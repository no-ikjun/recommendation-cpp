 Ancient rock paintings , rock shelters , paleolithic stone tools ( hundreds of thousands of years old ) , and megaliths provide evidence that the mountains of the region have been inhabited since prehistoric times . There are also archaeological remains which show the existence of early Vedic ( c . 1500 BCE ) practices in the area . The <unk> , <unk> , Kunindas , Guptas , Gurjara @-@ Pratihara , <unk> , <unk> , Palas , <unk> , Parmars or <unk> , Sikhs , and the British have ruled Uttarakhand in turns . The region was originally settled by Kol people , an aboriginal people of the Austro @-@ Asiatic physical type who were later joined by the Indo @-@ Aryan <unk> tribe that arrived from the northwest by the Vedic period ( 1700 – 1100 BCE ) . At that time , present @-@ day Uttarakhand also served as a habitat for <unk> and Sadhus . It is believed that the sage Vyasa scripted the Hindu epic Mahabharata in the state . Among the first major dynasties of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism and traded salt with Western Tibet . It is evident from the Ashokan edict at <unk> in Western Garhwal that Buddhism made inroads in this region . Folk shamanic practices deviating from Hindu orthodoxy also persisted here . However , Garhwal and Kumaon were restored to nominal Hindu rule due to the travails of Shankaracharya and the arrival of migrants from the plains . Between the 4th and 14th centuries , the <unk> dynasty dominated lands of varying extent from the <unk> ( modern day Baijnath ) valley in Kumaon . The historically significant temples at <unk> are believed to have been built by the <unk> and later remodelled by the <unk> . Other peoples of the Tibeto @-@ Burman group known as Kirata are thought to have settled in the northern highlands as well as in pockets throughout the region , and are believed to be ancestors of the modern day <unk> , Raji , <unk> , and <unk> people . 
 By the medieval period , the region was consolidated under the Garhwal Kingdom in the west and the Kumaon Kingdom in the east . During this period , learning and new forms of painting ( the Pahari school of art ) developed . Modern @-@ day Garhwal was likewise unified under the rule of Parmars who , along with many Brahmins and Rajputs , also arrived from the plains . , the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom . The Garhwal Kingdom was re @-@ established from a smaller region in Tehri , as the larger portion of Tehri , along with eastern Garhwal and Kumaon ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli . 
 After India attained independence from the British , the Garhwal Kingdom was merged into the state of Uttar Pradesh , where Uttarakhand composed the Garhwal and Kumaon Divisions . Until 1998 , Uttarakhand was the name most commonly used to refer to the region , as various political groups , including the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal ( Uttarakhand Revolutionary Party ) , began agitating for separate statehood under its banner . Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography , economy , culture , language , and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions . These bonds formed the basis of the new political identity of Uttarakhand , which gained significant momentum in 1994 , when demand for separate statehood achieved almost unanimous acceptance among both the local populace and national political parties . The most notable incident during this period was the Rampur <unk> firing case on the night of 1 October 1994 , which led to a public uproar . On 24 September 1998 , the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly and Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council passed the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Bill , which began the process of creating a new state . Two years later the Parliament of India passed the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act , 2000 and thus , on 9 November 2000 , Uttarakhand became the 27th state of the Republic of India . 
 Uttarakhand is also well known for the mass agitation of the 1990s that led to the formation of the Chipko environmental movement and other social movements . Though primarily a livelihood movement rather than a forest conservation movement , it went on to become a rallying point for many future environmentalists , environmental protests , and movements the world over and created a precedent for non @-@ violent protest . It stirred up the existing civil society in India , which began to address the issues of tribal and marginalized people . So much so that , a quarter of a century later , India Today mentioned the people behind the " forest satyagraha " of the Chipko movement as amongst " 100 people who shaped India " . One of Chipko 's most salient features was the mass participation of female villagers . Both female and male activists played pivotal roles in the movement . <unk> Devi was the main activist who started this movement other participants were Chandi Prasad Bhatt , <unk> <unk> , and Ghanshyam <unk> , the popular Chipko poet . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Uttarakhand has a total area of 53 @,@ 483 km2 , of which 86 % is mountainous and 65 % is covered by forest . Most of the northern part of the state is covered by high Himalayan peaks and glaciers . In the first half of the nineteenth century , the expanding development of Indian roads , railways and other physical infrastructure was giving rise to concerns over indiscriminate logging , particularly in the Himalaya . Two of the most important rivers in Hinduism originate in the region , the Ganges at Gangotri and the Yamuna at Yamunotri . These two along with Badrinath and Kedarnath form the Chota Char Dham , a holy pilgrimage for the Hindus . The state hosts the Bengal tiger in Jim Corbett National Park , the oldest national park of the Indian subcontinent . The Valley of Flowers , a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the upper expanses of <unk> Ganga near <unk> in <unk> region , is known for the variety and rarity of its flowers and plants . One who raised this was Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker , Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , who visited the region . As a consequence , Lord Dalhousie issued the Indian Forest Charter in 1855 , reversing the previous laissez @-@ faire policy . The following Indian Forest Act of 1878 put Indian forestry on a solid scientific basis . A direct consequence was the founding of the Imperial Forest School at Dehradun by Dietrich <unk> in 1878 . Renamed the ' Imperial Forest Research Institute ' in 1906 , it is now known as the Forest Research Institute ( India ) . The model “ Forest Circles ” around Dehradun , used for training , demonstration and scientific measurements , had a lasting positive influence on the forests and ecology of the region . The Himalayan ecosystem provides habitat for many animals ( including bharal , snow leopards , leopards and tigers ) , plants , and rare herbs . Two of India 's largest rivers , the Ganges and the Yamuna , originate in the glaciers of Uttarakhand , where they are fed by myriad lakes , glacial melts and streams . 
 Uttarakhand lies on the southern slope of the Himalaya range , and the climate and vegetation vary greatly with elevation , from glaciers at the highest elevations to subtropical forests at the lower elevations . The highest elevations are covered by ice and bare rock . Below them , between 3 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 and 16 @,@ 400 ft ) are the western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows . The temperate western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests grow just below the tree line . At 3 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 600 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 to 8 @,@ 500 ft ) elevation they transition to the temperate western Himalayan broadleaf forests , which lie in a belt from 2 @,@ 600 to 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 8 @,@ 500 to 4 @,@ 900 ft ) elevation . Below 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) elevation lie the Himalayan subtropical pine forests . The Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests and the drier Terai @-@ Duar savanna and grasslands cover the lowlands along the Uttar Pradesh border in a belt locally known as <unk> . These lowland forests have mostly been cleared for agriculture , but a few pockets remain . 
 In June 2013 several days of extremely heavy rain caused devastating floods in the region , resulting in more than 5000 people missing and presumed dead . The flooding was referred to in the Indian media as a " Himalayan Tsunami " .

 Uttarakhand has a multiethnic population spread across two geocultural regions : the <unk> , and the Kumaon . A large portion of the population is Rajput ( various clans of erstwhile landowning rulers and their descendants ) , including members of the native Garhwali , Kumaoni and Gujjar communities , as well as a number of immigrants . According to a 2007 study by Centre for the Study of Developing Societies , Uttarakhand has the highest percentage of Brahmins of any state in India , with approximately 20 % of the population being Brahmin . Approximately one @-@ fifth of the population belongs to the Scheduled Castes ( an official term for the lower castes in the traditional Hindu caste system ) . Scheduled Tribes ( an official term for natives outside the Indian social system ) , such as the Raji , who live near the border with Nepal , constitute less than 3 percent of the population . More than four @-@ fifths of Uttarakhand ’ s residents are Hindus . Muslims , Sikhs , Christians , Buddhists , and Jains make up the remaining population with the Muslims being the largest minority . 
 The Garhwali and Kumaoni , dialects of Central Pahari are spoken in Kumaon and Garhwal regions , respectively . <unk> and <unk> languages are spoken by tribal communities in the west and north , respectively . The urban population , however , converses mostly in Hindi , which is an official language of the state . Uttarakhand is the only Indian state to give official language status to Sanskrit . 
 = = Government and politics = = 
 Following the Constitution of India , the State of Uttarakhand , like all Indian states , has a parliamentary system of representative democracy for its government . 
 The Governor is the constitutional and formal head of the government and is appointed for a five @-@ year term by the President of India on the advice of the Union government . The present Governor of the state is Krishan Kant Paul . The Chief Minister , who holds the real executive powers , is the head of the party or coalition garnering the majority in the state elections . The current Chief Minister of Uttarakhand is Harish Rawat . The Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker that are elected by the members . Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker , or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker 's absence . A Council of Ministers is appointed by the Governor of Uttarakhand on the advice of the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and reports to the Legislative Assembly . Uttarakhand has a unicameral house with 71 Members of the Legislative Assembly or MLAs . Auxiliary authorities that govern at a local level are known as panchayats in rural areas , municipalities in urban areas and municipal corporation in metro areas . All state and local government offices have a five @-@ year term . The state also contributes 5 seats to Lok Sabha and 3 seats to Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament . The judiciary consists of the Uttarakhand High Court , located at Nainital , and a system of lower courts . The present Chief Justice of Uttarakhand is Justice K. M. Joseph . 
 Politics in Uttarakhand is dominated by the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party . Since the formation of the state these parties have ruled the state in turns . Following the hung mandate in the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly election , 2012 , the Indian National Congress , having the maximum number of seats , formed a coalition government headed by Harish Rawat that collapsed on 27 March 2016 , following the political turmoil as about nine MLAs of INC rebelled against the party and supported the opposition party BJP , causing Harish Rawat government to lose the majority in assembly . However , on 21 April 2016 the High Court of Uttarakhand quashed the President 's Rule questioning its legality and maintained a status quo prior to 27 March 2016 when 9 rebel MLAs of INC voted against the Harish Rawat government in assembly on state 's money appropriation bill . This has been seen as a big blow to central government which is expected to take the matter to the Supreme Court of India to challenge the verdict of High Court . On 22 April 2016 the Supreme Court of India stayed the order of High Court till 27 April 2016 , thereby once again reviving the President 's Rule . In later developments regarding this matter , the Supreme Court ordered a floor test to be held on 10 May with the rebels being barred from voting . On 11 May at the opening of sealed result of the floor test , under the supervision of Supreme Court , the Harish Rawat government was revived following the victory in floor test held in Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly .

Kennedy 's national goal of " landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth " by the end of the 1960s , which he proposed in an address to Congress on May 25 , 1961 . 
 Kennedy 's goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Lunar Module ( LM ) on July 20 , 1969 , and walked on the lunar surface , while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command / Service Module ( CSM ) , and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24 . Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon , the last in December 1972 . In these six spaceflights , twelve men walked on the Moon . 
 Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972 , with the first manned flight in 1968 . It achieved its goal of manned lunar landing , despite the major setback of a 1967 Apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test . After the first landing , sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow @-@ on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration . Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these . Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings , but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon , which damaged the CSM 's propulsion and life support . The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a " lifeboat " for these functions . It used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles , which were also used for an Apollo Applications Program , which consisted of Skylab , a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973 – 74 , and the Apollo – Soyuz Test Project , a joint Earth orbit mission with the Soviet Union in 1975 . 
 Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones . It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit . Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body , while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit . The program returned 842 pounds ( 382 kg ) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth , greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon 's composition and geological history . The program laid the foundation for NASA 's current human spaceflight capability , and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center . Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight , including avionics , telecommunications , and computers .

 The Apollo program was conceived during the Eisenhower administration in early 1960 , as a follow @-@ up to Project Mercury . While the Mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission , Apollo would carry three astronauts . Possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station , circumlunar flights , and eventual manned lunar landings . The program was named after the Greek god of light , music , and the sun by NASA manager Abe Silverstein , who later said that " I was naming the spacecraft like I 'd name my baby . " Silverstein chose the name at home one evening , early in 1960 , because he felt " Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program . "

 In July 1960 , NASA Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of Space Task Group conferences . Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command module ( piloting and re @-@ entry cabin ) , and a propulsion and equipment module . On August 30 , a feasibility study competition was announced , and on October 25 , three study contracts were awarded to General Dynamics / Convair , General Electric , and the Glenn L. Martin Company . Meanwhile , NASA performed its own in @-@ house spacecraft design studies led by Maxime Faget , to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs . 
 = = = Political pressure builds = = = 
 In November 1960 , John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense . Up to the election of 1960 , Kennedy had been speaking out against the " missile gap " that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower . Beyond military power , Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige , pledging to make the US not " first but , first and , first if , but first period . " Despite Kennedy 's rhetoric , he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president . He knew little about the technical details of the space program , and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing . When Kennedy 's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency , Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA 's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue . 
 On April 12 , 1961 , Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space , reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union . At a meeting of the US House Committee on Science and Astronautics one day after Gagarin 's flight , many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up . Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news , refusing to make a commitment on America 's response to the Soviets . 
 On April 20 , Kennedy sent a memo to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , asking Johnson to look into the status of America 's space program , and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up . Johnson responded approximately one week later , concluding that " we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership . " His memo concluded that a manned Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first . 
 On May 25 , 1961 , twenty days after the first US manned spaceflight Freedom 7 , Kennedy proposed the manned Moon landing in a Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs : 
 " Now it is time to take longer strides - time for a great new American enterprise - time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement , which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth . 
 ... I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth . No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind , or more important in the long @-@ range exploration of space ; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish .

 At the time of Kennedy 's proposal , only one American had flown in space — less than a month earlier — and NASA had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit . Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy 's ambitious goal could be met . By 1963 , Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US @-@ USSR Moon mission , to eliminate duplication of effort . 
 With the clear goal of a manned landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and cislunar flights , NASA had to hit the ground running , and decided to discard the feasibility study designs of Convair , GE , and Martin , and proceed with Faget 's command / service module design . The mission module was determined to be only useful as an extra room , and therefore deemed unnecessary . They used Faget 's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961 . On November 28 , 1961 , it was announced that North American Aviation had won the contract , although its bid was not rated as good as Martin 's . Webb , Dryden and Robert Seamans chose it in preference due to North American 's longer association with NACA . 
 Landing men on the Moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity , and the largest commitment of resources ( $ 24 billion ) ever made by any nation in peacetime . At its peak , the Apollo program employed 400 @,@ 000 people and required the support of over 20 @,@ 000 industrial firms and universities . 
 On July 1 , 1960 , NASA established of the Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) in Huntsville , Alabama . MSFC designed the heavy lift @-@ class Saturn launch vehicles , which would be required for Apollo . 
 = = = Manned Spacecraft Center = = = 
 It became clear that managing the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth 's Space Task Group , which had been directing the nation 's manned space program from NASA 's Langley Research Center . So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center , the Manned Spacecraft Center ( MSC ) . A site was chosen in Houston , Texas , on land donated by Rice University , and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19 , 1961 . It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida , so a new Mission Control Center would be included in the MSC . 
 In September 1962 , by which time two Project Mercury astronauts had orbited the Earth , Gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in Houston , and construction of the MSC facility was under way , Kennedy visited Rice to reiterate his challenge in a famous speech : 
 " But why , some say , the Moon ? Why choose this as our goal ? And they may well ask , why climb the highest mountain ? Why , 35 years ago , fly the Atlantic ? ... 
 We choose to go to the Moon . We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things , not because they are easy , but because they are hard ; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills ; because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept , one we are unwilling to postpone , and one we intend to win ... .

 The MSC was completed in September 1963 . It was renamed by the US Congress in honor of Lyndon Johnson soon after his death in 1973 . 
 = = = Launch Operations Center = = = 
 It also became clear that Apollo would outgrow the Canaveral launch facilities in Florida . The two newest launch complexes were already being built for the Saturn I and IB rockets at the northernmost end : LC @-@ 34 and LC @-@ 37 . But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission , so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center ( LOC ) immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island . The design , development and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H. Debus , a member of Dr. Wernher von Braun 's original V @-@ 2 rocket engineering team . Debus was named the LOC 's first Director . Construction began in November 1962 . Upon Kennedy 's death , President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29 , 1963 , to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy . 
 The LOC included Launch Complex 39 , a Launch Control Center , and a 130 million cubic foot ( 3 @.@ 7 million cubic meter ) Vertical Assembly Building ( VAB ) in which the space vehicle ( launch vehicle and spacecraft ) would be assembled on a Mobile Launcher Platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads . Although at least three pads were planned , only two , designated A and B , were completed in October 1965 . The LOC also included an Operations and Checkout Building ( <unk> ) to which Gemini and Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles . The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250 @,@ 000 feet ( 76 km ) , which is nearly a vacuum . 
 = = = Organization = = = 
 Administrator Webb realized that in order to keep Apollo costs under control , he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization , so he recruited Dr. George E. Mueller for a high management job . Mueller accepted , on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo . Webb then worked with Associate Administrator ( later Deputy Administrator ) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight ( OMSF ) . On July 23 , 1963 , Webb announced Mueller 's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight , to replace then Associate Administrator D. Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1 . Under Webb 's reorganization , the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center ( Gilruth ) Marshall Space Flight Center ( von Braun ) and the Launch Operations Center ( Debus ) effectively reported to Mueller . 
 Based on his industry experience on Air Force missile projects , Mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high @-@ ranking officers in the United States Air Force , so he got Webb 's permission to recruit General Samuel C. Phillips , who gained a reputation for his effective management of the Minuteman program , as OMSF program controller . Phillips ' superior officer Bernard A. Schriever agreed to loan Phillips to NASA , along with a staff of officers under him , on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director . Mueller agreed , and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964 , until it achieved the first manned landing in July 1969 , after which he returned to Air Force duty . 
 = = Choosing a mission mode = = 
 Once Kennedy had defined a goal , the Apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life , cost , and demands on technology and astronaut skill . Four possible mission modes were considered : 
 Direct Ascent : The spacecraft would be launched as a unit and travel directly to the Moon and land . It would return , leaving its landing stage on the Moon . This design would have required development of the extremely powerful Nova launch vehicle . 
 Earth Orbit Rendezvous ( EOR ) : Multiple rocket launches ( up to 15 in some plans ) would carry parts of a Direct Ascent spacecraft and propulsion units for translunar injection ( TLI ) . These would be assembled into a single spacecraft in Earth orbit . 
 Lunar Orbit Rendezvous ( LOR ) : A single Saturn V could launch a spacecraft that was composed of a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon , while a smaller , two @-@ stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface , return to dock with the mother ship , and then be discarded . Landing only a small part of the spacecraft on the Moon and returning an even smaller part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the Earth . 
 Lunar Surface Rendezvous : Two spacecraft would be launched in succession . The first , an automated vehicle carrying propellant for the return to Earth , would land on the Moon , to be followed some time later by the manned vehicle . Propellant would have to be transferred from the automated vehicle to the manned vehicle . 
 In early 1961 , direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at NASA . Many engineers feared that a rendezvous — let alone a docking — neither of which had been attempted even in Earth orbit , would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit . Dissenters including John Houbolt at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach . Throughout 1960 and 1961 , Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option . Bypassing the NASA hierarchy , he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans ; while acknowledging that he spoke " somewhat as a voice in the wilderness , " Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question . 
 Seamans ' establishment of an ad @-@ hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961 , to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the Apollo program , represented a turning point in NASA 's mission mode decision . This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice , and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR @-@ LOR mode . Its consideration of LOR — as well as Houbolt 's ceaseless work — played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach . In late 1961 and early 1962 , members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR , including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight , Joseph Shea , who became a champion of LOR . The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) , which had much to lose from the decision , took longer to become convinced of its merits , but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7 , 1962 . 
 But even after NASA reached internal agreement , it was far from smooth sailing . Kennedy 's science advisor Jerome Wiesner , who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to Kennedy before the President took office , and had opposed the decision to land men on the Moon , hired Golovin , who had left NASA , to chair his own " Space Vehicle Panel " , ostensibly to monitor , but actually to second @-@ guess NASA 's decisions on the Saturn V launch vehicle and LOR by forcing Shea , Seamans , and even Webb to defend themselves , delaying its formal announcement to the press on July 11 , 1962 , and forcing Webb to still hedge the decision as " tentative " . 
 Wiesner kept up the pressure , even making the disagreement public during a two @-@ day September visit by the President to Marshall Space Flight Center . Wiesner blurted out " No , that 's no good " in front of the press , during a presentation by von Braun . Webb jumped in and defended von Braun , until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was " still subject to final review " . Webb held firm , and issued a request for proposal to candidate Lunar Excursion Module ( LEM ) contractors . Wiesner finally relented , unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy 's office , because of the President 's involvement with the October Cuban missile crisis , and fear of Kennedy 's support for Webb . NASA announced the selection of Grumman as the LEM contractor in November 1962 . 
 Space historian James Hansen concludes that : 
 Without NASA 's adoption of this stubbornly held minority opinion in 1962 , the United States may still have reached the Moon , but almost certainly it would not have been accomplished by the end of the 1960s , President Kennedy 's target date . 
 The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a " lifeboat " in the event of a failure of the command ship . Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen . A 1964 MSC study concluded , " The LM [ as lifeboat ] ... was finally dropped , because no single reasonable CSM failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the SPS . " Ironically , just such a failure happened on Apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the CSM without electrical power . The Lunar Module provided propulsion , electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely . 
 = = Spacecraft = = 
 Faget 's preliminary Apollo design employed a cone @-@ shaped command module , supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power , sized appropriately for the space station , cislunar , and lunar landing missions . Once Kennedy 's Moon landing goal became official , detailed design began of a Command / Service Module ( CSM ) in which the crew would spend the entire direct @-@ ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip , after being soft @-@ landed by a larger landing propulsion module . The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM 's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew , along with a new spacecraft , the Lunar Excursion Module ( LEM , later shortened to Lunar Module , LM ) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM . 
 = = = Command / Service Module = = = 
 The Command Module ( CM ) was the conical crew cabin , designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing . It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs . Its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield , and had its own reaction control system ( RCS ) engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path . Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown . The module was 11 @.@ 42 feet ( 3 @.@ 48 m ) tall , 12 @.@ 83 feet ( 3 @.@ 91 m ) in diameter , and weighed approximately 12 @,@ 250 pounds ( 5 @,@ 560 kg ) . 
 A cylindrical Service Module ( SM ) supported the Command Module , with a service propulsion engine and an RCS with propellants , and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants . A high @-@ gain S @-@ band antenna was used for long @-@ distance communications on the lunar flights . On the extended lunar missions , an orbital scientific instrument package was carried . The Service Module was discarded just before re @-@ entry . The module was 24 @.@ 6 feet ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) long and 12 @.@ 83 feet ( 3 @.@ 91 m ) in diameter . The initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51 @,@ 300 pounds ( 23 @,@ 300 kg ) fully fueled , while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54 @,@ 000 pounds ( 24 @,@ 000 kg ) . 
 North American Aviation won the contract to build the CSM , and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA . Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous , the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon , and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight . Also , there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module . A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing , while Block II , the actual lunar spacecraft , would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development . 
 = = = Lunar Module = = = 
 The Lunar Module ( LM ) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module . Not designed to fly through the Earth 's atmosphere or return to Earth , its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations , and was of an extremely lightweight construction . It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages , each with its own engine . The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant , surface stay consumables , and surface exploration equipment . The ascent stage contained the crew cabin , ascent propellant , and a reaction control system . The initial LM model weighed approximately 33 @,@ 300 pounds ( 15 @,@ 100 kg ) , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours . An Extended Lunar Module weighed over 36 @,@ 200 pounds ( 16 @,@ 400 kg ) , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days . The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation , and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly . 
 = = Launch vehicles = = 
 Before the Apollo program began , Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles , the Saturn series , and the even larger Nova series . In the midst of these plans , von Braun was transferred from the Army to NASA , and made Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center . The initial direct ascent plan to send the three @-@ man Apollo Command / Service Module directly to the lunar surface , on top of a large descent rocket stage , would require a Nova @-@ class launcher , with a lunar payload capability of over 180 @,@ 000 pounds ( 82 @,@ 000 kg ) . The June 11 , 1962 , decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the Saturn V to replace the Nova , and the MSFC proceeded to develop the Saturn rocket family for Apollo . 
 = = = Little Joe II = = = 
 Since Apollo , like Mercury , would require a launch escape system ( LES ) in case of a launch failure , a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system . A size bigger than the NAA Little Joe would be required , so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics / Convair . After an August 1963 qualification test flight , four LES test flights ( A @-@ 001 through 004 ) were made at the White Sands Missile Range between May 1964 and January 1966 . 
 = = = Saturn I = = = 
 Since Apollo , like Mercury , used more than one launch vehicle for space missions , NASA used spacecraft @-@ launch vehicle combination series numbers : AS @-@ 10x for Saturn I , AS @-@ 20x for Saturn IB , and AS @-@ <unk> for Saturn V ( compare Mercury @-@ Redstone 3 , Mercury @-@ Atlas 6 ) to designate and plan all missions , rather than numbering them sequentially as in Project Gemini . This was changed by the time manned flights began . 
 Saturn I , the first US heavy lift launch vehicle , was initially planned to launch partially equipped CSMs in low Earth orbit tests . The S @-@ I first stage burned RP @-@ 1 with liquid oxygen ( LOX ) oxidizer in eight clustered <unk> H @-@ 1 engines , to produce 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 6 @,@ 670 kN ) of thrust . The S @-@ IV second stage used six liquid hydrogen @-@ fueled Pratt & Whitney RL @-@ 10 engines with 90 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 400 kN ) of thrust . A planned Centaur ( S @-@ V ) third stage with two RL @-@ 10 engines , never flew on Saturn I. 
 The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC @-@ 34 , with only live first stages , carrying dummy upper stages filled with water . The first flight with a live S @-@ IV was launched from LC @-@ 37 . This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs ( designated AS @-@ 101 through AS @-@ 105 ) into orbit in 1964 and 1965 . The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying Pegasus satellites , which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts . 
 In September 1962 , NASA planned to launch four manned CSM flights on the Saturn I from late 1965 through 1966 , concurrent with Project Gemini . The 22 @,@ 500 @-@ pound ( 10 @,@ 200 kg ) payload capacity would have severely limited the systems which could be included , so the decision was made in October 1963 to use the uprated Saturn IB for all manned Earth orbital flights . 
 = = = Saturn IB = = = 
 The Saturn IB was an upgraded version of the Saturn I. The S @-@ IB first stage increased the thrust to 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 7 @,@ 120 kN ) by uprating the H @-@ 1 engine . The second stage replaced the S @-@ IV with the S @-@ IVB @-@ 200 , powered by a single J @-@ 2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with LOX , to produce 200 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 890 kN ) of thrust . A restartable version of the S @-@ IVB was used as the third stage of the Saturn V. The Saturn IB could send over 40 @,@ 000 pounds ( 18 @,@ 100 kg ) into low Earth orbit , sufficient for a partially fueled CSM or the LM . Saturn IB launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS @-@ 200 series number , " AS " indicating " Apollo Saturn " and the " 2 " indicating the second member of the Saturn rocket family . 
 = = = Saturn V = = = 
 Saturn V launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS @-@ 500 series number , " AS " indicating " Apollo Saturn " and the " 5 " indicating Saturn V. The three @-@ stage Saturn V was designed to send a fully fueled CSM and LM to the Moon . It was 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) in diameter and stood 363 feet ( 110 @.@ 6 m ) tall with its 96 @,@ 800 @-@ pound ( 43 @,@ 900 kg ) lunar payload . Its capability grew to 103 @,@ 600 pounds ( 47 @,@ 000 kg ) for the later advanced lunar landings . The S @-@ IC first stage burned RP @-@ 1 / LOX for a rated thrust of 7 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 33 @,@ 400 kN ) , which was upgraded to 7 @,@ 610 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 33 @,@ 900 kN ) . The second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen , and the third stage was a modified version of the S @-@ IVB , with thrust increased to 230 @,@ 000 pounds @-@ force ( 1 @,@ 020 kN ) and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit . 
 = = Astronauts = = 
 NASA 's Director of Flight Crew Operations during the Apollo program was Donald K. " Deke " Slayton , one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to a heart murmur . Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments . 
 Thirty @-@ two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the Apollo program . Twenty @-@ four of these left Earth ’ s orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 ( three of them twice ) . Half of the 24 walked on its surface , though none of them returned to the Moon after landing once . One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist . Of the 32 , Gus Grissom , Edward H. White , and Roger Chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for their Apollo 1 mission . 
 The Apollo astronauts were chosen from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans , plus from two later astronaut groups . All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans . Crews on all development flights ( except the Earth orbit CSM development flights ) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 , included at least two ( sometimes three ) Gemini veterans . Dr. Harrison Schmitt , a geologist , was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space , and landed on the Moon on the last mission , Apollo 17 . Schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the Apollo landing crews . 
 NASA awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor , the Distinguished Service Medal , given for " distinguished service , ability , or courage " , and personal " contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission " . The medals were awarded posthumously to Grissom , White , and Chaffee in 1969 , then to the crews of all missions from Apollo 8 onward . The crew that flew the first Earth orbital test mission Apollo 7 , Walter M. Schirra , Donn Eisele , and Walter Cunningham , were awarded the lesser NASA Exceptional Service Medal , because of discipline problems with the Flight Director 's orders during their flight . The NASA Administrator in October , 2008 , decided to award them the Distinguished Service Medals , by this time posthumously to Schirra and Eisele .

 The nominal planned lunar landing mission proceeded as follows : 
 = = = Profile variations = = = 
 After Apollo 12 placed the second of several seismometers on the Moon , the S @-@ <unk> on subsequent missions were deliberately crashed on the Moon instead of being sent to solar orbit , as an active seismic experiment to induce vibrations in the Moon . 
 The first three lunar missions ( Apollo 8 , Apollo 10 , and Apollo 11 ) used a free return trajectory , keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit , which would allow a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion . Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change , which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI , and eliminated the free @-@ return option . 
 Starting with Apollo 13 , descent orbit insertion was to be performed using the Service Module engine instead of the LM engine , in order to allow a greater fuel reserve for landing . This was actually first done for the first time on Apollo 14 , since the Apollo 13 mission was aborted before landing . 
 On Apollo 12 and later missions , the jettisoned LM ascent stages were deliberately crashed on the Moon at known locations , as another active seismic experiment . The only exceptions to this were the Apollo 13 LM which burned up in the Earth 's atmosphere , and Apollo 16 , where a loss of attitude control after jettison prevented making a targeted impact .

 A third Saturn IB test , AS @-@ 203 launched from pad 37 , went into orbit to support design of the S @-@ IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V.

 Two manned orbital Block I CSM missions were planned : AS @-@ 204 and AS @-@ 205 . The Block I crew positions were titled Command Pilot , Senior Pilot , and Pilot .

 After an unmanned LM test flight AS @-@ 206 , a crew would fly the first Block II CSM and LM in a dual mission known as AS @-@ 207 / 208 , or AS @-@ 278 ( each spacecraft would be launched on a separate Saturn IB ) . The Block II crew positions were titled Commander ( CDR ) Command Module Pilot ( CMP ) and Lunar Module Pilot ( LMP ) . The astronauts would begin wearing a new Apollo <unk> spacesuit , designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity ( EVA ) . The traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear " fishbowl " type for greater visibility , and the lunar surface EVA suit would include a water @-@ cooled undergarment . 
 Deke Slayton , the grounded Mercury astronaut who became Director of Flight Crew Operations for the Gemini and Apollo programs , selected the first Apollo crew in January 1966 , with Grissom as Command Pilot , White as Senior Pilot , and rookie Donn F. Eisele as Pilot . But Eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the KC135 weightlessness training aircraft , and had to undergo surgery on January 27 . Slayton replaced him with Chaffee . NASA announced the final crew selection for AS @-@ 204 on March 21 , 1966 , with the backup crew consisting of Gemini veterans James McDivitt and David Scott , with rookie Russell L. " Rusty " Schweickart . Mercury / Gemini veteran Wally Schirra , Eisele , and rookie Walter Cunningham were announced on September 29 as the prime crew for AS @-@ 205 . 
 In December 1966 , the AS @-@ 205 mission was canceled , since the validation of the CSM would be accomplished on the 14 @-@ day first flight , and AS @-@ 205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft . Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission , now redesignated AS @-@ 205 / 208 or AS @-@ 258 , planned for August 1967 . McDivitt , Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS @-@ 258 crew , and Schirra , Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew . 
 = = = = Program delays = = = = 
 The spacecraft for the AS @-@ 202 and AS @-@ 204 missions were delivered by North American Aviation to the Kennedy Space Center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight ; these delays caused the launch of AS @-@ 202 to slip behind AS @-@ 203 , and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966 , concurrently with the last Gemini mission . Eventually the planned AS @-@ 204 flight date was pushed to February 21 , 1967 . 
 North American Aviation was prime contractor not only for the Apollo CSM , but for the Saturn V S @-@ II second stage as well , and delays in this stage pushed the first unmanned Saturn V flight AS @-@ 501 from late 1966 to November 1967 . ( The initial assembly of AS @-@ 501 had to use a dummy spacer spool in place of the stage . ) 
 The problems with North American were severe enough in late 1965 to cause Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller to appoint program director Samuel Phillips to head a " tiger team " to investigate North American 's problems and identify corrections . Phillips documented his findings in a December 19 letter to NAA president Lee Atwood , with a strongly worded letter by Mueller , and also gave a presentation of the results to Mueller and Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans . Meanwhile , Grumman was also encountering problems with the Lunar Module , eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967 , not long after the first manned CSM flights . 
 = = = = Disaster strikes = = = = 
 Grissom , White , and Chaffee decided to name their flight Apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight . They trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American , and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center . A " plugs @-@ out " test was planned for January , which would simulate a launch countdown on LC @-@ 34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad @-@ supplied to internal power . If successful , this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the February 21 launch , with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled . 
 The plugs @-@ out test began on the morning of January 27 , 1967 , and immediately was plagued with problems . First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits , which delayed the sealing of the hatch . Then , communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown . During this hold , an electrical fire began in the cabin , and spread quickly in the high pressure , 100 % oxygen atmosphere . Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst , allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew . The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened . 
 NASA immediately convened an accident review board , overseen by both houses of Congress . While the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex , the review board concluded that " deficiencies existed in Command Module design , workmanship and quality control . " At the insistence of NASA Administrator Webb , North American removed Harrison Storms as Command Module program manager . Webb also reassigned Apollo Spacecraft Program Office ( ASPO ) Manager Joseph Francis Shea , replacing him with George Low . 
 To remedy the causes of the fire , changes were made in the Block II spacecraft and operational procedures , the most important of which were use of a nitrogen / oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch , and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials . The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug @-@ type hatch cover with a quick @-@ release , outward opening door . NASA discontinued the manned Block I program , using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights . Crew members would also exclusively wear modified , fire @-@ resistant <unk> Block II space suits , and would be designated by the Block II titles , regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not . 
 = = = = Unmanned Saturn V and LM tests = = = = 
 On April 24 , 1967 , Mueller published an official Apollo mission numbering scheme , using sequential numbers for all flights , manned or unmanned . The sequence would start with Apollo 4 to cover the first three unmanned flights while retiring the Apollo 1 designation to honor the crew , per their widows ' wishes . 
 In September 1967 , Mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing . Each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed , and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary ; therefore letters were used instead of numbers . The A missions were unmanned Saturn V validation ; B was unmanned LM validation using the Saturn IB ; C was manned CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB ; D was the first manned CSM / LM flight ( this replaced AS @-@ 258 , using a single Saturn V launch ) ; E would be a higher Earth orbit CSM / LM flight ; F would be the first lunar mission , testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing ( a " dress rehearsal " ) ; and G would be the first manned landing . The list of types covered follow @-@ on lunar exploration to include H lunar landings , I for lunar orbital survey missions , and J for extended @-@ stay lunar landings . 
 The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on man @-@ rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 ( AS @-@ 501 ) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V , carrying a Block I CSM on November 9 , 1967 . The capability of the Command Module 's heat shield to survive a trans @-@ lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth @-@ orbital reentry speed . This was followed on April 4 , 1968 , by Apollo 6 ( AS @-@ 502 ) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast . The intent of this mission was to achieve trans @-@ lunar injection , followed closely by a simulated direct @-@ return abort , using the Service Module engine to achieve another high @-@ speed reentry . The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation , a problem caused by non @-@ steady engine combustion , which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages . Two S @-@ II engines shut down prematurely , but the remaining engines were able to compensate . The damage to the third stage engine was more severe , preventing it from restarting for trans @-@ lunar injection . Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4 . Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems , NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men , cancelling a third unmanned test . 
 Apollo 5 ( AS @-@ 204 ) was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit , launched from pad 37 on January 22 , 1968 , by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1 . The LM engines were successfully test @-@ fired and restarted , despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing . The ascent engine was fired in abort mode , known as a " fire @-@ in @-@ the @-@ hole " test , where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage . Although Grumman wanted a second unmanned test , George Low decided the next LM flight would be manned . 
 = = = Manned development missions = = = 
 Apollo 7 , launched from LC @-@ 34 on October 11 , 1968 , was the C mission , crewed by Schirra , Eisele and Cunningham . It was an 11 @-@ day Earth @-@ orbital flight which tested the CSM systems . 
 Apollo 8 was planned to be the D mission in December 1968 , crewed by McDivitt , Scott and Schweickart , launched on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs . In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time . Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth @-@ orbiting mission , ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead , deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969 , and eliminating the E mission . This would keep the program on track . The Soviet Union had sent animals around the Moon on September 15 , 1968 , aboard Zond 5 , and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts . The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7 . Gemini veterans Frank Borman and Jim Lovell , and rookie William Anders captured the world 's attention by making ten lunar orbits in 20 hours , transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve , and returning safely to Earth . 
 The following March , LM flight , rendezvous and docking were successfully demonstrated in Earth orbit on Apollo 9 , and Schweickart tested the full lunar EVA suit with its Portable Life Support System ( PLSS ) outside the LM . The F mission was successfully carried out on Apollo 10 in May 1969 by Gemini veterans Thomas P. Stafford , John Young and Eugene Cernan . Stafford and Cernan took the LM to within 50 @,@ 000 feet ( 15 km ) of the lunar surface . 
 The G mission was achieved on Apollo 11 in July 1969 by an all @-@ Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong , Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin . Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first landing at the Sea of Tranquility at 20 : 17 : 40 UTC on July 20 , 1969 . They spent a total of 21 hours , 36 minutes on the surface , and spent 2 hours , 31 minutes outside the spacecraft , walking on the surface , taking photographs , collecting material samples , and deploying automated scientific instruments , while continuously sending black @-@ and @-@ white television back to Earth . The astronauts returned safely on July 24 . 
 That 's one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . 
 = = = Production lunar landings = = = 
 In November 1969 , Gemini veteran Charles " Pete " Conrad and rookie Alan L. Bean made a precision landing on Apollo 12 within walking distance of the Surveyor 3 unmanned lunar probe , which had landed in April 1967 on the Ocean of Storms . The Command Module Pilot was Gemini veteran Richard F. Gordon , Jr . Conrad and Bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera , but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the Sun . They made two EVAs totaling 7 hours and 45 minutes . On one , they walked to the Surveyor , photographed it , and removed some parts which they returned to Earth . 
 The success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as Commander , with two rookies . Apollo 13 launched Lovell , Jack Swigert , and Fred Haise in April 1970 , headed for the Fra Mauro formation . But two days out , a liquid oxygen tank exploded , disabling the Service Module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a " life boat " to return to Earth . Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause , which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory , and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications . Apollo was grounded again , for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added . 
 The contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20 . NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites , with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions , along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list , allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface , and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days . These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle ( LRV ) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM . Also , the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV . 
 = = = = Mission cutbacks = = = = 
 About the time of the first landing in 1969 , it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre @-@ built on the ground , replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches ; this eliminated Apollo 20 . NASA 's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing , and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle . By 1971 , the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19 . The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island , Florida , George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville , Alabama , Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans , Louisiana , and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas . 
 The cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions . Apollo 15 had been planned to be the last of the H series missions , but since there would be only two subsequent missions left , it was changed to the first of three J missions . 
 Apollo 13 's Fra Mauro mission was reassigned to Apollo 14 , commanded in February 1971 by Mercury veteran Alan Shepard , with Stuart Roosa and Edgar Mitchell . This time the mission was successful . Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours and 31 minutes on the surface , and completed two EVAs totalling 9 hours 24 minutes , which was a record for the longest EVA by a lunar crew at the time . 
 In August 1971 , just after conclusion of the Apollo 15 mission , President Richard Nixon proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions , Apollo 16 and 17 . Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director Caspar Weinberger was opposed to this , and persuaded Nixon to keep the remaining missions .

 Apollo 15 was launched on July 26 , 1971 , with David Scott , Alfred Worden and James Irwin . Scott and Irwin landed on July 30 near Hadley <unk> , and spent just under 2 days , 19 hours on the surface . In over 18 hours of EVA , they collected about 77 kilograms ( 170 lb ) of lunar material . 
 Apollo 16 landed in the Descartes Highlands on April 20 , 1972 . The crew was commanded by John Young , with Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke . Young and Duke spent just under 3 days on the surface , with a total of over 20 hours EVA . 
 Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo program , landing in the Taurus @-@ Littrow region in December 1972 . Eugene Cernan commanded Ronald E. Evans and NASA 's first scientist @-@ astronaut , geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt . Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18 , but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing . Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over 3 days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA .

 = = Samples returned = = 
 The Apollo program returned over 838 pounds ( 380 kg ) of lunar rocks and soil to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston . Today , 75 % of the samples are stored at the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility built in 1979 . 
 The rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth , as measured by radiometric dating techniques . They range in age from about 3 @.@ 2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria , to about 4 @.@ 6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust . As such , they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the Solar System , that are largely absent on Earth . One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock , retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission . This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium @-@ rich feldspar mineral anorthite , and is believed to be representative of the highland crust . A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12 , which has no known terrestrial counterpart . KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten ( see lunar magma ocean ) . 
 Almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects . Many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters , which is never seen on Earth rocks , due to the thick atmosphere . Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events . Some of the returned samples are of impact melt ( materials melted near an impact crater . ) All samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events . 
 Analysis of composition of the lunar samples supports the giant impact hypothesis , that the Moon was created through impact of a large astronomical body with the Earth . 
 = = Costs = = 
 When President Kennedy first chartered the Moon landing program , a preliminary cost estimate of $ 7 billion was generated , but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess of what could not possibly be determined precisely , and James Webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to $ 20 billion before giving it to Vice President Johnson . 
 When Kennedy made his 1962 speech at Rice University , the annual space budget was $ 5 @.@ 4 billion , and he described this cost as 40 cents per person per week , " somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year " , but that the Moon program would soon raise this to " more than 50 cents a week for every man , woman and child in the United States " . 
 Webb 's estimate shocked many at the time ( including the President ) but ultimately proved to be reasonably accurate . In January 1969 , NASA prepared an itemized estimate of the run @-@ out cost of the Apollo program . The total came to $ 23 @.@ 9 billion , itemized as follows : 
 Apollo spacecraft : $ 7 @,@ 945 @.@ 0 million 
 Saturn I launch vehicles : $ 767 @.@ 1 million 
 Saturn IB launch vehicles : $ 1 @,@ 131 @.@ 2 million 
 Saturn V launch vehicles : $ 6 @,@ 871 @.@ 1 million 
 Launch vehicle engine development : $ 854 @.@ 2 million 
 Mission support : $ 1 @,@ 432 @.@ 3 million 
 Tracking and data acquisition : $ 664 @.@ 1 million 
 Ground facilities : $ 1 @,@ 830 @.@ 3 million 
 Operation of installations : $ 2 @,@ 420 @.@ 6 million 
 The final cost of Apollo was reported to Congress as $ 25 @.@ 4 billion in 1973 . It took up the majority of NASA 's budget while it was being developed . For example , in 1966 it accounted for about 60 percent of NASA 's total $ 5 @.@ 2 billion budget . A single Saturn V launch in 1969 cost up to $ 375 million , compared to the National Science Foundation 's fiscal year 1970 budget of $ 440 million . 
 In 2009 , NASA held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the Apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $ 170 billion . This included all research and development costs ; the procurement of 15 Saturn V rockets , 16 Command / Service Modules , 12 Lunar Modules , plus program support and management costs ; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading , and costs for flight operations . This was based on a Congressional Budget Office report , A Budgetary Analysis of NASA 's New Vision for Space , September 2004 . The Space Review estimated in 2010 the cost of Apollo from 1959 to 1973 as $ 20 @.@ 4 billion , or $ 109 billion in 2010 dollars . 
 = = Apollo Applications Program = = 
 Looking beyond the manned lunar landings , NASA investigated several post @-@ lunar applications for Apollo hardware . The Apollo Extension Series ( Apollo X , ) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit , using the space in the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter ( SLA ) to house a small orbital laboratory ( workshop ) . Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station . This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S @-@ IVB Saturn upper stage , and grew into the Apollo Applications Program ( AAP ) . The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount , which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack . The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S @-@ IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly @-@ by mission . 
 The S @-@ IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board . Dubbed Skylab , it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space , and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount . Skylab 's last crew departed the station on February 8 , 1974 , and the station itself re @-@ entered the atmosphere in 1979 . 
 The Apollo @-@ Soyuz Test Project also used Apollo hardware for the first joint nation space flight , paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs .

 In September 2007 , the X <unk> Foundation and Google announced the Google Lunar X Prize , to be awarded for a robotic lunar landing mission which transmits close @-@ up images of the Apollo Lunar Modules and other artificial objects on the surface . 
 In 2008 , Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency 's SELENE probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the Apollo 15 Lunar Module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface . In 2009 , NASA 's robotic Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , while orbiting 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) above the Moon , began photographing the remnants of the Apollo program left on the lunar surface , and photographed each site where manned Apollo flights landed . All of the U. S. flags left on the Moon during the Apollo missions were found to still be standing , with the exception of the one left during the Apollo 11 mission , which was blown over during that mission 's lift @-@ off from the lunar surface and return to the mission Command Module in lunar orbit ; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown . 
 In a November 16 , 2009 editorial , The New York Times opined : 
 [ T ] here 's something terribly wistful about these photographs of the Apollo landing sites . The detail is such that if Neil Armstrong were walking there now , we could make him out , make out his footsteps even , like the astronaut footpath clearly visible in the photos of the Apollo 14 site . Perhaps the wistfulness is caused by the sense of simple grandeur in those Apollo missions . Perhaps , too , it ’ s a reminder of the risk we all felt after the Eagle had landed – the possibility that it might be unable to lift off again and the astronauts would be stranded on the Moon . But it may also be that a photograph like this one is as close as we ’ re able to come to looking directly back into the human past ... 
 There the [ Apollo 11 ] lunar module sits , parked just where it landed 40 years ago , as if it still really were 40 years ago and all the time since merely imaginary .

 The Apollo program has been called the greatest technological achievement in human history . Apollo stimulated many areas of technology , leading to over 1 @,@ 800 spinoff products as of 2015 . The flight computer design used in both the Lunar and Command Modules was , along with the Polaris and Minuteman missile systems , the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits ( IC ) . By 1963 , Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States ' production of ICs . The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo 's much greater need for reliability . While the Navy and Air Force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles , the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high .

 The crew of Apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the Earth and the Moon back to Earth , and read from the creation story in the Book of Genesis , on Christmas Eve , 1968 . An estimated one @-@ quarter of the population of the world saw — either live or delayed — the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon , and an estimated one @-@ fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the Apollo 11 moonwalk . 
 The Apollo program also affected environmental activism in the 1970s due to photos taken by the astronauts . The most famous , taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts , is The Blue Marble . This image , which was released during a surge in environmentalism , became a symbol of the environmental movement , as a depiction of Earth 's frailty , vulnerability , and isolation amid the vast expanse of space . 
 According to The Economist , Apollo succeeded in accomplishing President Kennedy 's goal of taking on the Soviet Union in the Space Race , and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement , and thereby showcased the superiority of the capitalistic , free @-@ market system as represented by the US . The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal , the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast , centralized government bureaucracy . 
 There are those who , despite evidence to the contrary , deny that the moon landings took place . The Apollo moon landing hoax claims helped propel conspiracy theories into a quasi @-@ political narrative . 
 = = = Apollo 11 broadcast data restoration project = = = 
 As part of Apollo 11 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , NASA spearheaded an effort to digitally restore the existing videotapes of the mission 's live televised moonwalk . After an exhaustive three @-@ year search for missing tapes of the original video of the Apollo 11 moonwalk , NASA concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased . 
 We 're all saddened that they 're not there . We all wish we had 20 @-@ 20 hindsight . I don 't think anyone in the NASA organization did anything wrong , I think it slipped through the cracks , and nobody 's happy about it . 
 The Moon landing data was recorded by a special Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV . This resulted in lunar footage that had to be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes . During the following years , a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data . Stan Lebar , who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation , also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes . 
 So I don 't believe that the tapes exist today at all . It was a hard thing to accept . But there was just an overwhelming amount of evidence that led us to believe that they just don 't exist anymore . And you have to accept reality . 
 With a budget of $ 230 @,@ 000 , the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration . The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy . The images were from tapes in Australia , the CBS News archive , and kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center . The restored video , remaining in black and white , contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements .

 = History of Aston Villa F.C. ( 1961 – present ) = 
 The history of Aston Villa F.C. from 1961 to the current season covers the fluctuating fortunes of the club during the 1960s and 1970s , the European Cup victory in 1982 and the present day 's Premiership club . 
 The late 1960s was a turbulent time for the club and pressure from fans led to a change of ownership and management . The problems started when the club was relegated from the first tier of English football for the third time , under manager Dick Taylor in 1967 . Within two years , pressure from supporters had led to the resignation of the board of directors . The club was then relegated to the Third Division . In the 1971 – 72 season Aston Villa returned to the Second Division as champions with a record 70 points . In 1974 Ron Saunders was appointed manager and by 1975 he had led the club back into the First Division and into European competition . The club was back among the elite and it continued to have much success under Saunders and won the league in the 1980 – 81 season . Saunders ' resignation halfway through the 1981 – 82 season came as a surprise , with the club in the quarter @-@ final of the European Cup . He was replaced by his assistant manager Tony Barton who guided them to 1 – 0 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam . However , winning the cup marked a pinnacle and the club fell steadily down the League standings over the next five years and was relegated in 1987 . However , the club was promoted the following year and achieved second place in the Football League in 1989 . 
 Villa was one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992 , and finished runners @-@ up to Manchester United in the inaugural season . The 1990s was a decade of inconsistency ; the club had three different managers and league positions were unpredictable , despite winning two League Cups . They reached the FA Cup Final for the first time since 1957 in 2000 , but lost 1 – 0 to Chelsea in the last game to be played at the old Wembley Stadium . Once again Villa 's league position fluctuated under various managers and in the summer of 2006 , David O 'Leary left under acrimonious circumstances . Martin O 'Neill soon arrived and received a rapturous reception . After 23 years as chairman and largest shareholder , owning approximately 38 % of the club , Doug Ellis decided to sell his stake to Randy Lerner , the owner of the NFL franchise Cleveland Browns . The arrival of a new owner and manager marked the start of sweeping changes throughout the club , including a new crest , a new kit sponsor and new players in the summer of 2007 . After several years of narrowly avoiding the drop , Villa were relegated at the end of the 2015 – 16 season . 
 = = Instability = = 
 Winning the League Cup in 1961 was a pinnacle for the club . Although Villa finished seventh in 1961 – 62 , the following season saw the beginning of a decline in form that would see them finish in 15th place in 1963 and fourth from bottom in 1964 . The manager Joe Mercer parted company with the club in July 1964 because of these results and his declining health . His replacement , Dick Taylor , managed to avoid relegation in the 1964 – 65 season as Villa finished 16th after a poor start to the season . The following year Villa finished 16th once again . Following a 4 – 2 final day defeat by Everton the club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1966 – 67 season . Manager Dick Taylor was sacked and Tommy Cummings was appointed in his place . The decline was not solely the responsibility of the manager ; the club had an ageing five @-@ man board " who had failed to adapt to the new football reality . " The club had neither developed a scouting network nor an effective coaching structure . The board had also sold two of Villa 's best players , Phil <unk> and Tony Hateley . The fans ' calls for the board to resign became more and more pronounced when Villa finished 16th in the Second Division in 1968 . Events on the pitch came to a head in November 1968 , with Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two ; the board sacked Cummings . On 21 November 1968 the problems in the boardroom were highlighted when a board member , George Robinson , resigned . Following his resignation the board issued a statement : " [ The board ] would make available , by their resignation , such seats as new financial arrangements might require . " Aston Villa F.C was up for sale . After much speculation , control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews , who brought in local travel @-@ agent Doug Ellis as chairman of the new board that was convened on 16 December 1968 . Two days later Tommy Docherty was appointed as manager . 
 = = Rebuilding = = 
 Docherty rebuilt confidence in the team and Villa went on to win five consecutive games and retained a place in the Second Division . In the short time that Docherty had been at the club , attendances rose significantly from a low of just over 12 @,@ 000 against Charlton Athletic in December . In the summer of 1969 the first share issue since 1896 raised £ 200 @,@ 000 for the club , £ 140 @,@ 000 of which was spent on new players . In the following season , however , Villa took ten games to register a win . By Christmas 1969 , Villa were at the bottom of the Second Division and Docherty was sacked . His successor , Vic Crowe , was unable to prevent Aston Villa from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in its history in the 1969 – 70 season . Despite finishing fourth in the Third Division in the 1970 – 71 season , Villa reached the League Cup final after beating Manchester United in the semi @-@ final . They were defeated in the final by Tottenham Hotspur 2 – 0 . The 1971 – 72 season saw the club return to the Second Division as champions with a then divisional record 70 points . They were invited to take part in the 1972 FA Charity Shield but lost 1 – 0 to Manchester City . In the autumn of 1972 , there was a revolt in the boardroom and four of the five directors voted to oust Doug Ellis from the board . Within 43 days though , Ellis was reinstated as chairman after he received the support of the largest shareholder Pat Matthews , and the supporters at an EGM , who also voted to replace the existing directors . Their first season back in the Second Division in 1972 – 73 saw Villa narrowly miss out on a second successive promotion when they finished third . However , the following season Villa finished 14th and Ellis sacked Crowe , replacing him with Ron Saunders . 
 For the club 's centenary season of 1974 – 75 , Saunders brought in only two new players , Frank <unk> and Leighton Phillips . At the end of his first season in charge , Villa were back in the First Division after finishing second , and had won the 1975 League Cup final at Wembley Stadium . Villa beat Norwich City 1 – 0 with Ray Graydon scoring the winning goal . At the beginning of the 1975 – 76 season Doug Ellis resigned as chairman but remained on the board . Ellis left the club in a good position on the field . They were in the First Division and the UEFA Cup for the first time due to the League Cup win of 1975 . The club 's first season of European football was short @-@ lived though as they were beaten 5 – 1 by Antwerp in the first round . In the following season , Villa finished fourth in the League , and reached the quarter @-@ finals of the FA Cup . In the 1976 – 77 season , two years after their last League Cup win , they beat Everton 3 – 2 in the 1977 Final after a second replay . 
 = = League and European victories = = 
 In the 1977 – 78 season Villa reached the quarter @-@ final of the UEFA Cup where they went out 4 – 3 on aggregate against Barcelona . In the domestic league , however , they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team . As Saunders began restructuring his team in the summer of 1979 , there were more changes in the boardroom . Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed from the board . The resolution was not successful and as a result , Ellis resigned from the board . Meanwhile , Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa 's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances . Allan Evans , Ken McNaught and Kenny Swain were brought into the defence and Des Bremner was brought into the midfield to play alongside Dennis Mortimer and Gordon Cowans . Tony Morley and Gary Shaw were the new strike partnership . When Peter Withe was signed from Newcastle United in the summer of 1980 , Saunders had built a team that was to see much success in the next few years . 
 The first success was to come in the 1980 – 81 season when Villa won their first League Championship for 71 years , fighting off competition from Liverpool and Ipswich Town using only 14 playing staff in the whole season . The title was sealed on the final day of the season when they lost 2 @-@ 0 at Arsenal but still finished top as Ipswich Town , the only side still in contention for the title , lost to Middlesbrough . This triumph was popularly known as the " transistor championship " as Villa fans had turned up at the game listening to the progress of the Ipswich game on their transistor audio sets . 
 The next season Villa did not start well and they were in mid @-@ table at Christmas although the club was still in the European Cup . In the first round Villa beat <unk> 7 – 0 on aggregate . In the second round they scored twice at Dynamo Berlin to achieve a 2 – 2 draw , which saw them go through due to the away goals rule . These victories were in contrast to their poor performance in the league . By February 1982 , the club were lying 19th in the First Division and Saunders resigned . It was later disclosed that the then chairman , Ron Bendall , had offered him a revised , shorter term , contract , which he had refused to accept . Saunders ' assistant Tony Barton was promoted in his place . When Barton took over , although Villa were in a poor league position , they were in the quarter @-@ final of the European Cup . In the quarter @-@ finals , they beat Dynamo Kiev over two legs . Gordon Cowans is quoted as saying , " Once we got past Dynamo Kiev we began thinking we could go all the way . " In the semi @-@ final , they played Anderlecht over two legs , with Tony Morley scoring to secure Aston Villa 's place in the final . 
 = = European Champions and subsequent decline = = 
 On 26 May 1982 , just three months after being appointed manager , Barton guided Villa to a 1 – 0 victory over Bayern Munich in the European Cup final in Rotterdam . As of January 2008 , Villa remain one of only five English teams to have won the European Cup , along with Chelsea , Liverpool , Manchester United and Nottingham Forest . They were the underdogs in the final and were expected to lose . 
 The final was held in Feyenoord Stadium , Rotterdam , with an attendance of 39 @,@ 776 . Only nine minutes into the game , Villa lost their experienced goalkeeper Jimmy Rimmer to a shoulder injury . He was replaced by 23 @-@ year @-@ old reserve goalkeeper Nigel Spink , who had only played one match for the club in five years since joining from Chelmsford . Spink went on to make one of his best performances for the club against the highly experienced Bayern strikeforce , which included Karl @-@ Heinz Rummenigge . Other key players in this Villa side included Tony Morley , Gordon Cowans and Dennis Mortimer . 
 The win was not followed with more success and the team performed badly in the following seasons . At the AGM in October 1982 , it was revealed that the club were in £ 1 @.@ 6 million of debt , mainly due to escalating wages and building costs , including the construction of the North Stand . At the end of November Ron and Donald Bendall resigned from the board to be replaced by Doug Ellis , who bought Ron Bendall 's 42 % shareholding . In January 1983 , Villa beat Barcelona 3 – 1 on aggregate to win the 1982 UEFA Super Cup . Barton remained in charge for two seasons after the European Cup triumph , but was sacked at the end of the 1983 – 84 season despite Villa finishing tenth in the First Division and reaching the semi @-@ finals of the League Cup . Shrewsbury Town manager Graham Turner was brought in as his successor . Turner was unable to reverse the decline , and in 1986 Villa narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division . A lacklustre start to the following season saw Turner sacked halfway through September . Billy McNeill was hired in his place , but was unable to save Villa from relegation . They were relegated to the Second Division just five years after winning the European Cup . McNeill handed in his notice and moved to Celtic when the season ended . Chairman Ellis persuaded Watford manager Graham Taylor to take over the reins and set about rebuilding the team . 
 = = Taylor , Vengloš and Atkinson = = 
 Taylor 's first season at Villa ended with automatic promotion as Second Division runners @-@ up , being pipped to the title by Millwall . One player who contributed to that season 's success was the recently signed David Platt , a former Manchester United reserve who had signed from Crewe Alexandra for £ 200 @,@ 000 just after Taylor 's arrival . Before he left in 1991 , Platt scored 68 goals in his 155 appearances for the club . Villa avoided relegation on the last day of the 1988 – 89 season as other results favoured them . In the 1989 – 90 season they emerged as surprise contenders for the title , leading for three weeks in the latter stages of the season before finishing in second place , nine points behind Liverpool . Taylor departed for the England manager 's job and was succeeded by Slovak coach Jozef Vengloš , the first foreign manager in the First Division . 
 The 1990 – 91 season was Vengloš 's only season as manager of Aston Villa . Their second @-@ place finish the previous season earned them qualification for the UEFA Cup as one of the first English clubs to enter European competition after ban resulting from the Heysel Stadium disaster was lifted . They beat first round opponents Baník Ostrava over two legs , and won the first leg of the second round tie against Inter Milan . However , this lead was overturned by Inter in the return leg 3 – 0 , and Villa were eliminated . The defeat started a decline , and by the end of the season they were two places above the relegation zone . Vengloš stepped down and David Platt was sold to Italian side Bari for £ 5 million . Aston Villa 's new manager was Ron Atkinson , who had taken West Bromwich Albion to the quarter @-@ finals of the UEFA Cup and had won the League Cup with Sheffield Wednesday . In his first season in charge , 1991 – 92 , Villa finished in sixth place and thus became one of the founder members of the FA Premier League . 
 = = Villa in the Premiership = = 
 In his first 18 months in charge , Atkinson bought Earl Barrett , Dean Saunders , Andy Townsend , Dalian Atkinson , Kevin Richardson , Ray Houghton and Shaun Teale . They all helped the club to finish as runners @-@ up to Manchester United in the inaugural Premier League season of 1992 – 93 . The strike partnership of Saunders and Atkinson established itself as one of the most successful partnerships in the Premiership . On 27 March 1994 Villa won the League Cup final 3 – 1 , to secure a second successive UEFA Cup campaign , although their Premier League form dipped and they finished 10th . At the end of the 1993 – 94 season , they played their last game at a terraced Villa Park before it was converted over the summer to an all @-@ seater stadium to comply with the Taylor Report . In November 1994 , Atkinson was dismissed following a poor start to the season . 
 Leicester City 's manager Brian Little was forbidden to speak to Aston Villa by their board , after rumours began circulating that Ellis wanted to hire him . Although maintaining that he had not spoken to Ellis about the possibility of taking over at Villa , Little resigned from his post at Leicester even though he was contracted to the club until the end of the 1997 – 98 season . Three days after his resignation , Ellis hired him as the new Villa manager . Little kept Villa in the Premiership , and then reshaped the squad in the 1995 close @-@ season by selling most of the club 's older players and buying in several younger ones . Villa won the 1996 League Cup with a win over Leeds United , reached the FA Cup semi @-@ finals and finished fourth in the Premiership in the 1995 – 96 season . In February 1998 , with Villa standing 15th in the Premiership and speculation rife that he would be sacked , Little resigned , stating that , " There were certain things going on behind the scenes which were affecting my own managerial position . " Ellis came out with a statement directly challenging that it had anything to do with the management at Villa Park . Instead , he suggested it was due to a " variety of pressures " including abuse directed towards Little and his family by irate fans . 
 Ellis appointed John Gregory , a former Aston Villa coach , as Little 's successor . Gregory revitalised the team and Villa finished seventh in the Premiership and qualified for the UEFA Cup . Usually , only the top six teams qualified for European competition , but due to the progress of other teams in the top seven it was the first time that a seventh placed club had automatically qualified for the UEFA Cup . Despite the £ 12 @.@ 6 million sale of Dwight Yorke , a player who had scored 97 goals in 287 appearances for the club , to Manchester United in August 1998 , John Gregory had guided Aston Villa to the top of the Premiership by the middle of the 1998 – 99 season . Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 for the first time since 1957 , but lost 1 – 0 to Chelsea in the last final to be played at the old Wembley Stadium . The 2000 – 01 season saw Villa finish eighth in the Premiership , although they did eventually qualify for the UEFA Cup by winning the Intertoto Cup in the summer of 2001 . In November 2001 , Gregory accused Ellis of " living in a time @-@ warp " , but was forced to apologise a few days later after provoking an uproar . While Gregory remained in his job , the relationship between him and Ellis was strained . Gregory resigned on 24 January 2002 , with Villa occupying a familiar mid @-@ table position in the league . 
 In January 2002 , chairman Doug Ellis once again appointed Graham Taylor as manager . Villa finished the 2001 – 02 season in eighth place , which was similar to most of their other Premiership finishes . Taylor quit as manager for the second time after the end of the 2002 – 03 season . Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership , losing twice to arch rivals Birmingham City . David O 'Leary , who had taken Leeds United to the semi @-@ finals of the 2000 – 01 Champions League , was brought in as Taylor 's replacement . O 'Leary took the team to sixth in the table , with a 2 – 0 home defeat against Manchester United on the final day meaning that they narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place . In 2005 – 06 , Villa slowly fell down the table and finished in 16th place . The poor placing came despite O 'Leary having spent more than £ 13 million the previous summer on players such as Milan Baroš , Kevin Phillips and Wilfred <unk> . 
 Frustration within the club soon reared its head when , on 14 July 2006 , a group of Villa players criticised the chairman 's alleged parsimony and lack of ambition in an interview with a local newspaper . The club immediately dismissed the report as " ridiculous " , but it emerged over the following few days that a group of senior players had indeed instigated the move , possibly with O 'Leary 's backing . The following week , David O 'Leary left the club by mutual consent after three years as Aston Villa manager and his assistant Roy Aitken became caretaker manager . 
 = = Lerner era = = 
 At a press conference on 4 August 2006 , Doug Ellis introduced Martin O 'Neill as the new manager and O 'Neill said , 
 After several years of speculation and failed bids , the 23 @-@ year reign of Doug Ellis as chairman came to an end . Ellis , the largest shareholder with approximately 38 % , decided to sell his stake . For many years supporters groups had been urging Ellis to resign , though the actions including two " Ellis out " protests , and an " Ellis out " march marked an increase in intensity . The decision to leave the club was likely to have been prompted by Ellis ' ill @-@ health . Randy Lerner , the owner of the NFL franchise Cleveland Browns , was announced as the preferred bidder . On 25 August , it was announced that he had secured 59 @.@ 69 % of the club 's shares . By 26 September 2006 , Lerner had achieved a 90 % shareholding , and could complete his buy @-@ out of the rest of the shares . Lerner appointed several new people to the Board including General Charles C Krulak . Ellis was given an President Emeritus ( Life President ) role . 
 Aston Villa started the 2006 – 07 Premiership campaign well , with Olof Mellberg scoring the first competitive goal at Arsenal 's new Emirates Stadium . The January signings of John Carew , Ashley Young and Shaun Maloney bolstered the squad . Villa finished in 11th place in the league with 50 points , ending the season with an unbeaten run of nine league games . The last home game of the season , a 3 – 0 victory over Sheffield United , was used to mark the 25th anniversary of Villa winning the European Cup in 1982 . Before kick @-@ off , the 1982 winning team paraded the trophy in front of a full stadium . <unk> bearing the words " Proud History — Bright Future " were given out to all home team supporters attending the match . 
 2007 @-@ 08 saw Villa progress further , finishing sixth to qualify for the Intertoto Cup . A victory against Danish side Odense BK over two legs in the final , during the summer of 2008 , put Villa into European competition for the 2008 – 09 season , the first time in seven years . They reached the group stage of the UEFA Cup that season with relative ease , and played their first match against Dutch club Ajax at Villa Park , winning 2 – 1 . The first major final of the Lerner era was the 2010 Football League Cup Final ; Villa lost 2 – 1 to Manchester United at Wembley Stadium . Five days before the opening day of the 2010 – 11 season , O 'Neill resigned as manager with immediate effect . The reserve team coach , Kevin MacDonald , took over as caretaker manager for the opening games of the season . Randy Lerner returned to England from the United States to interview potential candidates for the post . On 8 September 2010 , the club announced that Gérard Houllier would become the manager of Aston Villa , the first managerial appointment of Lerner 's reign . On 20 April 2011 , Houllier was admitted to hospital suffering from chest pains . Further tests showed that Houllier had suffered from a recurrence of a heart problem . The last games of the season saw Houllier 's assistant , Gary McAllister , take over in a caretaker capacity . On 1 June 2011 , the club issued a statement that Houllier had left the club by mutual consent leaving the club looking for their fifth manager , including caretakers , of the year . Houllier was replaced by the former Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish on 17 June 2011 , despite numerous protests from fans against his appointment . McLeish 's appointment marked the first time in history that a manager had moved directly from Birmingham to Villa . 
 = = = Crisis ( 2012 – present ) = = = 
 McLeish 's contract was terminated at the end of the 2011 – 12 season after Villa finished in 16th place , only just above the relegation zone . On 2 July 2012 , Aston Villa confirmed the appointment of former Norwich City manager Paul Lambert as the replacement for McLeish . On 28 February 2012 , the club announced a financial loss of £ 53 @.@ 9 million . Lerner put the club up for sale on 12 May 2014 , with an estimated value of £ 200 million . With Lerner still on board , in the 2014 – 15 season Aston Villa scored just 12 goals in 25 league games , the lowest in Premier League history , and Lambert was sacked on 11 February 2015 . He was replaced by Tim Sherwood , who saved Villa from relegation in the 2014 – 15 season and took them to the 2015 FA Cup Final . 
 Despite saving them from relegation the previous season , Sherwood was sacked as manager on 15 October 2015 , after six consecutive league losses , with Kevin MacDonald taking the role of interim manager . On 2 November 2015 , Frenchman Rémi Garde agreed a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half year deal to become the manager , but he left on 29 March 2016 with the club rooted to the bottom of the table . The club was eventually relegated from the Premier League on 16 April .

 Director / writer Sooraj Barjatya devoted one year and nine months to the screenplay of Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! . He spent the first five months trying to write another Maine Pyar Kiya , but then started over after his father Rajkumar Barjatya suggested that he rework one of the family company Rajshri Productions earlier offerings . Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! then became a loose adaptation of their 1982 production Nadiya Ke Paar . Barjatya used musical numbers to avoid treating some situations in a cliche manner , which resulted in so many songs that there were complaints during initial screenings of the film concerning its length and number of songs . <unk> 's grandfather , company founder <unk> Barjatya loved the song " <unk> " so much that the film was nearly given that title . 
 Barjatya later told India Abroad , " My attempt in this movie has been to <unk> the cinema @-@ going public to the quintessential family life ... not to make people feel that they have come to see a movie , but make them feel as if they have come to visit a big joint family that is preparing for a wedding " . The story was constructed differently than what was popular at the time . There were no villains , violence , or battles between good and evil . From conception to finished product , the film took four years . Madhuri Dixit was paid a salary of ₹ 27 @,@ 540 @,@ 000 for playing the role of Nisha .

 Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! is credited as being a defining moment in Hindi cinema 's box office history , and the beginning of a revolution in the Indian film distribution system . When it was released , cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television , home video , and film piracy . The film was originally released in only a small number of theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities . Due to widespread demand for the film , many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film . Although ticket prices were raised , the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television . Also , the film 's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle @-@ class family patrons that they could return to the theatre . This film , in addition to the following year 's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge , contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40 % in just two years . 
 The film was so successful that it literally gave the term blockbuster new meaning in India . Box Office India said , " Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! [ ... ] took business for films released afterwards to another level . To put into perspective how business changed [ ... ] before Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! an all India share of 10 crore for a big film was regarded as blockbuster business but after Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! the blockbuster business figure went to 20 crore . " 
 Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! influenced many subsequent Hindi films . The film was also a trendsetter for glamorous family dramas and NRI @-@ related films , and started Bollywood 's " big @-@ fat @-@ wedding @-@ film " trend . In 1998 a theatre company in London , where the film had played for a year , staged a production based on the film titled Fourteen Songs , Two Weddings and a Funeral . Planet Bollywood has noted that no wedding is complete without some songs from this film , and it has been used as a script to design wedding plans . For years afterwards , women wanted to wear a purple sari like the one worn by Madhuri Dixit in the song " Didi Tera Devar Deewana " . 
 Filmmaker Karan Johar named it as the one film that changed his life . He said , " After seeing Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! I realized Indian cinema is about values , tradition , subtlety , romance . There is so much soul in it . [ ... ] I decided to go ahead and be a filmmaker only after watching this film . " Hum Aapke Hain Koun .. ! belongs to a small collection of films , including Kismet ( 1943 ) , Mother India ( 1957 ) , Mughal @-@ e @-@ Azam ( 1960 ) and Sholay ( 1975 ) , which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance .

 = Arab street = 
 The Arab street ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , ash @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> ) is an expression referring to the spectrum of public opinion in the Arab world , often as opposed or contrasted to the opinions of Arab governments . In some contexts it refers more specifically to the lower socioeconomic strata of Arab society . It is used primarily in the United States and Arab countries . 
 While it is sometimes assumed , particularly in the United States , to have been borrowed from Arabic political discourse , its evolution has followed a circular course from Arabic to English and then back . Lebanese newspapers began referring to just " the street " during the 1950s ; later in the decade reports in The New York Times used the term in English to explain Gamal Abdel Nasser 's broad appeal not just in his native Egypt but across the Arab world . Later commentators added the " Arab " and eventually dropped the scare quotes to create the current usage , which became widespread in American media during the First Palestinian Intifada in 1987 . Arab media began using it themselves a decade later . However , its usage still differs between the two languages . In the Western English @-@ language media , only Arab popular sentiment is referred to as the " street " ; Arabic commentators use the expression in the same sense to refer to not just public opinion in their countries but in the West as well . 
 Due to the many negative connotations attached to the use of " street " as a modifier , the use of the term in English has been criticized as fostering stereotypes of a population easily roused to violence . The " Arab street " thus alternately justifies the need for an authoritarian ruler , or constrains the potentially moderate actions of those rulers . In the wake of the Arab Spring early in the 2010s , the concept of the Arab street has been revisited and challenged . The revolutions that toppled governments have , to some , shown how deficient and outdated Western understandings of Arab public opinion , shaped by the concept of the " Arab street " , had been and have even led some to suggest it no longer be used . Others , including some Arabs , saw the uprisings as vindicating the importance of public opinion in their cultures and changing the popular concept of the street within them . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Attempts to directly define the Arab street have usually equated it with Arab public opinion . New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman , who once covered the Middle East and frequently writes about the region , called it " the broad mass of public opinion " there in 2002 , as distinct from extremist opinion , which he calls the " Arab basement " . As of 2013 , Collins English Dictionary defines " the Arab street " as an informal term for " public opinion in the Arab world . " 
 Nevertheless , even as the term came into wide use , there was disagreement about its exact meaning . In 2002 a U.S. State Department official , reporting on a meeting between President George W. Bush and the leaders of Japan and Pakistan , said that the latter , Pervez Musharraf , had referred to the " possibility of trouble in the Arab street , whatever that is " over the upcoming invasion of Iraq . This uncertainty has led to confusion over what the term represents . During the same period of time , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later recalled , Arab leaders urged him to make sure the operation went quickly as they " were worried about the ' Arab street ' erupting in anger at the West 's invasion of a Muslim country . I was skeptical of the idea that a monolithic Arab street existed ... but I did understand that popular discontent could cause them difficulties . " 
 According to a 2009 paper on the evolution and use of the term by professors Terry Regier and Muhammad Ali Khalidi , some of that confusion results from a frequent second <unk> encompassing the majority of Arab public opinion , they observe , another usage seems to associate it more specifically with " a presumed seething underclass within Arab society , one that is viewed primarily as a source of political trouble . " In a 1993 exploration of the Arab street 's existence , David Pollock of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy began by acknowledging these connotations : " The very name evokes images of mystery , mobs and mullahs ; it sounds vaguely subterranean , if not sinister ; and it is most often regarded in the West with a peculiar mixture of fascination , dismissal and fear . " In November 2001 , a front @-@ page story in The New York Times on the Arab street 's rising power in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. two months earlier began by evoking the term 's visual connotations and the corresponding power vested in it by fearful Western observers : " The Arab street : the well @-@ worn phrase evokes men clustered around dusty coffeehouse tables , discussing the events of the day with well @-@ earned cynicism between puffs on a hookah — yet suddenly able to turn into a mob , powerful enough to sweep away governments . " Ten years later , columnist Edwin Black wrote on the Fox News website , after protesters in Egypt began calling for longtime president Hosni Mubarak to step down , something that had previously been unthinkable , that the leader had fallen afoul of the Arab street , 
 ... a dusty , unimproved and irrepressible thoroughfare of fury whose frequent itinerary has been known and feared for generations in the Middle East ... Quite simply , the Arab Street refers to the unexpected potential for popular upheaval at any time in any Arab locale . With no democratic venues to express popular wrath , this wrath pours onto the street and acts out en masse against the established order . 
 = = = Arabic = = = 
 In Arabic , the word for street ( <unk> , ash @-@ <unk> ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning , the point of a weapon , and law or lawfulness and legitimacy in both the secular and religious sense . Among those words are sharia , the term for Islamic religious and moral law . <unk> itself can also be used to refer to a legislator or lawgiver , and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law . 
 According to Regier and Khalidi , Arabic commentators use the term much as it is used in the West , when they discuss public opinion in the Arab world . However , they also refer to the " streets " of other , non @-@ Arab countries in much the same way — " feelings of anger and shock are running very high in the American street [ after the September 11 attacks ] " , for example . And in contrast to the fear of political upheaval frequently implied by Western writers , their use of " the Arab street " often carries positive and respectful overtones , such as when Al @-@ <unk> praised " the great Egyptian street , which has always been the heart and conscience of the Arabs " in 1997 . Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah provided an example of both differences in usage when he praised " the Israeli street " for its reaction to the <unk> report on Israel 's conduct of the 2006 Lebanon War . 
 = = History = = 
 " Arab street " arises originally from Arabic usage , but only became widely recognized through English adaptation . 
 = = = English = = = 
 In English , the earliest use of the word " street " in reference to the political role of popular opinion Regier and Khalidi found was that cited in the Oxford English Dictionary 's ( OED ) entry on the word , where one of its definitions in the plural is " loosely as the realm of the common man , and esp. the source of popular political support . " Wyndham Lewis 's 1931 book Hitler , a defense of the German dictator that he later disowned , credited Hitler 's political success in part to his " mastery of the street " , which the OED reported as the earliest use of the word in that political sense . It did not enter widespread use at that time . 
 The earliest use of " street " in a political context that Regier and Khalidi could find was a 1950 editorial in the Lebanese newspaper An @-@ Nahar : 
 This poor street , or rather the poor sons of the street , or rather poor me and you , sons of the street ! ! ... The government pulls us to and fro ... and the opposition also pulls this way and that . All of them make grand claims on our behalf , on behalf of the street , on behalf of the children of the street ... By God , leave this street to its own problems , for it is dizzy , dizzy from the opium of politics and politicians , and the hashish of merchants and extortionists . Leave it , may God have mercy on you . 
 " The street , " they wrote , " is here conceived as an aggrieved everyman , manipulated and exploited by the political class , " a sense that later manifested itself in Western discourse . 
 This usage made its debut in the American media early in 1957 . Times correspondent Hanson Baldwin , in an article on the personalities in the Middle East in the wake of the previous year 's Suez Crisis , focused on Gamal Abdel Nasser , president and prime minister of Egypt . Baldwin credited Nasser 's success to " his appeal to ' the street ' , which carries great political power in the Arab world . " He also inaugurated the concept of the street as a source of political danger to established hierarchies , saying Nasser 's prestige was " probably at a new high with the Arab street mobs , by which Arab governments are so often made or broken . " Two years later , the title and subtitle of a Times Magazine article made explicitly clear that the Arab mob and the street were related : " Power of ' The Street ' in the Arab World ; Here is an analysis of that frightening phenomenon , the mob , and the role it plays in the contest between freedom and tyranny in the Mideast . " 
 Nasser himself , in speeches , often cited not the street but " al @-@ <unk> " ( <unk> ) as his political base . The Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic defines it as " the masses " , or " the people " ; in the singular it can mean " the public " or a crowd or throng of people . Another form of the same root is <unk> , the word for republic . 
 <unk> , rendered in English as " the masses " , carries Marxist overtones of class struggle . Northwestern University professor Joe Khalil , who studies the Arab media , explains that it can " refer to everything from the indoctrinated members of a political party to a group of enthusiasts at a pop performance . " Within a political context it most often denotes " several groups of people bound together by a common activity or ideology and easily recognizable within a larger population . " The term , like the Pan @-@ Arabism it was also associated with , gradually fell into disuse after Egypt was defeated by Israel both in the Suez Crisis and the Six @-@ Day War of 1967 . 
 " Street " was first grammatically modified by " Arab " in English in a 1970 article in The Review of Politics , a political science journal . The writer , Robert Sullivan , alluded to the role of " radio propaganda aimed at mobilizing the Arab ' street ' " during military conflicts . Seven years later , another journal article by Steve J. Rosen argued that Israel 's development of nuclear weapons would lead to " a revolution of declining expectations in the Arab ' street . ' " 
 Regier and Khalidi speculate that the use of scare quotes by both Rosen and Sullivan suggest that they are using a term not familiar to them , something they may have adapted from a foreign language . Since both of them were academics specializing in Middle Eastern studies , it could be presumed that they had at least a reading knowledge of Arabic and were familiar with the term 's use in Arabic media in the region , Regier and Khalidi argued . The two further speculated that Rosen , who often took strongly pro @-@ Israel positions and later became policy director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , may have also perhaps picked up the term from Israeli media and scholars , as the " street " terminology for popular opinion is also used sometimes in Hebrew . 
 An Israeli attorney 's 1987 comment to the Christian Science Monitor , that his country had never " tried to root out the PLO in the Arab street " was the first modern use in its present sense without the scare quotes . By the end of the decade it came into wide use in both American academic and popular media , as coverage of the First Palestinian Intifada dominated news from the region . This may have been the result of geopolitical shifts taking place at the same time . New York Times language columnist William Safire anonymously quoted a Middle East expert who told him that before the late 1980s the term " Arab masses " had been used instead . " With the eclipse of the Soviet Union , that phrase disappeared because [ it ] had too much of a Marxist – Soviet – Communist tilt to it . " In his 1992 paper on the Arab street as a political phenomenon , David Pollock uses " Arab masses " only once , and in quotes .

 The first use of the term " Arab street " in Arabic media occurred in 1997 . The two researchers were not certain whether it had seen any use prior to that year as the database they used only went as far back as 1995 . It has become quite common in Arabic media since then , suggesting , according to Regier and Khalidi , that a term created in English from a borrowed Arabic term has been " re @-@ imported " into Arabic . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 = = = Negative connotations = = = 
 While sometimes the American media used " Arab street " as to be interchangeable with " Arab public opinion , " suggesting rationality and calm , Regier and Khalidi found that most uses carried the connotations of incipient unrest . " We propose that a central association of the Arab street is indeed that of a volatile potential mob , dangerous to the established order of Arab states , and thus to any agreements Western powers may have with those states . " While users may not always have intended it that way , in many cases they did . 
 They identified three factors that gave rise to these connotations . First , other common English phrases such as " man in / on the street " , " street smart " and " the word on the street " suggest the street is associated with uneducated and possibly misinformed opinion . The street is further associated with illegality through terms like " street crime " and the " street value " of contraband such as illicit drugs . Both of these , Regier and Khalidi observe , help strengthen the sense that the Arab street 's opinions are uninfluenced and uncontrollable by any official source or body . 
 Lastly , terms like " street person " for one who is homeless and " streetwalker " for a prostitute link the street to desperate personal circumstances . Regier and Khalidi note that this has historical connections to the term " street Arab " , for a homeless child , now out of regular use but still encountered by readers of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes mysteries , where the titular character relied at times on a network of such individuals as informants . Edward Said , a Palestinian @-@ born professor of English literature at Columbia University who frequently spoke and wrote on behalf of his people 's cause , along with casting a critical eye on Western " orientalism " and how it affected perceptions of non @-@ Western cultures such as the Arab world , explicitly and critically drew the connection between the two terms , they note , quoting him as saying : 
 There 's a kind of unconscious identification between the word " street " in connection with the Arabs , and the late 19th and early 20th @-@ century usage of the term " street Arab " . Street Arabs are vagrants ... So I think referring to the " Arab street " in this way suggests that these are riff @-@ <unk> , the kind of unimportant flotsam and <unk> of a society which is basically made up of barbarians and subhuman people . I think it 's not an accident that this term is always used to talk about Arab public opinion . 
 Regier and Khalidi write that the view of the Arab street , and by extension all Arab public opinion , as that of a mob always poised to rise violently , does Western publics a disservice . Not only is it inaccurate , it confronts them with " something quite unlike Westerners ' conception of their own publics ... It has the potential to contribute to an ongoing misreading of the Arab public among U.S. readers . "

 In late 1990 after Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded and occupied Kuwait , ultimately leading to the Gulf War , American commentators and Middle East experts expressed concern about the possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments , many of whom ( particularly Egypt ) had joined the military coalition led by the United States . This did not happen when the actual war began , nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered . A year later , in 1992 , David Pollock of the United States Information Agency ( USIA ) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and , by extension , all Arab public opinion . 
 As applied , Pollock saw two predominant conceptualizations of the Arab street . One , he called the " underrated " school , which usually claimed that " in the absence of Arab democratic institutions public opinion in those countries is politically irrelevant . " Other members of that school went further , claiming that Arab public opinion was " unknowable , and therefore unfit for serious discussion . " A small minority considered the Arab street a concept bound with Pan @-@ Arabism , by then largely discredited , and by extension similarly irrelevant . 
 On the opposite side was what he called the " exaggerated " school , which saw the Arab elites as " already hopelessly alienated from the masses ... As a result , popular revolution ( or at least paralyzing instability ) is always around the corner in the Arab world . " Proponents argued that , for that reason , the U.S. should turn its attention towards those who might hold power in a more democratic Arab world ; otherwise , its relationships with Arab states will always be tenuous and unstable . 
 A key foundation of the " underrated " school 's argument , Pollock wrote , was the tendency of the media in most Arab countries to be under state control or influence to a greater degree than in the West and therefore filtering information to the public and not reporting public opinion accurately , an experience informed by contemporary events in Eastern Europe . However , even in Syria , a coalition country where the government had the greatest control over the media , citizens still listened to the BBC , Radio Monte Carlo and Israeli and Saudi radio stations . In other countries , particularly some in North Africa , the media was relatively unrestricted during the conflict . Those mystified by the quiet on the Arab street during the conflict , he said , " neglected ... the possibility that different Arab publics generally supported the different policies pursued by their own governments towards the crisis . " 
 In addition , it was also entirely possible that those governments had based their policies in part on public opinion . Arab governments , Pollock observed , were not indifferent to public opinion despite the absence of real democratic institutions . Officials in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states held regular informal <unk> ( <unk> ) and the Egyptian government took note of what was said at neighborhood discussion centers known as " listening posts . " Some also consulted opinion polls . It was data from those that led him to believe that Jordan and Yemen both stayed out of the coalition in part because their leaders were aware that popular sentiment in their countries was strongly against participating , and they might have faced destabilizing civil unrest if they had . 
 Pollock was especially scornful of those who viewed the Arab street as irrelevant because it was unknowable . " This assumption sounds at once pathetic and presumptuous , a sorry combination of self @-@ confessed intellectual ignorance and impotence ... For one thing , it should be self @-@ evident that you cannot dismiss the Arab street just because you don 't understand it . " As for the " exaggerated " school , he first observed that there was , in fact , little history of real popular revolutions deposing governments in the modern Middle East with what he called the " debatable " exception of the 1958 Lebanon crisis , and not even many more unsuccessful attempts to do so via street uprisings . So , he noted with some bemusement , " the beauty of this argument is that it is invulnerable to disproof — because its proof lies in the future , which of course always lies ahead . " 
 At the beginning of the next decade , the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks again made it likely that the U.S. would find itself fighting another war against a Muslim country , and again fears rose in the American media about the damage an angered Arab street could inflict on American interests in the region when actual combat began , especially with the Second Palestinian Intifada already underway . Another USIA employee , Nancy Snow , wrote about the problems created by the connotations of the term in 2011 , when she had become a professor at Syracuse University 's Newhouse School of Public Communications : 
 The term " Arab street " seemed to position a region of the world as particularly prone to mob rule ... I came to believe that part of the United States ' problem with the Arab region was that the language we used in talking about it was overly paternalistic and stereotypical — that is , racist . Millions of Americans would hear about the Arab street in the media and assume that it meant a place where terrorism flourished , danger lurked around every corner and religious and political fanaticism were the norm . The way it is often presented , the Arab street could not possibly produce people with a healthy attitude towards the United States . It underscores a bigoted view in the West that Arabs are incapable of self @-@ government because they lack sufficient logic to organize society out of so much chaos . 
 " In the narratives of the Western media , " <unk> <unk> wrote in 2011 , " the ' Arab street ' is damned if it does and damned if it doesn 't " , echoing a theme of Pollock 's critique . After fears of violence across the Arab world proved exaggerated following the beginning of the Afghan War , commentators dismissed the Arab street as apathetic and harmless , only to suddenly reclaim it as an object of fear when popular protests erupted all over the region in response to Israel 's 2002 invasion of the West Bank . He denounced the term as a colonialist and Orientalist creation , similar to an earlier term " the Arab mind " , which " <unk> the culture and collective conduct of an entire people in a violent abstraction . " 
 While Tunisian writer <unk> Sadiki agrees that the negative connotations of " Arab street " are harmful to public discourse about the region in the West , he puts some of the blame for its widespread use on Arabs themselves . " It is no exaggeration to say that ' public opinion ' has not had any presence to speak of in the Arabic political vocabulary , " he wrote in 2009 . It did not emerge into Arabic political discussion alongside the idea of universal suffrage when that became a goal of Arab activists in the early 20th century , he notes , and polling organizations did not consequently form as they did in the West . Thus the notion of the Arab street filled the void . The Arabic term for public opinion , <unk> <unk> ( ar @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> ) , is a direct translation of the English expression . " There is no other Arabic term that conveys an equivalent meaning . " 
 To make the distinction between mainstream and extremist Arab opinion clear , in 2002 Jordanian journalist Rami George Khouri suggested calling the latter the " Arab basement . " New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman picked it up , noting that the Arab street , in opposition to the " basement " , is " largely passive and nonviolent . " While the U.S. and the West had no choice but to defeat the basement , since it was beyond reason , he said it was not too late to work with Arab states to address the very real grievances that led from the street to the basement . " If America made clear that it was going into Iraq , " he wrote , " not just to disarm Iraq but to empower Iraq 's people to implement the Arab Human Development Report , well , the Arab basement still wouldn 't be with us , but the Arab street just might . "

 Beginning in 2011 , popular uprisings that came to be collectively known as the Arab Spring deposed dictatorships in Tunisia , Egypt and Yemen . Similar mass movements were put down in Bahrain and touched off the Syrian Civil War Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi was killed after a civil war . " Those accustomed to the region 's repressive status quo have been caught by surprise " , wrote two editors of an anthology of writings by younger Arabs . " Young Middle Easterners — typically viewed with trepidation as part of a reactionary ' Arab street ' or simply overlooked as masses passively acquiescing to despots — have shattered stereotypes by leading dignified struggles in the face of overwhelming repression . " 
 Western commentators , particularly after the protests in Egypt forced Hosni Mubarak to step down , reconsidered the concept of the Arab street and whether or not it had , indeed , ever been an accurate representation of public opinion in the region . " I 'm convinced the country has what it takes to build a decent , representative society — one that gives the lie to all the stereotypes associated with that dismissive shorthand ' The Arab Street . ' " Roger Cohen wrote from Cairo the day afterward in The New York Times . " In fact , post @-@ Tahrir , let 's retire that phrase . " " [ F ] <unk> to it , once and for all , " agreed Fouad Ajami shortly afterwards , noting that Arabs had never risen up in response to violence against Kurds or Shiites , particularly the 1978 disappearance of popular Shiite Imam Musa al @-@ Sadr , widely believed to have been ordered by Gaddafi . 
 Arab commentators agreed . " [ E ] vents in Egypt and elsewhere have exposed the myth of ' the Arab street ' as a shallow caricature of the complex reality behind the revolutionary movements now sweeping the Arab world , " wrote Hassan Malik , a Harvard graduate student . He noted that in both Tunisia and Egypt the protesters had been a diverse group in every way that had been motivated by a desire for political freedom , not the Islamic fundamentalism so often feared to be motivating the street in the West . " It is time for Washington and its allies to drop their fears of ' the Arab street ' and unequivocally and genuinely support the popular revolution in Egypt — or to get out of the way . " 
 On the English @-@ language website of the Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar , Syrian journalist Ula <unk> recalled how the uprisings had changed the meaning of the word " street " for his generation . Once , much as it had been in English , it had been " a space for thieves , drug addicts , prostitutes , beggars , and ' <unk> . ' " But now there was " a new understanding of the Arab ' street , ' " he wrote . " We are beginning to understand why the powers that be wanted us to believe all those lies about [ it ] . " He said it had now become " a place of righteousness and honor , beauty and justice ... the space where our youth came of age , as they rebelled against injustice , abuse , and humiliation . "

 " Band on the Run " is the title song of Paul McCartney and Wings ' 1973 album Band on the Run . The song was released as a single in 1974 , following the success of " Jet " , and became an international chart success . The song topped the charts in the United States , also reaching number 3 in the United Kingdom . The single sold over one million copies in 1974 in America . It has since become one of the band 's most famous songs . 
 A medley of song fragments that vary in style from folk rock to funk , " Band on the Run " is one of McCartney 's longest singles at 5 : 09 . The song was partly inspired by a comment that George Harrison had made during a meeting of the Beatles ' Apple record label . The song @-@ wide theme is one of freedom and escape , and its creation coincided with Harrison , John Lennon and Ringo Starr having parted with manager Allen Klein in March 1973 , leading to improved relations between McCartney and his fellow ex @-@ Beatles . The original demos for this and other tracks on Band on the Run were stolen shortly after Wings arrived in Lagos , Nigeria , to begin recording the album . With the band reduced to a trio consisting of McCartney , his wife Linda , and Denny Laine , " Band on the Run " was recorded at EMI 's Lagos studio and completed at AIR Studios in London .

McCartney recalled : " He was saying that we were all prisoners in some way [ due to the ongoing problems with their company Apple ] … I thought it would be a nice way to start an album . " McCartney added , referring to his inspiration for " Band on the Run " : " It 's a million things … all put together . Band on the run – escaping , freedom , criminals . You name it , it 's there . " 
 In a 1988 interview with Musician magazine , McCartney noted the drug busts musicians of the late 1960s and early 1970s experienced as an inspiration for the " Band on the Run " , also referencing the " desperado " image he attributed to bands like the Byrds and the Eagles as an influence . McCartney , who had been having legal trouble involving pot possession , said , " We were being outlawed for pot ... And our argument on [ ' Band on the Run ' ] was ' Don 't put us on the wrong side ... We 're not criminals , we don 't want to be . So I just made up a story about people breaking out of prison . ' " 
 According to Mojo contributor Tom Doyle , the song 's lyrics , recalled through memory following the robbery of the band 's demo tapes for the Band on the Run album , were altered to reflect on the band 's then @-@ current status , " stuck inside the four walls of the small , cell @-@ like studio , faced with grim uncertainty .

 " Band on the Run " is a three @-@ part medley , with the first section being a slow ballad , the second featuring a funk rock style , and the final a country @-@ esque section .

 The original demo recording for " Band on the Run " , as well as multiple other tracks from the album , was stolen from the McCartneys by a group of thugs while Paul McCartney and Wings were recording in Lagos , Nigeria . <unk> at knife @-@ point , they relinquished the demos , only recovering the songs through memory . Paul McCartney later remarked , " It was stuff that would be worth a bit on eBay these days , you know ? But no , we figured the guys who mugged us wouldn ’ t even be remotely interested . If they ’ d have known , they could have just held on to them and made themselves a little fortune . But they didn ’ t know , and we reckoned they ’ d probably record over them . " 
 The song was recorded in two parts , in different sessions . The first two were taped in Lagos while the third section was recorded in October 1973 at AIR Studios in London . 
 = = Release = = 
 Originally , Paul McCartney planned not to release any singles from Band on the Run , a strategy he compared to that used by The Beatles . However , he was convinced by Capitol Records promotion man Al Coury to release singles from the album , resulting in the single release of " Jet " and " Band on the Run " . 
 " Band on the Run " , backed with " Nineteen Hundred and Eighty @-@ Five " , was released in America on 8 April 1974 as the follow @-@ up single to Paul McCartney and Wings ' top @-@ ten hit " Jet " . The song was a smash hit for the band , becoming McCartney 's third solo American chart @-@ topping single and Wings ' second . The single was later released in Britain ( instead backed with " Zoo Gang " , the theme song to the television show of the same name ) , reaching number 3 on the British charts . The song was also a top 40 single in multiple European countries , such as the Netherlands ( number 7 ) , Belgium ( number 21 ) , and Germany ( number 22 ) . 
 The US radio edit was 3 : 50 in length . The difference was largely caused by the removal of the middle or the second part of the song , as well as the verse that starts with " Well , the undertaker drew a heavy sigh … " 
 The single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies . It was the second of five number @-@ one singles for the band on the Billboard Hot 100 . In 1974 , Billboard ranked it number 22 on its Top Pop Singles year @-@ end chart . Billboard also listed the song as Paul McCartney 's sixth most successful chart hit of all time , excluding Beatles releases . 
 " Band on the Run " has also been featured on numerous McCartney / Wings compilation albums , including Wings Greatest , All the Best ! , and Wingspan : Hits and History . The song is also performed in many of McCartney 's live shows , with a live version being included on the 1976 live album Wings over America .

 An independent film produced by Michael Coulson while he was a college student in the mid 1970s was later included in The McCartney Years video compilation as well as the 2010 re @-@ issue of the album Band on the Run .

The video ends with a collage of Beatles pictures much like the album cover of Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . 
 In 2014 , a new video for " Band on the Run " was created . The video designed by Ben Ib , an artist who created tour visuals for Paul McCartney ( as well as Roger Waters and The Smashing Pumpkins ) and the cover for Paul McCartney 's 2013 solo album New . In the video , all of the objects , including the " band on the run " itself , are made up of words .

 The song was praised by former bandmate and songwriting partner , John Lennon , who considered it " a great song and a great album " . In 2014 , Billboard praised " Band on the Run " for having " three distinct parts that don 't depend on a chorus yet still manage to feel anthemic . " AllMusic critic Stewart Mason called the track " classic McCartney " , lauding the song for " manag [ ing ] to be experimental in form yet so deliciously melodic that its structural oddities largely go unnoticed . " 
 " Band on the Run " also won the Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo , Group or Chorus at the 17th Annual Grammy Awards . NME ranked the song as the tenth best song of the 1970s , as well as the fifteenth best solo song by an ex @-@ Beatle . In 2010 , AOL Radio listeners voted " Band on the Run " the best song of Paul McCartney 's solo career , achieving a better ranking than " Maybe I 'm Amazed " and " Silly Love Songs " . In 2012 , Rolling Stone readers ranked the song as McCartney 's fourth best song of all time , behind " Maybe I 'm Amazed " , " Hey Jude " , and " Yesterday " .

 = Consorts of Ganesha = 
 The marital status of Ganesha varies widely in mythological stories and the issue has been the subject of considerable scholarly review . Several patterns of associations with different consorts are identifiable . One pattern of myths identifies Ganesha as an unmarried <unk> with no consorts . Another pattern associates him with the concepts of Buddhi ( intellect ) , Siddhi ( spiritual power ) , and Riddhi ( prosperity ) ; these qualities are sometimes personified as goddesses who are considered to be Ganesha 's wives . Another pattern connects Ganesha with the goddess of culture and the arts , Sarasvati , and the goddess of luck and prosperity , Lakshmi . In the Bengal region he is linked with the banana tree , Kala Bo ( or Kola Bou ) . He also may be shown with a single consort or a nameless servant ( Sanskrit : <unk> ) . 
 Some of the differences between these patterns can be understood by looking at regional variations across India , the time periods in which the patterns are found , and the traditions in which the beliefs are held . Some differences pertain to the preferred meditation form used by the devotee , with many different traditional forms ranging from Ganesha as a young boy ( Sanskrit : <unk> <unk> ; <unk> ) to Ganesha as a Tantric deity . 
 = = Unmarried = = 
 According to one tradition , Ganesha was a <unk> , that is , unmarried . This pattern is primarily popular in southern India . This tradition was linked to Hindu concepts of the relationship between celibacy and the development of spiritual power . <unk> alludes to the tradition in which Ganesha was considered to be a lifelong bachelor in his commentary on the Ganesha Purana version of the Ganesha Sahasranama , which includes the name <unk> ( verse 9a ) . In his commentary on this verse <unk> says the name <unk> means " without a woman , " but the term can also mean " not fearful . " 
 = = <unk> , <unk> , and Budhi = = 
 The Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana contain descriptions of Ganesha flanked by Siddhi and Buddhi . In these two Puranas they appear as an intrinsic part of Ganapati and according to Thapan do not require any special rituals associated with shakti worship . In Chapter <unk> – 39 of the Ganesha Purana , Brahmā performs worship in honor of Ganesha , and during it Ganesha himself causes Buddhi and Siddhi to appear so that Brahmā can offer them back to Ganesha . Ganesha accepts them as offerings . In Ganesha Purana <unk> – 12 there is a variant of this incident , in which various gods are giving presents to Ganesha , but in this case Siddhi and Buddhi are born from Brahmā 's mind and are given by Brahmā to Ganesha . 
 The Ganesha Temple at Morgaon is the central shrine for the regional aṣṭavināyaka complex . The most sacred area within the <unk> temple is the sanctum ( <unk> ) , a small enclosure containing an image of Ganesha . To the right and left sides of the image stand Siddhi and Buddhi . In northern India the two female figures are said to be Siddhi and Riddhi . There is no Purāṇic evidence for the pair , but the pairing parallels those of Buddhi and Siddhi in Shiva Purana and Riddhi and Buddhi from Matsya Purana . 
 = = = Interpretation of relationships = = = 
 The Śiva Purāṇa has a story in which Ganesha and his brother Skanda compete for the right to marry the two desirable daughters of <unk> , Siddhi and Buddhi , and Ganesha wins through a clever approach . This story adds that after some time Ganesha begat two sons : <unk> ( <unk> ) ( Prosperity ) , born to Siddhi , and Lābha ( Acquisition , Profit ) born to Buddhi . In Northern Indian variants of this story the sons are often said to be Śubha ( Hindi Shubh ) ( auspiciousness ) and Lābha . In discussing the Shiva Purana version , Courtright comments that while Ganesha is sometimes depicted as sitting between these two feminine deities , " these women are more like feminine emanations of his androgynous nature , Shaktis rather than spouses having their own characters and spouses . " 
 Ludo Rocher says that " descriptions of Gaṇeśa as siddhi @-@ buddhi @-@ <unk> ' accompanied by , followed by siddhi and buddhi . ' often seem to mean no more than that , when Gaṇeśa is present , siddhi ' success ' and buddhi ' wisdom ' are not far behind . Such may well have been the original conception , of which the marriage was a later development . " In verse <unk> of the Ganesha Purana version of the Ganesha Sahasranama , one of Ganesha 's names is <unk> ( " <unk> of material and spiritual success " ) . The Matsya Purana identifies <unk> as the " owner " of Riddhi ( prosperity ) and Buddhi ( wisdom ) . In discussing the northern Indian sources , Cohen remarks : 
 " They are <unk> figures , interchangeable , and given their frequent depiction fanning Gaṇeśa are often referred to as <unk> — servants . Their names represent the benefits accrued by the worshipper of Gaṇeśa , and thus Gaṇeśa is said to be the owner of <unk> and Siddhi ; he similarly functions as the father of Śubha ( auspiciousness ) and Lābha ( profit ) , a pair similar to the Śiva Purāṇa 's <unk> ( prosperity ) and Lābha . Though in Varanasi the paired figures were usually called <unk> and Siddhi , Gaṇeśa 's relationship to them was often vague . He was their <unk> , their owner ; they were more often <unk> than <unk> ( wives ) . " 
 In the <unk> , a Tantric form of Ganesha called Haridra Ganapati is described as turmeric @-@ colored and flanked by two unnamed wives . The word " wives " ( Sanskrit : <unk> ; <unk> ) is specifically used ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् ; <unk> ) . These wives are distinct from shaktis . 
 = = = Ashta Siddhi = = = 
 Ganesha 's relationship with the <unk> — the eight spiritual <unk> obtained by the practice of yoga — is also of this <unk> type . In later iconography , these eight marvellous powers are represented by a group of young women who surround Ganesha . Raja Ravi Varma 's painting ( shown in this section ) illustrates a recent example of this iconographic form . The painting includes fans and Fly @-@ whisks , which establish the feminine figures as attendants . In cosmopolitan <unk> worship of Ganesha , the Aṣṭa Siddhi are addressed as eight goddesses . In Ganesha Purana , these personified Aṣṭa Siddhi are used by Ganesha to attack demon <unk> . These eight consorts are fused in a single devi , Ganesha ’ s śakti , according to Getty . She speculates as to whether the Aṣṭa Siddhi are a transformation of the <unk> with whom Ganesha is often <unk> represented . 
 = = = Santoshi Ma = = = 
 Ganesha was depicted as a householder married to Riddhi and Siddhi and the father of Santoshi Ma ( Devanagari : <unk> <unk> ) , a new goddess of satisfaction , in the 1975 Hindi film Jai Santoshi Maa . The movie script is not based on scriptural sources . The fact that a cult has developed around the figure of Santoshi Ma has been cited by Anita Raina Thapan and Lawrence Cohen as evidence of Ganesha 's continuing evolution as a popular deity . 
 = = Buddhi ( Wisdom ) = = 
 Ganesha is considered to be the Lord of Intelligence . In Sanskrit the word buddhi is a feminine noun that is variously translated as intelligence , wisdom , or intellect . The concept of buddhi is closely associated with the personality of Ganesha as of the Puranic period , where many stories develop that showcase his cleverness and love of intelligence . One of Ganesha 's names in the Ganesha Purana and in the Ganesha Sahasranama is Buddhipriya . The name Buddhipriya also appears in a special list of twenty @-@ one names that Gaṇeśa says are of special importance at the end of the Ganesha Sahasranama . The word <unk> can mean " fond of " or in a marital context it can mean " a lover , husband " , so Buddhipriya means " fond of intelligence " or " Buddhi 's husband " . 
 This association with wisdom also appears in the name Buddha , which appears as a name of Ganesha in the second verse of the Ganesha Purana version of the Ganesha Sahasranama . The positioning of this name at the beginning of the Ganesha Sahasranama indicates that the name was of importance . Bhaskararaya 's commentary on the Ganesha Sahasranama says that this name for Ganesha means that the Buddha was an avatar of Ganesha . This interpretation is not widely known even among Ganapatya , and the Buddha is not mentioned in the lists of Ganesha 's incarnations given in the main sections of the Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana . Bhaskararaya also provides a more general interpretation of this name as simply meaning that Ganesha 's very form is " eternal enlightenment " ( <unk> ) , so he is named Buddha . 
 = = Motif of shaktis = = 
 A distinct type of iconographic image of Ganesha shows him with a single human @-@ looking shakti ( Sanskrit : śakti ) . According to Ananda Coomaraswamy , the oldest known depiction of Ganesha with a shakti of this type dates from the sixth century . The consort lacks a distinctive personality or iconographic repertoire . According to Cohen and Getty , the appearance of this shakti motif parallels the emergence of tantric branches of the Ganapatya cult . Getty mentions a specific cult of " Shakti Ganapati " that was set up by the Ganapatyas involving five distinct forms . Of the thirty @-@ two standard meditation forms for Ganesha that appear in the Sritattvanidhi ( <unk> ) , six include a shakti . A common form of this motif shows Ganesha seated with the shakti upon his left hip , holding a bowl of flat cakes or round sweets . Ganesha turns his trunk to his own left in order to touch the tasty food . In some of the tantric forms of this image , the gesture is modified to take on erotic overtones . Some tantric variants of this form are described in the <unk> <unk> . 
 Prithvi Kumar <unk> has traced at least six different lists of fifty or more aspects or forms of Ganesha each with their specific female consorts or shaktis . In these lists of paired shaktis are found such goddess names as Hrī , Śrī , <unk> , etc . The names Buddhi , Siddhi , and Riddhi do not appear on any of these lists . The lists provide no details about the personalities or distinguishing iconographic forms for these shaktis . <unk> concludes that all of the lists were derived from one original set of names . The earliest of the lists appears in the <unk> Purāṇa ( <unk> @-@ 38 ) , and appears to have been used with minor variations in the <unk> <unk> . These lists are of two types . In the first type the names of various forms of Ganesha are given with a clear @-@ cut pairing of a named shakti for that form . The second type , as found in the <unk> Purāṇa ( <unk> – 76 ) and the commentary of <unk> on the <unk> ( <unk> ) , gives fifty or more names of Ganesha collectively in one group , with the names of the shaktis provided collectively in a second group . The second type of list poses problems in separating and properly connecting the names into pairs due to ambiguities in the formation of Sanskrit compound words . 
 = = Sarasvati and Lakshmi = = 
 Throughout India , on contemporary poster art , Ganesha is portrayed with Sarasvati ( goddess of culture and art ) or Lakshmi ( goddess of luck and prosperity ) or both . Ganesha , Lakshmi and <unk> are often grouped together as the divinities immediately responsible for material welfare . Ganesha and Saraswati share control over Buddhi ( Wisdom ) , while Ganesha and Lakshmi are both deities of <unk> and Siddhi ( material and spiritual success ) . Particularly in Maharashtra , Ganesha is associated with <unk> or Sarasvati . Some identify the two goddesses as the same person and thus the single consort of Ganesha while others consider them distinct and one or both of them as married to Ganesha . Lakshmi 's association with Ganesha is rarely tied with the Tantric tradition of Lakshmi as Ganesha 's śakti . Other reasons are variously offered for their relationship : their functional <unk> and their joint worship on Diwali and in general by the " business community . " Conversely , in Calcutta , Ganesha is said to be the brother of Sarasvati and Lakshmi . 
 = = Kola Bo = = 
 In Bengal , Ganesha on Durga Puja is associated with a plantain ( banana ) tree , the " Kola Bo " ( also spelled <unk> or <unk> ) , ritually transformed into a goddess during the festival . 
 On the first day of Durga Puja the Kala Bo is draped with a red @-@ bordered white sari and vermilion is smeared on its leaves . She is then placed on a decorated pedestal and worshipped with flowers , sandalwood paste , and incense sticks . The Kala Bo is set on Ganesha 's right side , along with other deities . For most who view her , the new sari indicates her role as a new bride , and many Bengalis see it as symbolizing the wife of Ganesha . 
 A different view is that the Kala Bo represents Durga herself , who in Bengal is considered the mother of Ganesha . Those who know of that tradition do not consider Ganesha 's association with Kala Bo as a marital one . Haridas Mitra says that the Kala Bo is intended to serve as a symbolic summary for the nine types of leaves ( <unk> <unk> ) that together form a sacred complex on Durga Puja . The officiating priests who carry out the ceremony tie a bunch of eight plants on the trunk of the plantain tree and it is the grouping of all nine plants that constitute the Kala Bo . The nine plants all have beneficial medicinal properties . According to Martin @-@ Dubost , the Kala Bo does not represent a bride or shakti of Ganesha , but rather is the plant form of Durga . He connects the plant symbol back to the festival enactment of Durga 's return of the blood of the buffalo demon to the earth so that the order of the world may be re @-@ established and luxuriant vegetation reappear . He links Ganesha to this vegetation myth and notes that <unk> ( <unk> , " Creator of the eighteen medicinal plants " ) is a name of Ganesha . 
 = All You Need Is Love ( The JAMs song ) = 
 " All You Need Is Love " is a song by The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu , independently released as their debut single on 9 March 1987 . A politically topical song concerning the British media 's AIDS furore , the track was initially given a 12 " white label release because of its sampling of other records . 
 The artistic attitude of " All You Need Is Love " epitomised that of The JAMs ' subsequent recordings : making use of popular music by taking extensive samples of other artists ' work , and juxtaposing these with each other , adding beatbox rhythms and Bill Drummond 's Scottish @-@ accented raps , poems and narrations . The JAMs ' promotional tactics were similarly unconventional , including the use of promotional graffiti , a guerrilla communication method which would be employed regularly by Drummond and Cauty throughout their career . 
 = = Recording and release = = 
 Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty started working together early in 1987 . They assumed alter egos — <unk> D and Rockman Rock respectively — and adopted the name " The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu " ( The JAMs ) , after the fictional conspiratorial group " The Justified Ancients of <unk> " from The Illuminatus ! Trilogy . " All You Need Is Love " was their debut single . 
 Initially , the song was released as a limited edition one @-@ sided white label promotional 12 " , on 9 March 1987 , by The JAMs ' own label The Sound Of Mu ( sic ) . This version included a 15 @-@ second sample of The Beatles ' " All You Need Is Love " , as well as samples of the MC5 's " Kick Out the Jams " and Samantha Fox 's " Touch Me ( I Want Your Body ) " . The song had been declined by distributors fearful of prosecution , but copies of the white label were sent to DJs and the music press . The identities of Drummond and Cauty were not made known to these recipients ( Drummond was actually something of a music business veteran , and Cauty a former member of the much @-@ hyped but unsuccessful band Brilliant ) . Underground Magazine speculated on this in March 1987 : " The whole affair is mysterious , a telephone number only and a threat that the group will soon be releasing more material ... ' No , we 've not been in bands before , and yes , I suppose we were originally influenced by the Beastie Boys to actually get up and do something ... ' Too true , but these colonials seem a touch wiser , world weary a bit , but not angry ... " . In the 28 March 1987 edition , NME revealed King Boy D 's identity as Bill Drummond . 
 The JAMs re @-@ edited the single in such a way that — they hoped — " brought [ them ] inside the " law " but still got up peoples noses " , removing all but a snatch of The Beatles , replacing or doctoring the MC5 sample , and rerecording the Samantha Fox vocal . This new version — named " All You Need Is Love ( <unk> ) " — was released on 18 May 1987 as JAMS <unk> , and was included on The JAMs debut album 1987 ( What the Fuck Is Going On ? ) . Indeed , according to Drummond , the recording of 1987 was funded by the sales of " All You Need Is Love ( <unk> ) " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The central theme of " All You Need Is Love " was the media coverage given to the AIDS crisis . The original version opens with a 15 @-@ second sample of The Beatles ' " All You Need Is Love " , followed by Rob Tyner 's cry of " Kick out the Jams , motherfuckers ! " from the MC5 's album Kick Out the Jams . A simple beatbox rhythm begins , along with samples of John Hurt from a British public information film — entitled Don 't Die of Ignorance — about the dangers of AIDS . The samples misquote the film : " sexual intercourse — no known cure " . Bill Drummond performs a heavily accented Clydeside rap , beginning " We 're back again , they never kicked us out , twenty thousand years of ' shout shout shout ' " , a reference to the fictional JAMs of The Illuminatus ! Trilogy . Later , he raps : " With this killer virus who needs war ? <unk> the <unk> , I said shag shag shag some more ! " " <unk> the <unk> " is a reference to the opening line of Illuminatus ! , referring to the end of the world , and " shag " is a British slang word for sexual intercourse . 
 Between verses , the rhythm is punctuated by samples of former glamour model Samantha Fox ( " Touch me , touch me , I want to feel your body " ) , as well as a sample " Ancients of Mu Mu " ( by The JAMs ' associate rapper Chike ) which recurred throughout the next ten years ' work of Drummond and Cauty . Also heard is a rendition by children of " Ring a Ring o ' Roses " , rhythmic panting , and an original female vocal line concerning infant mortality . Sounds magazine stated that the deliberate placement of Fox 's sexually provocative " Touch Me " alongside " Ring a Ring O <unk> " ( " the nursery rhyme about the Plague " ) " highlights explicitly the depth of contradiction embedded in society 's attitude towards death through sex " . More succinctly , NME said : " ' All You Need ... ' is by everyone " ( so many samples ) " and about everything " ( and a variety of thematic nuances ) . 
 Drummond has said he was inspired by the hip @-@ hop and scratch he was hearing regularly on John Peel 's BBC Radio 1 show , but looking back in 1991 he said " If you listen to it now , it sounds nothing like a hip hop record , you know , it sounds a lot more like British punk ... [ a ] punk version of a hip hop record , I suppose . " 
 = = Reviews = = 
 The original white label release of " All You Need Is Love " was made " single of the week " in Sounds magazine , who announced that The JAMs had " produced the first single to capture realistically the musical and social climate of 1987 " . Calling the result " a seething terror ridden pulp " , Sounds elaborated : " How have [ The JAMs ] produced a record more powerful than Lydon / Bambaataa 's " World Destruction " without laying a finger on a synthesiser or guitar ? <unk> ! By stealing all the various beats , noises and sounds they 've wanted , and building it into their own stunning audio collage , [ The JAMs ] are making a direct assault on the way records are put together . " 
 Underground magazine were also enthusiastic : " This month I 'm pleased to say , what 's really moving is entirely British . The best groove so far this year is from Scotland and it shows London and New York exactly how it should be done , a one @-@ sided , one @-@ track 12 inch ( it doesn 't need any dub or instrumentals ) . ' All You Need Is Love ' by The <unk> is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles ( with a dash of MC5 and Samantha Fox ) . It seems to be anti @-@ AIDS , but as I know nothing about the band it could easily be a piss take . Either way this is a superb jam , if you can find it , buy it ( it 's so <unk> constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given ) . " 
 In a July 1987 review of 1987 ( What the Fuck Is Going On ? ) , Q magazine recalled that the original release of " All You Need Is Love " " seemed an inspired moment of pure wildness . Here were Red Clydeside beatbox rappers pointing a finger at society , putting their record together from samples pirated directly from other people 's recordings , while at the same time crossing almost all contemporary music tribal boundaries by including everyone from Samantha Fox to The MC5 among their victims . " This was contrasted with 1987 which the reviewer felt was a " disappointment " with " too few ideas being spread too thin " . 
 The re @-@ release of " All You Need Is Love " rewarded The JAMs with further praise , including NME " single of the week " , in which Danny Kelly thought that " its maverick requisition of the hip @-@ hop idiom , its fanatical confrontation of copyright laws overrun by music 's new technologies , its central subject matters and its termination with the year 's most incisively searching question — ' 1987 : what the f * * k 's going on ? ' — combine to make ' All You Need Is Love ' a triumph of <unk> over mere newness " [ sic ] . Reviewing 1987 later in the year , the same writer described " All You Need Is Love " as " mighty " but he was unable to hide his disappointment in the album as a whole : " is it the runaway juggernaut <unk> monster crack that the <unk> 45 threatened ? No . " 
 A retrospective piece in The Guardian called " All You Need Is Love " a " jagged slice of agit @-@ prop " and " shockingly effective " , adding that " [ the original ] was a club hit ( i.e. everybody danced to it though nobody bought it ) , and after being re @-@ edited to avoid copyright restrictions , it reached number three in the Indie chart " .

 The artistic attitude of " All You Need Is Love " epitomised that of The JAMs ' subsequent recordings : plagiarising popular music by taking extensive samples of other artists ' work , and juxtaposing these with each other , adding beatbox rhythms and Drummond 's Scottish @-@ accented raps , poems and narrations . The albums 1987 and Who Killed The JAMs ? , and the singles " All You Need Is Love " , " Whitney Joins The JAMs " and " Down Town " all had small @-@ scale production budgets and little mainstream popularity , yet their novel construction and The JAMs ' provocative disregard for copyright gained the duo enduring media attention . 
 The JAMs ' promotional tactics were similarly unconventional , including the use of promotional graffiti , a guerrilla communication method employed repeatedly by Drummond and Cauty , beginning around the time of their first releases . Some copies of the re @-@ released single were supplied in a picture sleeve which showed The JAMs ' " Shag Shag Shag " graffiti defacing a billboard ( advertising the Today newspaper ) that depicted police chief James Anderton . Anderton , a self @-@ declared Christian , had courted controversy when he said " I see increasing evidence of people swirling about in a human cesspit of their own making … We must ask why homosexuals freely engage in sodomy and other obnoxious practices , knowing the dangers involved " . As with much of The JAMs ' graffiti , the potency of " Shag Shag Shag " was derived from the context it in which it was placed . Further graffiti followed , " JAMs " and " Shag Shag Shag " slogans defacing billboards and Government @-@ funded AIDS warnings in London . The JAMs also made available " Shag Shag Shag " T @-@ shirts which King Boy D told the NME were " selling like hot cakes " . The JAMs later revisited the word " shag " when they named their early career retrospective compilation album Shag Times . 
 Drummond and Cauty 's output as The JAMs and later The KLF extensively referenced The Illuminatus ! Trilogy , and their debut recordings were no exception . The lyrical references in " All You Need Is Love " are complemented by the first of many iconographic and numerical allusions that soon came to characterise the duo 's work . Their " pyramid blaster " logo — a pyramid with a ghetto blaster suspended in front — appeared for the first time on the re @-@ released " All You Need Is Love " .

 = Lady Saigō = 
 Lady Saigō ( <unk> or <unk> , Saigō @-@ no @-@ Tsubone ) ( 1552 – 1 July 1589 ) , also known as Oai , was the first consort and trusted confidante of Tokugawa Ieyasu , the samurai lord who unified Japan at the end of the sixteenth century and then ruled as Shogun . She was also the mother of the second Tokugawa shogun , Tokugawa Hidetada . 
 During their relationship , Lady Saigō influenced Ieyasu 's philosophies , choice of allies , and policies as he rose to power during the late Sengoku period , and she thus had an indirect effect on the organization and composition of the Tokugawa shogunate . Although less is known of her than some other figures of the era , she is generally regarded as the " power behind the throne " , and her life has been compared to a " Cinderella story " of feudal Japan . Her contributions were considered so significant that she was posthumously inducted to the Senior First Rank of the Imperial Court , the highest honor that could be conferred by the Emperor of Japan . 
 Once she was in a respected and secure position as first consort and mother to Ieyasu 's heir , Lady Saigō used her influence and wealth for charitable purposes . A devout Buddhist , she donated money to temples in Suruga Province , where she resided as the consort of Ieyasu , first in Hamamatsu Castle and later in Sunpu Castle . As she was quite near @-@ sighted , she also established a charitable organization that assisted visually impaired women with no other means of support . Lady Saigō died at a fairly young age , under somewhat mysterious circumstances . Although murder was suspected , no culprit was identified . 
 Lady Saigō bore four children : she had a son and a daughter ( Saigō <unk> and <unk> ) while married , and she later bore two sons as the consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu : Tokugawa Hidetada and Matsudaira Tadayoshi . Among the descendants of Lady Saigō was the Empress <unk> ( 1624 – 1696 ) , one of very few women to accede to the Chrysanthemum Throne as empress regnant . 
 = = Name = = 
 The term " Saigō @-@ no @-@ Tsubone " , used in most historical texts , is an official title rather than a name . As an adult she was adopted into the Saigō clan , so she was permitted to use the surname . Later , when she was named first consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu , the title " tsubone " ( pronounced [ tsu ͍ bone ] ) was appended to the surname . The title was one of several titular suffixes conferred on high @-@ ranking women ( others include <unk> and <unk> ) . The bestowal of a title depended on social class and the relationship with her samurai lord , such as whether she was a legitimate wife or a concubine , and whether or not she had had children by him . The word tsubone indicates the living quarters reserved for ladies of a court , and it became the title for those who had been granted private quarters , such as high @-@ ranking concubines with children . This title , tsubone , was in use for concubines from the Heian Period until the Meiji Period ( from the eighth century to the early twentieth century ) , and is commonly translated to the English title " Lady " . 
 Though Lady Saigō 's given name does not appear in surviving documents from the time , there is good evidence it was Masako ( <unk> ) , but this name is very rarely used . Her most commonly used name was Oai ( <unk> or <unk> , meaning " love " ) and most sources agree this was a nickname she gained as a child . Intimate friends and family would call her Oai throughout her life , and it is the name most often used in modern popular cultural references . Following death , she was bestowed with a Buddhist posthumous name , and an abbreviation of that name , Hōdai @-@ in ( <unk> ) , is sometimes used out of pious respect . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Saigō family was one branch of the distinguished Kikuchi clan of Kyushu that had migrated northward to Mikawa Province in the fifteenth century . In 1524 , the forces of Matsudaira <unk> ( 1511 – 1536 ) , the grandfather of Tokugawa Ieyasu , stormed and took the Saigō clan 's headquarters at Yamanaka Castle during his conquest of the Mikawa region . Shortly after the battle , Saigō <unk> , the third head of the Saigō , submitted to the Matsudaira clan . Following the untimely death of <unk> in 1536 , and the ineffectual leadership and early death of Matsudaira Hirotada ( 1526 – 1549 ) , the leaderless Matsudaira clan finally submitted to Imagawa Yoshimoto ( 1519 – 1560 ) of Suruga Province , east of Mikawa . When the Matsudaira fell to the Imagawa , the clans of their retainers , which included the Saigō , likewise submitted to the Imagawa . Following the Battle of <unk> ( 1560 ) , Saigō Masakatsu attempted to re @-@ assert the independence of the clan while yielding some land concessions to the Imagawa . In response , Imagawa <unk> arrested thirteen Saigō men , and had them vertically impaled near Yoshida Castle . The executions did not deter the Saigō , and in 1562 the Imagawa launched punitive invasions of east Mikawa and attacked the two main Saigō castles . Masakatsu was killed in the battle of <unk> Castle ; his eldest son <unk> was killed during the battle for <unk> Castle . Clan leadership passed to Masakatsu 's son , Saigō Kiyokazu ( 1533 – 1594 ) , who pledged his loyalty to the Matsudaira clan , under the leadership of Tokugawa Ieyasu , in their mutual struggle against the Imagawa . In 1569 , the power of the Imagawa ended with the Siege of Kakegawa Castle . 
 Neither the name of Lady Saigō 's mother nor her dates of birth or death are recorded in any existing documents , although it is known that she was the elder sister of Saigō Kiyokazu . Lady Saigō 's father was <unk> Tadaharu of <unk> Province , under direct control of the Imagawa clan . The marriage between Tadaharu and his wife was very likely arranged by the Imagawa clan . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Lady Saigō was born in 1552 at Nishikawa Castle , a branch castle of the Saigō clan , and very likely given the name of Masako soon after birth . Japanese marriages are not usually matrilocal , but Tadaharu may have been assigned to Nishikawa Castle as an agent of the Imagawa . Masako spent her childhood with her two siblings in bucolic eastern Mikawa Province , and at some point gained the nickname Oai . In 1554 , her father Tadaharu died in the Battle of <unk> @-@ Omori , between the Imagawa and the Hōjō clan . Two years later her mother married Hattori <unk> ; the union resulted in four children , though only two survived to adulthood . 
 Some sources state that upon reaching " adulthood " Oai married , Note a but was widowed soon afterward . The husband 's name is not mentioned and there were apparently no children . Other sources do not mention the marriage , or suggest that there never was an earlier " first " marriage . It is known with certainty that in 1567 , Oai married Saigō Yoshikatsu , her cousin and the son of <unk> , who had already had two children by his late wife . Oai bore two children by Yoshikatsu : their son , Saigō <unk> , was born about 1570 ; they also had a daughter , possibly named <unk> b 
 In 1571 , Saigō Yoshikatsu was killed at the Battle of Takehiro , fighting the invading forces of the Takeda clan led by Akiyama <unk> . Soon after Yoshikatsu 's death , Oai was formally adopted by her uncle , Saigō Kiyokazu , then the head of the Saigō clan , though she chose to live with her mother in the house of her stepfather . 
 = = = Tokugawa Ieyasu = = = 
 Oai first met Tokugawa Ieyasu at about the age of 17 or 18 , when he visited the Saigō family and Oai served him tea . It is believed she caught his eye on that occasion , but as she was still married , nothing came of it at the time . Later , during the 1570s , it is believed that friendship and genuine affection developed between the two . This view contradicts a common impression which maintains that Ieyasu was a ruthless leader who treated all the women in his life , and all of his offspring , as commodities to be used as needed to serve the clan or his own ambitions . However , it is also known that he valued personal merit over bloodlines . During this time , Ieyasu had a house built in eastern Mikawa , far from the residence of his wife , the Lady Tsukiyama , in Okazaki . The marriage between Ieyasu and Lady Tsukiyama had been arranged by her uncle , Imagawa Yoshimoto , ostensibly to help cement ties between the two clans , though Ieyasu found it difficult to live with his wife 's jealousy , tempestuous moods , and eccentric habits . 
 Starting around the time of the Battle of <unk> ( 1573 ) , perhaps in its aftermath , Ieyasu began to confide in Oai and sought her counsel on various matters . It may have been during this period that the two commenced an amorous relationship . Oai is credited with advising Ieyasu as the Battle of Nagashino ( 1575 ) approached , a major turning point in both Ieyasu 's career and the history of Japan . It is also thought that Ieyasu continued to seek her advice concerning other battles and alliances , even as late as the Komaki @-@ <unk> Campaign ( 1584 ) . 
 In the spring of 1578 , Oai moved to Hamamatsu Castle , where she took over management of the kitchen . She became very popular with the unit of warriors from her native province , who not only admired her beauty , but regarded her as a gentle and virtuous example of the women of Mikawa . While her manners and gentility were exemplary , she could , when the occasion warranted , be outspoken or sarcastic in speech , the probable result of growing up around rustic warriors in a remote castle outpost . With her move to the court of Ieyasu , Oai entered a bitter arena where prospective concubines schemed and competed with each other for a chance to bear Ieyasu 's child . Bearing the child of a powerful samurai , especially a son , was one way an ambitious young woman of the period could elevate her status , ensure a comfortable life , and guarantee the prosperity of her family . These women usually relied on their physical attributes and sexual prowess to keep their lord 's attention , and some resorted to the use of aphrodisiacs . Unlike these courtesans , Oai already had the attention of Ieyasu , which would have undermined the ambitions of some and very likely made her a target of resentment , hostility , and the intrigues that were common in Japanese harems . 
 While Ieyasu 's marriage was arranged for political reasons , and many of his later concubines were chosen in the same spirit , it is thought that he chose his relationship with Lady Saigō . Despite the image of Ieyasu as a calculating and stoic warlord , there was no new political advantage to the match , as the Saigō were already loyal vassals , and thus texts about Lady Saigō refer to her as the " most beloved " of Ieyasu 's women . Moreover , Ieyasu valued her for her intelligence and sound advice and it is believed that he enjoyed her company and calm demeanor as well as their common background in Mikawa province . On May 2 , 1579 , Oai gave birth to Ieyasu 's third son , who would become known as Tokugawa Hidetada . The news was probably a shock to all who had an interest in Ieyasu , but with the event , Oai 's position became more secure and she was accepted as the first consort of Ieyasu . Based on this relationship , and out of respect for her gentle manner and devotion to Ieyasu , she became known by the respectful title of Saigō @-@ no @-@ Tsubone , or Lady Saigō . 
 In the same year , Oda Nobunaga was informed that Lady Tsukiyama had conspired against him with the Takeda clan . Although evidence was weak , Ieyasu re @-@ assured his ally by having his wife executed by the shore of Lake <unk> in Hamamatsu . Tokugawa <unk> , Ieyasu 's first son by Lady Tsukiyama , was held in confinement until Ieyasu ordered him to commit seppuku . With their deaths , Lady Saigō 's position at court was unassailable . With the death of <unk> , Hidetada became Ieyasu 's heir <unk> c 
 Ieyasu 's fourth son , the second by Lady Saigō , was born on October 18 , 1580 . He would become known as Matsudaira Tadayoshi , after he was adopted by Matsudaira <unk> , the head of the <unk> branch of the Matsudaira clan . In the same year , Lady Saigō had a temple founded in her mother 's memory , indicating she had died by that point . In 1586 , Lady Saigō was at the side of Ieyasu when he entered the newly reconstructed Sunpu Castle in triumph . This was a highly symbolic celebration of his victories over his enemies and the subjugation of the region , but it was also a visible and symbolic gesture to Lady Saigō , a way that Ieyasu could credit her for her assistance , and publicly demonstrate the esteem in which he regarded her . 
 = = = Charity = = = 
 While at Sunpu Castle , Lady Saigō worshipped at a Buddhist temple called Ryusen @-@ ji . She became devoted to the teachings of the Pure Land sect and was known for her piety and charity . Because she suffered a high degree of myopia , she often donated money , clothing , food , and other necessities to blind women and organizations that assisted them . She eventually founded a co @-@ operative school with living quarters near Ryusen @-@ ji that assisted indigent blind women by teaching them how to play the shamisen ( traditional stringed instrument ) as a vocation , and helped them to find employment . These women were known as <unk> , and were akin to traveling minstrels in Edo period Japan . The women were granted membership to the guild @-@ like organization , and musicians with apprentices were dispatched to various destinations . They played pieces from a sanctioned repertoire , and operated under a strict code of rules on behavior and permissible business transactions intended to maintain an upstanding reputation . On her deathbed , Lady Saigō wrote a letter pleading for the continued maintenance of the organization . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Within a short time after taking up residence in Sunpu Castle , Lady Saigō 's health began to deteriorate . It was said that " physical and emotional hardships " were taking their toll on her health , but nothing could be done to help her . Lady Saigō died on July 1 , 1589 , at the age of 37 . The cause of her early death was never determined , and while murder was suspected at the time , no culprit was identified . There were later rumors that she was poisoned by a maidservant devoted to Ieyasu 's late wife , the Lady Tsukiyama . 
 By the time of her death , Lady Saigō was treated as Ieyasu 's wife in deed if not in word . The remains of Lady Saigō were interred at Ryusen @-@ ji . At her death , a number of blind women reportedly gathered in front of the temple and prayed .

 Tokugawa Ieyasu continued his campaigns allied with Toyotomi Hideyoshi . After their victory at the Siege of Odawara Castle in 1590 , Ieyasu agreed to relinquish all of his domains to Hideyoshi in exchange for the Kantō region to the east . Hideyoshi died in 1598 . By 1603 , Ieyasu had recovered Sunpu Castle and completed his unification of Japan , and had been named shogun by the Emperor . The following year , he had Ryusen @-@ ji moved from <unk> to <unk> d near Sunpu Castle and attended Buddhist funeral rites conducted in honor of the late Lady Saigō on the anniversary of her death . To mark the occasion , Ieyasu presented the temple priests with the katana he inherited from his father , and a portrait of himself as he looked at the time . These items can still be viewed at the temple in Shizuoka city . 
 In 1628 , Tokugawa Hidetada , by then the retired second shogun , attended ceremonies conducted in honor of his late mother on the anniversary of her death . These ceremonies were meant to help her spirit achieve buddha status . He also saw to it that she was made the honored tutelary patron of the temple by having her posthumous name changed and the first three characters appended to the name of the temple . Today , the temple Ryusen @-@ ji is known mainly by that appellation , Hōdai @-@ in ( <unk> ) . At the same time , the Emperor Go @-@ Mizunoo conferred the name Minamoto Masako ( <unk> <unk> ) upon Lady Saigō , in effect posthumously adopting her into the Minamoto clan , the extended family of the Imperial line . The new name was then inducted into the Lower First Rank of the Imperial Court . Her status was later upgraded to Senior First Rank , the highest and most prominent award , then or now , bestowed by the Emperor to a few subjects outside the Imperial family who had significantly and positively affected the history of Japan . 
 In 1938 , the mausoleum of Lady Saigō at Hōdai @-@ in , which consisted of a five @-@ tiered stupa over her grave and a sanctuary for the veneration of her spirit , was designated an Important Cultural Property . The designation was rescinded after the entire temple complex was destroyed in the Great Shizuoka Fire on January 15 , 1940 . The stupa remains , though evidence of the damage suffered when it toppled over is plainly visible . Many of the treasures of the temple , including a portrait of Lady Saigō and the sword and portrait bequeathed by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1604 , were saved by the priests who flung the objects out of windows and doorways before fleeing the burning temple . The temple was rebuilt using steel @-@ reinforced concrete in 1970 . Historical artifacts saved from the fire of 1940 are on display at the new Hōdai @-@ in temple in Shizuoka city .

 Lady Saigō was the ancestral mother to the line of shoguns that began with the second Edo period shogun , Tokugawa Hidetada , and ended with the seventh , Tokugawa <unk> ( 1709 – 1716 ) . Aside from this , Lady Saigō also became connected to the Imperial line . In 1620 , Hidetada 's daughter , Tokugawa Masako ( 1607 – 1678 ) , married Emperor Go @-@ Mizunoo and entered the Imperial palace . As empress consort , Masako helped maintain the Imperial Court , supported the arts , and significantly influenced the next three monarchs : the first was her daughter , and the two that followed , Emperors Go @-@ <unk> and Go @-@ Sai , were sons of Emperor Go @-@ Mizunoo by different concubines . The daughter of Masako , and thus great @-@ granddaughter of Lady Saigō , was Princess <unk> ( 1624 – 1696 ) , who acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 1629 as Empress <unk> . She reigned for fifteen years as the 109th monarch of Japan , the seventh of only eight empresses regnant in the history of Japan , until she abdicated in 1643 .

 A financial crisis in Springfield causes the sale of many houses and the release of all low @-@ level criminals from Springfield Penitentiary , including a man named Walt Warren . Walt purchases a house next door to the Simpson family ( where The Winfields and Ruth and Laura Powers used to live ) , and he immediately charms the neighborhood . However , Bart is convinced that Walt is Sideshow Bob in disguise , because they have the same voice . He tries several times to find proof , but fails . Marge convinces him otherwise by taking him to visit the penitentiary , where they see Bob locked in a padded cell , wearing a straitjacket and writing " Bart Simpson Will Die ! " on the walls . A reassured Bart decides to go to a baseball game with Walt . However , Bart 's initial instincts prove right when " Walt " removes his small shoes to show his long feet folded inside , revealing himself to be Sideshow Bob . Bob restrains Bart in the car and gags him with duct tape , planning to take him to Five Corners , a location where five states meet , to kill him . 
 Meanwhile , the real Walt Warren escapes prison while bearing Bob 's hair and face and comes to the Simpsons ' home . At first , everyone thinks Bob has escaped prison , but Walt 's short feet ( which was also used as a clue in " Krusty Gets Busted " to clear Krusty 's name for robbing the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart ) reveal his true identity . Walt explains that he and Bob were cellmates and , prior to Walt 's release , Bob drugged him and performed a transplant to switch their faces . The transplant left Walt unable to talk properly , and his garbled speech led the guards to put him in the padded cell . He wrote his message on the wall as a warning , but it was misinterpreted as a threat . Walt and the Simpsons immediately go after Bob , knowing that Bart 's life is in danger . Meanwhile , a waitress at a roadside diner becomes infatuated with Bob @-@ as @-@ Walt until Bob 's new face peels off . Amidst a distraction outside the diner , Homer , Marge , and Lisa travel to Mexico in search of Bart while Walt gets away and continues to Five Corners to save Bart. 
 At Five Corners , Bob intends to kill Bart in such a way that the crime takes place in five separate states , thus making it impossible to prosecute . Bart stalls by repeatedly jumping into the same state as Bob until Walt arrives . Walt and Bob struggle over the gun , but just before Bob can fire on either Walt or Bart , Chief Wiggum and the Springfield Police Department arrive to arrest Bob , having been tipped off by Bart. Bob jumps into the other states in order to escape their jurisdiction , only to be promptly confronted by police from each state , and he is taken into custody by officers with a strong New Jersey accent . His house is bought by Ned Flanders ' cousin Ted , and Homer groans at the realization that he now lives next door to two Flanders families . The Sideshow Bob leitmotif first introduced in the episode " Cape Feare " plays over the credits .

 The plot of " The Bob Next Door " is based on the movie Face / Off . The opening couch gag also features Harold from the 1955 children 's book Harold and the Purple Crayon . Bart tries to tempt Walt to sing " Three Little Maids from School Are We " from The Mikado ; the same song was also used in an earlier episode , " Cape Feare " , which also featured Sideshow Bob . Later in the show , when Sideshow Bob reveals his true identity , he exclaims he is now " able to sing all the Gilbert & Sullivan I damn well please " , followed by him pulling a Japanese fan out of the glove box and singing the opening notes of " Behold The Lord High Executioner " , another number from The Mikado , to Bart 's horror . Marge and Homer tell Bart that a lot of people have voices like Sideshow Bob 's , such as " Frasier on Cheers , Frasier on Frasier or Lt. Cmdr. Tom Dodge in Down Periscope . " Both of these characters were played by Sideshow Bob 's voice , Kelsey Grammer .

 The International Astrophysical Observatory " <unk> " ( usually known as Granat ; Russian : <unk> ) , was a Soviet ( later Russian ) space observatory developed in collaboration with France , Denmark and Bulgaria . It was launched on 1 December 1989 aboard a Proton rocket and placed in a highly eccentric four @-@ day orbit , of which three were devoted to observations . It operated for almost nine years . 
 In September 1994 , after nearly five years of directed observations , the gas supply for its attitude control was exhausted and the observatory was placed in a non @-@ directed survey mode . Transmissions finally ceased on 27 November 1998 . 
 With seven different instruments on board , Granat was designed to observe the universe at energies ranging from X @-@ ray to gamma ray . Its main instrument , SIGMA , was capable of imaging both hard X @-@ ray and soft gamma @-@ ray sources . The PHEBUS instrument was meant to study gamma @-@ ray bursts and other transient X @-@ Ray sources . Other experiments such as ART @-@ P were intended to image X @-@ Ray sources in the 35 to 100 keV range . One instrument , WATCH , was designed to monitor the sky continuously and alert the other instruments to new or interesting X @-@ Ray sources . The ART @-@ S spectrometer covered the X @-@ ray energy range while the KONUS @-@ B and TOURNESOL experiments covered both the X @-@ ray and gamma ray spectrum .

 Granat was a three @-@ axis @-@ stabilized spacecraft and the last of the Venera @-@ class spacecraft produced by the Lavochkin Scientific Production Association . It was similar to the Astron observatory which was functional from 1983 to 1989 ; for this reason , the spacecraft was originally known as the Astron 2 . It weighed 4 @.@ 4 metric tons and carried almost 2 @.@ 3 metric tons of international scientific instrumentation . Granat stood 6 @.@ 5 m tall and had a total span of 8 @.@ 5 m across its solar arrays . The power made available to the scientific instruments was approximately 400 W.

 The spacecraft was launched on 1 December 1989 aboard a Proton rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakh SSR . It was placed in a highly eccentric 98 @-@ hour orbit with an initial apogee / perigee of 202 @,@ 480 km / 1 @,@ 760 km respectively and an inclination of 51 @.@ 9 degrees . This meant that solar and lunar perturbations would significantly increase the orbits inclination while reducing its eccentricity , such that the orbit had become near @-@ circular by the time Granat completed its directed observations in September 1994 . ( By 1991 , the perigee had increased to 20 @,@ 000 km ; by September 1994 , the apogee / perigee was 59 @,@ 025 km / 144 @,@ 550 km at an inclination of 86 @.@ 7 degrees . )

 The PHEBUS experiment was designed by CESR ( Toulouse ) to record high energy transient events in the range 100 keV to 100 MeV . It consisted of two independent detectors and their associated electronics . Each detector consisted of a bismuth germanate ( BGO ) crystal 78 mm in diameter by 120 mm thick , surrounded by a plastic anti @-@ coincidence jacket . The two detectors were arranged on the spacecraft so as to observe 4π <unk> . The burst mode was triggered when the count rate in the 0 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 5 MeV energy range exceeded the background level by 8 sigma in either 0 @.@ 25 or 1 @.@ 0 seconds . There were 116 energy channels .

 Starting in January 1990 , four WATCH instruments , designed by the Danish Space Research Institute , were in operation on the Granat observatory . The instruments could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180 keV range to within 0 @.@ 5 ° using a Rotation Modulation <unk> . Taken together , the instruments ' three fields of view covered approximately 75 % of the sky . The energy resolution was 30 % <unk> at 60 keV . During quiet periods , count rates in two energy bands ( 6 to 15 and 15 to 180 keV ) were accumulated for 4 , 8 , or 16 seconds , depending on onboard computer memory availability . During a burst or transient event , count rates were accumulated with a time resolution of 1 second per 36 energy channels .

 The KONUS @-@ B instrument , designed by the Ioffe Physico @-@ Technical Institute in St. Petersburg , consisted of seven detectors distributed around the spacecraft that responded to photons of 10 keV to 8 MeV energy . They consisted of NaI ( Tl ) scintillator crystals 200 mm in diameter by 50 mm thick behind a Be entrance window . The side surfaces were protected by a 5 mm thick lead layer . The burst detection threshold was 500 to 50 <unk> per square meter ( 5 × 10 @-@ 7 to 5 × 10 @-@ 8 erg / cm ² ) , depending on the burst spectrum and rise time . Spectra were taken in two 31 @-@ channel pulse height analyzers ( <unk> ) , of which the first eight were measured with 1 / 16 s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the count rate . The range of resolutions covered 0 @.@ 25 to 8 s . 
 The KONUS @-@ B instrument operated from 11 December 1989 until 20 February 1990 . Over that period , the " on " time for the experiment was 27 days . Some 60 solar flares and 19 cosmic gamma @-@ ray bursts were detected .

 Over the initial four years of directed observations , Granat observed many galactic and extra @-@ galactic X @-@ ray sources with emphasis on the deep imaging and spectroscopy of the galactic center , broad @-@ band observations of black hole candidates , and X @-@ ray novae . After 1994 , the observatory was switched to survey mode and carried out a sensitive all @-@ sky survey in the 40 to 200 keV energy band . 
 Some of the highlights included : 
 A very deep imaging ( more than 5 million seconds duration ) of the galactic center region . 
 Discovery of electron @-@ positron annihilation lines from the galactic microquasar <unk> @-@ 294 and the X @-@ ray Nova Muscae .

 Across eight years of observations , Granat discovered some twenty new X @-@ ray sources , i.e. candidate black holes and neutron stars . Consequently , their designations begin with " GRS " meaning " <unk> source " . Examples are GRS 1915 + 105 ( the first microquasar discovered in our galaxy ) and GRS 1124 @-@ 683 . 
 = = Impact of the dissolution of the Soviet Union = = 
 After the end of the Soviet Union , two problems arose for the project . The first was geopolitical in nature : the main spacecraft control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region . This control center was significant in the Soviet space program , being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70 m dish antenna . With the breakup of the Union , the Crimea region , although mostly populated by ethnic Russians , found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control , prompting new political hurdles . 
 The main and most urgent problem , however , was in finding funds to support the continued operation of the spacecraft amid the spending crunch in post @-@ Soviet Russia . The French space agency , having already contributed significantly to the project ( both scientifically and financially ) , took upon itself to fund the continuing operations directly .

 Route 56 is a state highway in the southern part of New Jersey , United States . Also known as Landis Avenue , it runs 9 @.@ 19 mi ( 14 @.@ 79 km ) from an intersection with Route 77 and County Route 622 in Upper Deerfield Township , Cumberland County , to an intersection with Route 47 ( Delsea Drive ) in Vineland , Cumberland County . The route serves as a connector between Bridgeton and Vineland . West of the interchange with Route 55 in Vineland , Route 56 is a two @-@ lane undivided road that passes through rural areas of Cumberland County , also entering a corner of Salem County . East of Route 55 , the route is a four @-@ lane locally maintained road that runs through commercial areas of Vineland . 
 The portion of current Route 56 in Vineland was built as a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) wide road when Vineland was planned in the 1860s , serving as the main east – west road through the community . In the past , the Route 56 number was used twice for a never @-@ built road between the Laurelton Circle and Mantoloking in Ocean County legislated in 1938 and for the portion of U.S. Route 30 between current Route 157 and Atlantic City between 1938 and 1953 . The current iteration of Route 56 was legislated in 1977 to run from Route 77 north of Bridgeton to Route 47 in Vineland , replacing County Route 22 between Route 77 and the Salem County border , County Route 6 within Salem County , and County Route 23 between the Salem County border and Route 47 . This portion of road was designated as Route 56 by the 1990s . In 2007 , two bridges along the route were replaced . The Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township was rebuilt after it was washed out by the April 2007 Nor 'easter while the Maurice River bridge was reconstructed to make it wider and higher .

 = Cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics = 
 A cricket tournament , played as part of the 1900 Summer Olympics , took place on 19 – 20 August at the Vélodrome de Vincennes . The only match of the tournament was played between teams representing Great Britain and France , and was won by 158 runs by Great Britain . 
 Originally , teams representing Belgium , France , Great Britain , and the Netherlands were scheduled to compete in the tournament . Belgium and the Netherlands pulled out of the competition , leaving Great Britain to play France . Neither team was nationally selected . The British side was a touring club , the Devon and Somerset Wanderers ( alias Devon County Wanderers ) , while the French team , the French Athletic Club Union , comprised mainly British expatriates living in Paris . 
 The two @-@ day game commenced on 19 August 1900 . Great Britain batted first and scored 117 , and bowled France out for 78 . Great Britain then scored 145 for 5 in their second innings , setting the hosts a target of 185 . The tourists bowled out France for 26 to win the match by 158 runs , a significant margin , but with only five minutes of the match remaining . The Great Britain team was awarded silver medals and the French team bronze medals , together with miniature statues of the Eiffel Tower . The match was formally recognised as being an Olympic contest in 1912 , and the medals were later reassigned as gold and silver .

 Cricket had been scheduled as an event at the first modern Olympics , the 1896 Summer Olympics , being listed in the original programme for the Athens Games . Due to an insufficient number of entries , the event was cancelled . Four years later , at the Paris Games , there was also a shortage of entries . Belgium and the Netherlands , who for a time had been considered as possibilities to co @-@ host the Olympics with France , withdrew from the cricket tournament when their co @-@ hosting bids fell through . Their withdrawal left only Great Britain and the host nation , France . 
 The slightly haphazard nature of the cricket tournament was mirrored throughout the rest of the 1900 Olympics . Events took place throughout a six @-@ month period from May through until October , and like the Games themselves , were often considered part of the Exposition Universelle , a world 's fair held in Paris from 15 April until 12 November 1900 . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 Neither side was nationally selected , nor representative . Great Britain , or England as they were called in the advertising handbills , were represented by a touring club side , the Devon and Somerset Wanderers . The side , formed by William Donne in 1894 for a tour of the Isle of Wight , had completed five other tours before travelling to France . The Wanderers were primarily formed from players of Castle Cary Cricket Club , five of whom played in the match , and also included four former pupils of Blundell 's School , a public school in Devon . The side was completed by a number of players from the surrounding areas who were able to get away from business and personal commitments for the two @-@ week period of the tour . Writing in the Journal of Olympic History , Ian Buchanan describes that both sides " were made up of distinctly average club cricketers " . Only two members of the Wanderers side , and none of the French side , played first @-@ class cricket . Montagu Toller played six times for Somerset County Cricket Club , all in 1897 , while Alfred Bowerman played for Somerset once in 1900 , and again in 1905 . 
 The French side was officially drawn from all the member clubs of the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques . Few of these clubs actually sported cricket teams , and so the eventual side was selected from just two clubs : the Union Club and the Standard Athletic Club . Both sides had strong English influences , and the majority of the team that competed for France in the Olympic match were British expatriates . The Standard Athletic Club had been formed ten years earlier by English workers who had moved to the country to help build the Eiffel Tower .

 The match had been intended to be a standard eleven @-@ a @-@ side contest , but by mutual agreement from the captains this was increased to twelve @-@ a @-@ side , a move which the scorecard printers had not expected , resulting in the extra name having to be added by hand . Play commenced at 11 : 00AM on Sunday , 19 August with the touring Wanderers batting first . They were bowled out for 117 , with only four members of the team reaching double figures . Frederick Cuming , one of the four Old <unk> , top @-@ scored for the side with 38 , followed by their captain , and Exeter Cricket Club opening batsman , C. B. K. <unk> with 23 . The French were then bowled out for 78 , the bowling led by Frederick Christian who claimed seven wickets . Play closed at 5 : 00PM after both sides had completed their first innings , and the Wanderers had a lead of 39 runs . The Wanderers batting improved the following morning , and they added 145 runs for the second innings , declaring their innings closed with five wickets down . <unk> was again successful , reaching a half @-@ century , a feat also achieved by Bowerman , who top @-@ scored with 59 runs . The French required 185 runs to win , but lost their first ten wickets for eleven runs . At this point they attempted to play out time , which would have meant the match was drawn . They succeeded for a time , and the match was just five minutes from the end when their eleventh , and final , wicket fell , granting the Wanderers a 158 @-@ run victory . Toller was the pick of the Wanderers bowlers in the second innings , claiming seven wickets and conceding nine runs . 
 After the match , the English side were awarded Silver medals , and the French side were given Bronze medals , and both teams were also given miniature statues of the Eiffel Tower . The match was not covered in any national newspapers in England or France , although some of the local Devon and West Country newspapers did publish reports .

 The Devon and Somerset Wanderers played two further matches during their tour of France , both one @-@ day contests , and won them both . They were not impressed by the French , whom a journalist at the time described as " too excitable to enjoy the game " . 
 Neither of the teams realised that they had competed in the Olympic Games , with the match advertised as part of the world 's fair . The event was retrospectively recognised as an Olympic contest by the International Olympic Committee in 1912 , and the medals won by the teams were upgraded to Gold for Great Britain and Silver for France . The scheduled competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics , held in St Louis , was cancelled at short notice due to a lack of facilities , and the sport has not been included in the Olympic Games since .

 = Midshipman = 
 A midshipman is an officer cadet or a commissioned officer candidate of the junior @-@ most rank , in the Royal Navy , United States Navy , and many Commonwealth navies . Commonwealth countries which use the rank include Australia , Bangladesh , Namibia , New Zealand , South Africa , India , Pakistan , Singapore , Sri Lanka , and Kenya . 
 In the 17th century , a midshipman was a rating for an experienced seaman , and the word derives from the area aboard a ship , amidships , either where the original rating worked on the ship , or where he was berthed . Beginning in the 18th century , a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman , and the seaman rating began to slowly die out . By the Napoleonic era ( 1793 – 1815 ) , a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served at least three years as a volunteer , officer 's servant or able seaman , and was roughly equivalent to a present @-@ day petty officer in rank and responsibilities . After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master 's mate , he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant . Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic , and many midshipmen took positions as master 's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship . Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipman in the Royal Navy , although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy , a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912 . 
 During the 19th century , changes in the training of naval officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a naval college . Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a naval college . Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years at sea prior to promotion to commissioned officer rank . Between the mid @-@ 19th and mid @-@ 20th centuries , time at sea declined to less than a year as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18 . 
 Ranks equivalent to midshipman exist in many other navies . Using US midshipman or pre @-@ fleet board UK midshipman as the basis for comparison , the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior commissioned officer . Using post @-@ fleet board UK midshipman for comparison , the rank would be the most junior commissioned officer in the rank structure , and similar to a US ensign in role and responsibility . In many Romance languages , the literal translation of the local term for " midshipman " into English is " Navy Guard " , including the French garde marine , Spanish guardia marina , Portuguese guarda @-@ marinha , and Italian guardiamarina . Today , these ranks all refer to naval cadets , but historically they were selected by the monarchy , and were trained mostly on land as soldiers .

 = = = = = Origins = = = = = 
 The rank of midshipman originated during the Tudor and Stuart eras , and originally referred to a post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands , who worked in between the main and mizzen masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman , but was not a military officer or an officer in training . The first published use of the term midshipman was in 1662 . The word derives from an area aboard a ship , amidships , but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship , or the location where midshipmen were berthed . 
 By the 18th century , four types of midshipman existed : midshipman ( original rating ) , midshipman extraordinary , midshipman ( apprentice officer ) , and midshipman ordinary . Some midshipmen were older men , and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion , some members of the original rating served , as late as 1822 , alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission . By 1794 , all midshipmen were considered officer candidates , and the original rating was phased out . 
 = = = = = Entry = = = = = 
 Beginning in 1661 , boys who aspired to become officers were sent by their families to serve on ships with a " letter of service " from the crown , and were paid at the same rate as midshipmen . The letter instructed the admirals and captains that the bearer was to be shown " such kindness as you shall judge fit for a gentleman , both in accommodating him in your ship and in furthering his improvement " . Their official rating was volunteer @-@ per @-@ order , but they were often known as King 's letter boys , to distinguish their higher social class from the original midshipman rating . 
 Beginning in 1677 , Royal Navy regulations for promotion to lieutenant required service as a midshipman , and promotion to midshipman required some time at sea . By the Napoleonic era , the regulations required at least three years of services as a midshipman or master 's mate and six years of total sea time . Sea time was earned in various ways , most boys served this period at sea in any lower rating , either as a servant of one of the ship 's officers , a volunteer , or a seaman . 
 By the 1730s , the rating volunteer @-@ per @-@ order was phased out and replaced with a system where prospective midshipmen served as servants for officers . For example , a captain was allowed four servants for every 100 men aboard his ship ; many of these servants were young men destined to become officers . 
 In 1729 , the Royal Naval Academy in Portsmouth – renamed the Royal Naval College in 1806 – was founded , for 40 students aged between 13 and 16 , who would take three years to complete a course of study defined in an illustrated book , and would earn two years of sea time as part of their studies . The rating of midshipman @-@ by @-@ order , or midshipman ordinary , was used specifically for graduates of the Royal Naval College , to distinguish them from midshipmen who had served aboard ship , who were paid more . The school was unpopular in the Navy , because officers enjoyed the privilege of having servants and preferred the traditional method of training officers via apprenticeship . 
 In 1794 , officers ' servants were abolished and a new class of volunteers called ' volunteer class I ' was created for boys between the ages of 11 and 13 who were considered future midshipmen and lived in the gunroom on a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line or with the midshipmen on a frigate or smaller vessel . Volunteers were paid £ 6 per year . By 1816 , the rating of midshipman ordinary was phased out , and all apprentice officers were rated as midshipmen . 
 = = = = = Social background and uniform = = = = = 
 In the 18th century Royal Navy , rank and position on board ship was defined by a mix of two hierarchies , an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social divide between gentlemen and non @-@ gentlemen . Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors . Generally , aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the fo <unk> , while officers were quartered at the stern . Occasionally , a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit . 
 Approximately 50 percent of midshipmen were the sons of professional men , which included the sons of naval officers , and there were notable sailing families throughout the Age of Sail , such as the Saumarez , Hood , and Parker families . The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers . Members of the peerage and landed gentry formed the next largest group , about 27 percent of officers . The numbers were smaller , but similarly , their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion , and they had a considerable influence on the Royal Navy . A notable member of this group was Prince William , later William IV , who served as a midshipman from 1780 – 1785 . The rest were from commercial or working class backgrounds , and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors , their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim . 
 Since most midshipmen were from the gentry or had family connections with sailing ships , many used their connections to have their names placed on a ship 's books . The practice , known colloquially as " false muster " was common even though it was technically illegal and frowned upon . This allowed some boys to be promoted to midshipmen , or in some cases lieutenant , without having completed the required amount of time at sea . A notable example was Thomas Cochrane , whose uncle had him entered at the age of five ; his name was carried on various ships until he was 18 and received his commission . 
 When uniforms were introduced in the Navy in 1748 , midshipmen started wearing the same uniform as commissioned officers . They also began wearing their traditional badge of rank , a white patch of cloth with a gold button and a twist of white cord on each side of the coat collar . The uniform emphasized that midshipmen were gentlemen and officers under instruction . 
 = = = = = Duties and promotion = = = = = 
 Midshipmen were expected to work on the ship , but were also expected to learn navigation and seamanship . They were expected to have learned already , as able seamen and volunteers , to rig sails , other duties included keeping watch , relaying messages between decks , supervising gun batteries , commanding small boats , and taking command of a sub @-@ division of the ship 's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants . On smaller ships , midshipmen were instructed by a senior master 's mate , often a passed midshipman , who taught them mathematics , navigation , and sailing lore . Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster , who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain . Midshipmen were expected to keep detailed navigational logs , which were shown to the captain to assess their progress . 
 Prior to promotion to lieutenant , a commissioned officer candidate in the Royal Navy had to pass a formal examination . Officially , a prospective lieutenant was at least 19 , and was expected to produce proof of his service , which would include certificates from his commanders and journals kept while a midshipman . However , most midshipmen aspired to take the lieutenant examination at age 17 or 18 , and the typical age of a midshipman was between 15 and 22 . The candidate was summoned before a board of three captains and questioned about seamanship , navigation , and discipline . The board would ask questions such as : 
 An enemy is observed ; give orders for clearing your ship , and make all the necessary preparations for engaging . 
 Like the board , which might be an ad hoc affair , the actual exam questions were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains . In seamanship , the candidate was expected to be able to splice ropes , reef a sail , work a ship in sailing and shift his tides . In navigation , he was expected to be able to keep a reckoning of the ship 's way by plane sailing , to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship , and to understand the variation of the compass . He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman . 
 Failure usually meant six more months of sea service before the examination could again be attempted . Some men never passed it . Successful completion made the midshipman a ' passed midshipman ' . From the 18th century until the second half of the 19th century , a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant 's examination did not automatically receive a commission . Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first , while others would wait their turn on a roster . During wartime , when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle , most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two , but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission . 
 Passed midshipmen awaiting promotion often elected to become master 's mates , a high @-@ ranking petty officer who assisted the master with his duties , served on watch as deputy to the lieutenants , and commanded small boats . A midshipman who became master 's mate earned an increase in pay from £ 2 5s to £ 3 16s per month but initially reduced his chances at a commission because master 's mates , along with masters , were assumed to have a working @-@ class background . Over time , however , appointment to master 's mate became considered a normal part of the path to a commission ; the situation caused some confusion during the last part of the 18th century , when two parallel roles – master 's mates trying to become masters , and former midshipmen working toward a commission – held the same title and responsibilities aboard ship . 
 By the first years of the 19th century , the term ' mate ' , without the prefix master 's , was used for passed midshipmen , to distinguish them from master 's mates who had not served as midshipmen . In 1824 , the rating of master 's assistant replaced master 's mate , and mate continued to be used unofficially by passed midshipmen . These changes helped eliminate the confusion caused by the mingling of midshipmen in the navigator 's branch . In 1838 a Royal Commission , presided over by the Duke of Wellington , recommended the institution of the rank of mate as an official step between midshipman and lieutenant . In 1861 mate was abolished in favor of sub @-@ lieutenant .

 When Congress created the United States Navy in 1794 , midshipman was listed as a rank of warrant officer in the Naval Act of 1794 , and they were appointed by the President of the United States . Midshipmen had similar duties and responsibilities as in the Royal Navy , and were typically young men between the age of 14 and 22 in training to become a naval officer . " Passed midshipman " was first used in 1819 , and was an official rank of the US Navy . 
 During the long period of peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few opportunities for promotion , and their warrants were often obtained via patronage . The poor quality of officer training in the US Navy became visible after the Somers Affair , an alleged mutiny aboard the training ship USS Somers in 1842 , and the subsequent execution of midshipman Philip Spencer . Spencer had gained his post aboard the Somers via the influence of his father , United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer .

 The original Royal Naval College closed in 1837 , after which the only method for training midshipmen in the Royal Navy was aboard ships . In 1844 the rank of naval cadet was created , and to qualify as a midshipman a candidate had to be 14 years old , successfully pass an admiralty examination and have two years of service as a naval cadet or three years of service in the Navy . A decline in qualified officers prompted the Navy to order training in a ship at anchor for all cadets , which began in 1857 aboard HMS Illustrious , which was replaced by HMS Britannia in 1859 . Britannia was moved to Portland in 1862 , and to the present location of the Britannia Royal Naval College , Dartmouth in 1863 . 
 Beginning in the 1840s , the normal entry age for executive officer cadets , those destined to command ships and fleets , was between 12 and 13 , and instruction consisted of two years of classroom training , during which time trainees were rated as naval cadets . Cadets who received a first @-@ class passing grade in studies , seamanship and conduct on their final examination could receive a credit for up to a year of sea time , and could be rated as midshipmen immediately after passing out of the college . After passing out of the college , cadets served aboard a special training vessel for one year . Cadets were then rated as midshipmen , and served aboard the fleet another two years . Midshipmen lived in the gunroom , kept watches , and ran the ship 's boats . They received instruction in navigation every day . After five total years of training and having reached the age of 19 , the midshipmen were eligible to take the examination for lieutenant . After passing the examination for lieutenant , midshipmen were commissioned as sub @-@ lieutenants , and were transferred to the Royal Naval College , Greenwich , which opened in 1873 as the ' University of the Navy ' . 
 Beginning in 1903 , officer training of military and engineering students was reformed by the Selborne @-@ Fisher scheme , and engineering and executive officer candidates began to enter the Navy in the same way , which was termed ' Common Entry ' . Previously , engineer cadets had been trained separately at the Royal Naval Engineering College , Keyham which was closed in 1910 . In 1903 a new preparatory school was opened at Royal Naval College , Osborne , which was Queen Victoria 's favorite residence but was not a favorite of her successor Edward VII who had donated it to the nation in 1902 . Training initially consisted of two years at Osborne and two years at Dartmouth as cadets , later four years at Dartmouth , followed by approximately 3 years of sea duty as midshipmen prior to promotion to sub @-@ lieutenant . In 1905 , a new building was completed on shore to replace Britannia , which was named Britannia Royal Naval College . In 1913 , increasing demand for officers led to recruitment of 18 @-@ year @-@ old graduates of public schools , which was called ' Special Entry ' , and was conducted separately from Selborne scheme cadets . Special entry cadets trained for approximately 6 months prior to service in the fleet as midshipmen . When World War I began in 1914 , all the cadets at Dartmouth were quickly mobilized as midshipmen in the Reserve Fleet . During the war , two midshipmen , George Drewry and Wilfred Malleson were awarded the Victoria Cross , the highest award of the British Commonwealth for gallantry , during the Landing at Cape Helles . After World War I ended , opposition to the Selborne @-@ Fisher scheme led to re @-@ segregating executive and engineering officers into separate branches , while common entry and special entry were maintained .
