 Typhoon Neoguri underwent an eyewall replacement cycle around the time it reached peak intensity ; the inner eyewall collapsed , and the outer eyewall contracted to a diameter of 65 km ( 40 mi ) . Upon attaining peak winds , the typhoon had turned northward , and the China Meteorological Administration assessed Neoguri as moving ashore along Hainan island near <unk> . However , other agencies assessed the typhoon as tracking parallel to the eastern coastline just offshore . Land interaction and wind shear weakened the typhoon , and by April 19 it had weakened to a tropical storm . Cooler waters contributed to further weakening , causing its convection to diminish significantly and for its circulation to become elongated . After turning to the north @-@ northeast , Neoguri made landfall on Guangdong province in southern China , a short distance west of Macau as a weak tropical storm . Neoguri made landfall on China earlier than any other tropical cyclone on record , about two weeks prior to the previous record set by Typhoon Wanda in 1971 . Shortly after moving ashore , the JTWC issued its final warning as the cyclone began dissipating .

 As Ambo ( Neoguri ) passed directly through many parts Visayas and Mindanao , PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signals for these areas . Signal number one was issued for southern Negros , Siquijor and Camiguin . This storm signal was later scaled back up until the storm reached Palawan and the South China Sea . 
 As a tropical depression , Neoguri ( Ambo ) brought heavy rainfall to many portions of the Philippines , including even Metro Manila . In Cebu City , the precipitation caused flooding , which forced 62 people to evacuate their houses . In the Camotes Islands , rough waves capsized a motorboat with six passengers ; five were rescued , with the other reported missing . But the storm at least alleviated for a few days the heat that has been experienced over Luzon from the past weeks . However , the storm did not stop the <unk> Pambansa ( National Games in the Philippines ) which was held in Puerto Princesa City in Palawan , one of the areas said by PAGASA to see stormy weather . 
 In preparation for the storm , about 21 @,@ 800 fishing boats in the Chinese province of Hainan returned to port , and about 120 @,@ 000 people evacuated from fish farms and low @-@ lying areas on the island . Officials halted ferry service between Hainan and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong province . Offshore , 56 fishermen rode out the storm in a shelter on the Paracel Islands ; 38 people were rescued shortly after the storm , and initially eighteen people were reported missing . The eighteen missing fishermen were found thirty hours after Neoguri struck . The ship they were on had sunk , and the crew clung to debris and made makeshift rafts to survive in the waters . However , another 18 Chinese fisherman and 22 Vietnamese fisherman remain missing . On Hainan island , the storm left the city of <unk> without power . 
 Along the mainland , ferry service was temporarily stopped between Hong Kong and Macau . At the Hong Kong International Airport , over 200 flights were delayed due to the threat of the storm ; additionally , around 30 were canceled , and 66 others were deviated elsewhere . The Hong Kong Observatory issued a standby warning signal on April 17 , which was the second earliest standby signal on record . One day later , the No. 3 strong wind signal was issued , the earliest in record . As it moved ashore , the storm brought heavy rainfall , with one station reporting 237 mm ( 9 @.@ 35 in ) in one day . Strong winds downed coconut and banana trees , with agricultural damage totaling over ¥ 200 million ( 2008 RMB , $ 28 million 2008 USD ) . Structural damage amounted to ¥ 96 million ( 2008 RMB , $ 14 million 2008 USD ) . Three fatalities were confirmed in China , two due to a road being covered in a mud flow , and another due to winds blowing a sheet of aluminum into a person , throwing them off the roof of a stadium . 
 = Typhoon Chanchu = 
 Typhoon Chanchu , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Caloy , was the most intense typhoon in the South China Sea in the month of May according to the Hong Kong Observatory ( HKO ) . The first named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season , Chanchu formed on May 8 in the vicinity of the Federated States of Micronesia and progressed westward . It gradually intensified into a tropical storm and later severe tropical storm before moving through the Philippines . On May 13 , Chanchu entered the South China Sea and became a typhoon , according to the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) . Warm waters and favorable outflow allowed the storm to quickly intensify to peak maximum sustained winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) on May 15 . Around that time , the typhoon turned sharply to the north toward southeastern China . Chanchu weakened as it curved to the northeast , making landfall near Shantou , Guangdong on May 17 as a severe tropical storm . The government of China considered Chanchu the earliest typhoon to make landfall in the province . On the next day , the storm emerged into the East China Sea , becoming extratropical on May 19 before dissipating west of Kyushu . 
 Early in its duration , Chanchu moved through the Philippines , causing power outages and landslides in several islands . Despite a general warning against small boats sailing , a ferry departed Masbate and capsized due to the storm , killing 28 people . Throughout the country , 41 people died , and damage reached ₱ 117 @.@ 57 million ( PHP , $ 2 @.@ 15 million USD ) . While in the South China Sea , Chanchu caught many Vietnamese fisherman off guard , causing 17 ships to sink and damaging several others . Chinese ships assisted in the search @-@ and @-@ rescue mission , ultimately rescuing 330 fishermen from 22 boats ; however , 21 bodies were found , and the remaining 220 missing were presumed killed . In southern China , flooding and strong winds from Chanchu wrecked about 14 @,@ 000 houses and damaged over 190 @,@ 000 ha ( 470 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields . Damage was heaviest in Shantou where it moved ashore , with flooding covering roads and entering hundreds of homes . Damage in China totaled ¥ 7 billion yuan ( RMB , $ 872 million USD ) , and there were 23 deaths . Rains from the typhoon killed two people in Taiwan after sweeping them up in a river , and crop damage there reached NT $ 158 @.@ 88 million ( NTD , $ 5 million USD ) . Later , high waves killed one person in Okinawa and left another person missing , while rains extended into South Korea .

 An area of convection , or thunderstorms , persisted on May 5 southeast of Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia ( FSM ) . Initially it remained disorganized while tracking to the west , although a circulation became more distinct on May 7 , indicative of gradual organization . At 06 : 00 UTC on May 8 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) declared that a tropical depression had developed about 175 km ( 110 mi ) northeast of Palau . Five hours later , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert , and at 18 : 00 UTC they classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W . The system moved to the west @-@ southwest , influenced by the subtropical ridge to the north . Early on May 9 , the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status , and at 12 : 00 UTC the JMA followed suit by upgrading the system to Tropical Storm Chanchu . Also on that day , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) began issuing warnings on the storm as Tropical Storm Caloy . 
 In its formative stages , Chanchu was located in an environment generally favorable for intensification . Its tracked shifted more to the west @-@ northwest due to a building ridge to the south . Late on May 10 , the JTWC upgraded Chanchu to typhoon status , estimating 1 minute sustained winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . By contrast , the JMA estimated it intensified only into a severe tropical storm with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Turning more to the west , Chanchu made landfall on Samar in the eastern Philippines on May 11 . Despite moving through the archipelago , Chanchu intensified slightly within the Sibuyan Sea , striking Mindoro on May 12 with 1 minute winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , according to the JTWC . On May 13 , Chanchu emerged into the South China Sea , and later that day the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status . 
 Upon reaching the South China Sea , Chanchu encountered an area of warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear . After an upper @-@ level low to the east provided favorable outflow to the south and the east , Chanchu rapidly intensified on May 14 . While the storm was active , the JTWC upgraded Chanchu to a super typhoon with peak 1 minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , although the agency later downgraded the peak winds to 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . By contrast , the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) at 00 : 00 UTC on May 15 . According to the Hong Kong Observatory , the 10 minute winds reached 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , which made Chanchu the strongest typhoon in the South China Sea in the month of May . 
 By the time Chanchu attained peak winds , an eastward @-@ moving trough over China broke up the ridge to the north , causing the typhoon to turn sharply to the north into a less favorable environment . With decreased outflow and stronger wind shear , Chanchu began slowly weakening . The eye initially remained small , but the outer eyewall deteriorated on May 16 as the convection decreased in the northern periphery . The trough that previously weakened the ridge steered Chanchu to the north @-@ northeast and forced an extratropical transition . Late on May 17 , the JMA downgraded the typhoon to a severe tropical storm . Around that time , Chanchu made landfall near Shantou , Guangdong in southeastern China , about 315 km ( 195 mi ) east of Hong Kong ; the JTWC estimated landfall winds of 130 km / h ( 85 mph ) , while the JMA estimated them at 110 km / h ( 70 km / h ) . Early on May 18 , the JTWC discontinued advisories , although the JMA continued tracking Chanchu over southeastern China through eastern Fujian province . Later on May 18 , the storm emerged into the East China Sea , becoming fully extratropical at 00 : 00 UTC on May 19 . The remnants continued toward Japan before dissipating at 18 : 00 UTC that day off the west coast of Kyushu in southern Japan .

 Officials in southern Leyte recommended that residents evacuate to prevent a repeat of a deadly landslide in February 2006 . Officials canceled several flights and ferry lines , stranding 10 @,@ 000 people . In all , 2 @,@ 144 people evacuated in the Philippines . PAGASA issued a storm signal number 2 for several provinces along Chanchu 's path , as well as storm signal number 1 for other areas , largely forecasting for rainfall and gusty winds . 
 Vietnamese fishermen in the South China Sea received 24 hours of warning from the National <unk> Forecast Center before Chanchu approached the area , less time than other agencies in the region . At one point , Chanchu was forecast to become a strong typhoon and make landfall near Hong Kong . In response to the threat , officials at the Hong Kong Observatory , as well as in Macau , issued a standby signal to inform the public of the approaching typhoon . The HKO issued a warning signal number 3 on May 17 . In the territory , 60 flights were canceled with another 14 delayed , beaches were closed , and ferry service was disrupted . Ahead of the storm , about 1 million people evacuated from coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces to government warehouses , schools , tents , or the houses of relatives . In the former province , 62 @,@ 000 fishermen were ordered to return to port , while four flights were canceled at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport . Residents were advised to remain indoors , and workers reinforced billboards in anticipation of the strong winds . Rail and boat transport was stopped between Guangdong and Hainan across the Qiongzhou Strait due to the typhoon . Schools were closed in Guangdong during the storm 's passage , although they remained open in Fujian . In Shanghai , the speed limit of Donghai Bridge was halved because of strong winds . 
 Ahead of the storm , the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan issued land and sea warnings . The Tainan city government and three county governments closed for one day . All domestic flights to offshore islands were canceled , and rail service was interrupted . Later , airlines canceled 12 flights in Japan due to the storm .

 While moving through the Philippines , Chanchu affected several islands with strong winds and heavy rainfall . In Legazpi , Albay , strong waves wrecked 100 homes and left 1 @,@ 500 people homeless . High winds left widespread power outages , particularly in Mindoro , Batangas , and across the Bicol Region . The storm severely damaged the banana industry and affected various other fruit crops . Near Metro Manila , the winds damaged billboards , knocked over trees , and caused isolated power outages . Rough seas sank a ferry off Masbate , despite a warning against the operation of small craft , having left at sunrise to avoid the police . The Coast Guard rescued 18 passengers , but 28 people died in the wreck . An empty ferry sank at port in <unk> . A ferry with 700 people aboard went missing , but the Coast Guard found it washed ashore with everyone safe on board . Similarly , an oil tanker washed ashore at Pinamalayan , Oriental Mindoro , and its crew of 13 was rescued . Throughout the country , Chanchu killed 41 people , mostly from the <unk> ferry wreck . The storm damaged 5 @,@ 630 homes , and destroyed 1 @,@ 013 others , forcing 53 @,@ 307 people to leave their homes . Agricultural losses totaled ₱ 71 @.@ 57 million ( PHP , $ 1 @.@ 3 million USD ) , chiefly to the corn harvest , with an additional ₱ 46 million ( PHP , $ 850 @,@ 000 USD ) in infrastructure damage . 
 While stalled over the South China Sea , Chanchu 's large circulation caused an increase in rainfall over Malaysia . The typhoon brought the onset of the summer monsoon in the South China Sea after shifting the prevailing winds over the region .

 While moving slowly through the South China Sea , Chanchu produced strong waves that struck the east coast of Vietnam . The associated flooding washed away many shrimp from coastal ponds and also entered Thu <unk> River , thus preventing its use as a source for irrigation for about 1 @,@ 000 ha ( 2 @,@ 500 acres ) of rice paddy fields . Due to its unexpected change in course and ferocity , Chanchu caught dozens of ships off guard and damaged communications , sinking 17 ships and damaging several others . Initially , there were 400 fishermen missing , although there was conflicting information with regard to the number of ships and people affected , particularly with ships near Hainan or Taiwan . Following a request from the Vietnamese government , the Chinese government deployed rescue ships on May 19 , a day after the storm made its final landfall . Offshore Quảng Ngãi Province , 94 fishermen sought refuge on a Chinese island , and 22 boats were found in the Dongsha Islands offshore China . One Chinese ship rescued 97 fishermen , but also found 18 people killed . Chinese ships ultimately rescued 330 fishermen from 22 boats and provided them with food and water ; this was the country 's largest oceanic rescue at the time . Two Vietnamese boats departed from Quảng Ngãi to assist crews on damaged boats attempting to return to port . Medical teams greeted the ships returning to harbor , while an altar was set up for the deceased . After two weeks , the government of Vietnam ended the search , with 21 bodies found , and the remaining 220 missing fishermen presumed killed .

 Typhoon Chanchu was the earliest on record to strike Guangdong at the time , having struck the country 44 days earlier than the average date for the first strike . Rainfall in the country spread across Guangdong , Fujian , Jiangxi , and Zhejiang , and Chanchu became the earliest typhoon to affect Shanghai in 80 years . Rainfall totaled over 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) in southeastern Guangdong and southwestern Fujian . In the former province , wind gusts peaked at 170 km / h ( 106 mph ) in <unk> . 
 Upon striking China , Chanchu produced deadly flooding and landslides along its path , with flooding spreading as far northeast as Zhejiang province . One landslide in Fujian killed eight people and wrecked two houses . In Guangdong and Fujian , Chanchu wrecked 14 @,@ 000 houses and damaged over 190 @,@ 000 hectares ( 470 @,@ 000 acres ) of crop fields . Damage was particularly heavy in Shantou , Guangdong , where Chanchu moved ashore . There were about 200 flooded houses , and many roads covered , after rivers flooded from the heavy rainfall . The storm also caused power outages in Shantou , and damage there totaled ¥ 2 @.@ 56 billion yuan ( RMB , $ 320 million USD ) . In nearby Xiamen , the typhoon forced 43 factories to temporarily close , resulting in a loss of ¥ 62 @.@ 2 million yuan ( RMB , $ 7 @.@ 8 million USD ) . The storm killed eight people in Guangdong , five of them due to traffic accidents , and a further 15 in Fujian . Overall damage was estimated at ¥ 7 billion yuan ( RMB , $ 872 million USD ) , roughly evenly split between Guangdong and Fujian . This was less than expected given the winds at landfall . 
 While passing east of Hong Kong , the outer rainbands of Chanchu dropped 43 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 71 in ) of rainfall at Sha Tin . Sustained winds in the territory reached 96 km / h ( 60 mph ) , while gusts reached 146 km / h ( 91 mph ) , both recorded at Tate 's Cairn . Chanchu produced a storm surge of 0 @.@ 77 m ( 2 @.@ 5 ft ) , causing minor flooding , sinking a yacht , and injuring one person who was swept into the sea . The storm downed several trees and damaged some scaffolding . Six people were injured in the territory , including three on a <unk> bound for Macau .

 High waves in Taiwan washed an oil tanker ashore in Kaohsiung City ; all 13 crew members were rescued with helicopters . In Kaohsiung County , the typhoon wrecked several dikes in coastal cities . Chanchu also produced heavy rainfall on the island , causing flooding and landslides , the latter of which covered a highway . Swollen rivers swept away three farmers in Hualien County , who were later rescued , and killed two sisters in Pingtung County underneath the <unk> Bridge . Crop damage totaled NT $ 158 @.@ 88 million ( NTD , $ 5 million USD ) . 
 In <unk> , Okinawa , high waves caused by Chanchu swept away three bathers . The Japan Coast Guard rescued one , another was killed , and the third remained missing as of May 23 . The remnants of Chanchu produced 121 mm ( 4 @.@ 8 in ) of rainfall in Gifu Prefecture in combination with a nearby cold front , causing one landslide . A fallen tree in Nagasaki Prefecture caused a small power outage , and nearby there was a damaged home . 
 The trough that engulfed Chanchu drew moisture from the typhoon , leading to heavy rainfall in portions of South Korea that reached 144 mm ( 5 @.@ 7 in ) on Jeju Island . Along with strong winds , the rains caused ferry and flight <unk> . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In the days after Chanchu moved through the Philippines , then @-@ President Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo ordered that the country 's National Disaster Coordinating Council help all towns affected by the storm . The agency helped coordinate search and rescue missions . Several areas were declared a state of calamity , mostly on Mindoro , Samar , and Batangas . The Tzu Chi Foundation visited islands in eastern Samar , providing money to the families whose houses were destroyed . Towns in the region also assisted by supplying thatch to rebuild homes . In Oriental Mindoro , the Philippine Red Cross provided food and relief items to families in Calapan . The Adventist Development and Relief Agency also provided building materials for 200 families in Mindoro . Ultimately , the government provided storm victims with ₱ 415 @.@ 1 million ( PHP , $ 7 @.@ 6 million USD ) worth of relief supplies . Rainfall from the storm caused a red tide in Taal Lake , after dispersing a <unk> bloom . 
 Immediate after Chanchu 's China landfall , officials began distributing tents , quilts , water purification tablets , and disinfectant . The government of Fujian set up a ¥ 8 @.@ 5 million yuan ( RMB , $ 1 @.@ 06 million ) relief fund . In the months after Chanchu , China suffered from several other damaging tropical cyclones , including Tropical Storm Bilis and Typhoon Saomai . Damage from Chanchu forced the China National Offshore Oil Corporation to shut down for a time , which contributed to an annual decrease in its oil output . The Chinese government recognized 50 people who assisted in the South China Sea search and rescue mission , and two vessels were declared " hero ships " . 
 Vietnamese president Trần Đức Lương expressed his thanks to the Chinese government on May 22 for rescuing the Vietnamese on the imperiled ships . Residents and industries in Vietnam raised ₫ 360 million ( VND , $ 36 @,@ 000 USD ) for the families of the deceased fishermen , as well as providing 1 ton of rice . Trade unions encouraged workers to donate one day 's salary to help storm victims . The Vietnamese embassy in India raised about $ 1 @,@ 000 ( USD ) and Vietnamese people living in Greece raised ₫ 26 million ( VND , € 1 @,@ 300 Euros ) for storm victims . Ultimately , 43 different organizations and people donated $ 29 @,@ 000 ( USD ) to the Vietnam Red Cross . The country 's Ministry of Labour , Invalids and Social Affairs presented an award to the Vietnam News Agency in June 2006 for its charitable donations , which included the distribution of ₫ 112 million ( VND , $ 11 @,@ 200 USD ) to storm victims . One fisherman claimed to survive for two weeks in the open seas before being rescued , although he later confessed that he was safely on another boat , and wanted his family to retain the disaster compensation ; after the man revealed that he had lied , his family was able to retain the relief funds due to their poverty . The head of the Vietnam Institute of Meteorology , Hydrology and Environment resigned two weeks after Chanchu killed many fishermen because of inadequate warnings . Then @-@ Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ordered a review of the meteorological agency as a result . Within a few years after the typhoon , the meteorological agency began issuing more accurate and timely forecasts . After the many deaths of fishermen from Chanchu , the Vietnam government prevented any fishermen from leaving harbor during the passage of Typhoon Durian in November . 
 After the season ended , members of the 39th meeting of the Typhoon Committee of the World Meteorological Organization met in Manila in December 2006 . They discussed retiring the name " Chanchu " , along with four other names from the season . During the 40th meeting in November 2007 , the Typhoon Committee approved the retirement , announcing that the name " <unk> " would replace Chanchu on the basin name lists beginning in 2008 .

 " Bad Reputation " is the seventeenth episode of the American television series , Glee . The episode premiered on the Fox network on May 4 , 2010 . It was directed by Elodie Keene , and written by series creator Ian Brennan . In " Bad Reputation " , cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) is publicly ridiculed when a video of her dancing to Olivia Newton @-@ John 's " Physical " is posted on YouTube . A salacious list about members of the glee club circulates the school , leading certain members to try to earn themselves a bad reputation . Newton @-@ John guest @-@ stars as herself in the episode , and Molly Shannon makes her first appearance in a recurring role . Following their romance in the episode " Mash @-@ Up " , club members Rachel ( Lea Michele ) and Puck ( Mark Salling ) are reunited , a decision made by the producers due to the unexpected popularity of the pairing . 
 The episode features cover versions of five songs , all of which were released as singles , available for digital download , and two of which are included on the soundtrack album Glee : The Music , Volume 3 – Showstoppers . " Bad Reputation " was watched by 11 @.@ 62 million American viewers and received mixed reviews from critics . Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly and Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle both considered it a return to form following disappointing episodes . Franich also praised the episode 's cover version of " Ice Ice Baby " by Vanilla Ice , which in contrast was criticized by Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times , with Kennedy deeming the performance his least favorite moment of the entire series thus far . 
 = = Plot = = 
 When Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) steals a video of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) performing Olivia Newton @-@ John 's " Physical " to a <unk> routine , the glee club members decide to post it on YouTube as a prank . The video becomes a viral hit and Sue is mortified . In retaliation , she gives Principal Figgins ( Iqbal Theba ) a list she has found , called a " <unk> " , which ranks the students in the glee club based on a scale of sexual promiscuity . Figgins tells club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) that he must either find the creator of the list , or he will be forced to disband the glee club and suspend all of its members . Will reprimands the club members , and for their weekly club assignment , he has the students find songs with bad reputations and rehabilitate them , performing Vanilla Ice 's " Ice Ice Baby " as an example . 
 Sue is laughed at by her co @-@ workers , who have seen the video , and is mocked by new alcoholic astronomy teacher and badminton coach Brenda Castle ( Molly Shannon ) . Sue is reminded by her sister , Jean ( Robin Trocki ) , who has Down Syndrome , that when they were hurt as children they would volunteer at an animal shelter as a reminder there was always someone less fortunate than themselves . In light of her sister 's advice , Sue decides to act as a therapist to guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) , informing her that Will has been unfaithful to her . Emma confronts Will in the teachers ' lounge , publicly shaming him . 
 Kurt , Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) , Artie ( Kevin McHale ) , and Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) are upset over not being included on the list , while Brittany ( Heather Morris ) is puzzled at not being listed among the top three , given that she has made out with everyone in the school : boys , girls , and the janitor . They perform a rendition of " U Can 't Touch This " in the school library to cause a disruption in the hope of earning a bad reputation , but their plan backfires when the librarian asks them to perform it at her church 's Sunday service . Next , Kurt confesses to Sue that he is the one who stole her video , expecting to be punished and also gain a more dangerous reputation . Instead , she thanks him , having recently been contacted by Olivia Newton @-@ John , who had seen Sue 's video and requested her help remaking the " Physical " video . The song 's re @-@ release gains Sue a position in the top 700 recording artists , which ends the ridicule of her colleagues . She donates her share of the profits to her sister 's residential care facility . 
 After apologizing to Emma and presenting her with flowers , Will sees a depressed @-@ looking Quinn ( Dianna Agron ) in the hallway and realizes that she is responsible for the list . He confronts Quinn , who confesses . To prevent her from being suspended , Will lies to Figgins that no culprit has been found , but convinces him that as no new lists have been posted , the matter should be dropped . 
 Rachel ( Lea Michele ) asks Puck ( Mark Salling ) to assist her in the glee club assignment , creating a video for David Geddes ' " Run Joey Run " . But she secretly also recruits her ex @-@ boyfriend Finn ( Cory Monteith ) and her current boyfriend Jesse St. James ( Jonathan Groff ) , triple @-@ casting them in the role of her film boyfriend , Joey , in a bid to improve her <unk> rating . When Rachel plays the video in class , all three are surprised , offended and angered by her deception . Jesse breaks up with Rachel as a result , and she sings Bonnie Tyler 's " Total Eclipse of the Heart " as the club members walk out of the classroom , leaving her behind .

 Recurring characters who appear in the episode are glee club members Brittany ( Heather Morris ) , Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) , Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) , Matt Rutherford ( Dijon Talton ) and Jesse St. James ( Jonathan Groff ) , former glee club director Sandy Ryerson ( Stephen Tobolowsky ) , football coach Ken Tanaka ( Patrick Gallagher ) and Sue 's sister Jean Sylvester ( Robin Trocki ) . Mary Jo Catlett appears as recently widowed teacher Mrs. Carlisle , and Molly Shannon makes her first appearance in a recurring role as new astronomy teacher and badminton coach Brenda Castle . Special guest star Olivia Newton @-@ John appears as herself , portraying the " dark side " of herself ; a " mixture of mean and diva " . She and Lynch produced an exact re @-@ creation of the original " Physical " video , filming of which took twelve hours . Series musical producer Adam Anders felt that Newton @-@ John 's appearance in the episode was organic , explaining : " The best part of Glee is introducing new music to an older generation and old music to a newer generation . There 's so much great music . We all listen to music in a vacuum , then we 're exposed to things and love it . Olivia Newton @-@ John is an example of that . It 's a perfect marriage between the songs that were chosen and the storyline . When that happens , it moves people . " 
 " Bad Reputation " shows the reunion of glee club members Rachel and Puck . The two first became involved in Glee 's eighth episode , " Mash @-@ Up " , but at the time , series creator Ryan Murphy did not expect the pairing to be well received by viewers . He believed that viewers would find Rachel " far too irritating " for Puck , and so was surprised by the positive fan response which emerged . Although Murphy described this response as " strange and bizarre " , explaining that he had believed fans would prefer for Rachel to be with Finn , as a result he planned to revisit their romance later in the first season . The first thirteen episodes had already been filmed by the time " Mash @-@ Up " aired , and so Murphy wrote a special episode to air after the mid @-@ season break , in which the characters could reunite in some way . Despite the popularity of the pairing — referred to by the portmanteau " <unk> " in the media — the series writers intend to retain Puck 's " bad boy " persona , and ultimately plan on pairing him with most of the female characters . 
 The episode features cover versions of five songs : " Ice Ice Baby " by Vanilla Ice , " U Can 't Touch This " by MC Hammer , Newton @-@ John 's " Physical " , " Run Joey Run " by David Geddes and " Total Eclipse of the Heart " by Bonnie Tyler . Each of the songs performed were released as singles , available for download .

He praised the decision not to " apply meaningless rules to their musical selections " , writing : " The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority , and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from feeling too forced . " Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively , describing it as : " pack [ ing ] more camp into an hour 's worth of television than most kids will get all summer . " Todd VanDerWerff of The A. V. Club graded " Bad Reputation " " B + " , writing that he : " enjoyed the episode quite a bit , even as [ he ] found some of it rather messy . " Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked , he stated : " the stuff that did reminded me that what I like about the show is its all @-@ out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones .

 Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized most of the musical performances in the episode , calling " Run Joey Run " the highlight of an otherwise " slow , forced show " . Flandez opined of " Ice Ice Baby " : " Will , kicking it old school , doesn 't cut it with his ' 80s @-@ flashback moves because a . ) he takes himself too seriously and b . ) he looks like he 's in a J.Crew mag , not part of 2 Live Crew . " Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode , similarly calling " Run Joey Run " his favorite song , but noting that that was " not hard considering the songbook that was offered " . Kennedy deemed the " Ice Ice Baby " performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far . He concluded : " Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been . I love Newton @-@ John ’ s walk @-@ on cameo , but I don ’ t want them to fall into the habit of re @-@ creating music videos frame by frame : It was cute - once . It sounds harsh , but I could have completely done without the episode . It was almost as if they needed filler just to showcase the " Physical " video .

 The 2009 – 10 Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball team represented the University of Michigan during the 2009 @-@ 10 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season . The team was coached by John Beilein and played its home games in Ann Arbor , Michigan at the Crisler Arena , which has a capacity of 13 @,@ 751 , for the forty @-@ third consecutive year . This season marked the team 's ninety @-@ third consecutive year as a member of the Big Ten Conference . The team finished the season with a 15 – 17 overall record and a 7 – 11 conference record , which was tied for seventh in the conference standings . It was seeded eighth in the single @-@ elimination 2010 Big Ten Conference Men 's Basketball Tournament where it advanced one round . On October 16 , Michigan was one of five Big Ten schools to begin its season by celebrating Midnight Madness . 
 Following the University of Michigan basketball scandal , the team had completed serving a scholarship probation imposed in 2003 two years earlier . During the probation , the team had had only twelve scholarships to offer instead of the usual thirteen . However , Michigan continued to be prohibited from affiliation with implicated athletes ( Chris Webber , Robert Traylor , Maurice Taylor , and Louis Bullock ) until 2012 , which meant , among other things , that the players could not help the University recruit . The team was expected to finish between third and fifth in the conference by most expert <unk> . The team was led by a pair of Wooden Award preseason watchlist nominees : Manny Harris and DeShawn Sims . Harris , Sims and Zack Novak served as team captains . 
 The team won two of its first three games against ranked opponents ( Connecticut and Ohio State ) . However , the season was a disappointment that included two buzzer @-@ beater losses to conference co @-@ champions Ohio State and Michigan State on field goals by 2010 Big Ten Conference Men 's Basketball Player of the Year Evan Turner and 2009 Big Ten Conference Men 's Basketball Player of the Year Kalin Lucas . After starting the season 3 – 0 , the team never again won three games in a row . The team was nationally ranked to start the season , but never reappeared in the national polls after the third week of the season . Michigan ended the year with a 7 – 11 conference record ( tied for seventh ) and a 15 – 17 overall regular season record . Turner 's buzzer @-@ beater came in the second round of the 2010 Big Ten Conference Men 's Basketball Tournament in which the eighth @-@ seeded Wolverines lost by a point to the top @-@ seeded Buckeyes . 
 At the conclusion of the regular season , Sims and Harris were named to the 2nd and 3rd All @-@ Big Ten teams , respectively , by both conference coaches and the media . Following the Big Ten tournament both players were recognized as 2nd @-@ team All @-@ District selections by the National Association of Basketball Coaches .

 November 12 , 2008 , marked the first day of the early signing period for high school seniors wishing to become eligible student @-@ athletes in the 2009 @-@ 2010 academic year . The early period ended on November 19 , 2008 for NCAA college basketball teams ( the regular signing period is from April 15 – May 20 , 2009 ) . However , verbal commitments are usually accurate predictors of signing activity . Based on <unk> and very early signings , Big Ten Conference rivals Indiana , Minnesota and Illinois had top 25 signing classes , but Michigan did not according to both ESPN and Scout.com. The team was the choice of four blue chip prospects who followed through on their verbal commitments and signed letters of intent including Matt Vogrich and Darius Morris . The 6 ft 4 in ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) 180 @-@ pound ( 82 kg ) Morris was listed among the top 15 point guards in the nation by Scout.com , Rivals.com and ESPN . Kelvin Grady , who had played 64 games and made 33 starts during his first two seasons , was going to transfer from the program at the end of the prior season , but he became a wide receiver on the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team . In June 2009 , Jordan Morgan had surgery on his left knee to repair articular cartilage . The expected recovery time was four to five months . In October , it was unclear whether he would be able to join the team or whether he would redshirt . 
 Entering the season , Harris was regarded by some as the most highly rated player in the Big Ten . E.g. , the FOX Sports preseason All @-@ American listed him on its second team . It included Michigan State 's Kalin Lucas on its third team , Purdue 's Robbie Hummel on its fourth team and Ohio State 's Evan Turner on its fifth team . However , ESPN chose both Lucas and Turner to its preseason second @-@ team All @-@ American list , while Harris was not shown on a single ballot . Harris and Sims were named among the 50 preseason Wooden Award watch list nominees . Harris was also named to the <unk> Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist . The 24 @-@ member Big Ten media panel selected Harris as a first team preseason All @-@ Big Ten team member . 
 The 2009 – 10 schedule includes the Old Spice Classic , an ACC – Big Ten Challenge match against Boston College , games against preseason ranked power conference opponents Kansas and Connecticut as well as the 2010 Big Ten Conference Men 's Basketball Tournament .

 The ABU Radio Song Festival 2012 was the first edition of the biennial ABU Radio Song Festivals , organised by the Asia @-@ Pacific Broadcasting Union ( ABU ) . The festival took place in the KBS Hall , which is located in the South Korean capital of Seoul and coincided with the 49th general assembly of the ABU . The ABU Radio Song Festival attracted twenty @-@ six original entries representing eighteen radio broadcasters from fifteen countries , which competed in a preliminary jury round . The juries selected thirteen entries from twelve radio broadcasters in ten countries to qualify for the final show which was held on 11 October 2012 . Fifteen entries were originally selected to participate in the grand final . However , Fiji and Sri Lanka withdrew from the radio competition prior to the final show , and thus only thirteen entries participated in the competition on 11 October 2012 . 
 South Korea won the Grand Prix award with the song " For a Rest " performed by boy band Billy <unk> . Danielle Blakey representing Australia won the gold award with the song " Fearless " , Brunei received the silver award with the song " Yang Terindah ( So Beautiful ) " performed by Maria Aires , with Sammy Ray Jones also representing Australia receiving the bronze award with his song " <unk> " . K @-@ Town Clan representing Malaysia received the special jury award with their song " Party Animal " . The next edition will be held in Colombo , Sri Lanka . 
 = = History = = 
 The Asia @-@ Pacific Broadcasting Union ( ABU ) had already run an international song contest for its members inspired by the Eurovision Song Contest in 1985 – 1987 , called the ABU Popular Song Contest , with 14 countries from the Asia @-@ Pacific region competing . The show had a similar concept to the current festivals with the winners being chosen by a professional jury . South Korea , New Zealand and Australia celebrated victories in that competition . In 1989 – 1991 the ABU co @-@ produced the ABU Golden Kite World Song Festival in Malaysia with participation of Asia @-@ Pacific countries , as well as Yugoslavia and Finland . 
 In 2008 , the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) proposed a partnership with the ABU on the establishment of an Asiavision Song Contest ; however these talks didn 't produce any results , and in September 2008 it was announced that the Eurovision Song Contest format for Asian production had been sold to a private company from Singapore , Asiavision Pte . Ltd . The original name intended for that event was Asiavision Song Contest , but it was later changed to Our Sound - The Asia @-@ Pacific Song Contest following a request from the ABU , who uses the Asiavision name for their news exchange service . Initially , the contest ( which was supposed to be a two program live broadcast TV show with public voting ) was set to premiere in 2009 , but it was later rescheduled for March 2010 in Macao and then for November 2010 in Mumbai , at the end being postponed indefinitely " due to the ongoing issues between the organizers and EBU " . 
 Shortly before launching the ABU Song Festival , the ABU had been considering the possibility of organizing the ABU ASEAN TV Song Festival in Thailand . Historically , ASEAN song contests had been organized in periods between 1981 and 1997 , however since 2011 the ASEAN Festival had been organized between local Radio stations such as Bintang Radio ASEAN . 
 In November 2011 , the ABU announced that they would organize their own TV and Radio Song Festivals to take place in Seoul , the South Korean capital , to coincide with the 49th General Assembly in October 2012 . The name Asiavision Song Contest was initially mentioned as a possibility , but they were later officially titled ABU Radio Song Festival and ABU TV Song Festival . According to the ABU , the deadline for participation applications for the ABU TV Song Festival was 18 May 2012 .

This had been inspired by the digital evolution changes in the global media . 
 At the preliminary round of the Radio Festival , twenty @-@ six participants from fifteen countries across Asia , Australia and the Pacific performed their entries in front of a jury panel . Thirteen entries representing ten countries qualified for the final show which took place at the KBS Hall on 11 October 2012 .

 = Inocybe godeyi = 
 Inocybe godeyi is a species of Inocybaceae fungus found in Europe . The species produces mushrooms with cone @-@ shaped caps up to 5 cm ( 2 in ) in diameter . The caps are cream , becoming browner , but they bruise red . The stem is up to 6 cm ( 2 in ) long , and has a " bulb " at the base . The white flesh has a strong smell and an acrid taste . The mushrooms can be found on forest floors in autumn months ; the species forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship to surrounding trees , favouring beech . I. godeyi is known to be poisonous , containing muscarine compounds , and consumption of the mushrooms can lead to SLUDGE syndrome . The species is sometimes mistaken for the deadly I. erubescens . 
 First described by Claude Casimir Gillet , the species retains the name which it was first given , but has a number of taxonomic synonyms . Its specific name honours Louis @-@ Luc Godey . Within the genus Inocybe , it has been classified in a number of ways , but appears to form part of a clade ( that is , a group sharing a common ancestor ) with species including I. abietis , I. <unk> , I. agglutinata and I. pudica . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 Inocybe godeyi was first described , and given its current name , by French botanist and mycologist Claude Casimir Gillet in his 1874 work Les <unk> ou description de tous les champignons ( fungi ) qui croissent en France . The specific name honours the French mycologist Louis @-@ Luc Godey . British mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke described a variety of the species , Inocybe godeyi var. rufescens , in a 1909 issue of the Transactions of the British Mycological Society . However , the name is now considered synonymous with Inocybe godeyi . A number of other names are recognised as synonymous . Gillet 's own Inocybe rubescens , described in an 1883 issue of Revue <unk> , is no longer seen as a separate taxon . The same is true of Narcisse Théophile Patouillard 's 1884 description of I. rubescens as a variety of " Agaricus <unk> " , Agaricus <unk> var. rubescens . Other synonyms include Roger Heim 's 1931 Inocybe <unk> and Inocybe <unk> . 
 Within the genus Inocybe , I. godeyi has been classified in a number of ways . In 1986 , mycologist Thom Kuyper placed the species in the supersection Marginatae ( subgenus Inocybe ) , along with species including I. abietis , I. calospora and I. praetervisa . Rolf Singer considers Marginatae a section in subgenus Inocybe , but he placed I. godeyi in the section <unk> ( in the subgenus <unk> ) along with species including I. agglutinata and I. pudica . A 2002 phylogenetic study found that Singer 's <unk> is probably monophyletic ( that is , the taxa all come from a common , recent ancestor ) and suggested that I. godeyi forms a clade with species including I. abietis , I. <unk> , I. agglutinata and I. pudica . All species in the clade were " smooth @-@ spored <unk> with <unk> hymenial cystidia " , but there were other species that fit that description , such as I. lacera , that were shown not to be a part of the clade . 
 = = Description = = 
 Inocybe godeyi produces mushrooms each of which features a cap of 2 to 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 to 2 in ) across . The cap is initially cone @-@ shaped , but expands outward , and flattens somewhat . In younger mushrooms , it is a cream colour , but as the fruit bodies mature , it changes to an ochre to tan colour ; however , the cap can sometimes become entirely red , the colour it turns when bruised . The cap surface of younger specimens is smooth and silky . The surface of older caps becomes increasingly fibrous , and cracks often develop , beginning at the cap margin and moving towards the centre . There is usually a small umbo . The stem attaches to the center of the cap , and measures 40 to 60 mm ( 2 to 2 in ) by 3 to 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 3 in ) . Towards the base , the stem surface is covered in fine grains , and at the very base , there is an obviously defined " bulb " . In colour , the stem is an off @-@ white , becoming redder as the mushroom ages . The flesh is white , but gradually turns red when it is exposed . The gills begin as an off @-@ white , but become gradually the colour of cinnamon . They are adnexed , which means that only part of the depth of the gills attaches to the stem , and crowded . 
 = = = Microscopic features = = = 
 Inocybe godeyi leaves a snuff @-@ brown spore print , while the individual spores themselves are smooth and almond @-@ shaped . The spores measure 9 to 11 @.@ 5 by 5 @.@ 5 to 7 micrometres . Each basidium bares four spores . Both the cheilocystidia ( cystidia found on the edges of the gills ) and the pleurocystidia ( cystidia found on the faces of the gills ) are spindle- or bottle @-@ shaped , with some kind of encrustation at the tip . They have thick cell walls .

 It is sometimes mistaken for the deadly Inocybe erubescens . The rarer I. erubescens , like I. godeyi , bruises red , though it is lighter in colour to begin with . The most distinguishing feature is that I. erubescens lacks a bulbous base .

 Inocybe godeyi flesh has a strong smell , which has been variously described as " unpleasant " , " earthy or mealy " , and " not distinctive " . The flesh has an acrid taste . The mushrooms are known to be poisonous , containing toxic compounds of muscarine . Consumption of the mushroom could lead to a number of physiological effects , including : salivation , lacrimation , urination , defecation , gastrointestinal problems and emesis ( vomiting ) ; this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE . Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure , sweating and death due to respiratory failure . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Inocybe godeyi can be found in Europe . It is found in deciduous woodland on the ground , particularly on chalky soil . The species is ectomycorrhizal , favouring beech . Mushrooms are encountered in the autumn months of August to November , solitarily or in " trooping groups " . While the mushrooms can be locally common , the species is typically uncommon .

 The Pui Tak Center ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> Zhōngxīn ; Jyutping : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; Cantonese Yale : <unk> <unk> ; literally : " cultivating virtue center " ) , formerly known as the On Leong Merchants Association Building , is a building located in Chicago 's Chinatown . Designed by architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad , the building was built for the On Leong Merchants Association and opened in 1928 . The Association used it as an immigrant assistance center , and the building was informally referred to as Chinatown 's " city hall " . In 1988 , the FBI and Chicago Police raided the building as part of a racketeering investigation . The US federal government seized the building that same year . 
 The building was purchased by the Chinese Christian Union Church ( CCUC ) for $ 1 @.@ 4 million and renamed the Pui Tak Center in 1993 . That same year , the On Leong Merchants Association Building was designated a Chicago landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks . The CCUC spent $ 1 million raised from community donations to renovate and update the building 's neglected interior . The newly named Pai Tak Center now hosts various religious , community , and educational programs , such as English @-@ as @-@ a @-@ Second @-@ Language courses ( ESL ) . 
 In 2007 , the Pui Tak Center won a $ 100 @,@ 000 grant from the Partners in Preservation , a program sponsored by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation . In preparation for the restoration work , the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss , Janney , Elstner Associates completed an evaluation of the building 's eastern and southern facades , focusing on its terra cotta portions . Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010 . Fully restoring the building 's exterior terra cotta pieces and clay roof tiles is the first step in a long @-@ range $ 2 million repair plan .

Swanson to design a building large enough to house 15 stores , 30 apartments and office space on the 200 block of West 22nd Street ( now Cermak Road ) . Built in 1912 for $ 200 @,@ 000 , the building 's design was typical of the period ; however , it featured white tile trim adorned with Chinese dragons and a third floor balcony . The Association relocated to the building 's third floor by 1914 . 
 In the 1920s , Chinese community leaders secured approximately 50 ten @-@ year leases on properties in the newly developing Chinatown . Jim Moy , director of the Association , then decided that a Chinese @-@ style building should be constructed as a strong visual announcement of the Chinese community 's new presence in the area . With no Chinese @-@ born architects in Chicago at the time , Chicago @-@ born Norse architects Christian S. Michaelsen and Sigurd A. Rognstad were asked to design the On Leong Merchants Association Building in the spring of 1926 . Moy decided to employ the pair again after Michaelsen and Rognstad 's firm built Moy 's Peacock Inn in Uptown in 1920 . 
 After studying texts on Chinese architecture , Michaelsen and Rognstad 's final design was an example of Orientalism , a Western architect 's interpretation of Chinese architectural forms . A good substitute for the <unk> li glazed ceramic found in traditional Chinese architecture , Rognstad designed exterior <unk> sculptural accents , a type of terra cotta produced by Crystal Lake , Illinois 's American Terra Cotta Company . When the building plans were announced in the Chicago Tribune on July 4 , 1926 , the building was called , " One of the most expensive and elaborate buildings ever erected in America by the Chinese " . Construction began in 1926 and was completed a year later for the cost of $ 1 million . 
 When the building opened in 1928 , the On Leong Merchants Association used it as an immigrant assistance center that housed various meeting halls , a school , a shrine , and the Association 's offices . It was often informally referred to as Chinatown 's " city hall " . In 1941 , the On Leong Association offered Reverend John T.S. Mao space in the building to open St. Therese Chinese Catholic School , a Catholic grade school . By the 1950s , the school had become overcrowded , but it remained in the building until construction of a new , devoted school building was completed in 1961 . 
 = = = Seizure and sale = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s , prosecutors began claiming the building was a national headquarters for a multimillion @-@ dollar racketeering operation . On April 20 , 1988 , the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building , confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building 's second floor and seized $ 350 @,@ 000 from a vault . Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted that the Association had collected $ 6 million in illegal gambling profits between 1966 and 1988 . The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal racketeering statutes . Other than several first @-@ floor shops , the building sat empty for almost five years . Rooms on the upper floors fell into disrepair , with paint peeling and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor . 
 After a unanimous voice vote by a City Council committee , the Commission on Chicago Landmarks designated the On Leong Merchants Association Building as a Chicago Landmark on December 1 , 1993 , the only such landmark in Chinatown . It has been described as Chicago ’ s " most significant symbol of the cultural heritage of the Chinese " . That same year , the Chinese Christian Union Church ( CCUC ) bought the building from the government for $ 1 @.@ 4 million . The CCUC now uses the newly named Pui Tak Center to host religious , community , and educational programs such as family literacy classes , music programs , computer courses , and youth activities , with English @-@ as @-@ a @-@ Second @-@ Language courses ( ESL ) being the Center 's largest program . Recent Chinese immigrants can also visit the Center for assistance with everyday needs . Serving approximately 2 @,@ 500 new immigrants annually , the Center 's annual $ 1 @.@ 5 million operating budget is partially funded by state and local government grants and private donations . 
 = = Renovation and restoration = = 
 After purchasing the building in 1993 , the Chinese Christian Union Church spent $ 1 million raised from community donations to make extensive alterations to the building 's interior , which suffered from peeling paint , falling plaster , and poor lighting . The On Leong Merchants Association 's former vault was converted into a closet , and the building 's heating and water systems underwent major renovations and replacement . Renovations were completed in 1995 , and the CCUC opened the building in November . 
 In November 2007 , the Pui Tak Center won a $ 100 @,@ 000 grant from the Partners in Preservation , a program sponsored by American Express and the National Trust for Historic Preservation . Spreading the word via e @-@ mail , Facebook , and church sermons , the building led the five @-@ week @-@ long online contest from the start and ultimately received 14 % of the vote . It received more votes than any of the other 24 historic Chicago sites participating in the contest , including the Robie House , the Chicago Cultural Center , and Unity Temple . 
 In preparation for the restoration work , the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss , Janney , Elstner Associates completed an evaluation of the building 's eastern and southern facades , focusing on its terra cotta portions . By using ultrasonic testing , engineers were able to evaluate the state of the terra cotta without further damaging the pieces . Severely cracked or damaged pieces were partially removed and a report was written from these findings . This report provided recommendations for the masonry facade and terra cotta repair work . Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010 . All of the damaged terra cotta elements have been replaced on the south tower and parapet , and scaffolding has been erected on building 's eastern facade in preparation for further restoration work . Fully restoring the building 's exterior terra cotta pieces and clay roof tiles is the first step in a long @-@ range $ 2 million repair plan . 
 = Saw VI = 
 Saw VI is a 2009 Canadian @-@ American horror film directed by Kevin Greutert from a screenplay written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan . It is the sixth installment in the seven – part Saw franchise and stars Tobin Bell , Costas Mandylor , Betsy Russell , Mark Rolston , Peter Outerbridge , and Shawnee Smith . It was produced by Mark Burg and Oren Koules of Twisted Pictures and distributed by Lionsgate . 
 Saw VI continues the franchise 's focus on the posthumous effects of the Jigsaw Killer and the progression of his successor , Mark Hoffman . In this film , Hoffman sets a series of traps for an insurance executive , William Easton , and his employees . Meanwhile , the FBI trails Peter Strahm , now suspected of being Jigsaw 's last accomplice , and Hoffman is drawn into motion to protect his secret identity . 
 Greutert , who served as editor for all the previous Saw films , made his directorial debut with Saw VI . Melton and Dunstan , the writers for both Saw IV and Saw V , returned to write the screenplay and Charlie Clouser , who provided the score for all previous Saw films , composed the score . Filming took place in Toronto from March to May 2009 with a budget of $ 11 million . 
 The film was released in New Zealand and Australia on October 22 , 2009 , and October 23 , 2009 in the United States and Canada . In Spain it was the first film to receive a Película X rating for violence ( a rating usually reserved for pornographic films ) ; the rating restricted screenings to eight select theaters in that country . It was released almost a year later on October 8 , 2010 in Spain with an " 18 " rating , after the producers had the offensive content edited out , according to the rating board . With gross receipts of $ 14 million in its opening weekend , Saw VI placed second to Paranormal Activity 's $ 21 million . Saw VI went on to gross over $ 68 million worldwide , the lowest @-@ grossing Saw film to date , but still a financial success compared to its small budget . Reviews were mixed , with some criticizing the acting and others praising Greutert 's directing . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Two predatory lenders awaken on either side of a room split by a caged @-@ in scale , wearing head harnesses with screws poised to pierce their temples . The one who sets more flesh weight upon their tray will survive . Eddie cuts fat from his torso , but Simone chops off her arm , and Eddie is killed when the timer expires . As he reviews the game 's footage , Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called to the scene by FBI Agent Dan Erickson , who has found Peter Strahm 's fingerprints . Also present is Lindsey Perez , whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection . They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner , the coroner who performed all of the autopsies for the case thus far , that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie 's flesh was only used once before , on Seth Baxter . The agents intend to find the Baxter videotape to prove Strahm 's involvement . 
 While at the hospital to meet with Simone , Hoffman is met by reporter Pamela Jenkins , who claims to have found something at the meatpacking plant . He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic and takes control of the games , and is given five envelopes from the box left to her in John Kramer 's will , each containing photos of people to be tested . After he leaves , a flashback reveals that Kramer brought Amanda Young to Jill , who had deemed her a lost cause , as proof of his methods . A later flashback , as Jill delivers a package from the box to the hospital , shows that Jill met with Kramer at the plant hours before his death , where he gave her the box 's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended . 
 William Easton , an insurance executive for Umbrella Health , meets with Debbie , the company 's attorney , about Harold Abbott , who succumbed to heart disease after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy . Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo , where he and his janitor , Hank , awaken in <unk> designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into oxygen masks strapped to their faces . Kramer himself appears in a videotape and informs Easton that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs , or he will lose his family . Hank , a heavy smoker , is unable to hold his breath for long and is killed by the vise . The other tests force Easton to save his staff and associates , including Debbie , from their own traps , usually by choosing between them ; this forces him to confront his own probability formula , which favors the healthy over the ill . It is shown that Kramer met Easton at the opening of Jill 's clinic and took issue with his formula . After his cancer was diagnosed , Kramer 's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by Easton . 
 The game is viewed by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the observation room , which contains a tank of hydrofluoric acid and a switch marked " Live " and " Die " . Pamela awakens in another cage on the other side of the room . During the game , Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez , who found the Baxter videotape and are having it unscrambled by an offsite technician . They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahm 's fingerprints , and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahm 's death . The moment his voice is unscrambled , Hoffman attacks and kills everyone in the room , plants fingerprints using Strahm 's severed hand , and lights the room on fire to destroy the evidence . 
 He returns to the observation room and finds the letter he 'd written to Amanda , in which he 'd used his knowledge of her role in Jill 's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn <unk> . The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill , who uses it to ambush Hoffman as Easton reaches the end of his path with one second left , finding himself between the cages . It is revealed that Pamela is his sister , while Tara and Brent are Harold 's family . Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill Easton or free him using the switch ; when she is unable to do so , Brent angrily shifts the switch and a bed of needles swings down and injects Easton 's body with the acid , killing him . Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head . She shows him the sixth envelope , which contains his photo , and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key . He escapes by breaking his hand and jamming the trap as it activates ; he pulls his head free , ripping open his cheek , and the screen cuts to black as he screams .

 On May 14 , 2008 , Bloody Disgusting reported that Kevin Greutert , the editor of the first five films in the franchise , would make his directorial debut with Saw VI . Newcomer to the series , Andrew Coutts replaced him as editor for the film . Saw VI marked David Armstrong 's last time to serve as cinematographer of the series . Mark Burg and Oren Koules again served as producers , with James Wan and Leigh Whannell , creators of the series , executive producing . Charlie Clouser was brought back to compose the score . Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan , writers of Saw IV and Saw V , returned to write the sixth installment . Melton said that the film had good pacing and a resolution for the series . Greutert commented that Saw VI would have some finality to it , something he always wanted to see in the series . During the early planning stage for the script it was suggested that Mandylor 's character , Detective Hoffman , should take on the mafia , but the idea was quickly dismissed as not " feeling Saw enough " . Greutert said in a Demon FM interview that Lionsgate told him a week before filming , that Saw VI would be post @-@ converted into 3D . Greutert was upset by this , since the film he envisioned was a 2D film , aesthetically . The plans were later abandoned due to time restraints .

 On July 26 , 2007 before Saw IV was released , CraveOnline 's horror website <unk> announced that Costas Mandylor would sign @-@ on to appear as Mark Hoffman in Saw V and Saw VI . Mandylor commented on his character : " Hoffman is sort of torn of becoming a mad man or becoming a guy that 's more composed , coming from a pure place like Jigsaw . That 's my character 's dilemma ; does he go fucking crazy or follow the rules of the boss ? " Greutert said in an interview with Bloody Disgusting that Saw VI would have the most characters of any Saw film to date but reassured the writers would stay true to previous storylines to prevent any " violations of logic and chronology " . A TV reality show called Scream Queens aired in 2008 on VH1 , in which 10 unknown actresses competed for a " breakout " role in Saw VI . Unknown actress <unk> Howard won the role . Lionsgate made a public statement ensuring her a leading role in the film but did not elaborate further on her character . 
 It was confirmed on March 24 , 2009 that Shawnee Smith would return as Amanda Young . Newly filmed " flashback " scenes would be created instead of using archive footage from previous entries , as had been done in the films since her character 's death in Saw III . On April 19 it was announced that James Van Patten would return as Dr. Heffner , a character featured in the opening scene of the fourth installment performing the autopsy on John Kramer . Peter Outerbridge was cast as a new character , William , and Tobin Bell , Betsy Russell , and Mark Rolston returned as their characters John Kramer , Jill Tuck , and Special Agent Erickson , respectively . Russell commented about her character : " You find out a little more about if Jill is good or evil . Pretty much you 'll know . " Greutert wanted to bring Cary Elwes 's character Dr. Gordon back but Elwes was not available . He was later cast in Saw 3D , though the storyline is very different than the one Greutert had for him in Saw VI .

 With a budget of $ 11 million , Saw VI began principal photography on March 30 , 2009 and wrapped on May 13 , 2009 . The film was shot at Toronto 's Cinespace Film Studios . Greutert said that the victims in traps would be more one @-@ on @-@ one with the trap and would be more personal to them . This was compared to Saw IV and Saw V , which most of the traps were set in big rooms and involved several people at one time . 
 Armstrong told Bloody Disgusting reviewer Mike Pereira that he thinks " visually " Saw VI might be his favorite , saying " We 're kind of pulling back a little bit in the color palette . It 's going to be more suggestive and not so vibrant , in your face like III and IV . It 's more neutral and shows natural flesh tones . On Saw V , I pulled back a little bit and on this one , I pulled back even more . " He commented that the " steam room " trap was the " best looking " of them all . He went on to say , " It 's big and expensive . It 's got furnaces , fires and steam . It 's multi @-@ leveled . The most complex Saw . We had techno cranes flying through . It was pretty amazing . " Commenting on the " carousel room " trap Armstrong said : " It 's very carnival , playground @-@ like . It 's just nasty . [ There are ] spinning red lights in there . It 's really overwhelming to walk in and look at because everything is spinning . " Greutert said in an issue of the horror magazine Fangoria that the " carousel room " was , to date , the " longest trap scene ever " . He admitted that originally they had ten actors riding the carousel , but it was ultimately scaled down to six , to " tie in to the [ film 's ] title " .

The soundtrack includes 18 tracks separated by 3 parts , each with six songs and includes 3 bonus tracks . It was released on October 20 , 2009 through Trustkill Records . James Christopher Monger of Allmusic praised the use of hard rock and heavy metal music , something that had been missing since Saw IV . He said in his review that " It 's a fitting marriage , as hard rock and heavy metal are the sonic suitors to horror and torture porn films and video games " . He particularly liked the songs by Hatebreed ( " In Ashes They Shall Reap " ) , Converge ( " Dark Horse " ) , My My <unk> ( " The Sinatra " ) , and Kittie ( " Cut Throat " ) , calling the songs the " most ferocious moments this time around " .

 Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that " Saw VI is the thinnest , <unk> , and most tediously preachy of the Saw films .

" Christopher Monfette of IGN Movies rated Saw VI three out of five and wrote that " while Saw VI certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw 's legacy , Saw VII will no doubt mark the time to either shake things up or watch this franchise get the ax " . 
 Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said , " If this is torture porn , it 's as if it was designed to be enjoyed by Michael Moore .

 = Shakespeare authorship question = 
 The Shakespeare authorship question is the argument that someone other than William Shakespeare of Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon wrote the works attributed to him . Anti @-@ Stratfordians — a collective term for adherents of the various alternative @-@ authorship theories — believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield the identity of the real author or authors , who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit . Although the idea has attracted much public interest , all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and for the most part acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims . 
 Shakespeare 's authorship was first questioned in the middle of the 19th century , when adulation of Shakespeare as the greatest writer of all time had become widespread . Shakespeare 's biography , particularly his humble origins and obscure life , seemed incompatible with his poetic eminence and his reputation for genius , arousing suspicion that Shakespeare might not have written the works attributed to him . The controversy has since spawned a vast body of literature , and more than 80 authorship candidates have been proposed , the most popular being Sir Francis Bacon ; Edward de Vere , 17th Earl of Oxford ; Christopher Marlowe ; and William Stanley , 6th Earl of Derby . 
 Supporters of alternative candidates argue that theirs is the more plausible author , and that William Shakespeare lacked the education , aristocratic sensibility , or familiarity with the royal court that they say is apparent in the works . Those Shakespeare scholars who have responded to such claims hold that biographical interpretations of literature are unreliable in attributing authorship , and that the convergence of documentary evidence used to support Shakespeare 's authorship — title pages , testimony by other contemporary poets and historians , and official records — is the same used for all other authorial attributions of his era . No such direct evidence exists for any other candidate , and Shakespeare 's authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death . 
 Despite the scholarly consensus , a relatively small but highly visible and diverse assortment of supporters , including prominent public figures , have questioned the conventional attribution . They work for acknowledgment of the authorship question as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry and for acceptance of one or another of the various authorship candidates . 
 = = Overview = = 
 The arguments presented by anti @-@ Stratfordians share several characteristics . They attempt to disqualify William Shakespeare as the author and usually offer supporting arguments for a substitute candidate . They often postulate some type of conspiracy that protected the author 's true identity , which they say explains why no documentary evidence exists for their candidate and why the historical record supports Shakespeare 's authorship . 
 Most anti @-@ Stratfordians say that the Shakespeare canon exhibits such breadth of learning and intimate knowledge of the Elizabethan and Jacobean court and politics that no one but a highly educated nobleman or court insider could have written it . Apart from literary references , critical commentary and acting notices , the available data regarding Shakespeare 's life consist of mundane personal details such as vital records of his baptism , marriage and death , tax records , lawsuits to recover debts , and real estate transactions . In addition , no document attests that he received an education . No personal letters or literary manuscripts certainly written by Shakespeare of Stratford survive . Despite the low survival rate for documents of this period , to sceptics , these gaps in the record suggest the profile of a person who differs markedly from the playwright and poet . Some prominent public figures , including Walt Whitman , Mark Twain , Helen Keller , Henry James , Sigmund Freud , Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles , have found the arguments against Shakespeare ’ s authorship persuasive , and their endorsements are an important element in many anti @-@ Stratfordian arguments . 
 At the core of the argument is the nature of acceptable evidence used to attribute works to their authors . Anti @-@ Stratfordians rely on what has been called a " rhetoric of accumulation " , or what they designate as circumstantial evidence : similarities between the characters and events portrayed in the works and the biography of their preferred candidate ; literary parallels with the known works of their candidate ; and hidden codes and cryptographic allusions in Shakespeare 's own works or texts written by contemporaries . By contrast , academic Shakespeareans and literary historians rely mainly on direct documentary evidence — in the form of title page attributions and government records such as the Stationers ' Register and the Accounts of the Revels Office — and contemporary testimony from poets , historians , and those players and playwrights who worked with him , as well as modern stylometric studies . Scholars say all these converge to confirm William Shakespeare 's authorship . These criteria are the same as those used to credit works to other authors and are accepted as the standard methodology for authorship attribution . 
 = = Case against Shakespeare 's authorship = = 
 Very little is known of Shakespeare 's personal life , and some anti @-@ Stratfordians take this as circumstantial evidence against his authorship . Further , the lack of biographical information has sometimes been taken as an indication of an organised attempt by government officials to expunge all traces of Shakespeare from the historical record and to conceal the true author 's identity . For example , a lack of attendance records for Stratford 's grammar school is taken as suggesting that they may have been destroyed to hide proof that Shakespeare did not attend . 
 = = = Shakespeare 's background = = = 
 Shakespeare was born , brought up , and buried in Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon , where he maintained a household throughout the duration of his career in London . A market town of around 1 @,@ 500 residents about 100 miles ( 160 km ) north @-@ west of London , Stratford was a centre for the slaughter , marketing , and distribution of sheep , as well as for hide tanning and wool trading . Anti @-@ Stratfordians often portray the town as a cultural backwater lacking the environment necessary to nurture a genius and depict Shakespeare as ignorant and illiterate . 
 Shakespeare 's father , John Shakespeare , was a <unk> and town official . He married Mary Arden , one of the <unk> of Warwickshire , a family of the local gentry . Both signed their names with a mark , and no other examples of their writing are extant . This is often used as an indication that Shakespeare was brought up in an illiterate household . There is also no evidence that Shakespeare 's two daughters were literate , save for two signatures by Susanna that appear to be " drawn " instead of written with a practised hand . His other daughter , Judith , signed a legal document with a mark . 
 Anti @-@ Stratfordians consider Shakespeare 's background incompatible with that attributable to the author of the Shakespeare canon , which exhibits an intimacy with court politics and culture , foreign countries , and aristocratic sports such as hunting , falconry , tennis , and lawn @-@ bowling . Some find that the works show little sympathy for upwardly mobile types such as John Shakespeare and his son , and that the author portrays individual commoners comically , as objects of ridicule . Commoners in groups are said to be depicted typically as dangerous mobs . 
 = = = Education and literacy = = = 
 The absence of documentary proof of Shakespeare 's education is often a part of anti @-@ Stratfordian arguments . The free King 's New School in Stratford , established 1553 , was about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) from Shakespeare 's boyhood home . Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar , the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in Latin grammar , the classics , and rhetoric at no cost . The headmaster , Thomas Jenkins , and the instructors were Oxford graduates . No student rosters of the period survive , so no documentation exists for the attendance of Shakespeare or any other pupil , nor did anyone who taught or attended the school ever record that they were his teacher or classmate . This lack of documentation is taken by many anti @-@ Stratfordians as evidence that Shakespeare had little or no education . 
 Anti @-@ Stratfordians also question how Shakespeare , with no record of the education and cultured background displayed in the works bearing his name , could have acquired the extensive vocabulary found in the plays and poems . The author 's vocabulary is calculated to be between 17 @,@ 500 and 29 @,@ 000 words . No letters or signed manuscripts written by Shakespeare survive . The appearance of Shakespeare 's six surviving authenticated signatures , which they characterise as " an illiterate scrawl " , is interpreted as indicating that he was illiterate or barely literate . All are written in secretary hand , a style of handwriting common to the era , particularly in play writing , and three of them utilize <unk> to abbreviate the surname . 
 = = = Name as a pseudonym = = = 
 In his surviving signatures William Shakespeare did not spell his name as it appears on most Shakespeare title pages . His surname was spelled inconsistently in both literary and non @-@ literary documents , with the most variation observed in those that were written by hand . This is taken as evidence that he was not the same person who wrote the works , and that the name was used as a pseudonym for the true author . 
 Shakespeare 's surname was hyphenated as " Shake @-@ speare " or " Shak @-@ spear " on the title pages of 15 of the 48 individual quarto ( or Q ) editions of Shakespeare 's plays ( 16 were published with the author unnamed ) and in two of the five editions of poetry , published before the First Folio . Of those 15 title pages with Shakespeare 's name hyphenated , 13 are on the title pages of just three plays , Richard II ( Q2 1598 , Q3 1598 , Q4 1608 , and Q5 1615 ) , Richard III ( Q2 1598 , Q3 1602 , Q4 1605 , Q5 1612 , and <unk> 1622 ) , and Henry IV , Part 1 ( Q2 1599 , Q3 1604 , Q4 1608 , and Q5 1613 ) . The hyphen is also present in one cast list and in six literary allusions published between 1594 and 1623 . This hyphen use is construed to indicate a pseudonym by most anti @-@ Stratfordians , who argue that fictional descriptive names ( such as " Master Shoe @-@ tie " and " Sir Luckless Woo @-@ all " ) were often hyphenated in plays , and pseudonyms such as " Tom Tell @-@ truth " were also sometimes hyphenated . 
 Reasons proposed for the use of " Shakespeare " as a pseudonym vary , usually depending upon the social status of the candidate . Aristocrats such as Derby and Oxford supposedly used pseudonyms because of a prevailing " stigma of print " , a social convention that putatively restricted their literary works to private and courtly audiences — as opposed to commercial endeavours — at the risk of social disgrace if violated . In the case of commoners , the reason was to avoid prosecution by the authorities : Bacon to avoid the consequences of advocating a more republican form of government , and Marlowe to avoid imprisonment or worse after faking his death and fleeing the country . 
 = = = Lack of documentary evidence = = = 
 Anti @-@ Stratfordians say that nothing in the documentary record explicitly identifies Shakespeare as a writer ; that the evidence instead supports a career as a businessman and real @-@ estate investor ; that any prominence he might have had in the London theatrical world ( aside from his role as a front for the true author ) was because of his money @-@ lending , trading in theatrical properties , acting , and being a shareholder . They also believe that any evidence of a literary career was falsified as part of the effort to shield the true author 's identity . 
 All the alternative authorship theories reject the surface meanings of Elizabethan and Jacobean references to Shakespeare as a playwright and instead look for ambiguities and codes . They identify him with such characters as the literary thief Poet @-@ Ape in Ben Jonson 's poem of the same name and the foolish poetry @-@ lover <unk> in the university play The Return from Parnassus ( performed c . 1601 ) . Such characters are taken as broad hints indicating that the London theatrical world knew Shakespeare was a front for an anonymous author . Similarly , praises of " Shakespeare " the writer , such as those found in the First Folio , are explained as references to the real author 's pen @-@ name , not the man from Stratford . 
 = = = Circumstances of Shakespeare 's death = = = 
 Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 in Stratford , leaving a signed will to direct the disposal of his large estate . The language of the will is mundane and unpoetic and makes no mention of personal papers , books , poems , or the 18 plays that remained unpublished at the time of his death . Its only theatrical reference — monetary gifts to fellow actors to buy mourning rings — was interlined after the will had been written , casting suspicion on the authenticity of the bequests . 
 Any public mourning of Shakespeare 's death went unrecorded , and no eulogies or poems memorialising his death were published until seven years later as part of the front matter in the First Folio of his plays . 
 Oxfordians think that the phrase " our ever @-@ living Poet " ( an epithet that commonly eulogised a deceased poet as having attained immortal literary fame ) , included in the dedication to Shakespeare 's sonnets that were published in 1609 , was a signal that the true poet had died by then . Oxford had died in 1604 , five years earlier . 
 Shakespeare 's funerary monument in Stratford consists of a demi @-@ figure effigy of him with pen in hand and an attached plaque praising his abilities as a writer . The earliest printed image of the figure , in Sir William Dugdale 's Antiquities of Warwickshire ( 1656 ) , differs greatly from its present appearance . Some authorship theorists argue that the figure originally portrayed a man clutching a sack of grain or wool that was later altered to help conceal the identity of the true author . In an attempt to put to rest such speculation , in 1924 M. H. Spielmann published a painting of the monument that had been executed before the 1748 restoration , which showed it very similar to its present @-@ day appearance . The publication of the image failed to achieve its intended effect , and in 2005 Oxfordian Richard Kennedy proposed that the monument was originally built to honour John Shakespeare , William 's father , who by tradition was a " considerable dealer in wool " . 
 = = Case for Shakespeare 's authorship = = 
 Nearly all academic Shakespeareans believe that the author referred to as " Shakespeare " was the same William Shakespeare who was born in Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon in 1564 and who died there in 1616 . He became an actor and shareholder in the Lord Chamberlain 's Men ( later the King 's Men ) , the playing company that owned the Globe Theatre , the Blackfriars Theatre , and exclusive rights to produce Shakespeare 's plays from 1594 to 1642 . Shakespeare was also allowed the use of the honorific " gentleman " after 1596 when his father was granted a coat of arms . 
 Shakespeare scholars see no reason to suspect that the name was a pseudonym or that the actor was a front for the author : contemporary records identify Shakespeare as the writer , other playwrights such as Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe came from similar backgrounds , and no contemporary is known to have expressed doubts about Shakespeare 's authorship . While information about some aspects of Shakespeare 's life is sketchy , this is true of many other playwrights of the time . Of some , next to nothing is known . Others , such as Jonson , Marlowe , and John Marston , are more fully documented because of their education , close connections with the court , or brushes with the law . 
 Literary scholars employ the same methodology to attribute works to the poet and playwright William Shakespeare as they use for other writers of the period : the historical record and stylistic studies , and they say the argument that there is no evidence of Shakespeare 's authorship is a form of fallacious logic known as <unk> ex <unk> , or argument from silence , since it takes the absence of evidence to be evidence of absence . They criticise the methods used to identify alternative candidates as unreliable and unscholarly , arguing that their subjectivity explains why at least as many as 80 candidates have been proposed as the " true " author . They consider the idea that Shakespeare revealed himself autobiographically in his work as a cultural anachronism : it has been a common authorial practice since the 19th century , but was not during the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras . Even in the 19th century , beginning at least with Hazlitt and Keats , critics frequently noted that the essence of Shakespeare 's genius consisted in his ability to have his characters speak and act according to their given dramatic natures , rendering the determination of Shakespeare 's authorial identity from his works that much more problematic . 
 = = = Historical evidence = = = 
 The historical record is unequivocal in assigning the authorship of the Shakespeare canon to a William Shakespeare . In addition to the name appearing on the title pages of poems and plays , this name was given as that of a well @-@ known writer at least 23 times during the lifetime of William Shakespeare of Stratford . Several contemporaries corroborate the identity of the playwright as an actor , and explicit contemporary documentary evidence attests that the Stratford citizen was also an actor under his own name . 
 In 1598 , Francis Meres named Shakespeare as a playwright and poet in his Palladis Tamia , referring to him as one of the authors by whom the " English tongue is mightily enriched " . He names twelve plays written by Shakespeare , including four which were never published in quarto : The Two Gentlemen of Verona , The Comedy of Errors , Love 's Labour 's Won , and King John , as well as ascribing to Shakespeare some of the plays that were published anonymously before 1598 — Titus Andronicus , Romeo and Juliet , and Henry IV , Part 1 . He refers to Shakespeare 's " <unk> [ a ] red Sonnets among his private friends " 11 years before the publication of the Sonnets . 
 In the rigid social structure of Elizabethan England , William Shakespeare was entitled to use the honorific " gentleman " after his father was granted a coat of arms in 1596 . This honorific was conventionally designated by the title " Master " or its abbreviations " Mr. " or " M. " prefixed to the name . The title was included in many contemporary references to Shakespeare , including official and literary records , and identifies William Shakespeare of Stratford as the author . Examples from Shakespeare 's lifetime include two official stationers ' entries . One is dated 23 August 1600 and entered by Andrew Wise and William Aspley : 
 <unk> for their copies <unk> the <unk> of the wardens . <unk> <unk> the one called : <unk> a Doo about <unk> . <unk> the second parte of the history of <unk> henry the <unk> with the humors of Sr John <unk> : <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> d 
 The other is dated 26 November 1607 and entered by Nathaniel Butter and John Busby :

 This latter appeared on the title page of King Lear Q1 ( 1608 ) as “ M. <unk> Shake @-@ speare , HIS True Chronicle History of the life and death of King Lear , and his three Daughters . ” 
 Shakespeare 's social status is also specifically referred to by his contemporaries in Epigram 159 by John Davies of Hereford in his The Scourge of Folly ( 1611 ) : " To our English Terence , Mr. Will . Shake @-@ speare " ; Epigram 92 by Thomas Freeman in his <unk> and A Great Caste ( 1614 ) : " To Master W : Shakespeare " ; and in historian John Stow 's list of " Our moderne , and present excellent Poets " in his Annales , printed posthumously in an edition by Edmund Howes ( 1615 ) , which reads : " M. Willi . Shake @-@ speare gentleman " . 
 After Shakespeare 's death , Ben Jonson explicitly identified William Shakespeare , gentleman , as the author in the title of his eulogy , " To the Memory of My Beloved the Author , Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us " , published in the First Folio ( 1623 ) . Other poets identified Shakespeare the gentleman as the author in the titles of their eulogies , also published in the First Folio : " Upon the Lines and Life of the Famous Scenic Poet , Master William Shakespeare " by Hugh Holland and " To the Memory of the Deceased Author , Master W. Shakespeare " by Leonard Digges . 
 = = = Contemporary legal recognition = = = 
 Both explicit testimony by his contemporaries and strong circumstantial evidence of personal relationships with those who interacted with him as an actor and playwright support Shakespeare 's authorship . 
 The historian and antiquary Sir George Buc served as Deputy Master of the Revels from 1603 and as Master of the Revels from 1610 to 1622 . His duties were to supervise and censor plays for the public theatres , arrange court performances of plays , and , after 1606 , to license plays for publication . Buc noted on the title page of George a Greene , the Pinner of Wakefield ( 1599 ) , an anonymous play , that he had consulted Shakespeare on its authorship . Buc was meticulous in his efforts to attribute books and plays to the correct author , and in 1607 he personally licensed King Lear for publication as written by " Master William Shakespeare " . 
 In 1602 , Ralph Brooke , the York Herald , accused Sir William Dethick , the Garter King of Arms , of elevating 23 unworthy persons to the gentry . One of these was Shakespeare 's father , who had applied for arms 34 years earlier but had to wait for the success of his son before they were granted in 1596 . Brooke included a sketch of the Shakespeare arms , captioned " Shakespear ye Player by Garter " . The grants , including John Shakespeare 's , were defended by Dethick and Clarenceux King of Arms William Camden , the foremost antiquary of the time . In his <unk> Concerning Britaine — published in 1605 , but finished two years previously and before the Earl of Oxford died in 1604 — Camden names Shakespeare as one of the " most pregnant <unk> of these ages our times , whom succeeding ages may justly admire " .

 Actors John Heminges and Henry Condell knew and worked with Shakespeare for more than 20 years . In the 1623 First Folio , they wrote that they had published the Folio " onely to <unk> the memory of so worthy a Friend , & Fellow <unk> , as was our Shakespeare , by humble offer of his <unk> " . The playwright and poet Ben Jonson knew Shakespeare from at least 1598 , when the Lord Chamberlain 's Men performed Jonson 's play Every Man in His Humour at the Curtain Theatre with Shakespeare as a cast member . The Scottish poet William Drummond recorded Jonson 's often contentious comments about his contemporaries : Jonson criticised Shakespeare as lacking " arte " and for mistakenly giving Bohemia a coast in The Winter 's Tale . In 1641 , four years after Jonson 's death , private notes written during his later life were published . In a comment intended for posterity ( Timber or Discoveries ) , he criticises Shakespeare 's casual approach to playwriting , but praises Shakespeare as a person : " I loved the man , and do honour his memory ( on this side Idolatry ) as much as any . He was ( indeed ) honest , and of an open , and free nature ; had an excellent fancy ; brave notions , and gentle expressions . . . " 
 In addition to Ben Jonson , other playwrights wrote about Shakespeare , including some who sold plays to Shakespeare 's company . Two of the three Parnassus plays produced at St John 's College , Cambridge , near the beginning of the 17th century mention Shakespeare as an actor , poet , and playwright who lacked a university education . In The First Part of the Return from Parnassus , two separate characters refer to Shakespeare as " Sweet Mr. Shakespeare " , and in The Second Part of the Return from Parnassus ( 1606 ) , the anonymous playwright has the actor Kempe say to the actor Burbage , " Few of the university men pen plays well ... Why here 's our fellow Shakespeare puts them all down . " 
 An edition of The Passionate Pilgrim , expanded with an additional nine poems written by the prominent English actor , playwright , and author Thomas Heywood , was published by William Jaggard in 1612 with Shakespeare 's name on the title page . Heywood protested this piracy in his Apology for Actors ( 1612 ) , adding that the author was " much offended with M. Jaggard ( that altogether unknown to him ) presumed to make so bold with his name . " That Heywood stated with certainty that the author was unaware of the deception , and that Jaggard removed Shakespeare 's name from unsold copies even though Heywood did not explicitly name him , indicates that Shakespeare was the offended author . Elsewhere , in his poem " <unk> of the Blessed Angels " ( 1634 ) , Heywood affectionately notes the nicknames his fellow playwrights had been known by . Of Shakespeare , he writes : 
 Our modern poets to that pass are driven , 
 Those names are curtailed which they first had given ; 
 And , as we wished to have their memories drowned , 
 We scarcely can afford them half their sound . ... 
 <unk> Shake @-@ speare , whose enchanting quill 
 Commanded mirth or passion , was but Will . 
 Playwright John Webster , in his dedication to The White Devil ( 1612 ) , wrote , " And lastly ( without wrong last to be named ) , the right happy and copious industry of M. Shake @-@ <unk> , M. Decker , & M. Heywood , wishing what I write might be read in their light " , here using the abbreviation " M. " to denote " Master " , a form of address properly used of William Shakespeare of Stratford , who was titled a gentleman . 
 In a verse letter to Ben Jonson dated to about 1608 , Francis Beaumont alludes to several playwrights , including Shakespeare , about whom he wrote , 
 ... Here I would let slip 
 ( If I had any in me ) scholarship , 
 And from all learning keep these lines as clear 
 as Shakespeare 's best are , which our heirs shall hear 
 Preachers apt to their auditors to show 
 how far sometimes a mortal man may go 
 by the dim light of Nature .

 The monument to Shakespeare , erected in Stratford before 1623 , bears a plaque with an inscription identifying Shakespeare as a writer . The first two Latin lines translate to " In judgment a <unk> , in genius a Socrates , in art a Maro , the earth covers him , the people mourn him , Olympus possesses him " , referring to Nestor , Socrates , Virgil , and Mount Olympus . The monument was not only referred to in the First Folio , but other early 17th @-@ century records identify it as being a memorial to Shakespeare and transcribe the inscription . Sir William Dugdale also included the inscription in his Antiquities of Warwickshire ( 1656 ) , but the engraving was done from a sketch made in 1634 and , like other portrayals of monuments in his work , is not accurate . 
 Shakespeare 's will , executed on 25 March 1616 , bequeaths " to my fellows John <unk> Richard Burbage and Henry <unk> 26 shilling 8 pence apiece to buy them [ mourning ] rings . " Numerous public records , including the royal patent of 19 May 1603 that chartered the King 's Men , establishes that Phillips , Heminges , Burbage , and Condell were fellow actors in the King 's Men with William Shakespeare ; two of them later edited his collected plays . Anti @-@ Stratfordians have cast suspicion on these bequests , which were interlined , and claim that they were added later as part of a conspiracy . However , the will was proved in the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of Canterbury ( George Abbot ) in London on 22 June 1616 , and the original will was copied into the court register with the bequests intact . 
 John Taylor was the first poet to mention in print the deaths of Shakespeare and Francis Beaumont in his 1620 book of poems The Praise of Hemp @-@ seed . Both had died four years earlier , less than two months apart . Ben Jonson wrote a short poem " To the Reader " commending the First Folio engraving of Shakespeare by Droeshout as a good likeness . Included in the prefatory <unk> verses was Jonson 's lengthy eulogy " To the memory of my beloved , the Author Mr. William Shakespeare : and what he hath left us " in which he identifies Shakespeare as a playwright , a poet , and an actor , and writes : 
 Sweet Swan of Avon ! what a sight it were 
 To see thee in our waters yet appear , 
 And make those flights upon the banks of Thames , 
 That so did take Eliza , and our James ! 
 Here Jonson links the author to Stratford 's river , the Avon , and confirms his appearances at the courts of Elizabeth I and James I. 
 Leonard Digges wrote the elegy " To the Memory of the Deceased Author Master W. Shakespeare " that was published in the Folio , in which he refers to " thy Stratford <unk> " . Brought up four miles from Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon in the 1590s , Digges was the stepson of Shakespeare 's friend , Thomas Russell , whom Shakespeare in his will designated as overseer to the executors . William Basse wrote an elegy entitled " On Mr. Wm . Shakespeare " sometime between 1616 and 1623 , in which he suggests that Shakespeare should have been buried in Westminster Abbey next to Chaucer , Beaumont , and Spenser . This poem circulated very widely in manuscript and survives today in more than two dozen contemporary copies ; several of these have a fuller , variant title " On Mr. William Shakespeare , he died in April 1616 " , which unambiguously specifies that the reference is to Shakespeare of Stratford . 
 = = = Evidence for Shakespeare 's authorship from his works = = = 
 Shakespeare 's are the most studied secular works in history . Contemporary comments and textual studies support the authorship of someone with an education , background , and life span consistent with that of William Shakespeare . 
 There is no record that any contemporary of Shakespeare referred to him as a learned writer or scholar . Ben Jonson and Francis Beaumont both refer to his lack of classical learning . If a university @-@ trained playwright wrote the plays , it is hard to explain the many classical blunders in Shakespeare . Not only does he mistake the scansion of many classical names , in Troilus and Cressida he has Greeks and Trojans citing Plato and Aristotle a thousand years before their births . <unk> suggests that most of Shakespeare 's classical allusions were drawn from Thomas Cooper ’ s Thesaurus <unk> <unk> et Britannicae ( 1565 ) , since a number of errors in that work are replicated in several of Shakespeare ’ s plays , and a copy of this book had been bequeathed to Stratford Grammar School by John <unk> for " the common use of scholars " . Later critics such as Samuel Johnson remarked that Shakespeare 's genius lay not in his erudition , but in his " vigilance of observation and accuracy of distinction which books and precepts cannot confer ; from this almost all original and native excellence proceeds . " Even the omnivorous reading imputed to Shakespeare by critics in later years is exaggerated , and he may well have absorbed much learning from conversations . And contrary to previous claims — both scholarly and popular — about his vocabulary and word coinage , the evidence of vocabulary size and word @-@ use frequency places Shakespeare with his contemporaries , rather than apart from them . Computerized comparisons with other playwrights demonstrate that his vocabulary is indeed large , but only because the canon of his surviving plays is larger than those of his contemporaries and because of the broad range of his characters , settings , and themes . 
 Shakespeare 's plays differ from those of the University Wits in that they avoid ostentatious displays of the writer 's mastery of Latin or of classical principles of drama , with the exceptions of co @-@ authored plays such as the Henry VI series and Titus Andronicus . Instead , his classical allusions rely on the Elizabethan grammar school curriculum . The curriculum began with William Lily 's Latin grammar <unk> <unk> and progressed to Caesar , Livy , Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Plautus , Terence , and Seneca , all of whom are quoted and echoed in the Shakespearean canon . Almost unique among his peers , Shakespeare 's plays are full of phrases from grammar school texts and pedagogy , together with caricatures of schoolmasters . Lily 's Grammar is referred to in a number of plays , including Titus Andronicus ( 4 @.@ 10 ) , The Taming of the Shrew ( 1 @.@ 1 ) , Love 's Labour 's Lost ( 5 @.@ 1 ) , Twelfth Night ( 2 @.@ 3 ) , and The Merry Wives of Windsor ( 4 @.@ 1 ) . Shakespeare alluded not only to grammar school but also to the petty school that children attended at age 5 to 7 to learn to read , a prerequisite for grammar school . 
 Beginning in 1987 , Ward Elliott , who was sympathetic to the Oxfordian theory , and Robert J. Valenza supervised a continuing stylometric study that used computer programs to compare Shakespeare 's stylistic habits to the works of 37 authors who had been proposed as the true author . The study , known as the Claremont Shakespeare Clinic , was last held in the spring of 2010 . The tests determined that Shakespeare 's work shows consistent , countable , profile @-@ fitting patterns , suggesting that he was a single individual , not a committee , and that he used fewer relative clauses and more hyphens , feminine endings , and run @-@ on lines than most of the writers with whom he was compared . The result determined that none of the other tested claimants ' work could have been written by Shakespeare , nor could Shakespeare have been written by them , eliminating all of the claimants whose known works have survived — including Oxford , Bacon , and Marlowe — as the true authors of the Shakespeare canon . 
 Shakespeare 's style evolved over time in keeping with changes in literary trends . His late plays , such as The Winter 's Tale , The Tempest , and Henry VIII , are written in a style similar to that of other Jacobean playwrights and radically different from that of his Elizabethan @-@ era plays . In addition , after the King 's Men began using the Blackfriars Theatre for performances in 1609 , Shakespeare 's plays were written to accommodate a smaller stage with more music , dancing , and more evenly divided acts to allow for trimming the candles used for stage lighting . 
 Dean Keith Simonton , who researches the factors involved in musical and literary creativity , especially Shakespeare 's , concludes " beyond a shadow of a doubt " that the consensus play chronology is roughly the correct order , and that Shakespeare 's works exhibit gradual stylistic development consistent with that of other artistic geniuses . Simonton 's study , published in 2004 , examined the correlation between the thematic content of Shakespeare 's plays and the political context in which they would have been written . When backdated two years , the mainstream chronologies yield substantial correlations between the two , whereas the alternative chronologies proposed by Oxfordians display no relationship regardless of the time lag . Simonton , who declared his Oxfordian sympathies in the article and had expected the results to support Oxford 's authorship , concluded that " that expectation was proven wrong " . 
 Shakespeare co @-@ authored half of his last 10 plays , collaborating closely with other playwrights . Oxfordians claim that those plays were finished by others after the death of Oxford . However , textual evidence from the late plays indicates that Shakespeare 's collaborators were not always aware of what Shakespeare had done in a previous scene , and that they were following a rough outline rather than working from an unfinished script left by a long @-@ dead playwright . For example , in The Two Noble Kinsmen ( 1612 – 1613 ) , written with John Fletcher , Shakespeare has two characters meet and leaves them on stage at the end of one scene , yet Fletcher has them act as if they were meeting for the first time in the following scene . 
 = = History of the authorship question = = 
 = = = <unk> and early doubt = = = 
 Despite adulatory tributes attached to his works , Shakespeare was not considered the world 's greatest writer in the century and a half following his death . His reputation was that of a good playwright and poet among many others of his era . Beaumont and Fletcher 's plays dominated popular taste after the theatres reopened in the Restoration Era in 1660 , with Ben Jonson 's and Shakespeare 's plays vying for second place . After the actor David Garrick mounted the Shakespeare Stratford Jubilee in 1769 , Shakespeare led the field . Excluding a handful of minor 18th @-@ century satirical and allegorical references , there was no suggestion in this period that anyone else might have written the works . The authorship question emerged only after Shakespeare had come to be regarded as the English national poet and a unique genius . 
 By the beginning of the 19th century , adulation was in full swing , with Shakespeare singled out as a transcendent genius , a phenomenon for which George Bernard Shaw coined the term " <unk> " in 1901 . By the middle of the century his genius was noted as much for its intellectual as for its imaginative strength . Since what was known about his life seemed to reveal Shakespeare as an untutored rustic , however , uneasiness began to emerge over the dissonance between Shakespeare 's reputation and his biography . Although still convinced that Shakespeare was the author of the works , Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed this disjunction in a lecture in 1846 by allowing that he could not reconcile Shakespeare 's verse with the image of a jovial actor and theatre manager . The rise of historical criticism , which challenged the authorial unity of Homer 's epics and the historicity of the Bible , also fuelled emerging puzzlement over Shakespeare 's authorship , which in one critic 's view was " an accident waiting to happen " . David Strauss 's investigation of the biography of Jesus , which shocked the public with its scepticism of the historical accuracy of the Gospels , influenced the secular debate about Shakespeare . In 1848 , Samuel <unk> Schmucker endeavoured to rebut Strauss 's doubts about the historicity of Christ by applying the same techniques satirically to the records of Shakespeare 's life in his Historic Doubts Respecting Shakespeare , Illustrating Infidel Objections Against the Bible . Schmucker , who never doubted that Shakespeare was Shakespeare , unwittingly anticipated and rehearsed many of the later arguments for alternative authorship candidates . 
 = = = Open dissent and the first alternative candidate = = = 
 Shakespeare 's authorship was first openly questioned in the pages of Joseph C. Hart 's The Romance of Yachting ( 1848 ) . Hart argued that the plays contained evidence that many different authors had worked on them . Four years later Dr. Robert W. Jameson anonymously published " Who Wrote Shakespeare ? " in the Chambers 's Edinburgh Journal , expressing similar views . In 1856 Delia Bacon 's unsigned article " William Shakspeare and His Plays ; An Enquiry Concerning Them " appeared in Putnam 's Magazine . 
 As early as 1845 , Delia Bacon had theorised that the plays attributed to Shakespeare were actually written by a group under the leadership of Sir Francis Bacon , with Sir Walter Raleigh as the main writer , whose purpose was to inculcate an advanced political and philosophical system for which they themselves could not publicly assume responsibility . Francis Bacon was the first single alternative author proposed in print , by William Henry Smith , in a pamphlet published in September 1856 ( Was Lord Bacon the Author of Shakspeare 's Plays ? A Letter to Lord Ellesmere ) . The following year Delia Bacon published a book outlining her theory : The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded . Ten years later , Judge Nathaniel Holmes of Kentucky published the 600 @-@ page The Authorship of Shakespeare supporting Smith 's theory , and the idea began to spread widely . By 1884 the question had produced more than 250 books , and Smith asserted that the war against the Shakespeare hegemony had almost been won by the Baconians after a 30 @-@ year battle . Two years later the Francis Bacon Society was founded in England to promote the theory . The society still survives and publishes a journal , <unk> , to further its mission . 
 These arguments against Shakespeare 's authorship were answered by academics . In 1857 the English critic George Henry Townsend published William Shakespeare Not an Impostor , criticising what he called the slovenly scholarship , false premises , specious parallel passages , and erroneous conclusions of the earliest proponents of alternative authorship candidates . 
 = = = Search for proof = = = 
 In 1853 , with the help of Ralph Waldo Emerson , Delia Bacon travelled to England to search for evidence to support her theories . Instead of performing archival research , she sought to unearth buried manuscripts , and unsuccessfully tried to persuade a caretaker to open Bacon 's tomb . She believed she had deciphered instructions in Bacon 's letters to look beneath Shakespeare 's Stratford gravestone for papers that would prove the works were Bacon 's , but after spending several nights in the chancel trying to summon the requisite courage , she left without prising up the stone slab . 
 <unk> became important to the Baconian theory , as they would later to the advocacy of other authorship candidates , with books such as Ignatius L. Donnelly 's The Great <unk> ( 1888 ) promoting the approach . Dr. Orville Ward Owen constructed a " cipher wheel " , a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ foot strip of canvas on which he had pasted the works of Shakespeare and other writers and mounted on two parallel wheels so he could quickly collate pages with key words as he turned them for decryption . In his multi @-@ volume Sir Francis Bacon 's Cipher Story ( 1893 ) , he claimed to have discovered Bacon 's autobiography embedded in Shakespeare 's plays , including the revelation that Bacon was the secret son of Queen Elizabeth , thus providing more motivation to conceal his authorship from the public . 
 Perhaps because of Francis Bacon 's legal background , both mock and real jury trials figured in attempts to prove claims for Bacon , and later for Oxford . The first mock trial was conducted over 15 months in 1892 – 93 , and the results of the debate were published in the Boston monthly The Arena . Ignatius Donnelly was one of the plaintiffs , while F. J. Furnivall formed part of the defence . The 25 @-@ member jury , which included Henry George , Edmund Gosse , and Henry Irving , came down heavily in favour of William Shakespeare . In 1916 , Judge Richard Tuthill presided over a real trial in Chicago . A film producer brought an action against a Baconian advocate , George Fabyan . He argued that Fabyan 's advocacy of Bacon threatened the profits expected from a forthcoming film about Shakespeare . The judge determined that ciphers identified by Fabyan 's analysts proved that Francis Bacon was the author of the Shakespeare canon , awarding Fabyan $ 5 @,@ 000 in damages . In the ensuing uproar , Tuthill rescinded his decision , and another judge , Frederick A. Smith , dismissed the case . 
 In 1907 , Owen claimed he had decoded instructions revealing that a box containing proof of Bacon 's authorship had been buried in the River Wye near Chepstow Castle on the Duke of Beaufort 's property . His dredging machinery failed to retrieve any concealed manuscripts . That same year his former assistant , Elizabeth Wells Gallup , financed by George Fabyan , likewise travelled to England . She believed she had decoded a message , by means of a <unk> cipher , revealing that Bacon 's secret manuscripts were hidden behind panels in Canonbury Tower in Islington . None were found . Two years later , the American humorist Mark Twain publicly revealed his long @-@ held anti @-@ Stratfordian belief in Is Shakespeare Dead ? ( 1909 ) , favouring Bacon as the true author . 
 In the 1920s Walter Conrad Arensberg became convinced that Bacon had willed the key to his cipher to the Rosicrucians . He thought this society was still active , and that its members communicated with each under the aegis of the Church of England . On the basis of cryptograms he detected in the sixpenny tickets of admission to Holy Trinity Church in Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon , he deduced that both Bacon and his mother were secretly buried , together with the original manuscripts of Shakespeare 's plays , in the Lichfield Chapter house in Staffordshire . He unsuccessfully petitioned the Dean of Lichfield to allow him both to photograph and excavate the obscure grave . Maria Bauer was convinced that Bacon 's manuscripts had been imported into Jamestown , Virginia , in 1653 , and could be found in the Bruton Vault at Williamsburg . She gained permission in the late 1930s to excavate , but authorities quickly withdrew her permit . In 1938 Roderick Eagle was allowed to open the tomb of Edmund Spenser to search for proof that Bacon was Shakespeare , but found only some old bones . 
 = = = Other candidates emerge = = = 
 By the end of the 19th century other candidates had begun to receive attention . In 1895 Wilbur G. Zeigler , an attorney , published the novel It Was Marlowe : A Story of the Secret of Three Centuries , whose premise was that Christopher Marlowe did not die in 1593 , but rather survived to write Shakespeare 's plays . He was followed by Thomas Corwin Mendenhall who , in the February 1902 issue of Current Literature , wrote an article based upon his stylometric work titled " Did Marlowe write Shakespeare ? " Karl Bleibtreu , a German literary critic , advanced the nomination of Roger Manners , 5th Earl of Rutland , in 1907 . Rutland 's candidacy enjoyed a brief flowering , supported by a number of other authors over the next few years . Anti @-@ Stratfordians unaffiliated to any specific authorship candidate also began to appear . George Greenwood , a British barrister , sought to disqualify William Shakespeare from the authorship in The Shakespeare Problem Restated ( 1908 ) , but did not support any alternative authors , thereby encouraging the search for candidates other than Bacon . John M. Robertson published The Baconian Heresy : A <unk> in 1913 , refuting the contention that Shakespeare had expert legal knowledge by showing that legalisms pervaded Elizabethan and Jacobean literature . In 1916 , on the three @-@ hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare 's death , Henry Watterson , the long @-@ time editor of The Courier @-@ Journal , wrote a widely syndicated front @-@ page feature story supporting the Marlovian theory and , like Zeigler , created a fictional account of how it might have happened . After the First World War , Professor Abel <unk> , an authority on French and English literature , argued the case for William Stanley , 6th Earl of Derby , as the author based on biographical evidence he had gleaned from the plays and poems . 
 With the appearance of J. Thomas Looney 's Shakespeare Identified ( 1920 ) , Edward de Vere , 17th Earl of Oxford , quickly ascended as the most popular alternative author . Two years later Looney and Greenwood founded the Shakespeare Fellowship , an international organisation to promote discussion and debate on the authorship question , which later changed its mission to propagate the Oxfordian theory . In 1923 Archie Webster published " Was Marlowe the Man ? " in The National Review , like Zeigler , Mendenhall and Watterson proposing that Marlowe wrote the works of Shakespeare , and arguing in particular that the Sonnets were an autobiographical account of his survival . In 1932 Allardyce Nicoll announced the discovery of a manuscript that appeared to establish James Wilmot as the earliest proponent of Bacon 's authorship , but recent investigations have identified the manuscript as a forgery probably designed to revive Baconian theory in the face of Oxford 's ascendancy . 
 Another authorship candidate emerged in 1943 when writer Alden Brooks , in his Will Shakspere and the Dyer 's hand , argued for Sir Edward Dyer . Six years earlier Brooks had dismissed Shakespeare as the playwright by proposing that his role in the deception was to act as an Elizabethan " play broker " , brokering the plays and poems on behalf of his various principals , the real authors . This view , of Shakespeare as a commercial go @-@ between , was later adapted by Oxfordians . After the Second World War , <unk> and anti @-@ <unk> declined in popularity and visibility . Copious archival research had failed to confirm Oxford or anyone else as the true author , and publishers lost interest in books advancing the same theories based on alleged circumstantial evidence . To bridge the evidentiary gap , both Oxfordians and Baconians began to argue that hidden clues and allusions in the Shakespeare canon had been placed there by their candidate for the benefit of future researchers . 
 To revive interest in Oxford , in 1952 Dorothy and Charlton Ogburn Sr. published the 1 @,@ 300 @-@ page This Star of England , now regarded as a classic Oxfordian text . They proposed that the " fair youth " of the sonnets was Henry Wriothesley , 3rd Earl of Southampton , the offspring of a love affair between Oxford and the Queen , and that the " Shakespeare " plays were written by Oxford to memorialise the passion of that affair . This became known as the " Prince Tudor theory " , which postulates that the Queen 's illicit offspring and his father 's authorship of the Shakespeare canon were covered up as an Elizabethan state secret . The <unk> found many parallels between Oxford 's life and the works , particularly in Hamlet , which they characterised as " straight biography " . A brief upsurge of enthusiasm ensued , resulting in the establishment of the Shakespeare Oxford Society in the US in 1957 . 
 In 1955 Broadway press agent Calvin Hoffman revived the Marlovian theory with the publication of The Murder of the Man Who Was " Shakespeare " . The next year he went to England to search for documentary evidence about Marlowe that he thought might be buried in his literary patron Sir Thomas Walsingham 's tomb . Nothing was found . 
 A series of critical academic books and articles , however , held in check any appreciable growth of anti @-@ <unk> , as academics attacked its methodology as unscholarly and the conclusions as ridiculous . American cryptologists William and <unk> Friedman won the Folger Shakespeare Library Literary Prize in 1955 for a study of the arguments that the works of Shakespeare contain hidden ciphers . The study disproved all claims that the works contain ciphers , and was condensed and published as The Shakespearean <unk> Examined ( 1957 ) . Soon after , four major works were issued surveying the history of the anti @-@ Stratfordian phenomenon from a mainstream perspective : The Poacher from Stratford ( 1958 ) , by Frank Wadsworth , Shakespeare and His Betters ( 1958 ) , by Reginald Churchill , The Shakespeare Claimants ( 1962 ) , by H. N. Gibson , and Shakespeare and His Rivals : A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy ( 1962 ) , by George L. McMichael and Edgar M. Glenn . In 1959 the American Bar Association Journal published a series of articles and letters on the authorship controversy , later anthologised as Shakespeare Cross @-@ Examination ( 1961 ) . In 1968 the newsletter of The Shakespeare Oxford Society reported that " the missionary or evangelical spirit of most of our members seems to be at a low ebb , dormant , or non @-@ existent " . In 1974 , membership in the society stood at 80 . 
 = = = Authorship in the mainstream media = = = 
 The freelance writer Charlton Ogburn Jr . , elected president of The Shakespeare Oxford Society in 1976 , promptly began a campaign to bypass the academic establishment ; he believed it to be an " entrenched authority " that aimed to " outlaw and silence dissent in a supposedly free society " . He proposed fighting for public recognition by portraying Oxford as a candidate on equal footing with Shakespeare . In 1984 Ogburn published his 900 @-@ page The Mysterious William Shakespeare : the Myth and the Reality , and by framing the issue as one of fairness in the atmosphere of conspiracy that permeated America after Watergate , he used the media to circumnavigate academia and appeal directly to the public . Ogburn 's efforts secured Oxford the place as the most popular alternative candidate . He also kick @-@ started the modern revival of the Oxfordian movement by adopting a policy of seeking publicity through moot court trials , media debates , television , and other outlets . These methods were later extended to the Internet , including Wikipedia . 
 Ogburn believed that academics were best challenged by recourse to law , and on 25 September 1987 three justices of the Supreme Court of the United States convened a one @-@ day moot court at the Metropolitan Memorial United Methodist Church , to hear the Oxfordian case . The trial was structured so that literary experts would not be represented , but the burden of proof was on the Oxfordians . The justices determined that the case was based on a conspiracy theory , and that the reasons given for this conspiracy were both incoherent and unpersuasive . Although Ogburn took the verdict as a " clear defeat " , Oxfordian columnist Joseph <unk> thought the trial had effectively dismissed any other Shakespeare authorship contender from the public mind and provided legitimacy for Oxford . A retrial was organised the next year in the United Kingdom to potentially reverse the decision . Presided over by three Law Lords , the court was held in the Inner Temple in London on 26 November 1988 . On this occasion Shakespearean scholars argued their case , and the outcome confirmed the American verdict . 
 Due in part to the rising visibility of the authorship question , media coverage of the controversy increased , with many outlets focusing on the Oxfordian theory . In 1989 the Public Broadcasting Service television show Frontline broadcast " The Shakespeare Mystery " , exposing the interpretation of Oxford @-@ as @-@ Shakespeare to more than 3 @.@ 5 million viewers in the US alone . This was followed in 1992 by a three @-@ hour Frontline teleconference , " Uncovering Shakespeare : an Update " , moderated by William F. Buckley , Jr . In 1991 The Atlantic Monthly published a debate between Tom Bethell , presenting the case for Oxford , and Irvin Leigh <unk> , presenting the case for Shakespeare . A similar print debate took place in 1999 in Harper 's Magazine under the title " The Ghost of Shakespeare " . Beginning in the 1990s Oxfordians and other anti @-@ Stratfordians increasingly turned to the Internet to promulgate their theories , including creating several articles on Wikipedia about the candidates and the arguments , to such an extent that a survey of the field in 2010 judged that its presence on Wikipedia " puts to shame anything that ever appeared in standard resources " . 
 On 14 April 2007 the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition issued an internet petition , the " Declaration of Reasonable Doubt About the Identity of William Shakespeare " , coinciding with Brunel University 's announcement of a one @-@ year Master of Arts programme in Shakespeare authorship studies ( since suspended ) . The coalition intends to enlist broad public support so that by 2016 , the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare 's death , the academic Shakespeare establishment will be forced to acknowledge that legitimate grounds for doubting Shakespeare 's authorship exist . More than 1 @,@ 200 signatures were collected by the end of 2007 , and by March 2016 the number of signatures had increased to 3 @,@ 300 , including those of 561 self @-@ described as current or former academics . On 22 April 2007 , The New York Times published a survey of 265 American Shakespeare professors on the Shakespeare authorship question . To the question of whether there is good reason to question Shakespeare 's authorship , 6 per cent answered " yes " , and 11 percent " possibly " . When asked their opinion of the topic , 61 per cent chose " A theory without convincing evidence " and 32 per cent chose " A waste of time and classroom distraction " . 
 In 2010 James S. Shapiro surveyed the authorship question in Contested Will : Who Wrote Shakespeare ? Approaching the subject sociologically , Shapiro found its origins to be grounded in a vein of traditional scholarship going back to Edmond Malone , and criticised academia for ignoring the topic , which was , he argued , tantamount to surrendering the field to anti @-@ Stratfordians . Shapiro links the revival of the Oxfordian movement to the cultural changes that followed the Watergate conspiracy scandal that increased the willingness of the public to believe in governmental conspiracies and cover @-@ ups , and Robert Sawyer suggests that the increased presence of anti @-@ Stratfordian ideas in popular culture can be attributed to the proliferation of conspiracy theories since the 9 / 11 attacks . 
 In September 2011 , Anonymous , a feature film based on the " Prince Tudor " variant of the Oxfordian theory , written by John Orloff and directed by Roland Emmerich , premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival . De Vere is portrayed as a literary prodigy who becomes the lover of Queen Elizabeth , with whom he sires Henry Wriothesley , 3rd Earl of Southampton , only to discover that he himself may be the Queen 's son by an earlier lover . He eventually sees his suppressed plays performed through the front man , William Shakespeare , who is portrayed as an opportunistic actor and the movie 's comic foil . Oxford agrees to Elizabeth 's demand that he remain anonymous as part of a bargain for saving their son from execution as a traitor for supporting the Essex Rebellion against her . Two months before the release of the film , the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust launched a campaign attacking anti @-@ Stratfordian arguments by means of a web site , 60 Minutes With Shakespeare : Who Was William Shakespeare ? , containing short audio contributions recorded by actors , scholars and other celebrities , which was quickly followed by a rebuttal from the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition . 
 Since then , Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells have written a short e @-@ book , Shakespeare Bites Back ( 2011 ) , and edited a longer book of essays by prominent academic Shakespeareans , Shakespeare Beyond Doubt ( 2013 ) , in which Edmondson says that they had " decided to lead the Shakespeare Authorship Campaign because we thought more questions would be asked by our visitors and students because of Anonymous , because we saw , and continue to see , something very wrong with the way doubts about Shakespeare 's authorship are being given academic credibility by the Universities of Concordia and Brunel , and because we felt that merely ignoring the anti @-@ <unk> was inappropriate at a time when their popular voice was likely to be gaining more ground . " 
 = = Alternative candidates = = 
 While more than 80 historical figures have been nominated at one time or another as the true author of the Shakespearean canon , only a few of these claimants have attracted significant attention . In addition to sole candidates , various " group " theories have also achieved a notable level of interest . 
 = = = Group theories = = = 
 Various group theories of Shakespearean authorship were proposed as early as the mid @-@ 1800s . The first published book focused entirely on the authorship debate , The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded , by Delia Bacon , appeared in 1857 , in which she proposed the first " group theory " , attributing the works to " a little clique of disappointed and defeated politicians " led by Sir Walter Raleigh which included Sir Francis Bacon and perhaps Edmund Spenser , Lord Buckhurst , and Edward de Vere , 17th Earl of Oxford . 
 A group theory was also described in Gilbert Slater 's The Seven Shakespeares ( 1931 ) , in which he theorized that the works were written by seven different authors : Francis Bacon , Edward de Vere , 17th Earl of Oxford , Sir Walter Raleigh , William Stanley , 6th Earl of Derby , Christopher Marlowe , Mary Sidney , Countess of Pembroke , and Roger Manners , 5th Earl of Rutland . In the early 1960s , Edward de Vere , Francis Bacon , Roger Manners , William Herbert and Mary Sidney were suggested as members of a group referred to as " The Oxford Syndicate " . In addition , playwrights such as Christopher Marlowe , Robert Greene and Thomas <unk> have all been proposed as participants . Some variants of the group theory also include William Shakespeare of Stratford as the group 's manager , broker and / or front man . 
 = = = Sir Francis Bacon = = = 
 The leading candidate of the 19th century was one of the great intellectual figures of Jacobean England , Sir Francis Bacon , a lawyer , philosopher , essayist and scientist . Bacon 's candidacy relies upon historical and literary conjectures , as well as alleged <unk> revelations . 
 Bacon was proposed as sole author by William Henry Smith in 1856 and as a co @-@ author by Delia Bacon in 1857 . Smith compared passages such as Bacon 's " Poetry is nothing else but feigned history " with Shakespeare 's " The truest poetry is the most feigning " ( As You Like It , 3 @.@ 3 @.@ 19 – 20 ) , and Bacon 's " He wished him not to shut the gate of your Majesty 's mercy " with Shakespeare 's " The gates of mercy shall be all shut up " ( Henry V , 3 @.@ 3 @.@ 10 ) . Delia Bacon argued that there were hidden political meanings in the plays and parallels between those ideas and Bacon 's known works . She proposed him as the leader of a group of disaffected philosopher @-@ politicians who tried to promote republican ideas to counter the despotism of the Tudor @-@ Stuart monarchies through the medium of the public stage . Later Bacon supporters found similarities between a great number of specific phrases and aphorisms from the plays and those written by Bacon in his waste book , the <unk> . In 1883 Mrs. Henry Pott edited Bacon 's <unk> and found 4 @,@ 400 parallels of thought or expression between Shakespeare and Bacon . 
 In a letter addressed to John Davies , Bacon closes " so <unk> you to bee good to concealed poets " , which according to his supporters is self @-@ referential . Baconians argue that while Bacon outlined both a scientific and moral philosophy in The Advancement of Learning ( 1605 ) , only the first part was published under his name during his lifetime . They say that his moral philosophy , including a revolutionary politico @-@ philosophic system of government , was concealed in the Shakespeare plays because of its threat to the monarchy . 
 Baconians suggest that the great number of legal allusions in the Shakespeare canon demonstrate the author 's expertise in the law . Bacon became Queen 's Counsel in 1596 and was appointed Attorney General in 1613 . Bacon also paid for and helped write speeches for a number of entertainments , including masques and <unk> , although he is not known to have authored a play . His only attributed verse consists of seven metrical psalters , following <unk> and Hopkins . 
 Since Bacon was knowledgeable about ciphers , early Baconians suspected that he left his signature encrypted in the Shakespeare canon . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries many Baconians claimed to have discovered ciphers throughout the works supporting Bacon as the true author . In 1881 , Mrs. C. F. Ashwood Windle claimed she had found carefully worked @-@ out jingles in each play that identified Bacon as the author . This sparked a cipher craze , and probative cryptograms were identified in the works by Ignatius Donnelly , Orville Ward Owen , Elizabeth Wells Gallup , and Dr. Isaac Hull Platt . Platt argued that the Latin word <unk> , found in Love 's Labour 's Lost , can be read as an anagram , yielding Hi ludi F. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " These plays , the offspring of F. Bacon , are preserved for the world . " ) . 
 = = = Edward de Vere , 17th Earl of Oxford = = = 
 Since the early 1920s , the leading alternative authorship candidate has been Edward de Vere , 17th Earl of Oxford and Lord Great Chamberlain of England . Oxford followed his grandfather and father in sponsoring companies of actors , and he also patronised a company of musicians and one of tumblers at one time . Oxford was an important courtier poet , praised as such and as a playwright by George <unk> and Francis Meres , who included him in a list of the " best for comedy amongst us " . Examples of his poetry but none of his theatrical works survive . Oxford was noted for his literary and theatrical patronage . Between 1564 and 1599 some 33 works were dedicated to him , including works by Arthur Golding , John Lyly , Robert Greene and Anthony Munday . In 1583 he bought the sublease of the first Blackfriars Theatre and gave it to the poet @-@ playwright Lyly , who operated it for a season under Oxford 's patronage . 
 Oxfordians believe certain literary allusions indicate that Oxford was one of the most prominent " suppressed " anonymous and / or pseudonymous writers of the day . They also note Oxford 's connections to the London theatre and the contemporary playwrights of Shakespeare 's day , his family connections including the patrons of Shakespeare 's First Folio , his relationships with Queen Elizabeth I and Shakespeare 's patron , the Earl of Southampton , his knowledge of Court life , his private tutors and education , and his wide @-@ ranging travels through the locations of Shakespeare 's plays in France and Italy . The case for Oxford 's authorship is also based on perceived similarities between Oxford 's biography and events in Shakespeare 's plays , sonnets and longer poems ; perceived parallels of language , idiom , and thought between Oxford 's letters and the Shakespearean canon ; and the discovery of numerous marked passages in Oxford 's Bible that appear in some form in Shakespeare 's plays . 
 The first to lay out a comprehensive case for Oxford 's authorship was J. Thomas Looney , an English schoolteacher who identified personality characteristics in Shakespeare 's works — especially Hamlet — that painted the author as an eccentric aristocratic poet , a drama and sporting enthusiast with a classical education who had travelled extensively to Italy . He discerned close affinities between the poetry of Oxford and that of Shakespeare in the use of motifs and subjects , phrasing , and rhetorical devices , which led him to identify Oxford as the author . After his Shakespeare Identified was published in 1920 , Oxford rapidly replaced Bacon as the most popular alternative candidate . 
 Oxford 's purported use of the " Shakespeare " pen name is attributed to the stigma of print , a convention that aristocratic authors could not take credit for writing plays for the public stage . Another motivation given is the politically explosive " Prince Tudor theory " that the youthful Oxford was Queen Elizabeth 's lover ; according to this theory , Oxford dedicated Venus and Adonis , The Rape of Lucrece , and the Sonnets to their son , England 's rightful Tudor Prince , Henry Wriothesley , who was brought up as the 3rd Earl of Southampton . 
 Oxfordians say that the dedication to the sonnets published in 1609 implies that the author was dead prior to their publication and that 1604 ( the year of Oxford 's death ) was the year regular publication of " newly corrected " and " augmented " Shakespeare plays stopped . Consequently , they date most of the plays earlier than the standard chronology and say that the plays which show evidence of revision and collaboration were left unfinished by Oxford and completed by other playwrights after his death . 
 = = = Christopher Marlowe = = = 
 The poet and dramatist Christopher Marlowe was born into the same social class as Shakespeare — his father was a cobbler , Shakespeare 's a glove @-@ maker . Marlowe was the older by only two months , but spent six and a half years at Cambridge University . He pioneered the use of blank verse in Elizabethan drama , and his works are widely accepted as having greatly influenced those of Shakespeare . Of his seven plays , all but one or two were first performed before 1593 . 
 The Marlovian theory argues that Marlowe 's documented death on 30 May 1593 was faked . Thomas Walsingham and others are supposed to have arranged the faked death , the main purpose of which was to allow Marlowe to escape trial and almost certain execution on charges of subversive atheism . The theory then argues that Shakespeare was chosen as the front behind whom Marlowe would continue writing his highly successful plays . These claims are founded on inferences derived from the circumstances of his apparent death , stylistic similarities between the works of Marlowe and Shakespeare , and hidden meanings found in the works and associated texts . 
 <unk> note that , despite Marlowe and Shakespeare being almost exactly the same age , the first work linked to the name William Shakespeare — Venus and Adonis — was on sale , with his name signed to the dedication , just 13 days after Marlowe 's reported death , having been registered with the Stationers ' Company on 18 April 1593 with no named author . Lists of verbal correspondences between the two canons have also been compiled . 
 Marlowe 's candidacy was initially suggested by T.W. White , in 1892 , as a member of a group of authors . He was first proposed as the sole author of Shakespeare 's " stronger plays " in 1895 by Wilbur G. Zeigler . His candidacy was revived by Calvin Hoffman in 1955 and , according to Shapiro , a recent surge in interest in the Marlowe case " may be a sign that the dominance of the Oxfordian camp may not extend much longer than the Baconian one " . 
 = = = William Stanley , 6th Earl of Derby = = = 
 William Stanley , 6th Earl of Derby , was first proposed as a candidate in 1891 by James Greenstreet and later supported by Abel <unk> and others . Greenstreet discovered that a Jesuit spy , George Fenner , reported in 1599 that Derby " is <unk> in penning <unk> for the common players . " That same year Derby was recorded as financing one of London 's two children 's drama companies , Paul 's Boys ; he also had his own company , Derby 's Men , which played multiple times at court in 1600 and 1601 . Derby was born three years before Shakespeare and died in 1642 , so his lifespan fits the consensus dating of the works . His initials were W. S. , and he was known to sign himself " Will " , which qualified him to write the punning " Will " sonnets . 
 Derby travelled in continental Europe in 1582 , visiting France and possibly Navarre . Love 's Labour 's Lost is set in Navarre and the play may be based on events that happened there between 1578 and 1584 . Derby married Elizabeth de Vere , whose maternal grandfather was William Cecil , thought by some critics to be the basis of the character of Polonius in Hamlet . Derby was associated with William Herbert , 3rd Earl of Pembroke , and his brother Philip Herbert , Earl of Montgomery and later 4th Earl of Pembroke , the " Incomparable Pair " to whom William Shakespeare 's First Folio is dedicated . When Derby released his estates to his son James around 1628 – 29 , he named Pembroke and Montgomery as trustees . Derby 's older brother , Ferdinando Stanley , 5th Earl of Derby , formed a group of players , the Lord Strange 's Men , some of whose members eventually joined the King 's Men , one of the companies most associated with Shakespeare .

 Summer Wars ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> Wōzu ) is a 2009 Japanese animated science fiction film directed by Mamoru Hosoda , animated by Madhouse and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures . The film 's voice cast includes <unk> Kamiki , Nanami Sakuraba , Mitsuki Tanimura , Sumiko Fuji and Ayumu Saitō . The film tells the story of Kenji Koiso , a timid eleventh @-@ grade math genius who is taken to Ueda by twelfth @-@ grade student Natsuki Shinohara to celebrate her great @-@ grandmother 's 90th birthday . However , he is falsely implicated in the hacking of a virtual world by a sadistic artificial intelligence named Love Machine . Kenji must repair the damage done to it and find a way to stop the rogue computer program from causing any further damage . 
 After producing The Girl Who Leapt Through Time , Madhouse was asked to produce something new . Hosoda and writer Satoko Okudera conceived a story about a social network and a stranger 's connection with a family . The real @-@ life city of Ueda was chosen as the setting for Summer Wars , as part of the territory was once governed by the Sanada clan and was close to Hosoda 's birthplace in Toyama . Hosoda used the clan as the basis for the Jinnouchi family after visiting his then @-@ fiancé 's home in Ueda . 
 Production of Summer Wars commenced in 2006 . Art director <unk> Takeshige incorporated Japanese houses into his background designs . Hosoda also insisted that 80 family members were to be included as main characters . The project was first announced at the 2008 Tokyo International Anime Fair and the first trailer of the film was released in April 2009 . Audience interest was fueled primarily through word of mouth and Internet publicity . A manga adaptation of the film was written by <unk> Sugimoto and began its serialization in July 2009 . 
 Summer Wars premiered in Japan on August 1 , 2009 . It grossed over US $ 1 million in its opening weekend in 127 theaters and ranked No. 7 at the box office . The film was well received by critics and the general audience and was financially successful , earning $ 18 million worldwide . It won several awards such as the 2010 Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year , the 2010 Japan Media Arts Festival 's Animation Division Grand Prize , the Anaheim International Film Festival 's Audience Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for the 2009 Golden Leopard award at the Locarno International Film Festival .

 Kenji Koiso ( <unk> Kamiki ) is a young student at <unk> High School with a gift for mathematics and a part @-@ time moderator in the massive computer @-@ simulated virtual reality world OZ along with his friend Takashi Sakuma ( Takahiro <unk> ) . 
 One day , Kenji is invited by fellow <unk> student Natsuki Shinohara ( Nanami Sakuraba ) to participate in the 90th birthday of her great @-@ grandmother Sakae Jinnouchi ( Sumiko Fuji ) . After traveling to Sakae 's estate in Ueda , Natsuki introduces Kenji as her fiancé to Sakae , surprising them both . Kenji meets several of Natsuki 's relatives and discovers that the Jinnouchis are descendants of a samurai ( vassal of the Takeda clan ) who challenged the Tokugawa clan in 1615 . He also meets Wabisuke Jinnouchi ( Ayumu Saitō ) , Natsuki 's half @-@ great @-@ uncle and a computer expert who has been living in the United States since stealing the family fortune 10 years ago . 
 Kenji receives an e @-@ mail with a mathematical code and cracks it . Love Machine , an artificial intelligence written by Wabisuke , uses Kenji 's account and avatar to hack the infrastructure , causing widespread damage . Kenji , Sakuma , and Natsuki 's cousin Kazuma Ikezawa ( Mitsuki Tanimura ) confront Love Machine . Love Machine defeats Kazuma 's avatar King Kazma and continues to consume accounts in the OZ mainframe , creating catastrophic traffic congestion and disabling electrical devices . Two of Sakae 's relatives , Rika ( Sakiko Tamagawa ) and Shota Jinnouchi ( Yutaka Shimizu ) , discover Kenji 's involvement . Shota arrests Kenji , but the congestion causes Natsuki to return them to the estate . 
 Sakae calls associates in important positions in Japanese society and relatives who work in emergency services , encouraging them to work their hardest to reduce chaos and damage , comparing the situation to war . Kenji is able to return control of the mainframe to the moderators and engineers . Wabisuke explains that he sold the program to the United States Armed Forces for a test run . After an argument with Sakae , Wabisuke leaves the estate . Sakae later encourages Kenji to take care of Natsuki during a Koi @-@ Koi match . 
 The next morning , Sakae is discovered dead by Kenji and the Jinnouchis . Her youngest son <unk> ( Tadashi Nakamura ) explains that she had angina , and that Love Machine had deactivated her heart monitor . Kenji , Sakuma , and most of the Jinnouchis initiate a plan to defeat Love Machine with a supercomputer using ice blocks as a coolant , while Natsuki and the others prepare a funeral for Sakae . 
 Kenji , along with Sakuma and the others , capture Love Machine , but Shota carries the ice blocks to Sakae 's body , causing the supercomputer to overheat . Love Machine consumes King Kazma and redirects the Arawashi Asteroid Probe onto a collision course with a nuclear power plant . Meanwhile , Natsuki discovers a will left by Sakae and reunites with Kenji and the rest of the group . Natsuki has Wabisuke return home before the family reads Sakae 's will , asking them to bring Wabisuke back to their lives . Realizing that Love Machine sees everything as a game , Kenji has the Jinnouchis confront Love Machine to play Koi @-@ Koi in OZ 's casino world , wagering their accounts in a desperate attempt to stop Love Machine . Natsuki wins several rounds , but gets distracted and nearly loses her " winnings " . 
 However , OZ users worldwide enter their own accounts into the wager on Natsuki 's side , which also prompts the guardian programs of OZ — the blue and red whales known as John and Yoko — to upgrade Natsuki 's account . Natsuki wagers the 150 million avatars given to her in a single hand and critically damages Love Machine , prompting the artificial intelligence to redirect the Arawashi towards Sakae 's estate . Kenji attempts to break into the probe 's GPS , while Wabisuke disables Love Machine 's defenses . After being revived and assisted by several of the Jinnouchi family 's avatars , King Kazma destroys Love Machine . Kenji activates the GPS code to redirect the Arawashi away from the estate , destroying the estate 's entrance and causing a geyser to erupt . In the aftermath , the Jinnouchi family , celebrating their victory as well as Sakae 's birthday , has Natsuki kiss Kenji after they confess their love to each other .

 After the critical and commercial success of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time , Madhouse was offered to produce another film . Whereas Madhouse based the previous film on a novel , the studio was given the chance to create the next film . Director Mamoru Hosoda selected a story for both people with family and those without having a family . Production of Summer Wars commenced in 2006 . 
 Most of the film is set in the real @-@ life city of Ueda . Ueda was chosen as the primary setting of the film because it is located in a territory formerly governed by the prominent Sanada clan , upon which the Jinnouchi family is based . Ueda is also close to Hosoda 's birthplace in Toyama . Hosoda 's inspiration for the name of the social network OZ came from a large supermarket that he once visited while still working for Toei Animation at the time . Although noting similarities between OZ and Second Life , Hosoda also cited the Japanese social networking website <unk> as a primary influence because of his experiences . For the color and design of OZ , he cited Nintendo games as inspiration . The design aesthetic was compared by some reviewers to the appearance of OZ . Hosoda said that he admires the artwork of Takashi Murakami , but designed the social network as a " clean , uncluttered look . " During production , Hosoda visited his then @-@ fiancé 's house in Ueda , and experienced the history of her family 's life . Hosoda cited his influence of using a family as the basis of the film from his marriage and from attending several film festivals . 
 In addition to Hosoda , the team included writer Satoko Okudera and character designer Yoshiyuki Sadamoto , who previously worked with Hosoda on The Girl Who Leapt Through Time . Hiroyuki Aoyama served as an animation director , while action animation direction was handled by <unk> Nishida . During production , Sadamoto based Wabisuke 's design on those of actor Yusaku Matsuda . Aoyama was responsible for supervising the animation of the real world scenes , while Nishida supervised the animation for the digital world , using both traditional animation and computer animation techniques . Digital animation studio Digital Frontier was responsible for creating the visuals of OZ and its avatars . <unk> Takeshige oversaw the art direction for Summer Wars . While visiting Ueda , Hosoda thought that Takeshige , who has previously worked with Studio Ghibli , should draw traditional Japanese houses for the film . The film also features the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa , whose control center is located in the nearby city of Saku . Hosoda included the spacecraft to support Japan 's contribution towards space exploration . 
 The film was announced at the 2008 Tokyo International Anime Fair . At the 2009 Otakon convention Madhouse president Masao Maruyama said that Hosoda insisted on including 80 family members as its main characters . Maruyama then quipped that he asked Hosoda to promise only two main characters and two years of production for his next film . Summer Wars was one film in Madhouse 's larger theatrical film release strategy , to release one new film each season for the next year . The release of Summer Wars was followed by Mai Mai Miracle and Yona Yona Penguin in 2009 with Redline released during the first half of 2010 .

 A high level of anticipation surrounded Summer Wars before its release , due to the critical and popular success of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time . Kadokawa Shoten promoted the film online through their official YouTube channel , aiming at international as well as domestic fans . On April 8 , 2009 , a one @-@ minute high @-@ definition ( HD ) trailer was released followed by a longer trailer on June 16 . On July 29 , the Japanese website of Yahoo ! Movies streamed the first five minutes of the film and Kadokawa offered the footage on their YouTube channel several days later to allow for international viewing . It also offered two of the film 's 15 @-@ second television adverts online . Before its release Masao Maruyama believed that " the film should be pretty popular , since the pre @-@ sales for the tickets are very high " . 
 <unk> Sugimoto 's manga adaptation of the film was featured in the July 2009 debut issue of Kadokawa 's manga magazine Young Ace . The first compilation volume of Sugimoto 's work was released in Japan on August 10 and debuted in 23rd place on the Oricon comic ranking , selling 51 @,@ 645 copies .

 Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 76 % of critics have given the film a positive review based on 21 reviews with an average rating of 7 / 10 . At Metacritic , which uses a normalized rating system , the film earned a " generally favorable " level rating of 63 / 100 based on 12 reviews by mainstream critics . 
 Mark Schilling of The Japan Times rated the film 5 out of 5 stars and observed that Summer Wars " may contain familiar elements , beginning with its bashful , <unk> young hero , but it combines them in ways fresh , contemporary and dazzlingly imaginative " . He also said that the film provides a social commentary on the differences between an " analog world " and a " realm of digital devices " . Schilling titled his article " The future king of Japanese animation may be with us ; Hosoda steps out of Miyazaki 's shadow with dazzling new film " . He praised Sadamoto , Aoyama and Nishida for producing " scenes of animated spectacle that , in their dazzling fluency of motion and untethered brilliance of invention , makes the usual SF / fantasy anime look childish and dull " . Twitch Film published a review by Guillem Rosset who also referenced Miyazaki noting that following The Girl Who Leapt Through Time " cries went out immediately hailing him [ Hosoda ] as the heir apparent " . He claimed that with Summer Wars , " Hosoda is the new king , the best story teller working within the animated medium in Japan and – quite possibly – the world . " Rosset praised the film itself as " richly detailed and beautifully written ... gorgeous to look at . " and " blessed with an extensive cast of stunningly detailed and authentic characters . " He concluded by saying " Hosoda has perfectly balanced the need to entertain via the visuals with the rich and satisfying character work that separates him from the massive pack of quality technicians to establish himself as truly a master story teller . " He also noted that " The wonderful cast of characters is one of the film 's greatest strengths " while also highlighting that , of the virtual world of OZ , " Here the creative minds of Madhouse can let their imagination run wild . " With regards to the technical aspects , Rosset called the film " a top class audiovisual show . " He concluded by writing " Mamoru <unk> deserves a place as one of the top contemporary Japanese animators . And it 's good to know that once the time comes for Miyazaki to retire ( not too soon I hope ! ) there 's people capable of following his steps . " The Korean newspaper Herald Business saw the film 's fantasy theme and gorgeous animation as a differentiator from works produced by Hollywood studios . 
 Patrick W. Galbraith of <unk> compared the design of OZ to Takashi Murakami 's artwork , specifically " the flatness , or slick , polished surfaces " and then contrasted them with the sequences in Nagano noting , " it has a warm and lived in feel to it , aided by a scrupulous attention to detail . " Of the story and characters Galbraith wrote that " scenes such as the large family coming together and talking over dinner are heartwarming and hilarious . " and compared the movie to " a moving picture book , a family photo album turned back a few decades . " He also noted the audience response , reporting sold @-@ out screenings two nights in a row , and highlighting handwritten notes left at the theater by " <unk> of fans who on the spot decided to move to Nagano " In conclusion , Galbraith wrote " there is an innocence and purity to this work that really reminds [ him ] of Miyazaki Hayao and Studio Ghibli back in the day , and the stellar backgrounds invoke Shinkai Makoto . " Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network gave the film an ' A ' rating and wrote that " decades from now , Summer Wars will be seen as the official arrival of [ director ] Mamoru Hosoda into the realm of historically important anime directors . " He called the film " a near @-@ perfect blend of social satire and science fiction , at once timely and timeless , sardonic and optimistic . " and noted that the film is " practically overflowing with sharp social insight in a way we have not seen from anime in years . " Sevakis praised Yoshiyuki Sadamoto 's character designs and highlighted the visuals as " sharp and consistently great " . In summing the film up he called Summer Wars " Incredibly entertaining , and intriguingly intelligent . Accessible and fast @-@ paced . Pretty much perfect . " Similarities have been commented on between the film and a previous work of Hosoda , Digimon Adventure : Our War Game . Neo magazine has stated that Our War Game is " plainly a prototype " of Summer Wars . Rachel Saltz of The New York Times also gave a positive review of the film . Saltz praised Mamoru Hosoda 's direction , and says it " matches the clean , classically composed images of his [ Hosoda 's ] outer story . " She further praised the visuals and themes , comparing it to those of director Yasujirō Ozu . In his review for Variety critic Peter Debruge stated that Hosoda 's direction " appeals to the hard @-@ to @-@ please teen crowd by taking mind @-@ bending ideas and planting them within a relatable contempo context . " He also praised the CG animation in the OZ sequences . Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Hosoda 's style and said that it " adds enough dimensions to his characters and kinetic battles that the serene real world seems like a dream state . " He also likened Hosoda 's style to that of Hayao Miyazaki and Nintendo . Hartlaub complained that Kenji 's character is " a bit too over @-@ caffeinated in the first part " and concluded that the film is " the kind of fun and quirky film that you don 't see very often in art houses this time of year . " Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film 3 out of 4 stars . He stated that " Summer Wars is most appealing in its hushed moments " and also praised Satoko Okudera 's writing , stating that it " stakes a claim for the non @-@ virtual world of history and of family ties that stretch back to Japan ’ s medieval era . " He also praised the OZ animation sequences as " visually ravishing explorations of white @-@ on @-@ white cyberspace , but the hectic gaming action sequences feel curiously passé . " Burr notes that in the film , " it 's what 's old that 's made to seem refreshingly new . " In his review for the New York Post V.A. Musetto gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and called the film " great despite its structural problems " . Musetto also complained about the storyline , stating that the " sci @-@ fi elements seem silly rather than suspenseful . " Nicolas Rapold of The Village Voice also praised the film 's visuals , and said that " it ’ s hard to appreciate things like the character detail amid the insufferably <unk> voicing and arbitrary suspense . " 
 Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised the film 's visuals , stating that " Summer Wars is awesome in its detailed depiction of Oz , which floats in space with an array of satellites , and earthly cityscapes visited by calamities . " Thomas also said the film is " also a superb example of Japanese anime , balancing science fiction fantasy with a paean to the timeless value of family life . " and called it " a sophisticated yet poignant family entertainment with an appeal beyond Japanese animation buffs . " Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film 2 out of 4 stars . Merry criticized the film 's plot , stating that it " ventures into territory both melodramatic and corny . " Merry also said that the relationship between Natsuki and Kenji " unfolds as blandly as a Debra Messing rom @-@ com . " Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter stated that the " increasingly convoluted narrative may be too difficult to follow for younger viewers , " but said that the film 's " thematic ambition and dazzling visual style ultimately make it one of the more rewarding anime efforts to reach these [ American ] shores .

 = Tan Chay Wa 's tombstone trial = 
 The Tan Chay Wa 's tombstone trial was a sequence of unusual events regarding an inscribed tombstone of a political dissident , Tan Chay Wa , that sparked a court case in Singapore in 1983 . His older brother Tan Chu Boon was arrested and charged on suspicion that he designed an elaborate but ' subversive ' tombstone , which had engraved on it words glorifying the communist cause . The story of the case was later taken up in London by The Sunday Times a few months after the trial , making the case an internationally known issue . 
 = = History = = 
 The Malayan National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) , an organisation of the Communist Party of Malaya ( CPM ) , was formed in 1968 to support the overthrow of the governments of Singapore and Malaysia . The countries had been declared independent in 1965 , but the communists rejected their separation . From 1968 to 1974 , the armed struggle included planting booby trap bombs in public places . The MNLF was also involved in collecting supplies such as medicine , explosives and assorted equipment for the Malayan National Liberation Army ( MNLA ) , which was the military arm of the CPM operating in the border area of northern Malaysia and southern Thailand . 
 In 1976 , after a prolonged investigation , Singapore 's Internal Security Department arrested hundreds of MNLF members together with many documents , arms and explosives in a sting operation in Singapore . Twenty @-@ three members were released after interrogation , seventeen were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act ( ISA ) and ten turned over to the Malaysian police for suspected involvement in terrorist activities in Malaysia . 
 = = = Tan Chay Wa = = = 
 Tan Chay Wa ( 1948 – 1983 ) , a political dissident and a senior official of the MNLF , managed to escape from Singapore to Malaysia as the ISD officers closed in on him . Chay Wa was a bus driver and a married man living in Singapore . On 2 June 1979 , Chay Wa was arrested at a vegetable farm in Johor ; he had a .32 <unk> semi @-@ automatic pistol and seven bullets in his possession . He was convicted under Malaysia 's Essential Security Cases ( Amendment ) Regulations ( <unk> ) by Johor Bahru 's High Court , which provides for a mandatory death penalty . During his detention , there was an offer by the Government of Belgium to grant him political asylum should he be allowed to leave <unk> but he was hanged on 18 January 1983 in Kuala Lumpur 's Pudu Prison . 
 Chay Wa 's body was brought back to Singapore by his older brother , Tan Chu Boon . Chu Boon arranged for his brother 's body to be buried in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery on 20 January 1983 . However , Chu Boon was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) Secret Society Investigation Branch at his flat on 28 May 1983 on suspicion that he designed an elaborate but subversive tombstone , which had engraved on it words glorifying the communist cause . 
 = = = ' Subversive ' tombstone trial = = = 
 At his November 1983 trial , Chu Boon argued in court that he was neither a communist nor did he have political leanings of any kind ; he did not monitor or even read the proposed inscription handed to him on a piece of paper by his brother 's widow , which was given to the tombstone <unk> . The inscription in Chinese , written in emotive language , read : 
 The court then heard that the CID started investigating the tombstone on 11 May 1983 and had seized the original piece of paper from the tombstone @-@ maker 's shop in Choa Chu Kang . Chu Boon 's defence lawyer was J.B. Jeyaretnam who had long been a consistent thorn in the side of Singapore 's political establishment . Jeyaretnam established that the instigation for the CID investigation and arrest had come from " a government department " . In mitigation , Jeyaretnam made the point that , apart from immediate family and friends , the public would not have known about the ' subversive ' tombstone nor its inscription in Singapore 's biggest cemetery . 
 The court threw out Chu Boon 's defence plea and he was convicted on grounds that he had " under his control , the tombstone of his brother , Tan Chay Wa , on which was engraved in Chinese characters an inscription which tended to advocate acts prejudicial to the security of Singapore . " He was sentenced to a year in jail ; on appeal this was reduced to a month . 
 = = = <unk> publicity = = = 
 The court case hearing of Chu Boon had one unintended consequence ; it made Chay Wa much better known to the public than he may otherwise have been . As a result , the story was later taken up in London by The Sunday Times a few months after the trial , making the case internationally known and depicting the Singapore government in a hostile manner . Robust " don 't interfere in our internal affairs " retorts soon emerged from government circles . 
 When the public debates were over , the case was not completely forgotten . In his 1986 book The Tiger and the Trojan Horse , British author Dennis Bloodworth noted that " the ideograms in stone , chiselled by a sentient hand , were proof that this was the epitaph of a man , not a movement . "

 Chay Wa 's grave is in Choa Chu Kang Cemetery 's Buddhist sector , grave number <unk> , Block 8 . It is difficult to locate , as it stands in a sea of tombstones that stretch almost as far as the eye can see . In 1985 , it was reported that the inscription of the tombstone had been whited out with plaster by members of Tan 's own family who wished to obscure any glorification of Chay Wa 's " martyrdom " in the communist cause . At that time , all that could be seen clearly was a photograph of Chay Wa and some lettering showing his name and the years of his birth and death . 
 = Braunschweig @-@ class battleship = 
 The Braunschweig @-@ class battleships were pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Kaiserliche Marine ( the German Imperial Navy ) . The class comprised five ships : Braunschweig , Elsass , Hessen , Preussen , and Lothringen . The ships were an improvement over the preceding Wittelsbach class ; the ships mounted a more powerful main battery , were two knots faster , and had better armor protection . 
 The five ships all saw active service during World War I , primarily as coast defense ships in the IV Battle Squadron . Hessen was transferred to the II Battle Squadron in 1916 and took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . All five ships of the class were retained by the Reichsmarine following Germany 's defeat in World War I , and saw further service in a variety of roles . Hessen was eventually rebuilt as a radio @-@ controlled target ship , while Preussen and Lothringen were converted into minesweeper tenders . All of the ships , with the exception of Hessen , were broken up in the 1930s ; Hessen survived until the end of World War II , when she was taken over by the Soviet Navy , for continued use as a target ship .

The ships had thirteen watertight compartments and a double bottom for 60 percent of the length of the hull . The ships displaced 13 @,@ 208 tonnes at their designed weight , and 14 @,@ 394 t at a full load . 
 The ships were described as good sea @-@ boats , but were prone to heavy pitching . The ships were responsive and had a tight turning radius at low speed , but at hard rudder of 12 degrees , the ships lost up to 70 percent speed . The ships had a crew of 35 officers and 708 men normally , and when serving as a squadron flagship , they had an additional 13 officers and 66 men . The ships carried a number of smaller boats aboard , including two picket boats , two launches , a pinnace ( later removed ) , two cutters , two yawls , and two dinghies .

Hessen suffered from unstable steering , which increased fuel consumption and shortened her operational range to 4 @,@ 530 nmi ( 8 @,@ 390 km ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The first two ships — Braunschweig and Elsass had four generators that produced 230 kW ( 74 V ) , while three following ships — Hessen , Preussen , and Lothringen had four turbo @-@ generators that provided 260 kW ( 110 V ) .

The main battery turrets had 50 mm thick roofs and 250 mm sides . The secondary battery turrets were protected by 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) of armor , while the casemated guns had gun shields 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 75 in ) thick . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships ' main armament was increased from previous designs , but still weaker than contemporary foreign battleships . The main armament comprised four 28 cm ( 11 in ) SK L / 40 quick @-@ firing guns in twin turrets , increased from four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns from previous designs , compared with the 12 in ( 30 cm ) guns used on many foreign ships . The guns could depress down to − 4 degrees , and elevate to + 30 degrees , which enabled a maximum range of 18 @,@ 800 m ( 20 @,@ 600 yd ) . The guns fired 529 lb shells at a muzzle velocity of 2690 feet per second ( 820 m / s ) The main battery had a total of 340 shells , for 85 shells per gun . 
 The secondary battery consisted of fourteen 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) SK L / 40 quick @-@ firing guns , four of which were mounted in single turrets amidships , with the remaining ten in casemates around the superstructure . The guns fired 141 lb shells at a muzzle velocity of <unk> f / s ( 850 m / s ) . The turret @-@ mounted guns could be elevated to 30 degrees , for a maximum range of 16 @,@ 900 m ( 18 @,@ 500 yds ) , while the casemated guns could only elevate to 22 degrees , and had a correspondingly lower range of 14 @,@ 500 m ( 15 @,@ 850 yd ) . These guns had a total of 1820 shells , for 130 rounds per gun . To transit the Kiel Canal , the three central 17 cm casemated guns had to be withdrawn into their housings , as they were unable to train fully flush with the sides of the ships . With the guns fully emplaced , the ships would have been too wide to fit in the canal . 
 The ships also had fourteen 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 35 quick @-@ firing guns in casemates along the length of the ship . The guns fired 15 @.@ 4 lb shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 526 f / t ( 770 m / s ) , and could be elevated to 25 degrees for a maximum range of 9 @,@ 090 m ( 9 @,@ 940 yd ) . They were also armed with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , with a total of 16 torpedoes .

 Braunschweig was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in 1901 , was launched on 20 December 1902 , and commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1904 . Elsass was built at Schichau in Danzig , starting in 1901 . The ship was launched on 26 May 1903 and commissioned on 29 November 1904 . Hessen was also built at Germaniawerft , starting in 1902 . She was launched on 18 September 1903 , and commissioned just over two years later on 19 September 1905 . Preussen was laid down in 1902 at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin , launched on 30 October 1903 , and commissioned into the fleet on 12 July 1905 . Lothringen , the final ship of the class , was laid down at the Schichau dockyards in 1902 . She was launched on 27 May 1904 , and commissioned just under two years later on 18 May 1906 .

 At the start of the First World War , the members of the Braunschweig class were assigned to IV Battle Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt , and tasked with coastal defense duties . Braunschweig and Elsass both participated in the early portion of the Battle of the Gulf of Riga . The two ships kept the Russian pre @-@ dreadnought Slava at bay while a Russian minefield was cleared , but the Russian forces put up a strong defense . Vice Admiral Schmidt decided to withdraw his forces when it became apparent that the mine clearing had taken too long , and there wasn 't sufficient daylight left for the minelayer Deutschland to lay a minefield of its own . In 1916 , Hessen was assigned to II Battle Squadron , and participated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . Late in the day on the 31st , Hessen and the other pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron briefly engaged Vice Admiral David Beatty 's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron , and in doing so , covered the withdrawal of the battered German battlecruisers under the command of Franz von Hipper . 
 Starting in 1916 , the ships of the Braunschweig class were withdrawn from active service , primarily because of manpower shortages . Braunschweig was used as a training ship , and on 20 August 1917 , was converted into a barracks ship in Kiel . Elsass was also used as a barracks and training ship in Kiel , having been withdrawn from active service on 25 July 1916 . Hessen was converted into a depot ship in Brunsbüttel in 1917 , while Preussen became a depot ship in Wilhelmshaven that same year . Lothringen was withdrawn from service in 1917 and used as an engineer training ship in Wilhelmshaven . Guns removed from these ships starting in 1916 were used by the Imperial Army in WWI as railway guns . 
 = = = Post @-@ World War I = = = 
 Because all of Germany 's powerful dreadnoughts had either been scuttled in Scapa Flow or ceded to the Allies as war prizes , the Braunschweig @-@ class battleships were recommissioned into the newly reorganized Reichsmarine . In the years following World War I , Braunschweig , Elsass , and Hessen were to be rebuilt as coastal defense ships , although this plan was abandoned . Braunschweig served in the Reichsmarine from 1921 to 1926 , at which point she was withdrawn from active duty . On 31 May 1931 , she was stricken and converted into a hulk at Wilhelmshaven , and eventually scrapped . Elsass saw active duty in the fleet from 1924 until 25 February 1930 , at which point she was removed from active service . On 31 March 1931 , she was stricken , hulked in Wilhelmshaven . On 31 October 1935 , Elsass was sold to Norddeutscher @-@ Lloyd in Bremerhaven , and scrapped in 1936 . 
 Hessen served in the fleet from 1925 to 12 November 1934 , when she was withdrawn and converted into a target ship . Conversion work lasted from 31 March 1935 to 1 April 1937 , when she was recommissioned as a target . She served in this capacity until 1945 ; at the end of World War II , she was renamed Tsel and ceded to the Soviet Union . The ship was eventually scrapped in the 1960s . Preussen saw active service with the fleet as a minesweeper depot ship from 1919 to 5 April 1929 , when she was stricken from the navy list . The ship was sold for breaking on 25 February 1931 for 216 @,@ 800 Mark , and scrapped in Wilhelmshaven . A 63 m ( 68 @.@ 9 yd ) section of the hull was kept for use as a torpedo target and other explosives . The hull section was bombed and sunk by Allied aircraft in April 1945 . The wreck was eventually raised and scrapped in 1954 . Lothringen was also converted into a minesweeper depot ship , and she served in this capacity from 1922 to 1926 . The ship was stricken on 31 March 1931 , sold for scrapping for 269 @,@ 650 Marks , and broken up by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg . 
 = Another One Rides the Bus ( EP ) = 
 Another One Rides the Bus is the debut extended play ( EP ) by American parodist " Weird Al " Yankovic . It was released in February 1981 by Placebo Records . The title song is a parody of English rock band Queen 's 1980 single " Another One Bites the Dust " . The EP also features three other songs , all of which are original recordings . All four songs on Another One Rides the Bus later appeared on Yankovic 's eponymous debut studio album ; the three original songs were re @-@ recorded for the album , while the title song is the same version that appears on the EP . 
 Another One Rides the Bus was released to capitalize on the recent success of the titular parody . Yankovic borrowed money from Barret " Dr. Demento " Hansen to pay for the record , and distributed them to records stores under consignment deals . Due to the underground success of the record , TK Records signed Yankovic for a while and released " Another One Bites the Dust " as a single . Only one thousand copies of this record were made , and today it is considered very rare .

 The EP features the titular parody , as well as three original comedy songs , with music written by Yankovic . In April 1980 , Yankovic recorded the first song for the album , " Gotta Boogie " . The song , co @-@ written by Joe Earley , is a play on words discussing a man with a " boogie " on his finger and his quandary therein . The second song to be recorded for the EP was " Another One Rides the Bus " , on September 14 , 1980 . Yankovic wrote the song , a parody of Queen 's hit " Another One Bites the Dust " , and debuted it live on the Dr. Demento Show , hosted by Barret " Dr. Demento " Hansen . While practicing the song outside the sound booth , Yankovic met Jon " Bermuda " Schwartz who told Yankovic he was a drummer . Schwartz agreed to drum on Yankovic 's accordion case to keep a steady beat to the song . " Another One Rides the Bus " became so popular that it got Yankovic his first appearance on a TV show , The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder . On the show , Yankovic played his accordion and Schwartz banged on Yankovic 's accordion case and played the bulb horns . 
 In January 1981 , the song " Mr. Frump in the Iron Long " was recorded . The song , an audience favorite from Yankovic 's days playing in coffeehouses at Cal Poly , describes the rather lopsided relationship between the narrator and the eponymous " Mr. Frump " in his iron lung , until the latter 's death . The final song , recorded on January 19 , 1981 , was " Happy Birthday " . A morbidly depressing birthday song detailing ails of the world , including poverty , nuclear holocaust , and eventual solar cataclysm , the song is based on the music of artist Tonio K. Only seeing two popular birthday songs at the time — " Happy Birthday to You " by Patty and Mildred J. Hill , and " Birthday " by The Beatles — Yankovic decided to write his own " severely twisted version of one " . The EP 's version of " Happy Birthday " is included on the Permanent Record : Al in the Box box set , and was remixed into stereo for the Hurricane Katrina charity album Laughter Is a Powerful Weapon Volume II . All three of the songs would be re @-@ recorded for Yankovic 's eponymous debut studio album . 
 = = Release = = 
 Yankovic desired to release the song on a record label , although no label wanted to sign him at the time . Thus , Yankovic borrowed some money from Dr. Demento and pressed up one thousand copies of the four @-@ track EP by himself . Yankovic then distributed the EP to various record stores , selling them through consignment deals . Yankovic released the record under Placebo Records , a one @-@ off label founded by Yankovic for the sole purpose of distributing the EPs . Due to the underground success of the record , Yankovic was eventually able to secure a short @-@ lived record deal with TK Records , who released the title song as a single . Due to the fact that only one thousand copies of this record were made , today it is considered a very rare record to locate .

 = Scorpion @-@ class ironclad = 
 The two Scorpion class ironclads , HMS Scorpion and HMS Wivern , were ironclad warships ordered by the Confederate States Navy in 1862 and seized in 1863 by the British to prevent their delivery . This would have violated the Foreign Enlistment Act , which forbade British subjects to build or arm any ships for governments at war with governments friendly to Great Britain . The Scorpion @-@ class were masted turret ships , each with two gun turrets that were designed to mount a pair of heavy muzzle @-@ loading guns . They were purchased for service in the Royal Navy in 1864 and served briefly with the Channel Fleet before they became guard ships at Bermuda and Hong Kong . Scorpion was sold in 1903 and sank under tow to be scrapped , while Wivern was sold for scrap in 1922 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 In March 1862 , a contract was placed with Laird & Son Co. by Captain James D. Bulloch , a naval agent for the Confederate States of America , for two double @-@ turreted warships designed for ramming attacks at a cost of £ 93 @,@ 750 each , exclusive of armament and ammunition . They were intended , together with other warships , to break the Federal blockade of Confederate coastal cities and to hold some Northern cities for ransom . 
 The ships had an length between perpendiculars of 224 feet 6 inches ( 68 @.@ 4 m ) , a beam of 42 feet 4 inches ( 12 @.@ 9 m ) , and a draught of 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) at deep load . They displaced 2 @,@ 751 long tons ( 2 @,@ 795 t ) . The hull was divided by 12 watertight bulkheads and the ships had a double bottom beneath the engine and boiler rooms . Their crew consisted of 152 officers and men . 
 The gun turrets , designed by Captain Coles of the Royal Navy , sat on circular turntables that were built on an iron radial platform with arms that rested on beveled wheels 18 inches ( 457 mm ) in diameter . Each turret required a crew of 18 men to rotate them via a system of rack and pinion gears ; one minute was required for a full 360 ° rotation . They could be rotated from inside the turret as well from outside . In emergencies the turret could be turned by a block and tackle as well as use of <unk> . A leather flap extended around the bottom of the turret and over the gap between the turret and the deck to reduce any water leakage through the gap . Like most contemporary ironclads they were fitted with a forged iron ram . 
 The ships had 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) of freeboard that could be increased by 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) hinged bulwarks abreast the turrets . In service the ships proved to be buoyant and seaworthy although they rolled heavily which meant that their decks were often awash . Their flat bottom and small rudder , however , caused steering problems before the wind . Because of their seaworthiness and powerful guns they have been judged superior to any monitor built by the United States Navy . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Scorpion @-@ class ships had two horizontal direct acting steam engines , built by Lairds , driving a single three @-@ bladed , 14 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) propeller . Their engines were powered by four tubular boilers at a working pressure of 20 psi ( 138 kPa ; 1 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines produced a total of 1 @,@ 450 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 080 kW ) which gave the ships a maximum speed of 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ; 12 @.@ 1 mph ) . Wivern reached a maximum speed just over 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) during her sea trials on 4 October 1865 . The ships carried 336 long tons ( 341 t ) of coal , enough to steam 1 @,@ 210 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 240 km ; 1 @,@ 390 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ships were barque @-@ rigged with three masts . Scorpion had conventional shrouds to anchor the masts in place , but Wivern was the first ship to have tripod masts to reduce interference with the firing arcs of the gun turrets . The funnel was made semi @-@ retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 No ordnance had been ordered by the Confederates before the ships were seized in 1863 , but in British service they mounted a pair of 9 @-@ inch rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns in each turret . The shell of the 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) gun weighed 254 pounds ( 115 @.@ 2 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 12 long tons ( 12 t ) . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 420 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 11 @.@ 3 inches ( 290 mm ) of wrought iron armour at 100 yards ( 91 m ) . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . According to Parkes , going from full depression to full elevation supposedly took one hour in smooth water and with an even keel ! 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The Scorpion @-@ class ships had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick amidships and thinned to 3 inches ( 76 mm ) at the bow and 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) at the stern . It completely covered the hull from the upper deck to 3 feet 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 99 m ) below the waterline . The armour protection of the polygonal turrets was quite elaborate . The inside of the turret was lined with .5 inches ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) of iron boiler plate to which T @-@ shaped beams were bolted . The space between the beams was filled with 10 inches ( 254 mm ) of teak . This was covered by an iron lattice .75 inches ( 19 @.@ 1 mm ) thick that was covered in turn by 8 inches ( 203 mm ) of teak . The 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 mm ) iron plates were bolted to the outside using bolts that ran through to the interior iron " skin " . The area around the gun ports was reinforced by 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch plates to give a total thickness of 10 inches . The turret roof consisted of T @-@ shaped beams covered by 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) iron plates . Holes in the roof were provided for ventilation and for the gun captain to use to aim the turret .

 In his letter of 29 October 1862 , Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory named yard number 294 as North Carolina and number 295 as Mississippi . In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary , Lord Russell , notified Bulloch , who had purchased the ships in his own name , that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war . Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863 , nominally on behalf of the Egyptian government , with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea . The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships , so this was superficially plausible . North Carolina , later HMS Scorpion , was given the cover name of El <unk> and Mississippi , later HMS Wivern , received the name of El <unk> . Lord Russel , prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador , Charles F. Adams queried the Egyptian government directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge to disguise the true ownership of the vessels . The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship , HMS Majestic , to watch over the newly launched El <unk> after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September . The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed not to let the ship leave her graving dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October . 
 The legality of this seizure was seriously disputed , but the British government had already been somewhat embarrassed by the activities of the Alabama , a ship also built by Laird Son & Co and operated as a commerce raider by the Confederate Navy . In order to overshadow discussions as to the legality of their action , the British government purchased the ships on 8 August 1864 for £ 25 @,@ 000 in excess of the contract price . 
 = = Service = = 
 Both ships were assigned to the Channel Fleet upon commissioning in 1865 . Scorpion was refitted in 1867 with a flying bridge that connected the forecastle to the poop , above the tops of the turrets , and her sailing rig was reduced to a fore @-@ and @-@ aft rig . The ship recommissioned in 1868 for another tour with the Channel Fleet . She arrived in Bermuda in November 1869 where she became the local guard ship . In 1873 a proposal was made to remove her poop and forecastle , masts and deck fitting to convert her to a harbour defence monitor with all @-@ around fire , but this was deemed too expensive and the project was abandoned in 1878 . At some point during her service in Bermuda her rigging was removed and she was reduced to simple pole masts . The ship was fitted with searchlights and quick @-@ firing guns in 1890 . Scorpion was sunk as a target in 1901 ; she was raised in 1902 and sold in February 1903 for £ 736 . She sank while under tow to Boston , Massachusetts . 
 Wivern burst one of her 9 @-@ inch guns in 1867 , but none of the 13 people in the turret was injured . She was given the same sort of refit as her sister ship in Devonport beginning in August 1868 . The ship became the guard ship at Hull from January through October 1870 and was then placed in reserve from 1870 until 1880 . That year she was sent to Hong Kong where she became the harbour defence ship . Wivern became a distilling ship in 1898 and was sold in May 1922 for scrap . 
 = Bughouse chess = 
 Bughouse chess ( also known as Exchange chess , Siamese chess , Tandem chess , Transfer chess , Double bughouse , Cross chess , Swap chess or simply bughouse or bug ) is a popular chess variant played on two chessboards by four players in teams of two . Normal chess rules apply , except that captured pieces on one board are passed on to the teammate on the other board , who then has the option of putting these pieces on his or her board . 
 The game is usually played at a fast time control ; this , together with the passing and dropping of pieces , can make the game look chaotic and random to the casual onlooker ; hence the name bughouse , which is slang for mental hospital . The game is traditionally played as a diversion from regular chess both over the board and online . Yearly , several dedicated bughouse tournaments are organised on a national and an international level . 
 = = Rules = = 
 Bughouse is a chess variant played on two chessboards by four players in teams of two . Each team member faces one opponent of the other team . Partners sit next to each other and one player has black , while the other has white . Each player plays the opponent as in a standard chess game , with the exception of the rules specified below . 
 = = = Captured pieces = = = 
 A player capturing a piece immediately passes that piece to the capturing player 's partner . The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may , instead of playing a regular move , place one of these pieces on the board ( as in shogi and <unk> ) . Pieces in reserve or on deck may be placed on any vacant square , including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate . However , pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank . Dropped pawns may promote , but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured . In play over the board , a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion . A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move . Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces on the table in front of the board , always visible to all players of the game . 
 = = = Clock and completion of a move = = = 
 Bughouse chess is usually played with chess clocks to prevent players from waiting indefinitely for a piece . Clocks are placed on the outside so that each player can see both clocks . At the start of the game , the players with the black pieces start the clocks simultaneously . Bughouse is usually played using clock move , which allows touching of pieces . A move is completed only when the clock is pressed . Touch move is practiced to a lesser extent . When used , it applies to pieces in reserve as well ; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square . 
 Bughouse can be played without a clock , but then there is usually a rule preventing a player waiting for pieces ( stalling or sitting ) indefinitely . One rule states that players may not delay their move beyond the time that it takes for their partner to make three moves . 
 = = = End of the game = = = 
 The match ends when either of the games on the two boards ends . A game is won when one player gets checkmated , resigns , forfeits on time or when an illegal move is made in which the offending side is caught . The match can be drawn by agreement or when two players run out of time or are checkmated simultaneously . Depending on ( local ) rules threefold repetition applies , in which case the reserve of pieces is not taken into account . 
 Alternatively , when one board finishes , play can continue on the other board . In this case , pieces in reserve can still be dropped , but no new pieces are coming in . The outcome of the match is then decided by adding the score of the two boards . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Partners are normally allowed to talk to each other during the game . They can for instance ask for a specific piece , for more trades , ask to hold a piece , suggest moves or ask their partner to stall . Shouts like " Knight mates ! " or " Give me pieces ! " are common , and can lead to seemingly absurd sacrificial captures on the other board . Partners are not allowed to physically act on the other board . 
 = = Two @-@ player and six @-@ player variations = = 
 It is possible to play the game with just two players ( one per team ) by having each player move on two boards . Analogously to simultaneous chess , this way of playing the game is referred to as simultaneous bughouse . It can also be played with just one clock by playing the boards in a specific order ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) and pressing the clock after each move . This variation is suitable for play by mail . 
 Bughouse can be played with three or more boards . The game is played in exactly the same way as normal bughouse with boards placed with alternating colours and two players and one clock per board . On capturing a piece however , the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece . In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards , but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces . The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available . 
 = = Strategy = = 
 = = = Material = = = 
 In chess a minor material advantage is important as when material gets exchanged , the relative advantage becomes larger . Because new pieces come in , there is no endgame play in bughouse and material is therefore less important . It is common to sacrifice pieces in bughouse while attacking , defending or hunting down a certain piece which the partner requires . 
 A scoring system to evaluate material is to add up the piece values of the material on the board . In chess , when a pawn equals one unit , a bishop or knight is worth three , a rook five and a queen nine . These values are a consequence of the difference in mobility of the pieces . In bughouse , piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square . The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess , as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns . They can for instance be dropped to block non @-@ contact checks . Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank , one step away from promotion , which again adds to their importance . Long @-@ range pieces like the queen or the rook lose relative value , due to the constantly changing pawn structure . They are also more likely to be hemmed in . A valuation system , first suggested by FICS @-@ player <unk> , often applied to bughouse is pawn = 1 , bishop = knight = rook = 2 and queen = 4 . 
 = = = Coordination = = = 
 Captured pieces are passed on and thus what happens on one board influences what happens on the other board . It is therefore natural for team members to communicate during game play . A common request of an attacking player would be " trades are good " , while players in trouble would ask their partner to hold trades with " trades are bad " . Equally a player can request a piece e.g. " knight wins a queen " or ask to hold a piece e.g. " rook mates me " . 
 Another common situation in the interplay between the two boards is a player not moving , also called sitting or stalling . This can happen in anticipation of a certain piece or at the request of the partner . Suppose a player is under heavy attack , and an additional pawn would mate him . When the partner cannot prevent giving up a pawn on the next move , sitting is the only strategy . It would of course be perfectly logical for the attacker to sit as well , waiting for a pawn to come . The situation where diagonal opponents sit at the same time is known as a " <unk> " ( literally " sitting war " in German , and a pun on " blitzkrieg " ) . The difference in time between the diagonal opponents will eventually force one party to move . This diagonal time advantage is more important than the difference on the clock between opponents on the same board . 
 Apart from this active communication , a good bughouse player tries to coordinate silently by keeping an eye on the other board and adapting moves accordingly . This can mean as little as glancing at the other board before trading queens , or as much as playing an opening adapted to the other board . 
 = = = Attack and defense = = = 
 Attacking the king can mean checking the opponent but also controlling vital squares around the king . It is an essential part of bughouse gameplay . From a player 's perspective , attacking the king has important advantages as opposed to defending or attempting to win material : 
 Because of the possibility of dropping pieces , attacks in bughouse can quickly lead to checkmate . 
 The attacking player has the initiative , he is the one who controls the board , while the opponent is left to react . This has also important consequences for the other board . 
 It is easier to attack than to defend . A defending mistake can have bigger consequences than an attacking mistake . Thus , the defender needs to be more precise , which in turn can lead to a time advantage for the attacker . 
 It is common to sacrifice material to build up , or sustain an attack . Characteristic of attacks is the so @-@ called " piece storm " , where a player drops piece after piece with check . Contact checks or knight checks , which force the king to move as opposed to dropping pieces , are especially important . They can be used to drive the king into the open , away from its defenders , while they prevent the opponent from putting new material on the board . 
 Partner communication is essential in a good defense . When one partner is under attack , the other partner should be aware of which pieces hurt most . Sitting strategies might be necessary , and it is therefore important to play the defense fast . Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal . On the other hand , it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with , with the defender 's partner having a piece more . Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative . 
 = = = Opening = = = 
 There are significantly fewer bughouse openings than there are chess openings . Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse . It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e @-@ pawns . Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development . Captured pieces become available after the first few moves and it is important to develop at this stage as there is often not enough time to do so later . Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks . 
 = = Notation and sample game = = 
 The algebraic chess notation for chess can be used to record moves in bughouse games . Different notations for piece drops are possible . The internet chess servers FICS and Internet Chess Club use the at @-@ sign @ , as in N @ f1 ( knight drop at f1 ) , Q @ e6 + ( queen drop with check at e6 ) or P @ h7 ( pawn drop at h7 ) . 
 Because of the fast pace at which the game is played , bughouse games are rarely recorded in games played over the board . With the arrival of online chess it has become possible to systematically record games . The format in which this is done is the bughouse portable game notation ( BPGN ) , an extension of the Portable Game Notation for chess .

 Little is known on the history of bughouse , but it seems to have developed in the early 1960s . It is now quite popular as a diversion of regular chess in local chess clubs throughout Europe and the US . Grandmasters such as Joel Benjamin , Yasser Seirawan , Andy Soltis , John Nunn , Jon <unk> , Sergey Karjakin , Michael Adams , Emil <unk> and Michael Rohde have been known to play the game . One of the strongest matches on record took place following the 2014 <unk> Cup , with Magnus Carlsen and Maxime Vachier @-@ Lagrave teaming up against Fabiano Caruana and Levon Aronian , four of the top ten chess players in the world at the time . 
 With the absence of an International Federation , over @-@ the @-@ board competitive bughouse is very much in its infancy . There is also no world championship . A few countries do organize bughouse tournaments within the national chess federation . Examples include : 
 The yearly international chess festival Czech Open in July features the Czech republic bughouse championship . 
 Yearly , USCF organizes bughouse tournaments as part of the National Junior High ( K @-@ 9 ) Championship and the National High School ( K @-@ 12 ) Championship . 
 Other tournaments are organized privately : 
 One of the largest international bughouse tournaments is the yearly tournament in Berlin . Going into its sixth edition , it is popular among top players from FICS . Grandmaster Levon Aronian took part in the 2005 edition of the tournament and took the second place with his teammate Vasiliy <unk> . 
 Since 2000 there has been an annual bughouse tournament in Geneva , attracting the best European players . 
 = = = Online = = = 
 Bughouse can be played online at chess servers such as FICS and ICC since 1995 . FICS is currently the most active server for bughouse , attracting the world 's best players like Levon Aronian . 
 The game is played online in the same way as over the board , but some aspects are unique to online bughouse . In games over the board , communication is heard by all players , while in online bughouse it is usually done via private messages between two partners . This makes communication a more powerful weapon . It is also easier to coordinate as the second board is more visible on the screen than over the board . The time aspect is altered due to existence of <unk> and lag . The latter can influence the diagonal time difference significantly , and it is good sportsmanship to restart the game when this difference gets too large . 
 ICS compatible interfaces particularly suitable for bughouse include Thief and <unk> . They have the ability to display both boards at the same time and store played or observed games , they also have partner communication buttons and a lag indicator . Special Chess Engine Communication Protocol compatible engines have been written that support bughouse , examples are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Although much faster than humans , they lack in positional understanding and especially in coordination and communication , an essential skill in this team game . 
 = = Relationship with chess = = 
 Bughouse chess is controversial among chess teachers . While some instructors find beneficial learning outcomes for bughouse , most do not consider it to have a positive effect , especially for novice chess players . According to Susan Polgar , " If your children want to play bughouse for fun , it is OK . But just remember that it is not chess and it has no positive value for chess . In fact , I absolutely recommend no bughouse during a tournament . " Arguments supporting a negative view of bughouse include that it distorts typical chess pattern recognition and that it too heavily emphasizes tactical play at the expense of positional strategy . It also shares criticisms with speed chess in general , potentially encouraging a habit of moving too fast or playing <unk> with the expectation that one 's opponent will be moving quickly . 
 Levon Aronian is among those who view bughouse as beneficial " for players who know chess well already . ... I started to play bug when I was already at master level , [ you ] see , and I think bughouse is good for the imagination , to develop new ideas . " For Joel Benjamin , bughouse trains players to pay closer attention to empty squares on the board . 
 = Zenas Bliss = 
 Zenas Randall Bliss ( April 17 , 1835 – January 2 , 1900 ) was an officer and general in the United States Army and a recipient of the Medal of Honor . He formed the first unit of Seminole @-@ Negro Indian Scouts , and his detailed memoirs chronicled life on the Texas frontier . He was the father of Rhode Island Lieutenant Governor Zenas Work Bliss . 
 Bliss was a native of Rhode Island and graduated from West Point in 1854 . He served most of his thirty @-@ seven @-@ year career on the Texas frontier , and served in the Union Army during the American Civil War . During the Civil War he was captured by Confederate forces and held as a prisoner of war . Bliss received the Medal of Honor for his actions while leading his regiment at the Battle of Fredericksburg . 
 = = Early life and military career = = 
 Bliss was born April 17 , 1835 in Johnston , Rhode Island to an upper @-@ middle @-@ class family . His parents were Zenas and Phebe Waterman Randall Bliss . He received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point , New York , in July 1850 when he was only fifteen years old . 
 He graduated from West Point in 1854 and served the next six years in Texas . He was stationed at Fort Davis and Fort Quitman , but his first assignment was as a brevet second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Infantry regiment at Fort Duncan . 
 He was promoted to the full rank of second lieutenant in the 8th U.S. Infantry on March 3 , 1855 and subsequently promoted to first lieutenant on October 17 , 1860 . Following the outbreak of the Civil War , he was promoted to captain on May 14 , 1861 . 
 = = = Civil War service = = = 
 When the American Civil War began on April 12 , 1861 Bliss immediately saw action . He was captured by Confederate forces and spent eleven months as a prisoner of war , first in San Antonio , Texas , and later in Richmond , Virginia . 
 He was finally exchanged and sent back to Union lines where he subsequently took command of the Tenth Rhode Island Infantry . He received a commission in the volunteer army as a colonel in May 1862 . The 10th Rhode Island served for only 90 days and was used in the defenses of Washington , D.C. After the 10th Rhode Island was discharged , Bliss assumed command of the Seventh Rhode Island Infantry on August 21 , 1862 . 
 In October 1862 the Seventh Rhode Island joined the First Brigade , Second Division , Ninth Corps , Army of the Potomac . The regiment saw action in December 1862 at the Battle of Fredericksburg , during which Bliss performed actions that earned him the Medal of Honor several decades later . When IX Corps was sent West , it participated in the Siege of Vicksburg . The Seventh served under Major General William T. Sherman in the capture of Jackson , Mississippi . 
 In April 1864 the Seventh rejoined the Army of the Potomac . Bliss became commander of the First Brigade , Second Division , Ninth Corps . His brigade fought in the Battle of the Wilderness . Bliss was badly injured by a horse at Spotsylvania , but he returned to lead his brigade in the Siege of Petersburg and the Battle of the Crater . The court of inquiry following the fiasco at the Crater censured Bliss , but he remained on duty . 
 During the Civil War , Bliss received a brevet ( honorary promotion ) to major dated December 13 , 1862 , for " gallantry and meritorious service " in the Battle of Fredericksburg . He was later breveted to lieutenant colonel on May 7 , 1864 , for " gallantry and meritorious service " in the Battle of the Wilderness . 
 Bliss was mustered out of volunteer service on June 9 , 1865 and reverted to his Regular Army rank of captain . 
 He was awarded the Medal of Honor on December 3 , 1898 , for valor during the Battle of Fredericksburg . 
 = = Postbellum career = = 
 Bliss remained in the Regular Army after the Civil War and was promoted to major of the 30th Infantry Regiment on August 6 , 1867 . He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 19th Infantry on March 4 , 1879 , and to colonel of the 24th Infantry ( a unit with black soldiers and white officers ) on April 20 , 1886 . 
 Bliss was promoted to brigadier general in the Regular Army April 24 , 1895 , and to major general on May 14 , 1897 . He retired from the Army eight days later on May 22 . Including his four years at West Point , Bliss had served 46 years , 10 months and 22 days in uniform when he retired . 
 Bliss was a member of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Loyal Legion and was assigned insignia number <unk> . He was also a member of the Grand Army of the Republic , Society of the Army of the Potomac and the Order of the Indian Wars . 
 Zenas Bliss died in Washington , D.C. January 2 , 1900 , at age 64 . He is buried alongside his wife at Arlington National Cemetery at Arlington , Virginia . His grave can be found in section 1 , lot 8 @-@ B. 
 Bliss and his wife had four children , two of whom lived to adulthood . One of his sons was Zenas Work Bliss ( 1867 - 1957 ) who served as lieutenant governor of Rhode Island from 1910 to 1913 .

 = Wilfred Rhodes = 
 Wilfred Rhodes ( 29 October 1877 – 8 July 1973 ) was an English professional cricketer who played 58 Test matches for England between 1899 and 1930 . In Tests , Rhodes took 127 wickets and scored 2 @,@ 325 runs , becoming the first Englishman to complete the double of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets in Test matches . He holds the world records both for the most appearances made in first @-@ class cricket ( 1 @,@ 110 matches ) , and for the most wickets taken ( 4 @,@ 204 ) . He completed the double of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season a record 16 times . Rhodes played for Yorkshire and England into his fifties , and in his final Test in 1930 was , at 52 years and 165 days , the oldest player who has appeared in a Test match . 
 Beginning his career for Yorkshire in 1898 as a slow left arm bowler who was a useful batsman , Rhodes quickly established a reputation as one of the best slow bowlers in the world . However , by the First World War he had developed his batting skills to the extent that he was regarded as one of the leading batsmen in England and had established an effective opening partnership with Jack Hobbs . The improvement in Rhodes 's batting was accompanied by a temporary decline in his bowling performances , but the loss of key Yorkshire bowlers after the war led to Rhodes resuming his role as a front @-@ line bowler . He played throughout the 1920s as an all @-@ rounder before retiring after the 1930 cricket season . His first appearance for England was in 1899 and he played regularly in Tests until 1921 . Recalled to the team in the final Ashes Test of 1926 aged 48 , Rhodes played a significant part in winning the match for England who thus regained the Ashes for the first time since 1912 . He ended his Test career in the West Indies in April 1930 . 
 As a bowler , Rhodes was noted for his great accuracy , variations in flight and , in his early days , sharp spin . Throughout his career he was particularly effective on wet , rain affected pitches where he could bowl sides out for very low scores . His batting was regarded as solid and dependable but unspectacular , and critics accused him of excessive caution at times . However , they considered him to be an astute cricket thinker . Following his retirement from playing cricket , he coached at Harrow School but was not a great success . His eyesight began to fail from around 1939 to the point where he was completely blind by 1952 . He was given honorary membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) in 1949 and remained a respected figure within the game until his death in 1973 .

 Rhodes was born in the village of Kirkheaton , just outside Huddersfield , in 1877 . His family moved to a farm two miles away while he was very young . He went to school in nearby Hopton , and later to Spring Grove School in Huddersfield . His father , Alfred Rhodes , was captain of the Kirkheaton cricket team 's Second XI and encouraged his son to play cricket , buying him equipment and having a pitch laid near their home for Wilfred to practice . By the time Rhodes left school , aged 16 , he had joined Kirkheaton Cricket Club and started to take cricket seriously : he watched Yorkshire when they played close to his home and began to consider a career as a professional cricketer . Around 1893 he took a job working on the railway in the local town of Mirfield . By now playing regularly for Kirkheaton Second XI , Rhodes 's keenness to reach one game on time led him to ring the off @-@ duty bell before the end of the shift and as a result he lost his job . Subsequently , he worked on a local farm , which allowed him more time for cricket . By 1895 he achieved a place in the Kirkheaton first team , and was recommended to Gala Cricket Club , of Galashiels , Scotland , as a professional . 
 = = = Professional club cricketer = = = 
 Rhodes played for Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897 , as an all @-@ rounder who opened the batting and bowled medium paced seamers . He took 92 wickets in his first season , and discovered that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success . He decided to change his bowling style to spin , and spent the winter of 1896 – 97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway , this time as a signalman . Over several months , Rhodes used his practice sessions to develop control of spin and different types of delivery . Consequently , in his second season at Galashiels , now bowling slow left @-@ arm , he took fewer wickets but at a better average . At the end of the 1897 season , encouraged by a Scottish member of the MCC , he resigned from Gala to look for work in England .

 In response to an advertisement , Rhodes applied to join the <unk> of Warwickshire County Cricket Club , but the club were unable to offer him an engagement for financial reasons . At this time , Yorkshire were looking for a slow left arm spinner to replace Bobby Peel , who had been sacked following a disciplinary lapse on the field in front of his captain Lord Hawke in August 1897 . Rhodes successfully applied for a place in a Yorkshire Colts team to play against the County XI . However , by his own later admission , Rhodes had a poor match , while his rival for Peel 's place in the side , Albert Cordingley , took nine wickets . 
 In early spring 1898 , Rhodes was invited to the nets at Headingley , which led to him playing in some friendly matches ( unofficial matches involving first @-@ class teams ) . Rhodes went on to make his first @-@ class debut for Yorkshire on 12 May 1898 against the MCC , taking six wickets in the match . In his second game , he made his County Championship debut on 16 May 1898 against Somerset , taking 13 wickets for 45 runs . In the 1898 season , according to Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack Rhodes " sprang at once into fame , bowling in match after match for Yorkshire with astounding success . " By the end of the season he had taken 154 wickets at an average of 14 @.@ 60 , and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1899 . The citation stated : " There can be no doubt as to the greatness of his achievements last summer ... His qualities as a slow bowler struck everyone as being exceptional " ; however , it was noted that bad weather in first part of the summer created some difficult pitches for batting . As a batsman he scored three fifties , and Wisden rated him " a dangerous run @-@ getter " . By the end of the season , according to cricket writer Neville Cardus , Rhodes had proven himself to be the best left @-@ arm spinner in England . 
 In 1899 , Rhodes took 179 wickets at an average of 17 @.@ 10 in a reasonably dry season ; this weather meant that pitches were harder , easier to bat on , and less likely to suit his bowling . Wisden described him as " head and shoulders above his colleagues " . He made his Test debut in the five @-@ match series against Australia , playing in three of the five Tests ; his first Test coincided with W. G. Grace 's last . As well as Grace , his team @-@ mates included C. B. Fry , K. S. Ranjitsinhji , and George Hirst . Rhodes opened the English bowling and took four wickets for 58 in an Australian total of 252 ; his first Test wicket was Monty Noble ( whose wicket he took again in the second innings ) . He was described by Wisden as bowling " steady and well " on the first day . Rhodes took three wickets in the second Test , but the selectors omitted him from the third match , a decision Wisden believed was mistaken . He did not play again until the final Test , and he finished with 13 wickets in the series , equal with J. T. Hearne as England 's leading Test wicket @-@ taker for the summer . Rhodes was also selected to represent the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord 's for the first time that season , although W. G. Grace and C. B. Fry scored heavily against him . 
 Rhodes 's most successful seasons in terms of wickets were the three seasons from 1900 to 1902 . In these years , Rhodes took 725 wickets at an average of 14 @.@ 07 , taking five or more wickets in an innings 68 times and taking ten or more wickets in a match 21 times , assisting Yorkshire to three consecutive County Championships . In 1900 , Rhodes took 261 wickets as bad weather made pitches helpful to his bowling . In 1901 , the weather was much better , leading to pitches that were good for batting , but Rhodes took 251 wickets , an achievement described by Wisden as astonishing . Against MCC that year , Rhodes scored his maiden first @-@ class century , batting at number nine . In the 1902 season , Rhodes took 213 wickets , fewer than 1901 despite a greater number of favourable pitches in a wet summer . This attracted unfavourable comment from some critics who had expected more . 
 The main cricket event of 1902 was the Australian tour of England . Rhodes played in all five Tests and was England 's leading wicket @-@ taker with 22 wickets at an average of 15 @.@ 27 . He took seven for 17 in the first innings of the first Test , out of an Australian total of 36 , in conditions that the umpires considered reasonable for batting ; Wisden noted that Rhodes and Hirst bowled very well . However , C. B. Fry believed that Hirst was more difficult to play and that while Rhodes bowled well , the Australian batsmen got themselves out as they " hurried to the other end and tried to hit Rhodes , without success " . Rain meant the game was drawn and washed out most of the second match . In the third Test , which England lost , Rhodes took five for 63 , including a spell of four wickets in nineteen balls . In the fourth Test , Rhodes took seven wickets in the match , taking three quick wickets in the first innings , but receiving some heavy punishment . He was batting at the end of the match , but was unable to prevent Australia from snatching victory to win by three runs and take the series . The final Test , at The Oval , was dominated by Gilbert Jessop and Hirst , but when England needed 263 to win in the final innings , Rhodes came into bat after the ninth wicket fell with 15 needed for England to win . It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes , " We 'll get ' em in singles " , but neither batsman could remember those words being said and not all the runs came in singles . The two Yorkshiremen were not dismissed and England won by one wicket . 
 In 1903 , Rhodes scored over 1 @,@ 000 runs in the season for the first time , in the process completing his first double of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets . However , after bowling a large number of overs against Worcestershire early in the season , he had little success as a bowler for a spell of three weeks . Pelham Warner , a leading amateur cricketer and later captain of England , noted that Rhodes was comparatively unsuccessful at the start of the year but came back well to take 193 wickets . Warner wrote that Rhodes at this time was accused of being easy to face on a wicket which suited the batsmen , although Warner himself did not agree . 
 = = = From all @-@ rounder to specialist batsman = = = 
 Warner toured prolifically with cricket teams and was chosen to captain the first MCC @-@ sponsored tour of Australia in the winter of 1903 – 04 . Warner was primarily responsible for the selection of players , and he selected Rhodes among his first choices for the team . Although K. S. Ranjitsinhji predicted that Rhodes " would not take a dozen wickets " on the tour , Warner believed that Rhodes and Hirst were the best two bowlers in England . In the event , Warner rated Rhodes the " mainstay of the team " , and Wisden observed that he proved critics wrong , establishing himself as the most effective bowler on the tour . The Wisden summary of the tour pointed out that rain made an unusually high number of pitches , by Australian standards , helpful for Rhodes 's style of bowling , but he bowled well on all types of pitches . On the whole tour , the Yorkshire bowler took 65 first @-@ class wickets at an average of 16 @.@ 23 , including 31 wickets at an average of 15 @.@ 74 in the Test matches . 
 England won the Test series 3 – 2 after winning the first , second and fourth games . In the first match Rhodes contributed 40 runs to a tenth wicket partnership of 130 with R. E. Foster , who scored 287 , to assist the team in building a large lead . This was a Test record partnership for the tenth wicket , and remained so for 70 years ; until 2014 , it was a record for England 's 10th wicket . When Victor Trumper led an Australian fightback , scoring 185 not out , only Rhodes could slow his scoring in conditions which , according to Warner , were very good for batting . Steady bowling through the innings brought Rhodes figures of five for 94 ; Warner wrote : " what we should have done without Rhodes I do not know " . 
 In the second Test , badly affected by the weather , Rhodes had a match analysis of 15 wickets for 124 runs , the best bowling analysis recorded in a match between England and Australia until 1934 and the equal highest number of wickets taken in a match by a single player at that time ( although other players had given away fewer runs ) . Rain made the pitch very difficult to bat on , but Wisden praised Rhodes and observed that eight catches were dropped from his bowling . His eight for 68 in the second innings remained his best figures in Tests . Australia won the third Test , but the decisive fourth Test was won by England and Rhodes contributed with bat and ball . In the first innings , while the crowd chanted in an attempt to distract him , he took four for 33 as the last five Australian wickets fell for 17 runs in favourable batting conditions . Later , Rhodes added 55 for the tenth wicket in the second innings with his captain . However , he was less effective as England lost the final Test . 
 Rhodes believed that the 1903 – 04 tour was a turning point in his career as a bowler and that afterwards he was never the same . Part of the reason was a change in his bowling style . He had noticed that it was necessary for him to bowl faster in Australia to be effective , and on his return to England he continued with this faster style until the First World War . Rhodes thought that another reason for his relative bowling decline was the development of his batting which took up much of his time . His biographer , Sidney Rogerson , speculates that further deterioration may have been caused by the strain of regular bowling on his fingers and wrist , and his more robust , muscular frame in his mid @-@ twenties . Rogerson believes that Rhodes was affected by the break @-@ up of the successful Yorkshire team which had peaked between 1900 and 1902 . More batting responsibility was placed on his shoulders , and he received less support in the field as the team personnel changed . Consequently , Rhodes scored more runs and moved further up the batting order after 1903 , but his bowling gradually declined until the war . 
 In 1904 , Rhodes took 131 wickets , the fewest in a season of his career to date . He scored 1 @,@ 537 runs , including two hundreds ( the second and third of his career ) to complete his second double . He generally batted at number six or seven in the batting order , but in two games he opened the batting . In 1905 , Yorkshire won the Championship ; Rhodes again completed the double , with 1 @,@ 581 runs , his two hundreds including a double hundred . He took 182 wickets , but Wisden judged that he was not as dangerous a bowler on slow wickets as he had been . Rhodes played in four of the five Tests against Australia that year . He scored 29 and 39 not out in the first Test , but in the second , suffered an injured finger which reduced his effectiveness and caused him to miss the next Test . In the fourth Test , Rhodes took five wickets in the match , including three for 36 in the second innings . However , the England captain , Stanley Jackson , showed , in the words of Wisden , " a curious want of faith in Rhodes " , even though he was bowling well . His fielding was singled out for praise as he took four catches , two of them regarded as brilliant . England eventually won the series 2 – 0 ; Rhodes contributed 146 runs , at an average of 48 @.@ 66 and a top score of 39 not out , and ten wickets at an average of 31 @.@ 40 . 
 The relative deterioration in Rhodes 's bowling continued into the 1906 season when Wisden commented that he had lost his sharp spin and was not dangerous on a hard wicket . Rhodes scored 1 @,@ 721 runs , now regularly opening the batting , and completed another double with 128 wickets , but the Wisden correspondent did not believe this compensated for his lost bowling . In 1907 , Rhodes scored fewer runs and increased his bowling aggregate , securing 173 wickets in a wet season . Wisden believed his greater bowling success was due to a reduced batting contribution , but he still completed the double by scoring 1 @,@ 045 runs . During that season , Rhodes was again asked to open the batting for Yorkshire and he was chosen as the permanent replacement for John Tunnicliffe as Yorkshire 's opening batsman . Several batsmen had been tried in the position , but Rhodes 's superior defensive technique with the bat secured him the role . Despite the increase in wickets , Rhodes was not picked for any of the Tests that year against South Africa , Colin Blythe being preferred . 
 Rhodes and Blythe both went to Australia the following winter ( 1907 – 08 ) with MCC , but Rhodes was now regarded primarily as a batsman and only a " change " bowler who would be the third or fourth used . In the five Test series , lost 4 – 1 by England , Rhodes scored 205 runs at an average of 20 @.@ 50 , including his first Test fifty in the fourth innings of the last Test . He took four for 102 in Australia 's second innings of that Test , and finished the Test series with seven wickets at an average of 60 @.@ 14 . In all first @-@ class matches on the tour , Rhodes scored 929 runs at an average of 48 @.@ 89 and took 31 wickets at an average of 34 @.@ 48 . He followed this with another double in 1908 of 1 @,@ 660 runs and 106 wickets as Yorkshire won the County Championship . 
 In 1909 , Rhodes scored 2 @,@ 094 runs at an average of 40 @.@ 26 , which was to remain his second highest run aggregate and average for an English cricket season , and took 141 wickets . Sidney Rogerson believed that this season marked the completion of his transformation into a batsman . This view was supported by Wisden , which judged that he had " now become such an exceptionally good batsman that the regret one used to feel at his ever giving his mind to run getting has lost its force . " He played in four of the five Tests against Australia in 1909 ; his omission from the second Test was later described as an error of judgement by the editor of Wisden , one of many <unk> blunders as England lost the series two games to one . Rhodes scored 168 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 60 , and took 11 wickets at an average of 22 @.@ 00 . In the first Test , he had a quiet time , scoring an unbeaten 15 , batting at number eight , and bowling only one over . Recalled for the third Test , Rhodes bowled a spell in which four wickets were captured for seven runs , before being hit for four fours in one over by Trumper . His first innings figures were four for 38 and he took another two wickets for 44 runs in the second innings . In the fourth Test , Wisden believed that Rhodes alone bowled well on the second day , taking five for 83 . Although moved up the order to bat at number five , he scored just five runs in the match . In the final Test , he batted at number three and scored two fifties , 66 and 54 , adding 104 in the first innings with C. B. Fry and another 61 to save the game with the same batsman in the second .

 In the 1909 – 10 English winter , MCC toured South Africa with a team below full Test strength . Rhodes opened the batting throughout the tour , partnering Jack Hobbs for the first time . However , Wisden stated that only Hobbs would have been sure of his batting place in a full strength England team , and that both Rhodes and David Denton , the next best batsmen , were a long way behind Hobbs . In all first @-@ class matches , Rhodes scored 499 runs at an average of 26 @.@ 26 , with three fifties , and took 21 wickets at 25 @.@ 47 . In the Test series , which South Africa won 3 – 2 , Rhodes took only two wickets in the five games . As a batsman , however , he shared some large partnerships with Hobbs . England lost the first two Tests , although in the first Rhodes and Hobbs put on 159 for the first wicket , of which Rhodes made 66 . In the second Test the pair put on 94 in the first innings and 48 in the second , Rhodes made little impact on the third and fourth Tests ; in the final Test , an England victory , he and Hobbs scored 221 together , Rhodes making what was then his highest Test score of 77 . Wisden stated that while overshadowed by the brilliance of Hobbs , Rhodes in this innings batted without mistakes . In the five Tests Rhodes scored 226 runs , averaging 25 @.@ 11 . During the tour Rhodes and Hobbs developed mutual trust while batting together , to the point where they could score runs without having to call to each other . This degree of understanding was unusual at the time . After the Test series ended , several amateur members of the team wanted to extend the tour into Rhodesia , but the professionals refused to take part as their contracts did not cover this and they would have effectively played for no wages . Rhodes , although not the ring @-@ leader , was influential in this strike , and a sports newspaper , Winning Post , singled him out as responsible in an article highly critical of him and the other professionals . 
 In the 1910 domestic season Rhodes was less productive in batting and bowling , and Yorkshire finished only eighth in the County Championship , a result considered very poor within the county . Rhodes scored 1 @,@ 465 runs at an average of 26 @.@ 63 , and took 88 wickets at an average of 18 @.@ 98 , the first time since the start of his career that he had taken less than 100 wickets in an English season . In 1911 , when Yorkshire finished seventh in the County Championship , it was a fine , dry summer , which meant generally good batting wickets . Rhodes was more productive with 2 @,@ 261 runs , the second and final time that he passed 2 @,@ 000 runs in an English summer , and the highest season 's total of his career . He averaged 38 @.@ 32 with the bat , and took 117 wickets . Rhodes was given a benefit match against Lancashire from which he received £ 750 ( around £ 57 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) . After Yorkshire launched an appeal , the total was boosted to £ 2 @,@ 200 ( worth around £ 167 @,@ 000 in 2010 ) , still considerably less than the record benefit total of £ 3 @,@ 703 raised for George Hirst in 1904 .

 In September 1911 Rhodes made his third visit to Australia , this time as the opening partner of Jack Hobbs . The tour proved to be the " absolute pinnacle of his success as a batsman " , according to Rogerson . Under the captaincy of Johnny Douglas , England won the 1911 – 12 Test series against Australia 4 – 1 , after losing the first Test . While the success of the tourists was attributed to their powerful bowling attack , C. B. Fry described the English victories as " a succession of triumphs for Jack Hobbs and Rhodes as first wicket batsmen . " Pelham Warner , who was nominally captain but missed the entire series due to illness , said that in " innings after innings they [ Hobbs and Rhodes ] gave us a wonderful start " , adding that he had run out of words to praise their contributions . 
 In the first Test , the only one of the series in which he did not open , Rhodes made 41 and 0 in England 's defeat . In the second match , opening with Hobbs , Rhodes scored 61 in the first innings , passing 1 @,@ 000 Test career runs in the process . Wisden recorded that apart from Rhodes and J. W. Hearne , with whom he shared a century partnership , the batting was very disappointing . In the second innings , Rhodes added 57 for the first wicket with Hobbs , helping England to an eight @-@ wicket victory . In the next Test Rhodes scored 59 out of an opening partnership of 147 with Hobbs , and 57 not out as England won again , this time by seven wickets . In the fourth Test , which England won overwhelmingly to take the series , Rhodes scored 179 as he and Hobbs scored 323 for the first wicket . At the time , this was a Test record partnership for any wicket . As of 2015 , it remains England 's highest first wicket partnership against Australia . This was Rhodes 's first Test century , and remained his highest Test score . Wisden commented that his seven @-@ hour innings was " a remarkable display of careful batting . " In the final Test victory Rhodes put on 76 with Hobbs in the second innings , to finish the series with 463 runs at an average of 57 @.@ 87 , the best series average of his career . On the tour as a whole , he scored 1 @,@ 098 runs at an average of 54 @.@ 90 , but he did not take a single first @-@ class wicket ; in the Tests he only bowled 18 overs . 
 = = = Triangular tournament = = = 
 On their return home for the 1912 season England , captained by C. B. Fry , were involved in the first @-@ ever triangular Test tournament , consisting of matches between England , Australia and South Africa . This experiment was severely affected by wet weather , the weakness of the South African side , and a dispute among the Australian side which resulted in substandard team being sent . Rhodes played as Hobbs ' opening partner in each of England 's six matches and once again won praise from Wisden . In England 's first match , a victory against South Africa , Rhodes scored 36 , his steady defence being described as invaluable . In the following drawn game against Australia , Hobbs and Rhodes scored 112 for the first wicket . Rhodes scored 59 , his first 52 runs being scored out of a total of 77 before he slowed down ; Wisden reported that the later part of his innings was " as cautious as the first part was brilliant " . Later in the match Rhodes bowled and took three wickets for 59 , his only bowling success of the tournament . 
 After a quiet second match against South Africa , Rhodes scored 92 out of a total of 203 in a rain @-@ ruined game against Australia . The difficult batting conditions were such that Fry described Rhodes as " digging his runs out of the slush . " Rhodes had another poor match against South Africa , but in the final match against Australia , which would decide the winner of the tournament , Rhodes scored 49 in an opening stand of 107 with Hobbs in the first innings , considered a great achievement in testing batting conditions . England went on to win in the match and hence the tournament . Rhodes had scored 204 runs at an average of 51 @.@ 00 against Australia , but only 53 runs at an average of 13 @.@ 25 against the South Africans . In all first @-@ class matches that summer , Rhodes scored 1 @,@ 576 runs ( averaging 30 @.@ 90 ) , and took 53 wickets ( average 21 @.@ 98 ) , his lowest total of wickets in an English season , and only the second time since 1903 that he had not completed the double . 
 = = = Last pre @-@ war seasons = = = 
 Rhodes again failed to complete the double in 1913 , scoring 1 @,@ 963 runs ( average 32 @.@ 71 ) and taking 86 wickets ( average 21 @.@ 88 ) . In the 1913 – 14 English winter , Rhodes went to South Africa with the MCC under the captaincy of Douglas . A strong England side won the five @-@ match series 4 – 0 against weak opposition . Rhodes scored 731 runs in first @-@ class matches , averaging 34 @.@ 80 , and took 31 wickets at 21 @.@ 35 , which led Wisden to comment on his value as an all @-@ rounder . In the second Test Rhodes took one wicket , his 100th in Test matches , and completed the double of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets in Tests ; the first England player to do so , he was only the third player to reach the double after Australians George Giffen and Monty Noble . In the same match , Rhodes made his second and final Test century , scoring 152 and adding 141 for the first wicket with Albert Relf . He batted for more than five hours , and Wisden said that he " was too cautious to please the crowd , but his steadiness was invaluable to his side . " His batting was overshadowed , as Sydney Barnes took 17 wickets in the match . Rhodes resumed his opening partnership with Hobbs in the third Test , sharing a stand of 100 , followed by opening partnerships of 92 and 133 in the fourth Test , the only drawn match of the series . In this match Rhodes took three wickets for 33 in the first South African innings . In all Tests on the tour Rhodes scored 289 runs at an average of 41 @.@ 28 and took six wickets ( average 32 @.@ 50 ) . 
 In the final season before the First World War , Rhodes scored 1 @,@ 377 runs . Yorkshire used him more often as a bowler and his tally of wickets consequently increased to 118 , enabling him to complete another double . Following the outbreak of war in August 1914 , first @-@ class cricket came to an end for four years . While many cricketers joined the army Rhodes , like George Hirst and Schofield Haigh , went to work in a munitions factory in Huddersfield . He and Hirst were paid by Yorkshire to be available to play in war @-@ time cricket matches on a certain number of Saturdays .

 When cricket resumed after the war in 1919 , no @-@ one was sure how popular county cricket would be and so the County Championship matches were reduced to two days instead of three . However , critics and players judged the experiment a failure , owing to the long hours of play and frequent travelling which arose from playing up to three games a week ; Rhodes and other players were also dissatisfied by wages offered . Yorkshire won the championship with a much @-@ changed side from that which had played in 1914 . The bowling attack was weaker : Hirst 's age lessened his effectiveness with the ball , Major Booth was killed in the war , and Alonzo Drake died from illness in January 1919 . Consequently , Rhodes decided to make up the shortfall by resuming full @-@ time bowling . With increased practice , he took more wickets and regained his confidence . Although unable to spin or flight the ball as well as previously , Rhodes bowled a very accurate length and used his great experience effectively . The success of Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe as opening batsmen meant that , although Rhodes began the season opening the batting , he was able to move down the order and bat at number four . He scored 1 @,@ 237 runs , and by taking 164 wickets at an average of 14 @.@ 42 , finished top of the national first @-@ class bowling averages . Around this time , Rhodes was approached by Haslingden Cricket Club from the Lancashire League , to play cricket for them as a professional . Rhodes , primarily through unhappiness with the 1919 playing conditions , seriously considered the offer before he declined . Some of his concerns were addressed before the following season , when matches returned to three days and wages were increased . In the following season , Rhodes scored 1 @,@ 123 runs , took 161 wickets at an average of 13 @.@ 18 , and was chosen to go to Australia with the 1920 – 21 MCC touring team . 
 = = = Australian tour , 1920 – 21 = = = 
 As English cricket had not fully recovered from the effects of the war , the team which toured Australia was weak in bowling . Confronted by a far better Australian side than anyone had expected , England lost all five Test matches , an unprecedented result that Wisden regarded as a " disaster " . Rhodes now played for Yorkshire as a middle @-@ order batsman and front @-@ line bowler but England 's captain Douglas showed uncertainty whether to use Rhodes in this capacity , or to revert to his pre @-@ war role as Hobbs 's opening partner . Until the first Test Rhodes batted mainly down the order ; after this he returned to opening the batting . On the tour Rhodes scored two centuries , one a double @-@ century , totalling in all 730 runs in all first @-@ class matches at an average of 38 @.@ 42 . Although a leading bowler in England in 1919 and 1920 , Rhodes bowled infrequently and with limited success . After taking six for 39 against Victoria in helpful conditions , he rarely bowled , and took only 18 first @-@ class wickets ( averaging 26 @.@ 61 ) on the tour . 
 In the Tests , Rhodes scored 238 runs at an average of 23 @.@ 80 , with a highest score of 73 in the fourth Test . In the first Test , a score of 45 took him past 2 @,@ 000 Test runs . As a bowler , Rhodes took four Test wickets in the series at an average of 61 @.@ 25 ; his best figures were three for 61 in the third Test . Rhodes later said that Douglas was reluctant to use him , believing his bowling would be ineffective on Australian pitches . Wisden commented : " It must be said , however , that in a summer of continuous sunshine – remarkable even for Australia – the bowlers received no help . " Nevertheless , much of Rhodes 's tour , according to A. A. Thomson , " may be fairly regarded as failure . " Tour manager and Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone , with whom Rhodes had already had a disagreement during the 1920 season , apparently said that " Wilfred 's finished " , a remark later reported to Rhodes . 
 = = = Senior professional = = = 
 The 1921 season was a turning point for Rhodes for several reasons . His regular England career ended during the visit of the Australians . The tourists , as Wisden reported , overwhelmed England , exposing many weaknesses in the team , and reduced the English selectors to " catch [ ing ] at straws " . 30 players were used in the five @-@ match Test series , which England lost by three matches to none . Rhodes played in the first Test , scored 19 and 10 and took two wickets in a heavy defeat . Although his performance was no worse than that of others , he was dropped from the team for the rest of the series and did not play another Test for five years . At the time , it was suggested his place was lost because he was uncomfortable against the fast bowling of Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald , who devastated and demoralised many English batsmen during the season . As a result of these problems with pace bowling Rhodes altered his batting stance to use the " two @-@ eyed stance " ; instead of using the traditional technique of standing at right angles to the bowler , the batsman turned his body towards the bowler . Critics complained that this method was ugly ; it restricted the shots that could be made , and led to some batsmen using their pads as an extra form of defence to stop the ball hitting the wicket . According to his Wisden obituary , Rhodes was one of the first men to adopt this batting stance . Rhodes faced a further development following the retirements of Hirst and Denton from Yorkshire ; he became the county 's senior professional . This position offered no official powers or responsibilities but was nevertheless significant as senior professionals influenced tactics , strategy and morale . Rhodes held this post until his retirement . 
 In all first @-@ class cricket in 1921 , Rhodes scored 1 @,@ 474 runs at an average of 39 @.@ 83 . This included his highest first @-@ class score of 267 not out against Leicestershire , struck on the day England began the second Test , having just dropped Rhodes . Rhodes took 141 wickets in the season , at an average of 13 @.@ 27 . In the autumn , he travelled to India , coaching and playing for the Maharaja of Patiala 's private team ; Rhodes repeated this trip every year until 1927 , sometimes accompanied by other players . On five occasions in India he completed a 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets double , although most of these games were not first @-@ class . 
 In each of the four seasons from 1922 to 1925 , Yorkshire won the County Championship . Rhodes scored over 1 @,@ 000 runs each year , averaging over 30 except in 1924 ; in 1925 his average was 40 @.@ 91 , only the second time it exceeded 40 in an English cricket season . Rhodes , by now part of a very powerful county bowling attack , was usually the fourth or fifth bowler used . Although he imparted less spin to the ball than in his younger days , he continually bowled a good length and placed fielders in positions which very effectively blocked the scoring opportunities of the batsmen . He took over 100 wickets in 1922 , 1923 and 1924 , but took only 57 in 1925 , a very good year for batting . As Yorkshire 's senior professional Rhodes was very influential in this period . He cultivated a hostile attitude among the bowlers , directed the team tactically and raised its standard of fielding . Alan Hill wrote that Yorkshire captains ( who were usually poor cricketers ) generally deferred to Rhodes as senior professional ; for example , Arthur Lupton , captain from 1925 to 1927 , " very wisely left the cricket affairs to the joint supervision of Rhodes and Emmott Robinson . " Stories emerged that he was an " <unk> subject " , arranging the positions of fielders and changing the bowler without reference to his nominal captain . In one story , Yorkshire had scored around 400 . Lupton , hoping to score some easy runs , came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional touched his arm and said , " It 's all right , sir . Mr Rhodes has declared [ the innings over ] . " However , all the captains to whom biographer Sidney Rogerson spoke mentioned their good relations with Rhodes , although they agreed that he could be difficult . Beverley Lyon , who captained Gloucestershire between 1929 and 1934 , criticised Rhodes for insisting young professionals take the game seriously , thus promoting a no @-@ risk attitude . 
 = = = Recalled for the Oval = = = 
 Reviewing the 1925 season , Wisden commented on Rhodes 's age and reduced performance . " In the nature of things , Rhodes , approaching the completion of his 48th year , could not be expected to prove very deadly in a dry summer ... If less effective in bowling , he did fine work with the bat " . However , in 1926 , Wisden reported that , despite his age and in contrast to the other bowlers in the team , Rhodes " came out in wonderful form ... [ His ] triumph delighted everybody ... He not only accomplished skilful work in bowling but made his thousand runs [ in county matches ] with an average of 40 . " Rhodes doubled his wicket tally from 1925 , taking 115 at an average of 14 @.@ 86 . In all first @-@ class matches he scored 1 @,@ 132 runs ( average 34 @.@ 30 ) , the final time he passed 1 @,@ 000 runs in a season , and completed his 16th and final double . 
 In 1926 the Australians toured England for the first time since 1921 . The English selectors decided to add two professional cricketers to their committee , choosing Rhodes and Jack Hobbs . With Rhodes in such good form and leading the bowling averages , the selectors tried to convince him to play for England on several occasions through the season but he refused on the grounds that younger men should be chosen . The first four Tests were all drawn ; the selectors were conscious , as England entered the final Test , the team had won only one of its previous 19 matches against Australia . The deciding game , at the Oval , was to be played to a finish no matter how long it took . The selectors dropped the captain , Arthur Carr , and replaced him with the inexperienced Percy Chapman . They also recalled Rhodes , aged nearly 49 , having finally overcome his objections . According to Wisden , the selection of Rhodes " naturally occasioned a good deal of surprise " . 
 England batted first , but made a disappointing total of 280 ; Rhodes , batting at number seven , scored 28 . In the Australian innings of 302 Rhodes bowled 25 overs and took two wickets for 35 , helped by a worn area on the pitch which helped him to spin the ball . He later described feeling nervous when first bowling , but said that he was heartened by the warm welcome he received from the crowd . After the start of England 's second innings an overnight thunderstorm soaked the pitch , leaving it very difficult to bat on next day . However , Hobbs and Sutcliffe put on 172 runs for the first wicket and England eventually scored 436 , leaving Australia to make 415 to win in unfavourable conditions for batting . Rhodes quickly began taking wickets , and went on to take four for 44 . Australia were bowled out for 125 , and amid widespread jubilation , England won the series and Ashes . Wisden 's judged Rhodes 's selection to be " crowned with complete success " , his bowling " proving no small factor in determining the issue of the struggle . " The Wisden editor believed Rhodes had shown himself still to be England 's best bowler and called his triumph " immensely popular . " 
 = = = Late career = = = 
 Rhodes continued to play for Yorkshire until 1930 , but averaged under 30 with the bat in each season and only scored one more hundred , in 1928 . He failed to reach 1 @,@ 000 runs in a season again , but as a bowler he took 85 wickets in 1927 , 115 in 1928 and 100 in 1929 . In 1927 the Yorkshire committee opened a public testimonial for Rhodes , donating £ 250 themselves ; it eventually raised £ 1 @,@ 821 , worth more than £ 80 @,@ 000 in 2010 . During the 1927 season , he played his 1,000th first @-@ class match when Yorkshire played Nottinghamshire on 23 July , becoming the first and , as of 2015 , only cricketer to play so many first @-@ class matches . On 10 May 1929 , he became the first man to take 4 @,@ 000 first @-@ class wickets during a match against Oxford University . As of 2015 , no other player has taken so many wickets . 
 By 1927 , Yorkshire wished to appoint a more competent and permanent captain , instead of continuing the succession of ineffective amateurs , and planned to ask Herbert Sutcliffe , a professional , to take the post . Frederick Toone encouraged Rhodes to offer his resignation as senior professional , possibly with a view to installing a new regime , but Rhodes declined . Meanwhile , the proposed appointment of Sutcliffe caused controversy ; some members of the county believed Rhodes should be appointed . Rhodes pointed out he had not been offered the captaincy , nor had his views been sought . He felt unappreciated when he was not offered first refusal of the captaincy . A poll of Yorkshire members showed a marked preference for Rhodes over Sutcliffe as captain ; the disagreements persuaded Sutcliffe to decline the offer , and another amateur was appointed . 
 In 1929 – 30 , Rhodes was selected in a MCC team , containing several veteran players , to tour West Indies — Rhodes described it as an " old <unk> " team . Given a heavy workload with the ball , he took 39 first @-@ class wickets , averaging 24 @.@ 28 , and scored 129 runs at an average of 25 @.@ 80 with a top score 36 . In the four Test matches Rhodes took ten wickets at an average of 45 @.@ 30 . On 12 April 1930 , the last day of the final Test , Rhodes was 52 years , 165 days , making him the oldest ever Test cricketer ; this remains a record in 2015 . 
 = = = Retirement and coaching = = = 
 During the 1930 season , Rhodes announced his intention to retire from cricket at the end of the summer . He was finding it harder to take wickets , and the workload placed on him in the West Indies had decreased his enthusiasm for the game . By this time , Hedley Verity and Bill Bowes had emerged to strengthen the Yorkshire bowling . Through an ex @-@ captain of Yorkshire , Harrow School offered Rhodes the post of professional cricket coach , which he accepted . Rhodes missed several matches towards the end of the 1930 season , before ending his career at the Scarborough Festival . His last match was for H. D. G. Leveson Gower 's XI against the Australians , where his figures were five for 93 ; he took a wicket with his last ball in first @-@ class cricket . Rhodes 's figures for his final season were 73 wickets at an average of 19 @.@ 10 and 478 runs at an average of 22 @.@ 76 . 
 Over his career Rhodes appeared in 1 @,@ 110 first @-@ class matches , which remains a world record in 2015 . In these games he scored 39 @,@ 969 runs , the 17th highest career total of any batsman . He took 4 @,@ 204 wickets , as of 2015 still the highest total in first @-@ class cricket . In his 58 Tests Rhodes scored 2 @,@ 325 runs ( average 30 @.@ 19 ) and took 127 wickets ( average 26 @.@ 96 ) . He was the first player in the world to accumulate 2 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets in Tests . 
 Rhodes coached at Harrow School until 1936 . Cricket was very important to the school , and they were following the lead of Eton College who had appointed George Hirst as their coach . However , Rhodes 's personality and generally critical nature did not communicate well with privileged schoolboys who were accustomed to getting their own way , and he was eventually replaced with the more genial and sympathetic Middlesex professional Patsy Hendren . This was in contrast to the success Hirst enjoyed at Eton . According to Bowes , Rhodes had vast technical knowledge , but unlike Hirst did not know how to get the best out of people . " [ He ] could not relate to beginners . But if you were a Test match player looking to get advice , Wilfred was superb . " 
 = = Style and personality = = 
 As a bowler , Rhodes was recognised by critics as one of the greatest slow bowlers of all time . Very effective at dismissing batsmen on difficult pitches , it was difficult to score runs from his bowling even on a good batting surface . He could make the ball turn if the pitch offered the slightest assistance , particularly if it had been affected by rain . Cricket writer E. W. Swanton described how Rhodes had " a beautifully controlled , economical and rhythmical action which ensured supreme accuracy of length and direction . He was a master of the stock left @-@ hander 's spin and could vary it with the ball that came on with the arm . " In his early years as a bowler , Rhodes was able to spin the ball very sharply , and while this ability decreased in later years , he became expert at working out a batsman 's weaknesses . Critics considered him expert at flighting the ball ; Neville Cardus wrote that " Flight was his secret . Flight and the curving line , now higher , now lower , tempting , inimical ; every ball like every other ball , yet somehow unlike ; each over in collusion with the others , part of a plot ... " In the early part of his career , his bowling partnership with Hirst , who shared Rhodes 's Kirkheaton birthplace , was particularly effective and established a formidable reputation . As time passed , his accuracy increased to the extent that it seemed every ball landed in exactly the same place . In his first five seasons , he was top of the national bowling averages twice and in second place three times , while in the first six seasons after the war , he was first four times and second once . In his whole career , he only fell outside the top 20 in the bowling averages in four seasons . 
 Rhodes claimed that he preferred batting to bowling . A right @-@ handed batsman with a good defensive technique , Rhodes was a strong driver of the ball who scored more quickly in the earlier part of his career . Analysts maintained that Rhodes had only two or three effective shots , though his technique was good . Cricket writer E. W. Swanton described Rhodes as a " craftsman rather than an artist " . Neville Cardus , in his obituary of Rhodes , said that the Yorkshireman " made himself into a batsman by practice and hard thinking " , and that while often " dour and parsimonious " , he was capable of hitting out . After changing to the two @-@ eyed stance more of his runs came on the leg @-@ side ; in later years , Rhodes often used his pads rather than play a shot , a tactic generally regarded as negative . A feature of his batting career was his successful opening partnership with Hobbs , particularly their enterprise in running between the wickets . In his career , he scored over 190 in an innings five times and twice scored centuries in each innings of a match . Although Rhodes 's primary function varied between bowler and batsman , he recorded 16 doubles to establish a record for any cricketer . 
 When Rhodes was involved in matches , Cardus believed that " he was not a man given to affability " , showing annoyance on the field and being critical of the performances of others . According to historian Anthony Woodhouse , Rhodes was a " dour , methodical and calculating cricketer . " Not popular in the way that a player like Hirst was popular , Rhodes " commanded respect rather than plaudits " in the words of Bowes . An introvert , he did not always get along with the more extrovert Hirst , possibly owing to mutual jealousy and some of Hirst 's jocular comments , and was rarely pictured smiling . However , Rhodes became more relaxed and approachable in later life , particularly after his eyesight failed . Cardus was surprised , after meeting him in 1950 , at how much more readily Rhodes engaged in conversation , commenting that " history comes from his mouth in rivers " . His obituary in The Times concluded : " Gruff or mellow , he was all of a piece , a fighting Yorkshireman , superbly gifted . "
