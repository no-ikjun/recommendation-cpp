 = = = Parental care = = = 
 Although care of offspring is poorly understood in frogs , up to an estimated 20 % of amphibian species may care for their young in some way . The evolution of parental care in frogs is driven primarily by the size of the water body in which they breed . Those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour . Because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies , some frog species started to lay their eggs on land . Once this happened , the desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival . The subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care . 
 In small pools , predators are mostly absent and competition between tadpoles becomes the variable that constrains their survival . Certain frog species avoid this competition by making use of smaller phytotelmata ( water @-@ filled leaf axils or small woody cavities ) as sites for depositing a few tadpoles . While these smaller rearing sites are free from competition , they also lack sufficient nutrients to support a tadpole without parental assistance . Frog species that changed from the use of larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilized eggs . The female strawberry poison @-@ dart frog ( Oophaga pumilio ) lays her eggs on the forest floor . The male frog guards them from predation and carries water in his cloaca to keep them moist . When they hatch , the female moves the tadpoles on her back to a water @-@ holding bromeliad or other similar water body , depositing just one in each location . She visits them regularly and feeds them by laying one or two unfertilized eggs in the <unk> , continuing to do this until the young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis . The granular poison frog ( Oophaga granulifera ) looks after its tadpoles in a similar way . 
 Many other diverse forms of parental care are seen in frogs . The tiny male Colostethus <unk> stands guard over his egg cluster , laid under a stone or log . When the eggs hatch , he transports the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool , where he partially immerses himself in the water and one or more tadpoles drop off . He then moves on to another pool . The male common midwife toad ( <unk> <unk> ) carries the eggs around with him attached to his hind legs . He keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond , and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters . After three to six weeks , he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles . The <unk> frog ( Physalaemus <unk> ) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation . The foam is made from proteins and lectins , and seems to have antimicrobial properties . Several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft . The eggs are laid in the centre , followed by alternate layers of foam and eggs , finishing with a foam capping . 
 Some frogs protect their offspring inside their own bodies . Both male and female pouched frogs ( Assa <unk> ) guard their eggs , which are laid on the ground . When the eggs hatch , the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass . The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side , where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs . The female gastric @-@ brooding frog ( <unk> sp . ) from Australia , now probably extinct , swallows her fertilized eggs , which then develop inside her stomach . She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid . The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment . After six or seven weeks , they are ready for metamorphosis . The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs , which hop away from her mouth . The female Darwin 's frog ( <unk> <unk> ) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground , where they are guarded by the male . When the tadpoles are about to hatch , they are engulfed by the male , which carries them around inside his much @-@ enlarged vocal sac . Here they are immersed in a frothy , viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs . They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis , after which they move into the male 's mouth and emerge . 
 = = Defence = = 
 At first sight , frogs seem rather defenceless because of their small size , slow movement , thin skin , and lack of defensive structures , such as spines , claws or teeth . Many use camouflage to avoid detection , the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings . Some can make prodigious leaps , often into water , that help them to evade potential attackers , while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies . 
 The skin of many frogs contains mild toxic substances called <unk> to make them unpalatable to potential predators . Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands , the parotoid glands , located on the sides of their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies . These glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous . If the noxious effect is immediate , the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape . If the effect develops more slowly , the predator may learn to avoid that species in future . Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours , an adaptive strategy known as aposematism . The poison dart frogs in the family Dendrobatidae do this . They are typically red , orange , or yellow , often with contrasting black markings on their bodies . <unk> <unk> is not poisonous , but mimics the appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators . Other species , such as the European fire @-@ bellied toad ( Bombina bombina ) , have their warning colour underneath . They " flash " this when attacked , adopting a pose that exposes the vivid colouring on their bellies . 
 Some frogs , such as the poison dart frogs , are especially toxic . The native people of South America extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting , although few species are toxic enough to be used for this purpose . At least two non @-@ poisonous frog species in tropical America ( Eleutherodactylus <unk> and <unk> lineatus ) mimic the colouration of dart poison frogs for self @-@ protection . Some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat . Others , such as the Australian corroboree frogs ( <unk> corroboree and <unk> <unk> ) , can synthesize the alkaloids themselves . The chemicals involved may be irritants , hallucinogens , <unk> , nerve poisons or <unk> . Many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons , but other creatures , including humans who handle the frogs , may be severely affected . 
 Some frogs use bluff or deception . The European common toad ( Bufo bufo ) adopts a characteristic stance when attacked , inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered . The bullfrog ( Rana catesbeiana ) crouches down with eyes closed and head tipped forward when threatened . This places the parotoid glands in the most effective position , the other glands on its back begin to ooze noxious secretions and the most vulnerable parts of its body are protected . Another tactic used by some frogs is to " scream " , the sudden loud noise tending to startle the predator . The gray tree frog ( Hyla versicolor ) makes an explosive sound that sometimes repels the shrew Blarina brevicauda . Although toads are avoided by many predators , the common garter snake ( Thamnophis sirtalis ) regularly feeds on them . The strategy employed by juvenile American toads ( Bufo americanus ) on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile . This is usually successful , with the snake passing by and the toad remaining undetected . If it is encountered by the snake 's head , however , the toad hops away before crouching defensively . 
 = = Distribution and conservation status = = 
 Frogs live on all the continents except Antarctica , but they are not present on certain islands , especially those far away from continental land masses . Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory , such as stretches of sea , mountain ridges , deserts , forest clearance , road construction , or other man @-@ made barriers . Usually , a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions , such as Europe . Some frogs inhabit arid areas , such as deserts , and rely on specific adaptations to survive . Members of the Australian genus Cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water @-@ impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods . Once it rains , they emerge , find a temporary pool , and breed . Egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other frogs , so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up . Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment . The wood frog ( Rana sylvatica ) , whose habitat extends into the Arctic Circle , buries itself in the ground during winter . Although much of its body freezes during this time , it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs , which protects them from damage . 
 In 2006 , of 4 @,@ 035 species of amphibians that depend on water during some lifecycle stage , 1 @,@ 356 ( 33 @.@ 6 % ) were considered to be threatened . This is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1 @,@ 427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status . Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s . More than one @-@ third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction , and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s . Among these species are the gastric @-@ brooding frogs of Australia and the golden toad of Costa Rica . The latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and its population crashed in 1987 , along with about 20 other frog species in the area . This could not be linked directly to human activities , such as deforestation , and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size . Elsewhere , habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline , as are pollutants , climate change , increased UVB radiation , and the introduction of non @-@ native predators and competitors . A Canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss . Emerging infectious diseases , including chytridiomycosis and <unk> , are also devastating populations . 
 Many environmental scientists believe amphibians , including frogs , are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health because of their intermediate positions in food chains , their permeable skins , and typically biphasic lives ( aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults ) . It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline , while those with direct development are the most resistant . 
 Frog mutations and genetic defects have increased since the 1990s . These often include missing legs or extra legs . Various causes have been identified or hypothesized , including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn on the surface of ponds , chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers , and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae . Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors , environmental factors contributing to rates of disease , and vulnerability to attack by parasites . <unk> impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood . An increase in the number of frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs , because the trematode 's complex lifecycle includes the <unk> snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds . 
 In a few cases , captive breeding programs have been established and have largely been successful . In 2007 , the application of certain probiotic bacteria was reported to protect amphibians from chytridiomycosis . One current project , the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project , has subsequently been developed to rescue species at risk of this disease in eastern Panama , and to develop field applications for probiotic therapy . The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums named 2008 as the " Year of the Frog " in order to draw attention to the conservation issues faced by them . 
 The cane toad ( Bufo marinus ) is a very adaptable species native to South and Central America . In the 1930s , it was introduced into Puerto Rico , and later various other islands in the Pacific and Caribbean region , as a biological pest control agent . In 1935 , 3000 toads were liberated in the sugar cane fields of Queensland , Australia , in an attempt to control cane beetles such as <unk> <unk> , the larvae of which damage and kill the canes . Initial results in many of these countries were positive , but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments . They bred freely , competed with native frog species , ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates , had few predators in their adopted habitats , and poisoned pets , carnivorous birds , and mammals . In many of these countries , they are now regarded both as pests and invasive species , and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them .

 Frog legs are eaten by humans in many parts of the world . French <unk> de <unk> or frog legs dish is a traditional dish particularly served in the region of the Dombes ( département of Ain ) . The dish is also common in French @-@ speaking parts of Louisiana , particularly the Cajun areas of Southern Louisiana as well as New Orleans , United States . In Asia , frog legs are consumed in China , Vietnam , Thailand and Indonesia . Chinese edible frog and pig frogs are farmed and consumed on a large scale in some areas of China . Frog legs are part of Chinese Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine . In Indonesia , frog @-@ leg soup is known as <unk> or <unk> . Indonesia is the world 's largest exporter of frog meat , exporting more than 5 @,@ 000 tonnes of frog meat each year , mostly to France , Belgium and Luxembourg . 
 Originally , they were supplied from local wild populations , but overexploitation led to a diminution in the supply . This resulted in the development of frog farming and a global trade in frogs . The main importing countries are France , Belgium , Luxembourg , and the United States , while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China . The annual global trade in the American bullfrog ( Rana catesbeiana ) , mostly farmed in China , varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes . 
 Coon , possum , partridges , prairie hen , and frogs were among the fare Mark Twain recorded as part of American cuisine .

 Frogs are used for dissections in high school and university anatomy classes , often first being injected with coloured substances to enhance contrasts among the biological systems . This practice is declining due to animal welfare concerns , and " digital frogs " are now available for virtual dissection . 
 Frogs have served as experimental animals throughout the history of science . Eighteenth @-@ century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs . In 1852 , H. F. <unk> used a frog 's heart in a procedure called a <unk> ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates . The African clawed frog or <unk> ( Xenopus laevis ) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests in the first half of the 20th century . A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs , a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben . This is because a hormone , human chorionic gonadotropin , is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy . In 1952 , Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer . This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep , and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals . 
 Frogs are used in cloning research and other branches of embryology . Although alternative pregnancy tests have been developed , biologists continue to use Xenopus as a model organism in developmental biology because their embryos are large and easy to manipulate , they are readily obtainable , and can easily be kept in the laboratory . Xenopus laevis is increasingly being displaced by its smaller relative , Xenopus tropicalis , which reaches its reproductive age in five months rather than the one to two years for X. laevis , thus facilitating faster studies across generations . The genome of X. tropicalis is being sequenced .

 Because frog toxins are extraordinarily diverse , they have raised the interest of biochemists as a " natural pharmacy " . The alkaloid epibatidine , a painkiller 200 times more potent than morphine is made by some species of poison dart frogs , although it can also cause death by lung paralysis . Other chemicals isolated from the skins of frogs may offer resistance to HIV infection . Dart poisons are under active investigation for their potential as therapeutic drugs . 
 It has long been suspected that pre @-@ Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen , but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad ( Bufo <unk> ) . These contain bufotenin ( 5 @-@ MeO @-@ DMT ) , a psychoactive compound that has been used in modern times as a recreational drug . Typically , the skin secretions are dried and then smoked . Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media , but this may be an urban myth . 
 <unk> from the skin of the golden poison frog ( Phyllobates terribilis ) are traditionally used by native Colombians to poison the darts they use for hunting . The tip of the projectile is rubbed over the back of the frog and the dart is launched from a blowgun . The combination of the two alkaloid toxins <unk> and <unk> is so powerful , one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22 @,@ 000 mice . Two other species , the <unk> poison dart frog ( Phyllobates <unk> ) and the black @-@ legged dart frog ( Phyllobates bicolor ) are also used for this purpose . These are less toxic and less abundant than the golden poison frog . They are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart . 
 = = Cultural beliefs = = 
 Frogs feature prominently in folklore , fairy tales , and popular culture . They tend to be portrayed as benign , ugly , and clumsy , but with hidden talents . Examples include Michigan J. Frog , " The Frog Prince " , and Kermit the Frog . The Warner Brothers cartoon One Froggy Evening features Michigan J. Frog , that will only dance and sing for the demolition worker who opens his time capsule , but will not perform in public . " The Frog Prince " is a fairy tale about a frog that turns into a handsome prince after he has rescued a princess 's golden ball and she has taken him into her palace . Kermit the Frog is a conscientious and disciplined character from The Muppet Show and Sesame Street ; while openly friendly and greatly talented , he is often portrayed as cringing at the fanciful behavior of more flamboyant characters . 
 Toads have a more sinister reputation . It was believed in European folklore that they were associated with witches as their familiar spirits and had magical powers . The toxic secretions from their skin was used in brewing evil potions , but was also put to use to create magical cures for human and livestock ailments . They were associated with the devil ; in John Milton 's Paradise Lost , Satan was depicted as a toad pouring poison into Eve 's ear . 
 The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals , and often depicted frogs in their art . In Panama , local legend held that good fortune would come to anyone who spotted a Panamanian golden frog . Some believed when one of these frogs died , it would turn into a golden talisman known as a <unk> . Today , despite being extinct in the wild , Panamanian golden frogs remain an important cultural symbol and are illustrated on decorative cloth <unk> made by the Kuna people . They also appear as part of the inlaid design on a new overpass in Panama City , on T @-@ shirts , and even on lottery tickets .

 Shrewsbury ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) is the county town of Shropshire , England . It is on the River Severn and has a population of approximately 72 @,@ 000 . 
 Shrewsbury is a market town whose centre has a largely unaltered medieval street plan and over 660 listed buildings , including several examples of timber framing from the 15th and 16th centuries . Shrewsbury Castle , a red sandstone fortification , and Shrewsbury Abbey , a former Benedictine monastery , were founded in 1074 and 1083 respectively by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury , Roger de Montgomery . The town has historically been a centre for the wool trade and brewing . Horticulture remains popular , and the Shrewsbury Flower Show is one of the largest horticultural events in England . 
 Located 9 miles ( 14 km ) east of the Welsh border , Shrewsbury serves as the commercial centre for Shropshire and mid @-@ Wales , with a retail output of over £ 299 million per year and light industry and distribution centres , such as Battlefield Enterprise Park , on the outskirts . The A5 and A49 trunk roads cross near to the town , and five railway lines meet at Shrewsbury railway station .

 The town was the early capital of the Kingdom of Powys , known to the ancient Britons as Pengwern , signifying " the alder hill " ; and in Old English as <unk> ( dative <unk> ) , which may mean either " <unk> 's fort " or " the fortified place in the bushes " . This name gradually evolved in three directions , into <unk> , which became Shropshire ; into <unk> , which became Salop / <unk> ( an alternative name for both town and county ) , and into <unk> , which eventually became the town 's name , Shrewsbury . Its later Welsh name <unk> means " fortified place " . 
 Over the ages , the geographically important town has been the site of many conflicts , particularly between the English and Welsh . The Angles , under King Offa of Mercia , took possession in 778 . 
 Nearby is the village of Wroxeter , 5 miles ( 8 km ) to the south @-@ east . This was once the site of Viroconium , the fourth largest cantonal capital in Roman Britain . As Caer <unk> it is a possible alternative for the Dark Age seat of the Kingdom of Powys . The importance of the Shrewsbury area in the Roman era was recently underlined with the discovery of the Shrewsbury Hoard in 2009 .

 Shrewsbury 's known history commences in the Early Middle Ages , having been founded c . 800 AD . It is believed that Anglo @-@ Saxon Shrewsbury was most probably a settlement fortified through the use of earthworks comprising a ditch and rampart , which were then shored up with a wooden stockade . There is evidence to show that by the beginning of the 900s , Shrewsbury was home to a mint . 
 The Welsh besieged it in 1069 , but were repelled by William the Conqueror . Roger de Montgomery was given the town as a gift from William , and built Shrewsbury Castle in 1074 , taking the title of Earl . He founded Shrewsbury Abbey as a Benedictine monastery in 1083 . The 3rd Earl , Robert of Bellême , was deposed in 1102 and the title forfeited , in consequence of rebelling against Henry I and joining the Duke of Normandy 's invasion of English in 1101 . In 1138 , King Stephen successfully besieged the castle held by William FitzAlan for the Empress Maud during the period known as the Anarchy . 
 It was in the late Middle Ages ( 14th and 15th centuries ) when the town was at its height of commercial importance . This was mainly due to the wool trade , a major industry at the time , with the rest of Britain and Europe , especially with the River Severn and Watling Street as trading routes . The Shrewsbury Drapers Company dominated the trade in Welsh wool for many years . 
 In 1403 the Battle of Shrewsbury was fought a few miles north of the town centre , at Battlefield ; it was fought between King Henry IV and Henry Hotspur Percy , with the King emerging victorious , an event celebrated in William Shakespeare 's Henry IV , Part 1 , Act 5 .

 Shrewsbury 's monastic gathering was disbanded with the Dissolution of the Monasteries and as such the Abbey was closed in 1540 . However , it is believed that Henry VIII thereafter intended to make Shrewsbury a cathedral city after the formation of the Church of England , but the citizens of the town declined the offer . Despite this , Shrewsbury thrived throughout the 16th and 17th centuries ; largely due to the town 's fortuitous location , which allowed it to control the Welsh wool trade . As a resultant a number of grand edifices , including the Ireland 's Mansion ( built 1575 ) and Draper 's Hall ( 1658 ) , were constructed . It was also in this period that Edward VI gave permission for the foundation of a free school , which was later to become Shrewsbury School . 
 During the English Civil War , the town was a Royalist stronghold and only fell to Parliament forces after they were let in by a parliamentarian sympathiser at the St Mary 's Water Gate ( now also known as Traitor 's Gate ) . After Thomas Mytton captured Shrewsbury in February 1645 ; in following with the ordnance of no quarter ; a dozen Irish prisoners were selected to be killed after picking lots . This prompted Prince Rupert to respond by executing Parliamentarian prisoners in Oswestry . Shrewsbury Unitarian Church was founded in 1662 . By the 18th century Shrewsbury had become an important market town and stop off for stagecoaches travelling between London and Holyhead on their way to Ireland ; this led to the establishment of a number of coaching inns , many of which , such as the Lion Hotel , are extant to this day . 
 Local soldier and statesman Robert Clive was Shrewsbury 's MP from 1762 until his death in 1774 . Clive also served once as the town 's mayor in 1762 . 
 St Chad 's Church collapsed in 1788 after attempts to expand the crypt compromised the structural integrity of the tower above ; it was , however , rebuilt just four years later as a large neo @-@ classical round church in a new location close to the Quarry Park . 
 In the period directly after Napoleon 's surrender after Waterloo ( 18 June 1815 ) , the town 's own 53rd ( Shropshire ) Regiment of Foot was sent to guard him in his exile on St Helena . A locket containing a lock of the emperor 's hair ( presented to an officer of the 53rd ) remains to this day in the collections of the Shropshire Regimental Museum at Shrewsbury Castle .

 Shrewsbury has also played a part in Western intellectual history , by being the town where the naturalist Charles Darwin was born and brought up . The town is also home to the <unk> Flax Mill , the world 's first iron @-@ framed building , which is commonly regarded as " the grandfather of the skyscraper " . Its importance was officially recognised in the 1950s , resulting in it becoming a Grade I listed building . Shrewsbury in the Industrial Revolution was also on the Shrewsbury Canal , which linked it with the Shropshire Canal and the rest of the canal network of Great Britain . Despite this , Shrewsbury escaped much of the industrialisation taking place in 19th century Britain due to its isolation from other large manufacturing towns and ports . 
 The town suffered very little from the bombing runs in the Second World War that did damage to many English locations . The worst case in Shrewsbury , was in 1940 , a woman and her two grandchildren were killed when a cottage was destroyed on Ellesmere Road , the only local air raid deaths . Therefore , many of its ancient buildings remain intact and there was little redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s , which arguably destroyed the character of many historic towns in the UK . However , a large area of half timbered houses and businesses was destroyed to make way for the Raven Meadows multi @-@ story car park , and other historic buildings were demolished to make way for the brutalist architectural style of the 1960s . The town was saved from a new ' inner ring road ' due to its challenging geography . 
 From the late 1990s the town experienced severe flooding problems from the Severn and Rea Brook . In the autumn of 2000 large swathes of the town were underwater , notably Frankwell , which flooded three times in six weeks . The Frankwell flood defences were completed in 2003 , along with the new offices of the borough council . More recently , such as in 2005 and 2007 , flooding has been less severe , and the defences have generally held back floodwaters from the town centre areas . However , the town car parks are often left to be flooded in the winter , which reduces trade in the town , most evidenced in the run up to Christmas in 2007 . 
 In 2000 and again in 2002 , Shrewsbury unsuccessfully applied for city status . 
 Shrewsbury won the West Midlands Capital of Enterprise award in 2004 . The town has two large expanding business parks , Shrewsbury Business Park by the A5 in the southeast and Battlefield Enterprise Park in the north . There are many residential developments currently under construction in the town to cater for the increasing numbers of people wishing to live in the town , which is a popular place to commute to Telford , Wolverhampton and Birmingham from . 
 A 2005 report on prison population found that HM Prison Shrewsbury was the most overcrowded in England and Wales . The prison , which was also known as the Dana , was closed in 2013 and then sold by the Ministry of Justice to private property developers in 2014 . 
 In 2009 Shrewsbury Town Council was formed and the town 's traditional coat of arms was returned to everyday use .

 Shrewsbury is about 14 miles ( 23 km ) west of Telford , 43 miles ( 69 km ) west of Birmingham and the West Midlands Conurbation , and about 153 miles ( 246 km ) north @-@ west of the capital , London . More locally , the town is to the east of Welshpool , with Bridgnorth and Kidderminster to the south @-@ east . The border with Wales is 9 miles ( 14 km ) to the west . The town centre is partially built on a hill whose elevation is , at its highest , 246 feet ( 75 m ) above sea level . The longest river in the UK , the River Severn , flows through the town , forming a meander around its centre . The town is subject to flooding from the river . 
 The town is near <unk> Hill , a site where Precambrian rocks , some of the oldest rocks in the county can be found , and the town itself is sited on an area of largely Carboniferous rocks . A fault , the Hodnet Fault , starts approximately at the town , and runs as far as Market Drayton . 
 = = = Suburbs and metropolitan area = = = 
 There are a number of suburbs and surrounding villages . The River Severn separates the western , southern and eastern suburbs from the town centre and northern suburbs . An example of a large neighbouring village that has effectively become part of the metropolitan area is Bayston Hill , which grew considerably in the latter half of the 20th century and is now separated from the Meole Brace suburb by only a few fields and the A5 by @-@ pass . It remains , however , a separate entity to the town , with its own parish council , etc . Bayston Hill lies 3 miles ( 5 km ) south of the town centre of Shrewsbury and on the A49 and near to the A5 . The smaller village of Battlefield , north of the town , is considered a suburb of the metropolitan area . It is covered by the parish of Shrewsbury .

 The climate of Shrewsbury is similar to that of the rest of Shropshire , generally moderate . Rainfall averages 76 to 100 cm ( 30 to 39 in ) , influenced by being in the rainshadow of the Cambrian Mountains from warm , moist frontal systems of the Atlantic Ocean , which bring generally light precipitation in autumn and spring . The nearest weather station is at Shawbury , about 6 @.@ 5 miles ( 10 @.@ 5 km ) north @-@ west of Shrewsbury town centre . The local topography , being that of a low @-@ lying plain surrounded by higher ground to the west , south and east gives the Shrewsbury area its own microclimate – the absolute maximum at Shawbury of 34 @.@ 9 ° C ( 94 @.@ 8 ° F ) and absolute minimum of − 25 @.@ 2 ° C ( − 13 @.@ 4 ° F ) represents the largest temperature range of any individual weather station in the British Isles – although the maximum range of average temperatures tends to peak to the south east of the Shrewsbury area , particularly in the south east midlands , inland East Anglia and inland south east England . 
 In an average year , the warmest day is 28 @.@ 4 ° C ( 83 @.@ 1 ° F ) , giving a total of 8 @.@ 9 days of 25 @.@ 1 ° C ( 77 @.@ 2 ° F ) or above . The absolute maximum of 34 @.@ 9 ° C ( 94 @.@ 8 ° F ) was recorded in August 1990 .

 The Borough of Shrewsbury 's first Charter was granted by King Henry I allowing the collection of rents . King Richard I granted another early charter in 1189 and from that time the town ’ s regional importance and influence increased , as well as its autonomy from the county of Shropshire . Further charters were granted in 1199 ( King John ) , 1495 ( Henry VII ) , 1638 ( Charles I ) and 1685 ( James II ) . In 1974 a charter from the Queen incorporated the Borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham , under the auspices of which the town remained until 2009 . 
 Shrewsbury is the administrative centre for the new Shropshire Council , the unitary authority covering most of Shropshire ( but excluding the Borough of Telford and Wrekin , a separate unitary authority area ) . Shropshire Council have their headquarters at the Shirehall , on Abbey Foregate , whilst the Guildhall , on Frankwell Quay , is partly utilised by the council as one of its many offices and customer service points around the county . 
 Shrewsbury is in the Shrewsbury and Atcham constituency and is the only large settlement in the constituency .

 = = = Town Council = = = 
 Shrewsbury was until 2009 an unparished area and had no town or parish council ( s ) , instead the Mayor of Shrewsbury and Atcham was also the mayor of the town . However , as part of wider changes to local governance in Shropshire , the town was parished on 13 May 2008 , with a single parish created covering the entire town and previously unparished area . Shrewsbury is the second most populous civil parish in England ( only Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare has a greater population ) with a population of approximately 72 @,@ 000 . The area of the parish is 3 @,@ 799 hectares ( 9 @,@ 390 acres ) . 
 The town council , which is the parish council , first convened on 1 April 2009 , and its chair is the Mayor of Shrewsbury . For the interim period before the first elections , the existing county councillors who represented electoral divisions covering Shrewsbury were the town councillors . On 4 June 2009 , the first election was held to the town council , with councillors elected from 17 single @-@ member wards coterminous with Shropshire Council electoral divisions . 
 The political make @-@ up of the town council , as of the 2013 local elections , sees Labour as the largest party with 7 seats , and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats both on 5 . The current Mayor of Shrewsbury is Liberal Democrat councillor Miles Kenny . 
 The town council has its headquarters and meeting place at The Guildhall , which was the headquarters of the former Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council . 
 = = = = Coat of arms = = = = 
 The coat of arms of the former Shrewsbury Borough Council , and now the Town Council , depicts three loggerheads , with the motto <unk> <unk> , a Latin phrase that can be translated to " May Shrewsbury Flourish " . The coat of arms of the ( now abolished ) Shrewsbury and Atcham Borough Council was Shrewsbury 's shield with the addition of Atcham Bridge running above the loggerheads . Shrewsbury Town F.C. historically used the loggerheads , but from 1986 till 1992 had a Celtic shrew and from 2007 to 2015 had a badge depicting a lion rather than a loggerhead . A new loggerheads badge embedded in a circular shape returned for 2015 @-@ 16 season . ( A loggerhead , in heraldry , means a leopard 's head – its naming derived from the carving of such faces on the ends of logs , including battering rams ) . The flag of Shropshire , and other county crests etc . , also uses the three loggerheads .

 According to the United Kingdom Census 2001 , the population of the town of Shrewsbury was 67 @,@ 126 . The same census put the population of the wider ( and now abolished ) borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham at 95 @,@ 850 . In 1981 the population of the town was 57 @,@ 731 and in 1991 the population of the town was 64 @,@ 219 . Shrewsbury is Shropshire 's second largest town , after Telford . 
 The 2001 census also indicates that the population of the town consists of 51 @.@ 1 % females , and 48 @.@ 9 % males , which echoes the trend of Shrewsbury and Atcham borough , and that of Shropshire as a whole .

 Throughout the Medieval period , Shrewsbury was a centre for the wool trade , and used its position on the River Severn to transport goods across England via the canal system . Unlike many other towns in this period , Shrewsbury never became a centre for heavy industry . By the early 1900s , the town became focused on transport services and the general service and professional sector , owing to its position on the A5 road , part of the strategic route to North Wales . 
 The town is the location of the town and county councils , and a number of retail complexes , both in and out of the town centre , and these provide significant employment . Four in five jobs in the town are in the service industry . Within this sector , the largest employers are the administration and distribution sectors , which includes retail , food and accommodation . 
 Shrewsbury is home to four shopping centres . The principal centres comprise the Darwin and Pride Hill shopping centres , which house many high street retailers such as Marks & Spencer , H & M , Next , and Boots . Riverside provides further retail accommodation for stores including Wilkinson . A plan to redevelop Riverside and integrate a new development with the Darwin and Pride Hill centres was granted planning permission in April 2012 . The project is dubbed " New Riverside " . The Parade Shopping Centre is a fourth centre exclusively housing independent retailers . There are also two retail warehouse clusters : at Meole Brace Retail Park to the south , and at Sundorne Retail Park to the north . Major supermarkets in the town are the environmentally friendly Tesco Extra at Harlescott , Morrisons on Whitchurch Road , Asda on Old Potts Way , Sainsbury 's at Meole Brace , and most recently a Waitrose on <unk> Road . 
 The visitor economy of Shrewsbury and Atcham was worth about £ 115 million in 2001 , with about 2 @,@ 500 people employed directly in the visitor industry and 3 @,@ 400 indirectly . There were about 3 @.@ 1 million visitors – both day visitors and staying visitors – to the borough in 2001 , with 88 % being day visitors and 12 % being staying visitors ; staying visitors accounted for 42 % of spending . Shrewsbury 's position of being the only sizable town for a large area , especially to the west in Mid @-@ Wales , allows it to attract a large retail base beyond that of its resident population . This is not only evident in the retail sector , but also in the healthcare sector , where the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital has the only A & E department westwards until Aberystwyth , about 75 miles ( 121 km ) away . 
 Although a less prominent brewing centre than at Burton @-@ on @-@ Trent , beer made in Shrewsbury was celebrated as early as about 1400 when bard Iolo Goch praised the supply of " <unk> <unk> " dispensed at the <unk> palace of Owain <unk> . In 1900 there were eight breweries in the town , chief among them being Southam 's and <unk> 's , which also had their own maltings and owned many local public houses , as well as five other maltsters , but the conventional brewing industry gradually closed after takeovers in the 1960s , and the last maltings , at <unk> , in 1986 . A real ale brewery was established in the town in 1995 . The <unk> Brewery is based in the Old Dairy in Mytton Oak Road , and produces cask ale and bottle conditioned beers . It has a production of 80 barrels a week and mainly serves the pubs in and around Shrewsbury . 
 In terms of social and economic deprivation , according to the Overall Index of Multiple Deprivation of 2004 , one Super Output Area ( <unk> ) in the town is in the bottom 15 % of all areas nationally . This area is in the ward of Harlescott . A further four <unk> fall into the bottom 30 % nationally , these being in the wards of <unk> , Sundorne , Battlefield and <unk> and Meole Brace . The most affluent areas of the town are generally to the south and west , around the grounds of Shrewsbury School , and the Copthorne area .

 The historic town centre still retains its medieval street pattern and many narrow streets and passages . Some of the passages , especially those that pass through buildings from one street to the next , are called " shuts " ( the word deriving from " to shoot through " from one street to another ) . Many specialist shops , traditional pubs and local restaurants can be found in the hidden corners , squares and lanes of Shrewsbury . Many of the street names have also remained unchanged for centuries and there are some more unusual names , such as Butcher Row , Longden Coleham , <unk> , Mardol , Frankwell , <unk> , Grope Lane , Gullet Passage , <unk> , the Dana , Portobello , Bear Steps , <unk> and <unk> . 
 The public library , in the pre @-@ 1882 Shrewsbury School building , is on Castle Hill . Above the main entrance are two statues bearing the Greek inscriptions " <unk> " and " <unk> " . These portray the virtues " Lover of learning " and " Much learning " to convey the lesson that it is good to gain knowledge through a love of learning . 
 In the centre of the town lies the Quarry . This 29 acre ( 120 @,@ 000 m ² ) riverside park attracts thousands of people throughout the year and is enjoyed as a place of recreation . Shrewsbury has traditionally been known as the " Town of Flowers " , a moniker incorporated into many of the signs on entrance to the town via major roads , although this was replaced in 2007 with ' the birthplace of Charles Darwin ' . 
 The British Army 's Light Infantry has been associated with Shrewsbury since the 17th century when the first regiments were formed and many more regiments have been raised at Shrewsbury before being deployed all over the world from the American Revolutionary War to the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan . Today , after several major reorganisations , the Light Infantry now forms part of the regiment known simply as the Rifles . Shrewsbury 's Copthorne Barracks , spiritual home of the Light Division , still houses the Headquarters of the British Army 's 143 ( West Midlands ) Brigade , while that of the 5th Division disbanded in April 2012 as part of the reorganisation of the Army 's Support Command . 
 Between 1962 and 1992 there was a hardened nuclear bunker , built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury , who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four @-@ minute warning alarm in the event of war and warned the population of Shrewsbury in the event of approaching radioactive fallout . The building was manned by up to 120 volunteers who trained on a weekly basis and wore a Royal Air Force style uniform . After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989 , the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995 . However , the nuclear bunker still stands just inside Holywell Street near the Abbey as a lasting reminder of the Cold War , but is now converted and used as a veterinary practice . 
 The tourist information centre is situated in the Shrewsbury Museum & Art Gallery in what used to be the old Music Hall theatre in the town square . The three main museums are Shrewsbury Museum & Art Gallery , Shrewsbury Castle ( which houses the Shropshire Regimental Museum ) and the Coleham Pumping Station . Also , there is the Gateway arts and drama centre and there are also various private galleries and art shops around the town . Another notable feature of the town is Lord Hill 's Column , the largest free @-@ standing Doric column in the world . 
 The Quantum Leap is an abstract sculpture unveiled in the town centre in 2009 to mark the bicentenary on the birth of Shrewsbury biologist Charles Darwin . 
 = = = Bridges = = = 
 Shrewsbury , being almost entirely encircled by the River Severn , has nine bridges across the river and many that cross the Rea Brook . 
 Working downstream from Frankwell Bridge , a modern pedestrian footbridge spans the River Severn between Frankwell and the town centre . Welsh Bridge was built in the 1790s to replace the ancient St George 's Bridge . 
 Further along from the Welsh Bridge is the <unk> Bridge , a pedestrian suspension bridge running between the Quarry and <unk> , built in 1922 . The next bridge along the river is Kingsland Bridge , a privately owned toll bridge , and the subsequent bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge , a pedestrian bridge between Coleham and the town centre . Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge , historically called Stone Bridge , which was rebuilt in the 1930s . Beyond it is the railway station , which is partly built over the river . After the station is Castle Walk Footbridge , another modern pedestrian footbridge . The last bridge to cross the river within the Shrewsbury bypass area is called Telford Way , which has separate lanes for vehicles ( A5112 ) , bicycles and pedestrians . A. E. Housman wrote of the area this verse , which mentions the bridges of the town :

Shrewsbury Greek Orthodox Church , a former Anglican church building , is off Sutton Road to the south . Shrewsbury is home to the Roman Catholic Shrewsbury Cathedral , by the Town Walls , as well as two other parishes in Harlescott and <unk> , within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury . One of the houses in Fish Street , facing St <unk> 's Church , was the site of John Wesley 's first preaching in Shrewsbury ; a wall plaque records the date as 16 March 1761 . According to legend , the spire of St <unk> 's Church was damaged by the Devil in 1553 , and climbed four times by a drunken steeplejack in 1621 . 
 There are several Anglican churches in Shrewsbury . Methodists , Baptists and the United Reformed Church are also represented , alongside newer church groups including Elim Pentecostal and <unk> .

 Shrewsbury is home to one of the largest horticultural events in the UK , it is also the ' Longest running flower show in the world ' – the annual Shrewsbury Flower Show . A two @-@ day event , the Flower Show takes place in mid @-@ August , has been running for more than 125 years , and attracts around 100 @,@ 000 visitors each year . Set in the Quarry park , there are a multitude of events , exhibitions and displays , with a fireworks display at the end of each day . The town is well known for its flower displays , and has won numerous awards in recent years . 
 Theatre Severn is the town 's main performing arts complex . It is situated in Frankwell next to the Welsh Bridge and alongside its namesake , the River Severn . The theatre includes two performance spaces , the 635 seat Main Auditorium and a smaller studio space , the Walker Theatre which can accommodate 250 seating or 500 standing . In November 2015 the theatre celebrated the sale of its 1 millionth ticket since its opening in 2009 . The venue also includes a full sized dance studio , function rooms and restaurant . The new complex replaced the old theatre , the Music Hall , which itself has been refurbished and expanded in preparation for its current use as home to Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery ( opened 2014 ) . Further museums in the town include the acclaimed Shropshire Regimental Museum , based at Shrewsbury Castle , and the restored 19th century steam @-@ powered Coleham Pumping Station , which opens for tours on specific days each year . Nearby National Trust properties include <unk> Park , former home of the Hill family , Barons of Berwick , and the last remaining Town Walls Tower which dates from the 14th century . 
 Shrewsbury is also home to one of the region 's main agricultural shows – the Shropshire County Show ( formerly the West Mid Show ) . This is held every year , usually in May , at the Shropshire Agricultural Showground on the outskirts of town at Coton Hill . The town is host to the Shrewsbury International Music Festival , when musical groups from all over the world come to perform for about a week for local residents , and give a final concert in the abbey . The festival is organised by <unk> Tours . 2006 saw the first Shrewsbury Folk Festival , after the event moved to the town from nearby Bridgnorth . Held annually over the August bank holiday , the event is very popular , with people travelling from across the UK to attend . In 2006 much of the event was held in the Quarry , with other related festivities happening around the town . For 2007 the event moved to the West Midlands Showground on the other side of the river . A new annual arts festival – the Shrewsbury Summer Season – was established in 2004 and runs each year from June to August with an extensive programme of music , visual arts , theatre and spectacle . 
 There are some very old public houses , which have been continuously open , such as the Golden Cross in Princess Street , the Dun Cow in Abbey Foregate , and the King 's Head in Mardol . The Golden Cross is reputed to be the oldest licensed public house in Shrewsbury and records show that it was used as an inn as far back as 1428 . Its original name was the <unk> , because it was originally the sacristy of Old St Chad 's Church .

 Famous literary figures who have visited the town include ( in the 17th century ) Daniel Defoe , Celia Fiennes , the Shrewsbury School @-@ educated Arthur Mainwaring and Ambrose Phillips and playwright George Farquhar whose 1706 play ' The Recruiting Officer ' was set in the town . 
 Later , in the 18th and 19th centuries , the likes of John Wesley , Thomas de Quincey and Benjamin Disraeli the latter of which was MP for Shrewsbury 1841 – 47 , would visit the town . Charles Dickens once also visited to present a series of lectures at the Music Hall , staying at the Lion Hotel . However , in this period the town 's most prolific literary figure and famous son was born – Charles Darwin . Darwin was educated at Shrewsbury School and later , with the development of his 1859 work On the Origin of Species became the preeminent naturalist of the 19th century . Although Darwin 's work was both revolutionary and highly controversial at the time , his teachings and beliefs have become ever more globalised and he is today widely recognised as the father of the modern theory of evolution . 
 In his 1910 novel Howards End , E. M. Forster makes a brief reference to " astonishing Shrewsbury " , an impression he received after having visited the town in the early 20th century . In the same century Shrewsbury became famous for its poets . The Great War poet Wilfred Owen was a resident , whilst his fellow poet Mary Webb much loved the town and referred to it many a time in her works under the guise of Silverton . Owen is the subject of the 1993 sculpture Symmetry , which was unveiled in the grounds of Shrewsbury Abbey , whilst Webb was finally laid to rest in one of the town 's cemeteries . 
 The town appears in the Brother Cadfael novels by Ellis Peters ( pen name of Edith <unk> ) . The novels take Shrewsbury Abbey for their setting , with Shrewsbury and other places in Shropshire portrayed regularly , and have made Medieval Shrewsbury familiar to a wide worldwide readership . 
 The local author , Carol <unk> has written two children 's books , including Jack the Cat , which are set in the town . Also , the children 's author Pauline Fisk wrote about a town called Pengwern , which is based entirely on Shrewsbury , in books including Midnight Blue and Sabrina Fludde . Frank Cottrell Boyce , another children 's author , writes briefly about Shrewsbury in his book Millions . Shrewsbury Library also hosts the West Midlands Literary Heritage website , developed to provide information about West Midland people and places , including those featured in the library 's own West Midland Creative Literature Collection . 
 In film Shrewsbury was used as the setting for the popular 1984 film , A Christmas Carol , which filmed many of its interior and exterior shots in and around the town . The gravestone prop of Ebenezer Scrooge ( played by George C. Scott ) that was used in the movie is still present in the graveyard of St Chad 's Church .

 Shrewsbury is well known in culinary circles for being the namesake of a classic English dessert . Shrewsbury cakes ( or biscuits ) are typically crisp and brittle creations that may incorporate fruit . They can be small in size for serving several at a time , or large for serving as a dessert in their own right . Traditionally Shrewsbury cakes have a distinct hint of lemon . 
 The playwright William Congreve mentioned Shrewsbury cakes in his play The Way of the World in 1700 as a simile ( <unk> – " Why , brother <unk> of Salop , you may be as short as a Shrewsbury cake , if you please . But I tell you ' tis not modish to know relations in town " ) . The recipe is also included in several early cookbooks including The Compleat Cook of 1658 . A final reference to the cakes can be seen to this day as the subject of a plaque affixed to a building close to Shrewsbury 's town library at the top of Pride Hill . The aforementioned plaque marks the spot where the Shrewsbury Cake 's recipe is said to have been pioneered in 1760 by Mr <unk> ; a further quote , drawn from Richard Harris Barham 's <unk> Legends , reads : 
 Shrewsbury is also the origin of the most popular Simnel cake recipe . Different towns had their own recipes and shapes of the Simnel cake . Bury , Devizes and Shrewsbury produced large numbers to their own recipes , but it is the Shrewsbury version that became most well known . Shrewsbury also had a large cheese market in Victorian times .

 Shrewsbury is home to Shrewsbury School , a public school , on a large site ( " Kingsland " ) just south of the town centre overlooking the loop of the Severn . The school was once in the town centre , in the buildings that are now the main county library on Castle Street . Opposite it on the other side of the river is Shrewsbury High School , an independent girls ' day school . 
 The long established Prestfelde School is an independent preparatory school , on London Road , close to the Lord Hill column . As part of the Woodard Schools group , it is affiliated to the largest group of Church of England schools in the country . Whilst originally a school for boys only it diversified and , in the late 1990s , started also accepting girls between the ages of three and thirteen . The school is set in 30 acres ( 12 ha ) of grounds on the outskirts of the town . The town 's other long @-@ established boys ' preparatory school , Kingsland Grange ( on Old Roman Road in Kingsland ) , in 2007 merged with the junior department of Shrewsbury Girls ' High School , sharing the two sites with some classes remaining all @-@ boys or all @-@ girls , but others switching to a co @-@ ed format . 
 <unk> School is an independent day and boarding school for girls , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of Shrewsbury . The school was founded in 1907 and is set in a Grade I listed country house built in 1879 for Rebecca Darby – a great niece of Abraham Darby and a member of the iron @-@ master family who built Ironbridge . 
 However , the majority of the town 's pupils attend one of the seven comprehensive schools . The Priory School , formerly a grammar school for girls ; Meole Brace School currently carries the status of Science College ; The Grange School the status of Arts College ; Sundorne School the status of Sports College and Belvidere School has the status of Technology College . 
 The Wakeman School , which was geographically the closest school to the town centre ' loop ' , next to the English Bridge , was previously called Shrewsbury Technical School , and was attended by the notable First World War poet Wilfred Owen . It closed as part of reorganisation in July 2013 . Additionally , two other establishments outside town serve town students . The Corbet School to the north at <unk> ; and Mary Webb School , in the village of <unk> to the south @-@ west . 
 Post @-@ 16 education is handled by Shrewsbury Sixth Form College , previously the Priory School for Boys recently ranked 17th in the top 20 of sixth form colleges nationally by the Sunday Times newspaper and Shrewsbury College of Arts and Technology , which handles primarily vocational courses . 
 University Centre Shrewsbury has been offering postgraduate courses since autumn 2014 and undergraduate students are being welcomed to the institution from autumn 2015 .

 Shrewsbury is the county 's public transport hub and has road and rail links to the rest of the county and country . 
 Five railway lines connect the town to most corners of Shropshire and the region , and the town is known as the " Gateway to Wales " . Shrewsbury railway station is served by Arriva Trains Wales and London Midland with trains running north to Chester , Manchester , Crewe and Wrexham , south to Hereford and Cardiff , west to Aberystwyth , and east to Birmingham via Telford , Shifnal , and Wolverhampton . Heart of Wales Line trains also operate to Swansea . On 28 April 2008 , open access operator Wrexham & Shropshire commenced services to London , restoring the county 's direct rail link to the capital ; previously , Shropshire had been one of only two mainland English counties without a dedicated service to the capital , the other being Rutland . However , the service ceased on 28 January 2011 . Virgin Trains announced in September 2014 that a new London service comprising two trains in each direction daily would be introduced in December of that year . 
 The main railway station building includes a clock tower , imitation Tudor chimneys and carved heads in the frames of every window . There is a small British Transport Police station within the building . 
 Bus services in the town are operated by Arriva Midlands and serve most parts of the town , congregating at the town 's bus station adjacent to the Darwin Shopping Centre and a short stroll from the railway station . Arriva also operate county services both independent of and on behalf of Shropshire County Council . There are other bus companies operating around the Shrewsbury area , including Boulton 's of Shropshire , <unk> Motors , Bryn <unk> and <unk> Valley Coaches with the last operating services crossing from over the Welsh border from nearby towns including <unk> , Montgomery , Newtown and Welshpool . 
 Shrewsbury has a Park and Ride bus scheme in operation and three car parks on the edge of town are used by many who want to travel into the town centre . The three car parks are at Harlescott ( to the north , colour @-@ coded blue ) , Oxon ( to the west , colour @-@ coded pink ) and Meole Brace ( to the south , colour @-@ coded green ) . It is proposed that a fourth one be built to the east of the town , at either <unk> or Preston . 
 Shrewsbury has been an important centre for road traffic . In 1815 , Thomas Telford designed a new coaching route from London to Holyhead in order to improve communications with Ireland . He routed the new road via Shrewsbury , which opened in 1830 . The road is now the A5 . The road connects the town northwest to Oswestry , and east towards Telford , where it joins the M54 . The A5 once ran through the town centre , until a bypass was built in the 1930s . Subsequently , in 1992 , a 17 @-@ mile ( 27 km ) dual carriageway was completed at a cost of 79 million pounds to the south of the town , and was made to form part of the A5 route . This dual carriageway was built further out of the town to act as a substantial link to Telford , as well as a bypass for the town . 
 The A49 also goes to Shrewsbury , joining the A5 at the south of the town , coming from Ludlow and Leominster . At this point the road merges with the A5 for 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) , before separating again to the east of the town . From there it runs north , passing Sundorne , then Battlefield , before heading out towards Whitchurch . At Battlefield , the A53 route begins and heads northeast towards Shawbury and Market Drayton then onwards towards Newcastle @-@ under @-@ Lyme and Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent . 
 The <unk> ( Welshpool @-@ Bridgnorth ) runs through the town centre , entering in the west and leaving to the southeast . The <unk> begins in the town centre and heads north , heading for Ellesmere . The <unk> begins just west of the town centre in Frankwell and heads out to Bishop 's Castle , Clun and Knighton crossing the border in the southwest of Shropshire . 
 Major roads within the town include the A5112 , <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> goes north @-@ south via the town centre , while the A5112 runs north @-@ south to the east of the town centre . The <unk> is a short , one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) stretch of road to the southeast of the town centre , called " London Road " . Additionally , the <unk> , the most recent bypass , was completed in 1998 , and runs across the northern edge of the town at Battlefield ( connecting the A49 / A53 to the <unk> ) , though it did exist before as Harlescott Lane ( which has since become unclassified ) .

 = Domestic of the Schools = 
 The office of the Domestic of the Schools ( Greek : δομέστικος τῶν <unk> , domestikos tōn <unk> ) was a senior military post of the Byzantine Empire , extant from the 8th century until at least the early 14th century . Originally simply the commander of the Scholai , the senior of the elite tagmata regiments , the Domestic quickly rose in prominence : by the mid @-@ 9th century , its holders essentially occupied the position of commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Byzantine army , next to the Emperor . The office was eclipsed in the 12th century by that of the Grand Domestic , and in the Palaiologan period ( 13th – 15th centuries ) , it was reduced to a purely honorary , mid @-@ level court dignity . 
 = = History = = 
 The first holder of the office of Domestic of the Schools first appears in the sources ( the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor ) for the year 767 , shortly after the creation of the tagmata . These were elite cavalry regiments stationed in or around the capital Constantinople , commanded by officers titled " Domestics " ( <unk> , <unk> ) and distinct from the provincial armies of the themes under their respective <unk> . The Schools ( Latin : scholae ; Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) was the senior tagma , tracing their origin to the Scholae Palatinae established by Constantine the Great ( reigned ( r . ) 306 – 337 ) and originally placed under the command of the magister officiorum . The historian J.B. Bury has traced a reference to a certain <unk> , " Domestic of the magister " , in the Chronicon Paschale for the year 624 , and considers this official to be the predecessor of the Domestic of the Schools . As the magister officiorum was gradually deprived of some of his functions in the 7th and 8th centuries , the Domestic apparently became an independent official . The Kletorologion of 899 lists his subordinate officials as comprising his deputy or <unk> ( <unk> ) , the secretary or chartoularios ( <unk> ) , the head messenger or <unk> ( <unk> ) and the other messengers ( <unk> , <unk> ) , as well as the various subordinate officers of the regiment ( cf. the article on the Scholae Palatinae ) . 
 In the 9th century , the office of the Domestic , or " Domesticate " ( <unk> , <unk> ) , of the Schools rose in importance and its holder was often appointed as the head of the army in the absence of the emperor . However , this role was not yet enshrined : it depended rather on the abilities of the current Domestic , and other generals of inferior rank were sometimes entrusted with supreme command instead . The Domestic of the Schools nevertheless rose to such prominence that the sources frequently speak of the office as " the Domestic " without further qualification , and the power and influence of the post saw it frequently occupied by persons closely related to the emperor . From the time of Michael III ( r . 842 – 867 ) on , the Domestic ranked in the imperial hierarchy above all other military commanders except for the stratēgos of the Anatolic Theme . In practice , he quickly became senior even to the latter , as demonstrated by the fact that military leaders like Nikephoros Phokas and John Tzimiskes were promoted from the generalship of the Anatolics to the Domesticate . 
 In the reign of Romanos II ( r . 959 – 963 ) the post was split , with a " Domestic of the West " ( δομέστικος τῆς <unk> , domestikos tēs <unk> ) and a " Domestic of the East " ( δομέστικος τῆς <unk> , domestikos tēs <unk> ) being created for operations in Europe and Asia respectively . The ceremony for the Domestic 's appointment is described in the De Ceremoniis ( II.3 ) ; the same work describes his duties and role in court ceremonies . 
 With some exceptions , most notably the unparalleled 22 @-@ year tenure of John Kourkouas , or in times of domestic instability , Domestics were changed on the average every three to four years . During the 10th century , the Domesticate of the Schools was dominated by members of the Phokas family , which produced six holders of the office . Their attempts to monopolize the office led a series of emperors , concerned over the power of the military aristocracy , to entrust the potentially over @-@ powerful office to non @-@ military court officials , including — especially in the first half of the 11th century , before the military aristocracy reasserted its authority — to eunuchs , even though this was in theory forbidden , with the alternate office of stratopedarches having been created for this purpose . 
 In the 10th and 11th centuries , the variant " Grand Domestic " ( μέγας δομέστικος , megas domestikos ) appears sporadically , used in parallel with other variants such as " Grand Domestic of the Schools " or " Grand Domestic of the East / West " for the same person . The Byzantinist Rodolphe Guilland considers most of these early references either as anachronistic references by 12th @-@ century writers , or simply cases where " megas " is used as an honorific prefix , as was the norm with other senior offices during this period , like the Drungary of the Watch or the Domestic of the Excubitors . Nevertheless , Guilland argues that from the time of Alexios I Komnenos ( r . 1081 – 1118 ) on , the " Grand Domestic " became a separate office , senior to the " plain " Domestics of the Schools and in effect the new commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army beside the Emperor . However , the usage of the titles is not consistent , and the habitual division of command between East and West seems to have been sometimes applied to the Grand Domesticate as well during the 12th century , causing some confusion as to the nature of the office and its relation to the " plain " Domestic . In the 13th century however the two titles became clearly distinct : the Grand Domestic was the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the entire army and one of the highest offices of state , while the Domestic of the Schools was relegated to a simple dignity without duties , awarded to provincial governors and other middle @-@ ranking officials . In the words of the mid @-@ 14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo @-@ Kodinos , " the Domestic of the Schools once had an office similar to that of the Grand Domestic currently , but he now holds none " . 
 In Pseudo @-@ Kodinos ' work , the Domestic of the Schools ranks 31st in the imperial hierarchy , between the <unk> and the Grand Drungary of the Fleet . The Domestic 's distinctive court dress , as reported by Pseudo @-@ Kodinos , consisted of a gold @-@ brocaded hat ( <unk> ) , a plain silk kabbadion tunic and a silver staff ( <unk> ) with a knob on top and another in the middle . For ceremonies and festivities , he bore the domed skaranikon , of yellow silk and decorated with gold wire embroidery , and with a portrait of the emperor seated on a throne in front and another with the emperor on horseback on the rear .

 = Barely Real = 
 Barely Real is the 1992 extended play ( EP ) by the American indie rock band Codeine . After releasing their previous album Frigid Stars LP in 1990 , the group accepted an invitation from the quartet Bastro to tour in Europe in 1991 . Following the tour the group was invited to record a single for Sub Pop Singles Club and attempted to record their followup album The White Birch in 1992 . The recording sessions proved to be disastrous for the group since it found themselves often with unusable tracks over several different studios . As Codeine could not record enough material for a full @-@ length album , they decided to release what tracks they had as an EP . 
 The music on Barely Real continued their slowcore music style of their previous album . Barely Real also featured contributions from guest musicians such as Jon Fine of Bitch Magnet playing additional guitar on the song " Jr " and a piano cover of the song " Wird " performed by David Grubbs . Following the recording sessions , the groups drummer Chris Brokaw left the group being replaced by Doug Scharin . 
 Barely Real had one single ( " Realize " ) released and was initially released in Germany through Sub Pop , followed by release in the United States in 1993 . The band toured North America to promote the release which included an opening spot for Mazzy Star and their first shows in Canada . The album received praise from the Alternative Press and Melody Maker on its initial release , with the latter calling the work " 25 minutes of snowblind glory " . The EP was re @-@ issued by The Numero Group in 2012 , including various unreleased songs and new material . The re @-@ issue was acclaimed Spin and Pitchfork Media , with the latter describing the release as " masterful " .

 Following the well received release of Frigid Stars LP ( 1990 ) , Codeine accepted and invitation from David Grubbs and John McEntire to open for their group Bastro on their European tour in 1991 . To prepare for the tour , Codeine and Bastro met in a studio to record the song " Produkt " and " A l 'Ombre de Nouse " as a seven @-@ inch single for the label <unk> . Following the tour , Immerwahr returned to New York working as an engineer at Mike McMacklin 's Sound on Sound studio . John Engle worked as a delivery man for a restaurant and Chris Brokaw waited tables and wrote songs with Thalia Zedek that would later be released on Eleven : Eleven , the debut album for Come . 
 Towards the end of 1991 , Sub Pop gave the group $ 1000 to record the July 1992 entry in the labels singles club series . The group entered James <unk> 's Toxic Shock Studios on Broadway in New York with Frigid Stars LP producer Mike McMacklin to record early versions of " Realize " , " Jr " , and a cover of the MX @-@ 80 song " Promise of Love " . The tracks were not successful with only " Promise of Love " being usable . Engle noted that Codeine desired the song to be loud on both sides of the single , but could not get the song " Jr " to come together . The group had already gone through most of their budget for recording , which led to the group going to an eight @-@ track studio in the Boston suburb of Allston . Immerwahr went into the studio where the group were able to complete a version of the song " Realize " . The group met up again to work in early 1992 towards their second LP ( Long playing record ) The White Birch , with recording commencing in June at Harold Dessau Recording at 25 Murray Street in Manhattan . At the studio , the group attempted to record versions of " Realize " , " Jr " , " Tom " , " Wird " " Smoking Room " , " Barely Real " , " Something New " and " Sea " within a months time . Immerwahr was not content with the tracks , noting several issues such as : his own vocals , his desire to record music with even slower tempos , and the presence of high pitched noises in the songs that no one else could hear . On attempting to fix a broken toilet at the studio , Immerwahr accidentally flooded the clothing store below the studio . 
 Codeine decided to continue their recording sessions in July at the studio in Boston where " Barely Real " and their third recording of " Jr " were completed . The band then continued to Night Owl studio to record " Hard To Find " with a drum machine . Jon Fine of the band Bitch Magnet added guitar to " Jr " while Mike McMacklin began to EQ the tracks from Toxic Shock , Night Owl , and the Boston studio . Immerwahr also contributed to the mixing of the album without McMacklin , stating that they were not getting along after their extended periods of time spent recording . The band quickly noticed that the amount of material they had recorded would not be enough for the length of an LP which lead the group to releasing what they had as an EP . To balance out the EP 's sides , the band revisited the instrumental song " Wird " that was made as a tribute to the band Slint . Immerwahr described " Wird " as a song he regretted making , as it was an attempt to do a version of a song from Slint 's album Tweez . He sent a tape of the track to David Grubbs to do a piano version of the song that was re @-@ titled " W. " . John McEntire recorded the song in a music room at the University of Chicago where he was working on an undergraduate degree . 
 After completing the album , Brokaw left Codeine to focus on his band Come . The group shot the video for " Realize " without him . Engle took longer than he expected to replace Brokaw as after placing a classified ad , he ended up " flooded with calls " and that " Half of them hadn 't heard Codeine . I 'd say , well , we play a very particular style that you should really know about . " The group chose Doug Scharin , who had attended Codeine 's first show in Boston . 
 = = Music = = 
 Stephen Immerwhar , who wrote the lyrics to the original songs on Barely Real described composing these lyrics as " probably the hardest work . Not that we have these prodigious texts , but there 's a consistency between the lyrical subject and content and the presentation of the music " . Immerwhar described his lyrics as expressing feelings of alienation and banality . When he was asked regarding the lyrics on Barely Real and The White Birch , Immerwhar said he preferred the lyrics on latter album where he desired to " have more writerly songs " , where he found " out that there were different sources of the same feelings that seemed to inspire earlier Codeine songs . " 
 The Toronto Star described the Codeine 's music as slowcore , a style AllMusic stated was famous for having a slow pace and skeletal music with " melodies linger forever and rhythms lurch forward , all shrouded in thick , dank atmospherics . " Stewart Mason of AllMusic described the music of Barely Real as a continuation of the style made on their previous album " , while comparing a review of the compilation album When I See The Sun in Exclaim ! proposed that the group 's music " didn 't change much during their five years together ― all the songs are relentlessly slow and possess an emotional detachment verging on apathy . " When asked about the music 's pace , on Barely Real , Immerwahr said the music was in contrast to grunge music of the era , and that slowing it down made it " challenging for people and challenging for audiences . And I actually kind of like that . " In a contemporary review , Ned Raggett of AllMusic stated this style is exemplified on songs like " Realize " , which continued the hybrid of a deliberate pace with electric guitar playing with softly sung vocals . Some tracks contained a variation on Codeine 's music , such as " Promise of Love " , which Raggett characterized as having a " late @-@ night jazz club style " that only contains more traditional Codeine styled music towards the end . Other songs that <unk> the sound included the piano @-@ based track " W. " performed by David Grubbs and quick stuttering guitar riff on " Jr " . Immerwhar spoke about the tracks " W. " and " Promise of Love " , opining that " W. " created a " nice transition from the severity of ' Hard to Find ' to the jazzy ' Promise of Love ' "

 Prior to the release of the EP , a single for " Realize " was released on July 1 , 1992 . It was released on as a seven @-@ inch single on clear and <unk> vinyl limited to 2 @,@ 933 copies . Barely Real was released by Sub Pop in Germany in November 1992 . The cover of the album is taken from a postcard of Belvedere Palace Stephen Immerwahr had found on their 1991 tour of Europe . Immerwahr felt that the image reminded him of the film Last Year at Marienbad , which he described as a film that was " all stylish surface to the point where time itself seems suspended , and without the possibility of human emotional connection . " Immerwahr related the image with his own lyrical themes of what he described as " an impossible need to connect with others . " Codeine and the band Love Child did a five @-@ week European tour in late 1992 after the release of the EP . When the tour went through Vienna in 1992 , the group stopped to visit the palace . During the tour , Codeine would occasionally encore with the song " Broken Hearted Wine " , a B @-@ side on the single for " Barely Real " . 
 The album received a released in the United States through Sub Pop on July 1 , 1993 . In 1993 , Codeine opened for Mazzy Star on selected dates in the Midwest and toured through North America . This tour had Codeine perform their first shows in Canada . Stephen Immerwahr spoke about the audiences to the Toronto Star , noting that they were people " who sit and really listen to stuff ... Not people drinking themselves into oblivion . " Reviewing one of their 1993 shows , Mark Jenkins of the Washington Post stating that Codeine " pursues the intoxicating dislocation offered by slow @-@ mo cinematography " and that the drumming of Doug Scharin " rattled rib cages throughout the club " . The review concluded that despite the self @-@ imposed limitations that Codeine 's music had , the result was a " curiously effective marriage of meditation and aggression . " 
 The Numero Group re @-@ released Barely Real with nine bonus tracks on both compact disc and vinyl in 2012 . This release added unreleased songs , Peel sessions , demo tracks , and the songs " Cracked in Two " , " Broken @-@ Hearted Wine " , and a live cover of Unrest 's " <unk> " . On the reissue , Brokaw commented that " we were all happy with the [ Barely Real ] . Some of the Dessau sessions are being included in the reissues on Numero , which I 'm very glad about . The best way I can describe it is that we had high aspirations around what we wanted to achieve and it wasn 't always easy ( or even possible ) to make those happen . "

 In contemporary reviews , Peter Paphides wrote in Melody Maker that the EP was " 25 minutes of snowblind glory waiting here if you want them . Each of them is a towering monument to nothingness " . The Alternative Press opined that the EP was not " a progression from the gorgeously devastated Frigid Stars and I couldn 't be happier . Codeine have hit upon a formula so pure and righteous it would be tragic for them to deviate from it . " The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review , explaining that " There 's not a lot going on here , but songs such as " Realize " and " Hard to Find " are hardly nothing . " and that tracks such as " W. " allow Codeine to achieve " both earthly aggression and unearthly calm . " Charles Aaron of Spin , reviewed the single " Realize " , stating that the song " inches along as if Codeine 's still wondering whether it 's worth the effort " . The b @-@ side " Broken @-@ hearted Wine " was described as a song that " coolly walks a delicate line between <unk> sadness and cartoon regret . " 
 From retrospective reviews , The The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music commented that Barely Real was " on first hearing , slightly soporific and listless , but it rewards repeated listening with its depth and emotional texture . " Ned Raggett ( AllMusic ) gave the album a rating of four and a half stars out of five , explaining that " Those put off by earlier Codeine CDs won 't want to continue ; those taken by the band 's way of doing things will happily embrace it . " The Numero Group 's reissue received positive reviews from Spin and Pitchfork Media , with Pitchfork declaring that after The Frigid Stars LP , the EP " felt masterful in its compression of what we 'd come to expect from them .

 = Bali Strait Incident = 
 The Bali Strait Incident was an encounter between a powerful French Navy frigate squadron and a convoy of British East India Company East Indiamen merchant ships in the Bali Strait on 28 January 1797 . The incident took place <unk> the East Indies campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars — repeated French attempts to disrupt the highly valuable British trade routes with British India and Qing Dynasty China . In 1796 , a large squadron of French frigates arrived in the Indian Ocean under the command of Contre @-@ amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey . In July this force sailed on a commerce raiding cruise off British Ceylon , but a subsequent attack into the Straits of Malacca was driven off in an inconclusive engagement with two British ships of the line off Northeastern Sumatra . Forced to make repairs , Sercey took his squadron to the allied Batavian city of Batavia , sheltering there until January 1797 . 
 As Sercey left Batavia , the very valuable annual British trade convoy from Macau ( Portuguese treaty port in Southern China ) was due to sail . This convoy was worth millions of pounds and its capture would seriously harm the British economy . The British commander in the region , Admiral Peter Rainier split the convoy , taking four ships with a heavy escort through the Straits of Malacca , while the remaining six East Indiamen sailed unescorted through the supposedly safer Bali Strait . On 28 January , at the entrance to the Strait near the coast of Java the convoy was discovered by Sercey 's squadron . 
 The British commander , Charles Lennox , knew that if he fled his ships would be rapidly overwhelmed and instead attempted to bluff Sercey into believing that the convoy was formed not from lightly armed East Indiamen , but from the powerful ships of the line which they resembled . Lennox ordered his ships to advance on the French who retreated , convinced they were facing a superior enemy . Sercey did momentarily reconsider , when the British ships declined to attack the temporarily disabled frigate Forte , but eventually withdrew completely , retiring to his base at Île de France ( now Mauritius ) where he learned of his error . The China Fleet reached its destination with only one ship lost , wrecked in a storm the day after the encounter .

 Trade through the East Indies was a vital component of the economy of Great Britain during the late eighteenth century . This trade was administered by the East India Company , which maintained trading ports throughout the region , most notably in British India at Bombay , Madras and Calcutta . The main bulk of this was carried on large merchant ships known as East Indiamen , which weighed between 500 and 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 510 and 1 @,@ 220 t ) and traveled well @-@ armed , carrying up to 36 cannon . Due to their size and weaponry they could be mistaken for ships of the line , standard large warships of the period , a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon . Despite their appearance however they could not fight off an enemy frigate or ship of the line as their guns were of inferior design , and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship . An important component of the East India trade was an annual trade convoy from Macau , a Portuguese port in Qing Dynasty China . Early in each year , a large convoy of East Indiamen would sail from Macau , through the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic to Britain . The value of the trade carried in this convoy , nicknamed the " China Fleet " , was enormous : one convoy in 1804 was reported to be carrying goods worth over £ 8 million in contemporary values ( the equivalent of £ 600 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . 
 By 1797 , Britain and the new French Republic had been engaged in the French Revolutionary Wars for nearly four years . Although there had been much fighting in Europe , the East Indies had remained largely under British control . French forces in the region were limited , and apart from a few raiding cruises the French squadron in the region had been under intermittent blockade at Île de France . The Royal Navy , commanded in Eastern waters by Rear @-@ Admiral Peter Rainier had focused on commerce protection and the elimination of the colonies of the French @-@ allied Batavian Republic , capturing Dutch Ceylon , the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies in 1795 and 1796 . Rainier had been engaged in pacifying local uprisings around Malacca during the latter part of the campaign , and there had been few forces left in reserve to protect British interests in the Indian Ocean . 
 In response to British activity in the region and the reluctance of the inhabitants of Île de France to follow orders from the National Convention abolishing slavery , the French dispatched a squadron of frigates to the East Indies early in 1796 . This force , led by Contre @-@ amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey , originally comprised three frigates , subsequently joined by three more vessels , forming a powerful raiding squadron . After resupplying on Île de France in July , Sercey 's frigates cruised off the Ceylon coast , dissuaded from attacking the undefended ports of British India by false information fed to his scouts that a British battle squadron was at anchor in Calcutta . Turning eastwards , Sercey hoped to raid George Town at Penang , but was driven off in an inconclusive engagement with a British squadron off Sumatra on 9 September . He spent the winter sheltering in the Batavian harbour of Batavia on Java .

 Sercey 's presence in the East Indies was known to the East India Company committee at Canton , who requested assistance from Rainier . The British admiral sailed to Macau in his flagship , the 74 @-@ gun ship of the line HMS Suffolk with the sloop HMS Swift and on 30 December met with four East Indiamen and two smaller " country ships " used for regional trade . Rainier elected to sail immediately , without waiting for the remainder of the convoy to assemble , escorting the small convoy through the Straits of Malacca during January reaching first Penang and then Madras by 13 February . Malacca was thought to be the most likely point for an ambush by the French squadron , and orders were issued by the committee for the remainder of the convoy , originally commanded by Captain Lestock Wilson and then by Captain Charles Lennox , to sail through either the <unk> Strait , the Alas Strait or the Bali Strait , which were thought to be safer than Malacca . 
 Rainier did not meet Sercey , who had learned of the British plans and altered his own accordingly . Sailing from Batavia on 4 January , he cruised the Java Sea in search of the China convoy , wary that Rainier might be searching for him in turn . On 28 January , as his ships passed through the Bali Strait in bad weather , sails were sighted . Sercey immediately ordered the frigate Cybèle under Captain Pierre Julien Tréhouart to reconnoitre the approaching ships . Lennox had led his convoy directly into the path of the French squadron , whose six frigates were easily more powerful than his own six East Indiamen . The British officer was aware that he could not win a naval engagement with such a force and so instead resolved to bluff the French into thinking his merchant convoy was a squadron of ships of the line . When he saw Cybèle approaching , Lennox brought two ships forward to meet the frigate , gambling that in the low light Tréhouart might mistake the East Indiamen for warships . 
 Lennox compounded his ruse by raising Rainier 's Blue ensign on his flagship Woodford and instructing the rest of the convoy to raise ensigns of their own . The deception was so convincing that Tréhouart turned away well short of the British convoy , signalling to Sercey that " L <unk> est supérieur aux forces Français " ( " The enemy is superior in force to the French " ) . Sercey turned his squadron away , Cybèle passing close by the flagship Forte , Tréhouart hailing that the British ships comprised a battle squadron of two ships of the line and four frigates . Forte had lost its main topmast in the early stages of the retreat , and Sercey had noted that the British ships were not pursuing with the fervour expected of a superior force encountering a weaker one , but Tréhouart 's declaration convinced him he was outnumbered and he ordered his squadron to withdraw .

 Lennox turned the convoy westwards , bringing his ships safely into the Indian Ocean . One exception was the East Indiaman Ocean , which a storm drove onto a reef at Pulau <unk> in the Lesser Sunda Islands the day after the incident , wrecking her . Three men drowned during the evacuation , and the local Makassar inhabitants killed another seven on 15 February in an attack . The survivors departed on hired proas three days later , reaching Amboyna safely on 28 February . Taunton Castle was damaged in the same storm and forced to make repairs at Amboyna , where she also took on board survivors from Ocean . Taunton Castle eventually reached Yarmouth in a disabled state some months later . The British commander was given the thanks of the East India Company and awarded 500 guineas . 
 Sercey retired with his frigates to Île de France , where he learned to his horror of the opportunity he had missed in the Bali Strait . His squadron required extensive repairs , but the Colonial Committee on Île de France remained rebellious over attempts to abolish slavery and denied his ships men and food supplies . Eventually Sercey was forced to disband his squadron , sending four frigates back to France . Seven years after the Bali Strait Incident , early in the Napoleonic Wars a much larger China Fleet was attacked by another strong French naval squadron at the Battle of Pulo Aura . As in 1797 , the British commander Nathaniel Dance managed to convince the French admiral that there were warships among his convoy and the French retired after a brief exchange of gunfire .

 The 1941 Texas hurricane , the second storm of the 1941 Atlantic hurricane season , was a large and intense tropical cyclone that struck coastal Texas as a major hurricane in September 1941 , causing relatively severe damage . The storm is estimated to have formed in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 16 . After attaining hurricane strength , it completed a clockwise loop and turned northwestward . The hurricane continued to strengthen until it made landfall near East Matagorda Bay , Texas , with winds of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km / h ) , but rapidly weakened as it headed inland . Damage from the storm amounted to about $ 6 @.@ 5 million , and crops throughout the region were largely destroyed . The city of Houston suffered extensive damage as the storm passed to the east . The hurricane disrupted activities related to the Louisiana Maneuvers . Later , the system became extratropical and passed over Lake Huron , killing three people in Toronto . Overall , seven people lost their lives due to the cyclone .

Operationally , the United States Weather Bureau failed to detect a tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico until a day later . After formation , the system initially moved northwestward , a heading that continued early on September 18 . At that time , the system became a tropical storm more than 300 mi ( 483 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of New Orleans , Louisiana . 
 Over the next three days , the intensifying storm executed a gradual clockwise loop , moving to the south @-@ southeast before turning back to the west . After intensifying into a hurricane on September 21 , the storm began assuming a more northwestward course , toward the Texas Gulf Coast . It continued to strengthen into a major hurricane , peaking at 125 miles per hour ( 201 km / h ) late on September 23 . Just afterward , the storm went ashore east of Bay City , Texas , at peak intensity with an estimated central pressure of 942 millibars ( 27 @.@ 82 inHg ) . However , few weather instruments were sited close to the point of landfall , so the lowest recorded pressure on land was only 970 @.@ 5 mb ( 28 @.@ 66 inHg ) in Houston . After landfall , the cyclone curved to the northeast and passed just west of Houston early on September 24 . It accelerated as it continued to move inland and transitioned into an extratropical storm on September 25 . The post @-@ tropical system dissipated early on September 27 over northeastern Quebec , near the Torngat Mountains National Park . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 In advance of the storm , advisories and warnings were widely distributed by press , radio , telegraph and telephone . About 25 @,@ 000 residents evacuated their homes ; some small towns along the coast were described as " deserted " . People in low @-@ lying areas of coastal Louisiana sought shelter as storm surge from the hurricane affected the northern Gulf Coast . Residents in Texas prepared their homes and businesses for the hurricane , and boat owners pulled their craft out of the water . In Port Arthur , structures were boarded up and hundreds of refugees sought shelter in local hotels . American Red Cross workers were dispatched to the state . In Houston , a temporary hospital was erected . Police and firefighters in the city were put on alert . Vessels near the storm were advised to proceed with caution . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Overall damage from the storm totaled approximately $ 7 million , of which about $ 4 million can be attributed to the destruction of crops , notably rice and cotton . The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers , a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941 . The exercise was designed to test US troop training , logistics , doctrine , and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II . The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers , and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result . Hundreds of military aircraft were forced to move inland for shelter . 
 Winds along the coast of Texas reached 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) at numerous points near the hurricane 's center . A report from Galveston explained , " There was little characteristic sky appearance prior to the advent of the storm , the sky being mostly clear until lower clouds appeared suddenly between 6 and 7 a. m . C. S. T. , on the 22d with altocumulus and alto @-@ stratus overcast showing through breaks occasionally during the day . By late afternoon of the 22d the sky became completely overcast with low clouds of bad weather which predominated throughout the remainder of the storm . " Tides at the city , already slightly above @-@ normal due to a previous storm , rose to a crest of 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) on September 23 , flooding large portions of Galveston Island . A local airport was flooded with 1 to 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) of tidewater . 
 As the hurricane moved inland , the city of Houston was hit especially hard . Three people in the area died and several others were injured . Winds blew at up to 77 mph ( 124 km / h ) , catching many off @-@ guard after a previous forecast that deemed the region was safe . Some sections of the city were left without power . The winds destroyed poorly built structures and damaged others , and some streets were flooded . An athletic stadium was demolished by the storm , and glass windows were shattered in downtown stores . A preliminary estimate placed the damage in Houston at $ 500 @,@ 000 . In the aftermath of the storm , fifteen truckloads of shattered glass were removed . 
 After spreading across the United States , the remnants moved through Ontario and Quebec , producing hurricane @-@ force wind gusts and 40 ft ( 12 m ) waves along Lake Ontario . Throughout the lake , 55 vessels sunk due to the storm , resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in damage . High winds caused power outages and structural damage , as well as destroyed wheat fields across Ontario . In Toronto , the storm killed three people and injured others .

 " Breaking Out Is Hard to Do " is the ninth episode of the fourth season of Family Guy . It originally broadcast on July 17 , 2005 , guest @-@ starred Dat Phan and Brian Tochi , and was written by Tom Devanney . The episode sees Lois becoming addicted to the rush of shoplifting ; she , however , is soon arrested and sentenced to three years imprisonment . Peter successfully smuggles her out of the prison , and the Griffins begin a new life in " Asiantown " away from where they are high profile fugitives , only for Joe to track them down and attempt to arrest them . Overall , the episode was received positively by critics and media sources . 
 = = Plot = = 
 During a grocery shopping trip , Lois realizes she is short on money to pay for food . She pretends to return a ham to the meat department but decides to hide it in her purse instead . Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting , she begins stealing other items , quickly becoming addicted to theft . She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees , including stealing a Matisse painting , which arouses the suspicion of Brian . While attempting to steal from an auto parts store , Lois is caught by Brian , who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems . Lois accepts his reasoning , but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods , she is caught by Joe and arrested . 
 In court , Lois is sentenced to serve three years in prison . The Griffin household turns to chaos in Lois ' absence , and the family realizes they need to break Lois out of jail . During a visit to Lois in the prison , Peter smuggles her out by stuffing her into his mouth . As Lois ' escape is realized , the Griffins jump into a laundry van , where they escape to Quahog 's Asiantown ( which evokes the traits of Chinatown and Japantown ) and rent a run @-@ down apartment to begin new lives . 
 Chris begins a career as a rickshaw driver , Stewie takes a job at sewing shoes ( but is fired after sewing a shoe to his hand , and replaced with a baby ) . Peter becomes a sumo wrestler , but is spotted by Joe on the television shortly afterward . Joe successfully tracks the family down and pursues them through Asiantown , leading them into the city sewers . Lois decides to surrender and face the consequences so that the rest of the family won 't have to , but as Joe attempts to detain her , he slips in the sewer and is almost swept off a nearby ledge . Lois pulls Joe to safety , and in gratitude , Joe manages to get Lois ' sentence cancelled , and life returns to normal for the family .

 " Breaking Out Is Hard to Do " is the first Family Guy episode to be written by Tom Devanney . When Stewie attempts to asphyxiate himself in the supermarket , he was originally meant to state " Either I was a C @-@ section or you 're Stretch <unk> " , which would have been a reference to the Stretch Armstrong action figure , but broadcasting standards prohibited them from showing it . During the " Take On Me " sequence , Family Guy had obtained full rights to use the " Take On Me " music video completely , but animators re @-@ produced the video to make it easier for production . Originally , a joke had been drafted showing Brian standing next to a tabloid newspaper with a picture of Kirstie Alley and commenting on her weight , only for her to enter the grocery shop in Godzilla @-@ like size and throw items from the shelves , but the sketch was removed to save time during the episode . The Matisse painting shown in the Griffins ' dining room is only animated similar to an actual Matisse painting due to a legal issue with the paintings . The episode production staff spent a lot of time deciding what would be Lois ' motivation for stealing en masse . 
 An unused scene was drafted showing Chris , directly after hearing Lois ' prison term , <unk> back to him watching Six Feet Under , seeing a same @-@ sex couple kissing , and exclaiming " Oh , come on ! " The song based around Glen Quagmire was sung and recorded by professional studio singers who sing at events such as the Academy Awards . The scene following Peter saying to Lois : " I had to do , well you know , that thing that you usually do for me every Thursday night " showing Peter attempting to give himself fellatio , hitting his head on the wall and falling down the stairs was repeatedly fought by broadcasting standards , but they eventually allowed the scene . In the original episode draft , Peter was to be seen falling down the stairs , and Stewie 's foot was to be lodged inside Peter 's anus , where he was to lose his shoe . Peter breaks the fourth wall and begins to speak with viewers during his interview with the sumo wrestling employee ; Executive Producer David A. Goodman comments in the episode DVD commentary that this is " one of the few times , maybe the only time , when [ the show ] can step out of format and point out the format . " The " CBS Asiantown " logo shown on the Griffins ' television was prohibited from broadcast on the televised version of the episode .

Peter riding <unk> the <unk> is a reference to fantasy novel The Neverending Story . The chase sequence between Lois and Joe is a reference to a sequence from Raiders of the Lost Ark as Joe is pulled along by the attached garden hose and pulls himself under the moving car . Peter goes to a book club while Lois is gone , where the members are reading The Lovely Bones . The Griffins escaping out of their apartment to evade Joe is a reference to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids , with the rest of the chase through Asiantown being a reference to Revenge of the Pink Panther .

 = Fortress ( Grin ) = 
 Fortress is the code name of a cancelled action role @-@ playing video game that was in development by Grin . Director Ulf Andersson devised the concept for Fortress and preproduction began in the second half of 2008 . During development , Square Enix approached the developer and proposed making the game a spin @-@ off of Final Fantasy XII . Grin reconceived the game in the recurring Final Fantasy world of Ivalice , and included elements of Final Fantasy XII such as stylistic motifs and character designs ; additional elements included chocobos and other recurring creatures from the Final Fantasy series . It was to be released on the Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 platforms . 
 During development , Square Enix did not pay Grin over several months , and disapproved of the game 's Nordic art style . Grin worked to bring the game 's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series , but after six months of development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix , and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later . Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced . In 2011 , Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio , but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form . 
 = = Premise = = 
 According to scenario writer Ulf Andersson , the story was set several years after the events of Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings . The plot revolved a magical fortress designed to defend Ivalice from a being known as the Sea King Loemund , who rose every 10 @,@ 000 years to attempt to conquer the land . During his last attempt , he was slain and his crown was lost in the fortress . Though the myth is mostly disregarded , the story is believed by Basch fon Ronsenburg , now serving the current Archadian Emperor Larsa Solidor under the name of " Judge Gabranth " . Marching to the fortress ' location , he and his forces would have needed to fend off the forces of Loemund , who seeks vengeance against his killer 's descendant Queen <unk> B <unk> Dalmasca . A central character plot was to be a romantic connection between Bache and Ashe that would fade as Larsa and Ashe grew closer and Bache became entrenched in his fight against Loemund . Other characters involved included the sky pirate Balthier , and earlier main protagonists Vaan and Penelo . A new character , a demigod named <unk> , would join Bache after being defeated in single combat . The main aim of the story was to bring the entire cast of Final Fantasy XII back together for a final fight to save Ivalice . 
 = = Development = = 
 Fortress started out as an original fantasy game concept designed by Ulf Andersson , Grin 's co @-@ founder . Preproduction began in the second half of 2008 . Lead character artist Björn <unk> described Fortress as " a game with an epic scale both in story and production values . " The project was developed on a game engine compatible with Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . The development team , led by Andersson as a creative director , produced concept art and 3D assets under art director Anders De Geer and <unk> . The game design was led by technical artist Erik Lindqvist . The art style of the game was supposed to be realistic and similar to The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim according to <unk> Mraz , a level designer at Grin . 
 The game was pitched to various publishers , and the Japanese gaming company Square Enix took an interest in the project . Square Enix president Yoichi Wada visited Grin several times , and liked the action role @-@ playing game concept and its Nordic visual style . After getting the chance to see a boss fight from Bionic Commando , which at the time was being developed by Grin for the Japanese company Capcom , Wada said he had seen enough , and decided that Square Enix would publish Fortress as a Final Fantasy spin @-@ off . 
 Once it became a Final Fantasy title , the Grin founders stated , " We wanted to come in and revolutionize Final Fantasy , which is exactly what they need . " Fortress was to be set in the fictional world of Ivalice , specifically the version seen in Final Fantasy XII , only set some time in the future . In addition to many original characters and locations , concept art for the game included the character Ashe and a Judge from Final Fantasy XII , as well as chocobos and other recurring creatures of the Final Fantasy series . A portfolio video created by lead technical artist Anders <unk> revealed that Larsa Solidor and Basch fon Ronsenburg from Final Fantasy XII were also to be featured . The setting was to be different from a normal Final Fantasy game , with familiar characters exploring a " Nordic " version of Final Fantasy , and " primarily set in a massive fortress " according to Linda Dahlberg , a Grin associate producer . Other landscapes such as plains , forests , deserts and snowfields were also designed . 
 Invaders from the sea were to be the main enemies of the game . They were visually based on the Vikings and wielded armor and weapons decorated with sea and sea monster imagery . Planned boss battles included fighting a gargantuan version of the Final Fantasy monster <unk> , where the player would use the seaweed on its back to climb on top of it and drop bombs on the creature 's weak spots . According to a design document , the game was divided into at least seven chapters , starting at the gate of the Fortress and leading up to the top of the stronghold . Grin 's music director Erik Thunberg was responsible for the game 's score , including a track that features a rearrangement of the " Prelude " theme from the Final Fantasy series . 
 = = Cancellation = = 
 Square Enix was supposed to pay Grin US $ 16 @.@ 5 million for the production of Fortress in successive waves in accordance with the project 's milestones . No payments were made during the first two months of development , but Grin 's co @-@ founder Bo Andersson was initially not worried as he considered delayed payments common and had faith in the project . However , several more months went by without payments , costing the studio 12 million krona a month . Grin closed all of their offices except for the main one in Stockholm , but still no money came . In 2009 , Grin released Terminator Salvation , Wanted : Weapons of Fate , and Bionic Commando to negative reviews and poor sales , which caused further financial woes and seemed to make Square Enix nervous . The publisher wanted updates and asked that all of the game 's assets , including the code , the music files , and even the game 's developer language be faxed to them . This move was described as impossible and " almost a criminal behavior " by Andersson . 
 Square Enix had changed its mind , and no longer liked the Nordic style of this spin @-@ off game , so a last @-@ minute style change was attempted . The game had been such a well @-@ guarded secret , and had been through so many changes , that most employees did not know they had been working on a Final Fantasy game until very late in development . Grin attempted to change the art style to fit more with traditional Final Fantasy games , but still did not receive any positive feedback . In response , Grin sent Square Enix an image of one of the latter 's own games , Final Fantasy XII , and were told that it does not look like a game in Final Fantasy 's style . Following that exchange , Grin came to the conclusion that there was no longer any way to satisfy the publisher . 
 In early August 2009 , a call was received from Square Enix telling them that no payments were coming . Grin 's founders considered suing , but had run out of money , leading them to stop production after six months of work . Furthermore , Grin ceased production on all of their other projects and declared bankruptcy due to Sweden 's severe laws against operating businesses under a debt load . Magnus <unk> , one of the 3D artists who worked on the project , stated that he had only found out about the game 's cancellation in August , but it was like a " punch in the belly ; this was our last chance to get on track again . " The developer closed its offices on August 12 , 2009 , stating that delayed payments from " too many publishers " caused " an unbearable cashflow situation , " and referred to Fortress in a farewell note as an " unreleased masterpiece that [ they ] weren 't allowed to finish . " According to the bankruptcy papers , Square Enix felt that the development goals for Fortress " had not been met in a satisfactory way , " whereas Andersson claimed the contrary , arguing that the milestones initially set up with a producer from Square Enix had been met . Mraz stated that Grin seemed to have ignored Square Enix 's requests for changes , and the Final Fantasy franchise was too important to overlook this behavior . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After Grin 's closure , the former existence of Fortress spread as mentions and concept art of the project appeared on former employees ' resumes and portfolios . In January 2010 , footage from an alleged tech demo of Fortress was leaked onto the Internet . The video description stated the game 's events are " set some time after Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings , " and mentioned Square Enix 's subsidiary Eidos Montreal as a possible new home for the project . Replying to a fan question in May 2010 , David Hoffman , director of business development at the North American branch of Square Enix , mentioned Fortress without confirming its existence , stating , " I have and had no involvement in the rumored project Fortress . " The Fortress project , still supported by Square Enix , was for a time being developed by a different , undisclosed studio , but this ended as well . At an interview at the 2011 Electronic Entertainment Expo , Motomu Toriyama of Square Enix stated that Fortress was suspended , saying that the game " won 't be released . " In 2012 , music director Erik Thunberg posted a music track intended for the game .

 HMS Blonde was the lead ship of the her class of scout cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . She led the 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet from completion until 1912 . The ship was temporarily assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla before she joined the 4th Battle Squadron in 1913 . During the First World War , Blonde was assigned to various battleship squadrons of the Grand Fleet . The ship was converted into a minelayer in 1917 , but never actually laid any mines . She was reduced to reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap in 1920 .

 Designed to provide destroyer flotillas with a command ship capable of outclassing enemy destroyers with her 10 four @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns , Blonde proved too slow in service from the start of her career . Her 25 @-@ knot ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) speed was inadequate to match the 27 @-@ to @-@ 30 @-@ knot ( 50 to 56 km / h ; 31 to 35 mph ) speeds of the destroyers she led in her flotilla . 
 Displacing 3 @,@ 350 long tons ( 3 @,@ 400 t ) , the ship had an overall length of 406 feet ( 123 @.@ 7 m ) , a beam of 41 feet 6 inches ( 12 @.@ 6 m ) and a deep draught of 14 feet 3 inches ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) . She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines , each driving one shaft . The turbines produced a total of 18 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam produced by 12 Yarrow boilers , and gave a maximum speed of 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . She carried a maximum of 780 long tons ( 790 t ) of coal and 189 long tons ( 192 t ) of fuel oil . Her crew consisted of 314 officers and enlisted men . 
 Her main armament consisted of 10 breech @-@ loading ( BL ) four @-@ inch Mk VII guns . The forward pair of guns were mounted side by side on a platform on the forecastle , three pairs were port and starboard amidships , and the two remaining guns were on the centreline of the quarterdeck , one ahead of the other . The guns fired their 31 @-@ pound ( 14 kg ) shells to a range of about 11 @,@ 400 yards ( 10 @,@ 400 m ) . Her secondary armament was four quick @-@ firing ( QF ) three @-@ pounder ( 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) ) Vickers Mk I guns and two submerged 21 @-@ inch ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes . 
 As a scout cruiser , the ship was only lightly protected to maximize her speed . She had a curved protective deck that was one inch ( 25 mm ) thick on the slope and .5 inches ( 13 mm ) on the flat . Her conning tower was protected by four inches of armour .

 Blonde , the eighth and last ship of that name , was laid down on No. 5 Slipway at Pembroke Royal Dockyard , on 6 December 1909 and launched on 22 July 1910 by Lady Frances Williams , wife of Sir Osmond Williams , 1st Baronet . She was completed in May 1911 with Captain Thomas Bonham in command and became the leader of the 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean through 1912 . Captain Arthur Hulbert assumed command of the ship and the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the First Fleet on 10 May 1912 . He was lost at sea on 12 January 1913 and replaced by Captain Thomas Shelford . He was relieved by Captain William Blunt on 25 April and transferred to the scout cruiser , Fearless , when that ship was assigned to the flotilla . The ship had been transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron as of 18 June and Captain Albert Scott assumed command on 5 July . 
 The ship was still assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet in Scapa Flow at the start of the war in August 1914 . Captain John Casement was in command 20 March – 21 May 1916 . Blonde and the Flotilla leader Broke were on patrol east of Scapa Flow when a depth charge carried by Blonde <unk> exploded . , damaging here upper deck and killing two of her crew . The accident resulted in the type of depth charge carried by Blonde , the Egerton Depth Charge , being withdrawn from use by the Grand Fleet . The ship was under refit in April 1916 and missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . Blonde was still detached in August . By October , she had rejoined the 4th Battle Squadron , with Captain Basil Brooke in command , but had been transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron by April 1917 , Captain The Honourable Arthur Forbes @-@ Sempill having assumed command in February . On 1 June , Commander Theodore Hallett relived Forbes @-@ <unk> . In September 1917 , she was converted into a minelayer , but never laid any mines in combat . Hallett was relived by Captain Gregory Wood @-@ Martin on 30 December and he retained command until 10 January 1919 when he was relieved in turn by Captain Maurice Evans . Blonde was in reserve by February and had been assigned to the Nore Reserve by 1 May , together with her sister ship Blanche . The sisters were listed for sale by 18 March 1920 and Blonde was sold for scrap on 6 May to T. C. Pas , and was broken up in the Netherlands . 
 = Fulla = 
 In Germanic mythology , Fulla ( Old Norse , possibly " bountiful " ) or Volla ( Old High German ) is a goddess . In Norse mythology , Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg , and , in addition , Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets . Fulla is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources ; the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson ; and in skaldic poetry . Volla is attested in the " Horse Cure " Merseburg Incantation , recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German , in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg 's sister . Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess .

 In the prose introduction to the Poetic Edda poem Grímnismál , Frigg makes a wager with her husband — the god Odin — over the hospitality of their human patrons . Frigg sends her servant maid Fulla to warn the king Geirröd — Frigg 's patron — that a magician ( actually Odin in disguise ) will visit him . Fulla meets with Geirröd , gives the warning , and advises to him a means of detecting the magician :

 In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning , High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur . High lists Fulla fifth , stating that , like the goddess Gefjun , Fulla is a virgin , wears her hair flowing freely with a gold band around her head . High describes that Fulla carries Frigg 's <unk> , looks after Frigg 's footwear , and that in Fulla Frigg confides secrets . 
 In chapter 49 of Gylfaginning , High details that , after the death of the deity couple Baldr and Nanna , the god Hermóðr wagers for their return in the underworld location of Hel . Hel , ruler of the location of the same name , tells Hermóðr a way to resurrect Baldr , but will not allow Baldr and Nanna to leave until the deed is accomplished . Hel does , however , allow Baldr and Nanna to send gifts to the living ; Baldr sends Odin the ring <unk> , and Nanna sends Frigg a robe of linen , and " other gifts . " Of these " other gifts " sent , the only specific item that High mentions is a finger @-@ ring for Fulla . 
 The first chapter of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , Fulla is listed among eight ásynjur who attend an evening drinking banquet held for Ægir . In chapter 19 of Skáldskaparmál , poetic ways to refer to Frigg are given , one of which is by referring to her as " queen [ ... ] of Fulla . " In chapter 32 , poetic expressions for gold are given , one of which includes " Fulla 's snood . " In chapter 36 , a work by the skald Eyvindr skáldaspillir is cited that references Fulla 's golden headgear ( " the falling sun [ gold ] of the plain [ forehead ] of Fulla 's eyelashes shone on [ ... ] " ) . Fulla receives a final mention in the Prose Edda in chapter 75 , where Fulla appears within a list of 27 ásynjur names .

 One of the two Merseburg Incantations ( the " horse cure " ) , recorded in Old High German , mentions Volla . The incantation describes how Phol and Wodan rode to a wood , and there Balder 's foal sprained its foot . Sinthgunt sang charms , her sister Sunna sang charms , Friia sang charms , her sister Volla sang charms , and finally Wodan sang charms , followed by a verse describing the healing of the foal 's bone . The charm reads : 
 Phol and Wodan went to the forest . 
 Then Balder 's horse sprained its foot . 
 Then Sinthgunt sang charms , and Sunna her sister ; 
 Then Friia sang charms , and Volla her sister ; 
 Then Wodan sang charms , as he well could :

 = = Theories = = 
 Andy Orchard comments that the seeming appearance of Baldr with Volla in the Merseburg Incantation is " intriguing " since Fulla is one of the three goddesses ( the other two being Baldr 's mother Frigg and his wife Nanna ) the deceased Baldr expressly sends gifts to from Hel . John Lindow says that since the name Fulla seems to have something to do with fullness , it may also point to an association with fertility . 
 Rudolf Simek comments that while Snorri notes that Baldr sends Fulla a golden ring from Hel in Gylfaginning , " this does not prove that she plays any role in the Baldr myth , but merely shows that Snorri associated her with gold " because of kennings used associating Fulla with gold . Simek says that since Fulla appears in the poetry of <unk> as early as the 10th century that she was likely " not a late personification of plenty " but that she is very likely identical with Volla from the Merseburg Incantation . Simek adds that it is unclear as to who Fulla actually is ; Simek says that she may be an independent deity or simply identical with the goddess Freyja or with Frigg . 
 John Knight Bostock says that theories have been proposed that the Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg . As a result , this notion has resulted in theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of the goddesses Sinthgunt and Sunna , in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures . 
 Hilda Ellis Davidson states that the goddesses Gefjun , Gerðr , Fulla , and Skaði " may represent important goddesses of early times in the North , but little was remembered about them by the time Snorri was collecting his material .

 = Hilary of Chichester = 
 Hilary ( c . 1110 – 1169 ) was a medieval Bishop of Chichester in England . English by birth , he studied canon law and worked in Rome as a papal clerk . During his time there , he became acquainted with a number of ecclesiastics , including the future Pope Adrian IV , and the medieval writer John of Salisbury . In England , he served as a clerk for Henry of Blois , who was the Bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen of England . After Hilary 's unsuccessful nomination to become Archbishop of York , Pope Eugene III compensated him by promoting him to the bishopric of Chichester in 1147 . 
 Hilary spent many years in a struggle with Battle Abbey , attempting to assert his right as bishop to oversee the abbey . He also clashed with Thomas Becket , then chancellor to King Henry II of England , later Archbishop of Canterbury ; Hilary supported King Henry II 's position in the conflict with Becket . Henry appointed Hilary a sheriff , and employed him as a judge in the royal courts . The papacy also used Hilary as a judge @-@ delegate , to hear cases referred back to England . Known for supporting his clergy and as a canon lawyer , or someone trained in ecclesiastical law , Hilary worked to have Edward the Confessor , a former English king , canonized as a saint . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hilary was probably born around 1110 , and was likely of low birth , but nothing is known of his ancestry . His brother was a canon of Salisbury Cathedral , and they both may have come from around Salisbury . Hilary served as a clerk for Henry of Blois , Bishop of Winchester , and as Dean of the church of Christchurch in Twynham , Hampshire , probably receiving both offices through the influence of Henry of Blois . Christchurch was a collegiate church of secular clergy , or clergy who were not monks , and Hilary was dean of the church by 1139 . He was educated as a canon lawyer , and was an advocate , or lawyer , in Rome in 1144 . While in Rome , he also served in the papal chancery , or writing office , in 1146 . Some of his coworkers in the chancery were Robert Pullen , John of Salisbury , and Nicholas Breakspear who later became pope , as Adrian IV . 
 As Dean of Christchurch , Hilary restored the organization to its traditional round of religious ceremonies that had been abandoned by his predecessors , as well as securing grants of privileges and lands . He ordered the writing of a history of the church at Christchurch , a book which still survives . Hilary was unsuccessful as a candidate for the archbishopric of York against Henry Murdac in 1147 , but Pope Eugene III chose to compensate him by appointing him to the see of Chichester . His candidacy to York had been supported by Hugh de Puiset , then treasurer of York and later Bishop of Durham , and by Robert of Ghent , who was Dean of York and Lord Chancellor of England , as well as by King Stephen of England . Hilary seems to have received the largest number of votes , but because the election was disputed by Murdac 's supporters the result was referred to the papacy , and Eugene chose Murdac . Hilary was appointed to Chichester in July 1147 , and he was consecrated on 3 August 1147 . Theobald of Bec , the Archbishop of Canterbury , consecrated him at Canterbury , with Nigel , the Bishop of Ely , Robert , the Bishop of Bath , and William de Turbeville , the Bishop of Norwich , assisting in the ceremony . For a number of years , Hilary continued to hold the deanship in plurality , which is the holding of two ecclesiastical benefices at once . 
 = = Stephen 's reign = = 
 King Stephen sent Hilary to attend a church council at Reims in 1148 along with Robert de Bethune , who was the Bishop of Hereford , and William de Turbeville . Theobald of Bec was also present , even though the king had forbidden him to attend . The medieval chronicler Gervase of Canterbury stated that Stephen wanted to weaken Theobald 's standing with the papacy , but Stephen also would have wished to assert his authority over the English Church by insisting on the right to limit papal contact with the English bishops , something that his predecessors had always done . 
 Hilary attempted to excuse the king 's attempt to exclude Theobald from the council , which appears to be the main reason why Stephen allowed Hilary to attend . Hilary was rewarded for his loyalty by being named a queen 's chaplain . Soon after the council , Robert de Bethune died and Gilbert Foliot was elected to the see of Hereford , at the direction of the pope . Theobald was in exile in Flanders because he had defied the king , so the pope ordered Robert de <unk> , the Bishop of London , Josceline de Bohon , the Bishop of Salisbury , and Hilary , to go to Flanders to help Theobald consecrate Gilbert . However , the three bishops were reluctant , and told the pope that because Gilbert had not received the royal assent , nor had he sworn fealty to Stephen , they would not consecrate him . Theobald then consecrated Gilbert with the help of some continental bishops . Hilary was one of the bishops who made peace between Theobald and Stephen after the council at Reims , helping in the negotiations after Theobald 's return to England . Theobald settled himself at Hugh Bigod 's castle of Framlingham ; negotiations between the royal party and the archbishop 's party resulted in the king yielding , and in the restoration of the archbishop to his lands . 
 = = Struggle with Battle Abbey = = 
 Hilary struggled with the abbot of Battle Abbey for many years over the exemption claimed by the abbey from the oversight of the Bishop of Chichester , in whose diocese it was located . The abbey had never received a papal exemption , but relied instead on its royal foundation by King William I of England , and its status as an <unk> , or proprietary church of the king . Under King Stephen , the abbey 's claims prevailed , but after Stephen 's death Hilary excommunicated the abbot , who appealed to the papacy . The appeal backfired however , as Hilary obtained from both Pope Eugenius III and Pope Hadrian IV orders for the abbot to obey the bishop . In 1157 , the then Abbot of Battle , Walter de Lucy , brother of Richard de Luci the Chief Justiciar , took the case before King Henry II , at a council held at Colchester . 
 At the council , Walter de Lucy produced William I 's foundation charter and the confirmation by King Henry I of England , Henry II 's grandfather . Both documents were admitted as genuine , and as freeing the abbey from ecclesiastical oversight , as Henry II had at his coronation confirmed all his grandfather 's charters . Modern scholarship has shown , however , that at least one of the documents had been recently forged , shortly before 1155 . Hilary argued that only a papal privilege could exempt a monastery from episcopal oversight , and that the abbey had no such privilege . Hilary argued that no king could grant such an exemption , unless they had a licence from the papacy . Henry was unimpressed by this argument , for it impinged on his royal prerogative . Thomas Becket , then Henry 's chancellor but later to be famous for his dispute with Henry over ecclesiastical privileges , was one of Hilary 's chief opponents at this council . Eventually , the case was decided by persuading Hilary to renounce any episcopal claims on the abbey . 
 Henry II 's biographer , the historian W. L. Warren , suggests that Hilary was pressed to bring the case against Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter , and that Hilary did not pursue the case vigorously . The historian Henry Mayr @-@ Harting , sees the case against the abbey as the lone exception in Hilary 's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy , and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary 's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted . Mayr @-@ Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary 's efforts to assert Chichester 's rights . 
 The historian Nicholas Vincent argues that the entire basis of this account , which ultimately rests on the Chronicle of Battle Abbey , is part of the forgeries produced by the Battle monks . He argues that the only documentary evidence detailing course of the legal battle besides the Chronicle is a forged charter of Henry II to the abbey and a letter of Theobald 's that itself may be forged , as it repeats the story of the Chronicle almost word for word . Vincent 's point is that although there was no doubt a dispute between Hilary and the abbey over a claimed exemption , as evidenced by an 1170 letter of Becket 's referring to some sort of settlement between the monks and the bishop , the actual account in the Chronicle is untrustworthy . Unfortunately , the 1170 letter does not give any details of the dispute , merely stating that the bishop was " forced to make public peace with the abbot " . 
 = = Henry II 's reign = = 
 Hilary held the office of Sheriff of Sussex in 1155 , and then again in 1160 through 1162 . It was very unusual for a bishop to hold the post of sheriff , and was a measure of the trust that King Henry II had in Hilary . Hilary was the only bishop to hold the office of sheriff during Henry 's reign , with the possible exception of Robert de Chesney , the Bishop of Lincoln . An English church council in 1143 had forbidden clergy to hold office as stewards or tax gatherers for non @-@ clergy . As the office of sheriff involved the gathering of the county farm , or income from the county , and the payment of those revenues into the Exchequer , clergy holding office as sheriffs would have been acting against the decrees of the 1143 council . Hilary was well known as a canon lawyer , and was often employed by the papacy as a judge @-@ delegate , hearing cases that had been appealed to Rome , and then sent back to the country of origin for trial . He also assisted other papal judges , including Theobald of Bec . Hilary served in England as a royal justice in 1156 , and then was with the king in Normandy from late 1156 to April 1157 . Hilary acted as judge @-@ delegate for the papacy in at least 15 cases during his bishopric . He acted as a legal advisor to Henry II on a number of occasions , and Hilary 's clerks occasionally drew up documents for the king . 
 Hilary created the offices of treasurer and chancellor of the diocese of Chichester , in order to regulate and improve the finances of the cathedral chapter and the diocese . He also was involved in the canonization of Edward the Confessor , writing a letter to Pope Alexander III in favour of Edward 's sainthood , and was one of the three bishops who announced the canonization at Westminster Abbey and celebrated a mass in honour of the new saint . The other bishops were Robert de Chesney and Nigel , Bishop of Ely . 
 In May 1162 , Hilary was part of the deputation sent to the monks of Christ Church Priory by King Henry II to secure the election of Thomas Becket as the next Archbishop of Canterbury . When Gilbert Foliot , the Bishop of Hereford , objected to Becket 's candidacy , Hilary took the position that the king desired the election , so the bishops and electors should elect the king 's choice . When it was suggested that a monk should hold Canterbury , as had been the custom previously , Hilary asked if the questioners thought that only one way of life was satisfactory to God . 
 The next year , a council held at Westminster became one of the early stages in the king 's growing quarrel with Becket over criminal clerks . The quarrel was sparked by the problem of clergy who committed crimes ; Becket supported the Church 's position that all clergy , even those in minor orders , could be tried only in ecclesiastical courts . As perhaps as many as a fifth of the population of England may have been in some form of clerical orders , including the minor ones , allowing this would have diminished the king 's authority . In the past , English law had tried clerks who committed serious offences in the royal courts , but recent changes in canon law were changing this practice . At Westminster , Henry tried to get the leading laymen and bishops to swear to uphold the old customs of England , instead of the newer canon law practices . All the bishops swore , with the reservation that the customs were not in conflict with canon law . Hilary , however , added no qualifiers to his oath . Although the oath supported Becket 's position , after the council most of the bishops , including Hilary , were persuaded by the king to support some compromise position , and threw their support behind Henry . 
 After the Council of Westminster , Hilary supported the king throughout the Becket dispute , and one factor in his royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey , and thus refused to support the archbishop . Towards the end of 1163 , Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket , to persuade the archbishop to modify his position , but Becket was unmoved . Hilary also took part in the king 's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France , which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket , and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Hilary died in July 1169 , probably on 13 July . The historian David Knowles described Hilary as " an extremely quick @-@ witted , efficient , self @-@ confident , voluble , somewhat shallow man , fully acquainted with the new canon law but not prepared to abide by principles to the end . His talents were great but he used them as an opportunist . " In Hilary 's favour , he was heavily involved in providing livings for the vicars who resided at the parish churches and performed the actual cure of souls , or pastoral duties , in his diocese . He was also a benefactor of libraries , and worked hard to recover lands once belonging to his church but lost in the years of Stephen 's reign . He also promoted clerical reform in his diocese , working to change many of the churches that had chapters of secular clergy into churches with chapters of Augustinian canons . Hilary secured the consent of his cathedral chapter for any grants of lands , even those that he had acquired personally . Thirty @-@ five documents survive from his bishopric , but few of them can be attributed to a specific date . One is his profession of obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury , and the others are a mix of charters , judgements made by Hilary , and confirmations of rights and privileges . 
 Hilary 's clerks were trained in administration , and one of them , his nephew Jocelin , was named chancellor of Chichester Cathedral by his uncle . Jocelin later became Archdeacon of Lewes , and a royal judge . A number of Hilary 's clerks served with Thomas Becket for a time , most of them after leaving Hilary 's service .

 = Dolphin drive hunting = 
 Dolphin drive hunting , also called dolphin drive fishing , is a method of hunting dolphins and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach . Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets . Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world , including the Solomon Islands , the Faroe Islands , Peru , and Japan , the most well @-@ known practitioner of this method . By numbers , dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat ; some end up in dolphinariums . 
 Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism , and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes , thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year . 
 = = By country = = 
 = = = Faroe Islands = = = 
 On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales are killed by drive hunts for their meat and blubber . Other species are also killed on rare occasion such as the Northern bottlenose whale and Atlantic White @-@ sided Dolphin . The Northern bottlenose whale is mainly killed when it accidentally swims too close to the beach and cannot return to the water . When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach , they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers . 
 The stranding of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly happens in two villages in the northern part of Suðuroy : Hvalba and Sandvík . It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale , because there are <unk> on these places , where the distance between the east and west coasts are short , around one kilometer or so . And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound , and too late it discovers , that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again . It happened on 30 August 2012 , when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge <unk> in Sandvík . Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales , and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba ( Hvalba municipality ) . 
 The hunt of the pilot whale is known by the locals as the <unk> . There are no fixed hunting seasons . As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted , the locals set out to begin the hunt , after approval from the <unk> . The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government , and then they try to make the whales to beach themselves . The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats , which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all the whales . 
 When on the beach , most of them get stuck . Those that have remained too far in the water are dragged onto the beach by putting a hook in their blowhole . When on land , they are killed by cutting down to the major arteries and spinal cord at the neck . The time it takes for a whale to die varies from a few seconds Up to half a minute , depending on the cut . If the locals fail to beach the animals altogether , they are let free again . 
 The pilot whale stock in the eastern and central North Atlantic is estimated to number 778 @,@ 000 . About a thousand pilot whales are killed this way each year on the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species , but numbers vary greatly per year . The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not believed to be a threat to the sustainability of the population , but the brutal appearance of the hunt has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations . 
 Due to pollution , consumption of the meat and blubber is considered unhealthy by some . Especially children and pregnant women are at risk , with prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children . 
 In November 2008 , the New Scientist reported in an article that research done in the Faroe Islands lead to the recommendation by Faroese government that the consumption of Pilot Whale meat in the Faroes should stop as it had been proved to be too toxic . However , the Faroese government did not forbid people to eat Pilot Whale meat due to the contamination , but the advice from the Joensen and <unk> had an effect , it has resulted in reduced consumption , according to a senior Faroese health official . 
 In June 2011 the Faroese Food and Veterinary Authorities sent out an official recommendation regarding the consumption of meat and blubber from the pilot whale . They recommend that because of the pollution of the whale : 
 Adults should only eat one dinner with pilot whale meat and blubber per month . 
 Special advice for women and girls : 
 Girls and women should not eat blubber at all until they have finished given birth to children . 
 Women who plan to get pregnant within 3 months , pregnant women and women who breastfeed should probably not eat whale meat at all . 
 The kidneys and liver of the pilot whales should not be eaten . 
 = = = Iceland = = = 
 In mid @-@ 1950s , fishermen in Iceland requested assistance from the government to remove Killer Whales from Icelandic waters as they damaged fishing equipment . With fisheries accounting for 20 % of Iceland 's employment at the time , the perceived economic impact was significant . The Icelandic government asked the United States for assistance . As a NATO ally with an air base in Iceland , the US Navy deployed Patrol Squadrons VP @-@ 18 and VP @-@ 7 to achieve this task . According to the US Navy , hundreds of animals were killed with machineguns , rockets and depth charges . 
 In the late 1970s , after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the ban on hunting Killer Whales in Washington in 1976 as discussed later in this article , the hunting of Killer Whales in Iceland resumed , this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry . The first two Killer Whales captured went to <unk> Harderwijk in the Netherlands . One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld . These captures continued until 1989 , with the additional animals going to SeaWorld , Marineland Antibes , Marineland Canada , Kamogawa Sea World , Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny @-@ Land . 
 Although commercial whaling does still take place in Icelandic waters today , dolphins are no longer hunted and whale watching is popular amongst tourists . 
 = = = Japan = = = 
 In Japan , Striped , Spotted , Risso 's , and Bottlenose dolphins are most commonly hunted , but several other species such as the False Killer Whale are also occasionally caught . A small number of Orcas have been caught in the past as well . Relatively few Striped Dolphins are found in the coastal waters , probably due to hunting ( 65 Striped Dolphin were caught and killed on January 28 , 2014 . Despite their rarity , the entire pod was killed using a painful and inhumane method that causes severe distress . ) 
 Catches in 2007 amounted to 384 Striped Dolphins , 300 Bottlenose Dolphins , 312 Risso 's Dolphins and 243 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales , for a total of 1 @,@ 239 animals . These numbers do not include dolphins or other small whale species killed using various other methods , such as offshore harpoon hunts , in which mainly porpoises are killed . Another 77 Bottlenose Dolphins , 8 Risso Dolphins , 5 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales were captured for use in the entertainment industry in Japan , China , Korea , and Taiwan . The quota set by the government for the species that were targeted in drive hunts that year allowed for the capture of 685 Striped Dolphins , 1 @,@ 018 Bottlenose Dolphins , 541 Risso 's Dolphins , and 369 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales . The quota applies to all hunting methods . 
 Taiji , Wakayama Prefecture is the only town in Japan where drive hunting still takes place on a large scale . Captive dolphin are now sold to aquariums and swim programs all over the world . The animals that are captured often die within days due to shock and injury . Many die during transport . The rest will live out their considerably shortened lives in captivity . A hunt took place in the <unk> area of Itō , Shizuoka in 2004 . In 2007 , Taiji wanted to step up its dolphin hunting programs , approving an estimated ¥ 330 million for the construction of a massive cetacean slaughterhouse in an effort to popularize the consumption of dolphins in the country . 
 An increase in criticism and the considerable toxicity of the meat appears to be achieving the opposite . During the first hunt of the season in Taiji in 2009 , an estimated 50 Pilot Whales and 100 Bottlenose Dolphins were captured . Although all the Pilot Whales were killed , and 30 Bottlenose Dolphins were taken for use in dolphinariums , the 70 remaining animals were set free again instead of being killed for consumption . 
 A number of dolphin welfare advocacy groups such as Earth Island Institute , Surfers for Cetaceans and Dolphin Project Inc . , dispute these official Japanese claims . These groups assert that the number of dolphins and porpoises killed is much higher , estimated at 25 @,@ 000 per year . 
 In 2014 an Australian non @-@ profit organisation called Australia for Dolphins ( featured in the documentary The Killing Cove ) launched a world @-@ first lawsuit against the brokers of the drive hunts , the Taiji Whale Museum . The lawsuit , known as the Action for Angel case , alleges that the museum illegally refused entry to dolphin welfare observers , and aims to open the museum up to public scrutiny . The lawsuit , which is ongoing , is expected to reach an outcome in 2015 . 
 In 2014 , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe asked for understanding of Japanese dolphin hunting in a small town ( Taiji ) in western Japan responding to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy . He said " The dolphin hunting is an ancient practice rooted in their culture and supports their livelihood . In every country and region , there are practices and ways of living and culture that have been handed down from ancestors . Naturally , I feel that they should be respected . " . 
 = = = = Method = = = = 
 In Japan , the hunting is done by a select group of fishermen . When a pod of dolphins has been spotted , they 're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the dolphins . When the dolphins are in the bay , it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape . The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately , but instead left to calm down over night . The following day , the dolphins are caught one by one and killed . 
 The killing of the animals used to be done by slitting their throats , but the Japanese government banned this method and now dolphins may officially only be killed by driving a metal pin into the neck of the dolphin , which causes them to die within seconds according to a memo from <unk> Uchida , the executive secretary of the Japan Cetacean Conference on Zoological Gardens and Aquariums . A veterinary team 's analysis of 2011 video footage of a Japanese hunters killing striped dolphins using this method suggested that in one case death took over four minutes . 
 = = = = Entertainment industry = = = = 
 As briefly mentioned above , occasionally , some of the captured dolphins are left alive and taken to mainly , but not exclusively , Japanese dolphinariums . Prior to the practice being banned in 1993 , dolphins were exported to the United States to several parks . 
 The US National Marine Fisheries Service has refused a permit for Marine World Africa USA on one occasion to import four False Killer Whales caught in a Japanese drive hunt . In recent years , dolphins from the Japanese drive hunts have been exported to China , Taiwan and to Egypt . On multiple occasions , members of the International Marine Animal Trainers Association ( <unk> ) have also been observed at the drive hunts in Japan . 
 = = = = Human health risks = = = = 
 The meat and blubber of the dolphins caught has been found to have high levels of mercury , cadmium , the pesticide DDT , and organic contaminants like PCBs . The levels are high enough to pose a health risk for those frequently eating the meat and researchers warn that children and pregnant women shouldn 't eat the meat at all . Because of the health concerns , the price of dolphin meat has decreased significantly . 
 In 2010 , hair samples from 1 @,@ 137 Taiji residents were tested for mercury by the National Institute for Minamata Disease . The average amount of methyl mercury found in the hair samples was 11 @.@ 0 parts per million for men and 6 @.@ 63 ppm for women , compared with an average of 2 @.@ 47 ppm for men and 1 @.@ 64 ppm for women in tests conducted in 14 other locations in Japan . One hundred eighty @-@ two Taiji residents showing extremely high mercury levels underwent further medical testing to check for symptoms of mercury poisoning . None of the Taiji residents displayed any of the traditional symptoms of mercury poisoning , according to the Institute . 
 Japan 's National Institute of Population and Social Security Research , however , reports that the mortality rate for Taiji and nearby <unk> , where dolphin meat is also consumed , is over 50 % higher than the rate for similarly @-@ sized villages throughout Japan . The chief of the <unk> , Koji Okamoto , said , " We presume that the high mercury concentrations are due to the intake of dolphin and whale meat . There were not any particular cases of damaged health , but seeing as how there were some especially high concentration levels found , we would like to continue conducting surveys here . " 
 Due to its low food self @-@ sufficiency rate , around 40 % , Japan relies on stockpiling to secure a stable food supply . As of 2009 , Japan 's 1 @.@ 2 million ton seafood stockpile included nearly 5000 tons of whale meat . Japan has started to serve whale meat in school lunches as part of a government initiative to reduce the amounts . However , there has been criticism of serving whale meat to school children due to allegations of toxic methyl mercury levels . 
 Consequently , Taiji 's bid to expand their school lunch programs to include dolphin and whale meat brought about much controversy . An estimated 150 kg ( 330 lbs ) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006 . In 2009 , dolphin meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination . The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets most likely to be providing the schools ' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry . The mercury levels were so high that the <unk> Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves . 
 = = = = Protests = = = = 
 Protests and campaigns are now common in Taiji . In 2003 , two activists were arrested for cutting fishing nets to release captured dolphins . They were detained for 23 days . In 2007 , American actress Hayden Panettiere was involved in a confrontation with Japanese fishermen as she tried to disrupt the hunt . She paddled out on a surfboard , with five other surfers from Australia and the United States , in an attempt to reach a pod of dolphins that had been captured . The following confrontation lasted more than 10 minutes before the surfers were forced to return to the beach . The surfers drove straight to Osaka airport and left the country to avoid being arrested for trespassing by the Japanese police . 
 Taiji 's fishery cooperative union argues that these protesters " continue willfully to distort the facts about this fishery " and that protester 's agendas are " based neither on international law nor on science but rather on emotion for economic self @-@ interest . " Some of the animal welfare organizations campaigning against the drive hunts are Ric O <unk> 's Dolphin Project , Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , One Voice , Blue Voice , the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society , and World Animal Protection . 
 Since much of the criticism is the result of photos and videos taken during the hunt and slaughter , it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside a tent or under a plastic cover , out of sight from the public . The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in <unk> in October 1999 ( a still of which can be seen on the right ) , shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy . Part of this footage was , amongst others , shown on CNN . 
 In recent years , the video has also become widespread on the internet and was featured in the animal welfare documentary Earthlings , though the method of killing dolphins as shown in this video is now officially banned . In 2009 , a critical documentary on the hunts in Japan titled The Cove was released and shown amongst others at the Sundance Film Festival . Well known are also the images from Iki Island taken in 1979 of a Japanese fisherman stabbing dolphins to death with spears in shallow water .

 Though it is forbidden under Peruvian law to hunt dolphins or eat their meat ( sold as <unk> <unk> , or sea pork in English ) , a large number of dolphins are still killed illegally by fishermen each year . To catch the dolphins , they are driven together with boats and encircled with nets , then harpooned , dragged on to the boat , and clubbed to death if still alive . Various species are hunted , such as the Bottlenose and Dusky Dolphin . 
 According to estimates from local animal welfare organisation Mundo Azul released in October 2013 , between 1 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 000 dolphins are killed annually for consumption , with a further 5 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 being killed for use as shark bait .

 On a smaller scale , drive hunting for dolphins also takes place in the Solomon Islands , more specifically on South Malaita Island . After capture , the meat is shared equally between households . Dolphin 's teeth are also used in jewelry and as currency on the island . The dolphins are hunted in a similar fashion as in Japan , using stones instead of metal rods to produce sounds to scare and confuse the dolphins . Various species are hunted , such as Spotted and Spinner dolphins . 
 The amount of dolphins killed each year is not known , but anecdotal information suggests between 600 and 1500 dolphins per hunting season . The hunting season lasts roughly from December to April , when the dolphins are closest to shore . As in Japan , some dolphins ( exclusively <unk> ) from the Solomon Islands have also been sold to the entertainment industry . 
 There was much controversy in July 2003 , when 28 Indo @-@ Pacific bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops <unk> aduncus ) were exported to Parque <unk> , a water park in Cancun . A large portion of the animals were later transported to Cozumel , to do interaction programs . Though the export of dolphins had been banned in 2005 , the export of dolphins was resumed in October 2007 when the ban was lifted following a court decision , allowing for 28 dolphins to be sent to a dolphinarium in Dubai . A further three dolphins were found dead near the holding pens . 
 The dealer that exported these dolphins has stated that they intend to release their 17 remaining dolphins back into the wild in the future . In 2015 the tourism minister visited Bita <unk> community and announced the government would financially support the development of eco @-@ tourism dolphin swimming if they stopped killing dolphins . 
 In April 2009 it was decided by CITES that an in @-@ depth review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place , this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group came to the conclusion that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year . The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo @-@ Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts . A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future . 
 The Solomon Islands signed the Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) for the Conservation of Cetaceans and their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region under the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species in 2007 , which is a commitment to improve conservation efforts , reduce threats and undertake research and monitoring of cetaceans and provide reports . Gordon Lilo , the prime minister of the Solomon Islands , announced in 2014 that he opposes export of live dolphins , but defends the traditional hunting of dolphin . The capture and trade of wild dolphins is prohibited in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands . 
 In recent years only villages in South Malaita Island have continued to hunt dolphin . In 2010 , the villages of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> signed a MoU with the non @-@ governmental organization , Earth Island Institute , to stop hunting dolphin . However , in early 2013 the agreement broke down and some men in <unk> resumed hunting . The hunting of dolphin continued in early 2014 . 
 Tourism minister Bartholomew <unk> visited the Bita <unk> community in 2015 and offered to fund eco @-@ tourism business project involving swimming with dolphins , if they ceased killing .

 On the Penghu Islands in Taiwan , drive fishing of Bottlenose Dolphins was practiced until 1990 , when the practice was outlawed by the government . Mainly Indian Ocean Bottlenose Dolphins but also common Bottlenose Dolphins were captured in these hunts .

 In ancient Hawaii , fishermen occasionally hunted dolphins for their meat by driving them onto the beach and killing them . In their ancient legal system , dolphin meat was considered to be kapu ( forbidden ) for women together with several other kinds of food .

 Hunting dolphins ( at the time still often incorrectly referred to as fish or porpoises ) , primarily using harpoons and firearms , was considered a form of recreational hunting along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century . Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s , with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made , the excursion would be free of charge . The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War .

 Drive hunting methods were used to capture Orcas in the Puget Sound in the 1960s and 1970s . These hunts were led by aquarium owner and entrepreneur Edward " Ted " Griffin and his partner Don Goldsberry . After Edward purchased an Orca that was caught by accident by fishermen in Namu , British Columbia , in 1965 , Edward and Don used drive hunting techniques in the Puget Sound area to capture Orcas for the entertainment industry . Others followed and despite the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 the practice continued until 1976 when the state of Washington ordered the release of a number of Orcas that were being held in Budd Inlet and subsequently banned the practice . 
 = Enid Blyton = 
 Enid Mary Blyton ( 11 August 1897 – 28 November 1968 ) was an English children 's writer whose books have been among the world 's best @-@ sellers since the 1930s , selling more than 600 million copies . Blyton 's books are still enormously popular , and have been translated into almost 90 languages ; her first book , Child Whispers , a 24 @-@ page collection of poems , was published in 1922 . She wrote on a wide range of topics including education , natural history , fantasy , mystery , and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy , Famous Five , Secret Seven , and Adventure series . 
 Following the commercial success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing Chair ( 1937 ) and The Enchanted Wood ( 1939 ) , Blyton went on to build a literary empire , sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions . Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind ; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her . The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers , a charge she vigorously denied . 
 Blyton 's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics , teachers and parents from the 1950s onwards , because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books , particularly the Noddy series . Some libraries and schools banned her works , which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit . Her books have been criticised as being elitist , sexist , racist , xenophobic and at odds with the more liberal environment emerging in post @-@ war Britain , but they have continued to be best @-@ sellers since her death in 1968 . 
 Blyton felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework , so she encouraged them to support worthy causes . In particular , through the clubs she set up or supported , she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and paediatric charities . The story of Blyton 's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid , featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four in 2009 . There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage , screen and television . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Enid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 in East Dulwich , London , the eldest of three children , to Thomas Carey Blyton ( 1870 – 1920 ) , a cutlery salesman , and his wife Theresa Mary ( née Harrison ; 1874 – 1950 ) . Enid 's younger brothers , Hanly ( 1899 – 1983 ) and Carey ( 1902 – 1976 ) , were born after the family had moved to a semi @-@ detached villa in Beckenham , then a village in Kent . A few months after her birth Enid almost died from whooping cough , but was nursed back to health by her father , whom she adored . Thomas Blyton ignited Enid 's interest in nature ; in her autobiography she wrote that he " loved flowers and birds and wild animals , and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met " . He also passed on his interest in gardening , art , music , literature and the theatre , and the pair often went on nature walks , much to the disapproval of Enid 's mother , who showed little interest in her daughter 's pursuits . Enid was devastated when he left the family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman . Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship , and she failed to attend either of her parents ' funerals . 
 From 1907 to 1915 Blyton attended St Christopher 's School in Beckenham , where she enjoyed physical activities and became school tennis champion and captain of lacrosse . She was not so keen on all the academic subjects but excelled in writing , and in 1911 she entered Arthur Mee 's children 's poetry competition . Mee offered to print her verses , encouraging her to produce more . Blyton 's mother considered her efforts at writing to be a " waste of time and money " , but she was encouraged to persevere by Mabel Attenborough , the aunt of a school friend . 
 Blyton 's father taught her to play the piano , which she mastered well enough for him to believe that she might follow in his sister 's footsteps and become a professional musician . Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music , but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer . After finishing school in 1915 as head girl , she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough , before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at <unk> Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk . <unk> Hall , with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing . At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt , who taught at Ipswich High School , and suggested that she train as a teacher . Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school , and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916 . By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family . 
 Blyton 's manuscripts had been rejected by publishers on many occasions , which only made her more determined to succeed : " it is partly the struggle that helps you so much , that gives you determination , character , self @-@ reliance – all things that help in any profession or trade , and most certainly in writing " . In March 1916 her first poems were published in Nash 's Magazine . She completed her teacher training course in December 1918 , and the following month obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School , a small independent establishment for boys in Bickley , Kent . Two months later Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education , 1st class in botany , geography , practice and history of education , child hygiene and class teaching and 2nd class in literature and elementary mathematics . In 1920 she moved to <unk> in Hook Road Surbiton as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude , with whom Blyton spent four happy years . Owing to a shortage of schools in the area her charges were soon joined by the children of neighbours , and a small school developed at the house . 
 = = Early writing career = = 
 In 1920 Blyton relocated to Chessington , and began writing in her spare time . The following year she won the Saturday Westminster Review writing competition with her essay " On the Popular Fallacy that to the Pure All Things are Pure " . Publications such as The Londoner , Home Weekly and The <unk> began to show an interest in her short stories and poems . 
 Blyton 's first book , Child Whispers , a 24 @-@ page collection of poems , was published in 1922 . It was illustrated by a schoolfriend , Phyllis Chase , who collaborated on several of her early works . Also in that year Blyton began writing in annuals for Cassell and George Newnes , and her first piece of writing was accepted for publication in Teachers ' World , " <unk> and his Pot of Glue " . Her success was boosted in 1923 when her poems were published alongside those of Rudyard Kipling , Walter de la Mare and G. K. Chesterton in a special issue of Teachers ' World . Blyton 's educational texts were quite influential in the 1920s and ' 30s , her most sizeable being the three @-@ volume The Teacher 's Treasury ( 1926 ) , the six @-@ volume Modern Teaching ( 1928 ) , the ten @-@ volume Pictorial Knowledge ( 1930 ) , and the four @-@ volume Modern Teaching in the Infant School ( 1932 ) . 
 In July 1923 Blyton published Real Fairies , a collection of thirty @-@ three poems written especially for the book with the exception of " Pretending " , which had appeared earlier in Punch magazine . The following year she published The Enid Blyton Book of Fairies , illustrated by Horace J. Knowles , and in 1926 the Book of Brownies . Several books of plays appeared in 1927 , including A Book of Little Plays and The Play 's the Thing with the illustrator Alfred <unk> . 
 In the 1930s Blyton developed an interest in writing stories related to various myths , including those of ancient Greece and Rome ; The Knights of the Round Table , Tales of Ancient Greece and Tales of Robin Hood were published in 1930 . In Tales of Ancient Greece Blyton retold sixteen well @-@ known ancient Greek myths , but used the Latin rather than the Greek names of deities and invented conversations between the characters . The Adventures of Odysseus , Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians and Tales of the Romans followed in 1934 .

 The first of twenty @-@ eight books in Blyton 's Old Thatch series , The Talking Teapot and Other Tales , was published in 1934 , the same year as the first book in her Brer Rabbit series , Brer Rabbit <unk> ; her first serial story and first full @-@ length book , Adventures of the Wishing @-@ Chair , followed in 1937 . The Enchanted Wood , the first book in the Faraway Tree series , published in 1939 , is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child . According to Blyton 's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from " thinking up a story one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree . In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon @-@ Face , Silky , the <unk> Man and the rest of the characters . She had all she needed . " As in the Wishing @-@ Chair series , these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies , goblins , elves , pixies and other mythological creatures . 
 Blyton 's first full @-@ length adventure novel , The Secret Island , was published in 1938 , featuring the characters of Jack , Mike , Peggy and Nora . Described by The Glasgow Herald as a " Robinson Crusoe @-@ style adventure on an island in an English lake " , The Secret Island was a lifelong favourite of Gillian 's and spawned the Secret series . The following year Blyton released her first book in the Circus series and her initial book in the Amelia Jane series , Naughty Amelia Jane ! According to Gillian the main character was based on a large handmade doll given to her by her mother on her third birthday . 
 During the 1940s Blyton became a prolific author , her success enhanced by her " marketing , publicity and branding that was far ahead of its time " . In 1940 Blyton published two books – Three Boys and a Circus and Children of <unk> – under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock ( middle name plus first married name ) , in addition to the eleven published under her own name that year . So popular were Pollock 's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that " Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels " . But Blyton 's readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher , with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock – two in 1940 and four in 1943 – were reissued under Blyton 's name . Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her boarding school story books and the first novel in the Naughtiest Girl series , The Naughtiest Girl in the School , which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional <unk> School . The first of her six novels in the St. Clare 's series , The Twins at St. Clare 's , appeared the following year , featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O 'Sullivan . 
 In 1942 Blyton released the first book in the Mary Mouse series , Mary Mouse and the Dolls ' House , about a mouse exiled from her <unk> who becomes a maid at a dolls ' house . Twenty @-@ three books in the series were produced between 1942 and 1964 ; 10 @,@ 000 copies were sold in 1942 alone . The same year , Blyton published the first novel in the Famous Five series , Five on a Treasure Island , with illustrations by Eileen Soper . Its popularity resulted in twenty @-@ one books between then and 1963 , and the characters of Julian , Dick , Anne , George ( Georgina ) and Timmy the dog became household names in Britain . Matthew Grenby , author of Children 's Literature , states that the five were involved with " unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes " , although the novels were " hardly ' hard @-@ boiled ' thrillers " . Blyton based the character of Georgina , a tomboy she described as " short @-@ haired , freckled , sturdy , and snub @-@ nosed " and " bold and daring , hot @-@ tempered and loyal " , on herself . 
 Blyton had an interest in biblical narratives , and retold Old and New Testament stories . The Land of Far @-@ Beyond ( 1942 ) is a Christian parable along the lines of John Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress ( 1698 ) , with contemporary children as the main characters . In 1943 she published The Children 's Life of Christ , a collection of fifty @-@ nine short stories related to the life of Jesus , with her own slant on popular biblical stories , from the Nativity and the Three Wise Men through to the trial , the crucifixion and the resurrection . Tales from the Bible was published the following year , followed by The Boy with the <unk> and Fishes in 1948 . 
 The first book of Blyton 's Five Find @-@ <unk> series , The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage , was published in 1943 , as was the second book in the Faraway series , The Magic Faraway Tree , which in 2003 was voted 66th in the BBC 's Big Read poll to find the UK 's favourite book . Several of Blyton 's works during this period have seaside themes ; John Jolly by the Sea ( 1943 ) , a picture book intended for younger readers , was published in a booklet format by Evans Brothers . Other books with a maritime theme include The Secret of Cliff Castle and Smuggler Ben , both attributed to Mary Pollock in 1943 ; The Island of Adventure , the first in the Adventure series of eight novels from 1944 onwards ; and various novels of the Famous Five series such as Five on a Treasure Island ( 1942 ) , Five on <unk> Island Again ( 1947 ) and Five Go Down to the Sea ( 1953 ) . 
 Capitalising on her success , with a loyal and ever @-@ growing readership , Blyton produced a new edition of many of her series such as the Famous Five , the Five Find @-@ <unk> and St. Clare 's every year in addition to many other novels , short stories and books . In 1946 Blyton launched the first in the Malory Towers series of six books based around the schoolgirl Darrell Rivers , First Term at Malory Towers , which became extremely popular , particularly with girls . 
 = = = Peak output : 1949 – 1959 = = = 
 The first book in Blyton 's Barney Mysteries series , The <unk> Mystery , was published in 1949 , as was the first of her fifteen Secret Seven novels . The Secret Seven Society consists of Peter , his sister Janet , and their friends Colin , George , Jack , Pam and Barbara , who meet regularly in a shed in the garden to discuss peculiar events in their local community . Blyton rewrote the stories so they could be adapted into cartoons , which appeared in Mickey Mouse Weekly in 1951 with illustrations by George Brook . The French author <unk> <unk> continued the series in the 1970s , producing an additional twelve books , nine of which were translated into English by Anthea Bell between 1983 and 1987 . 
 Blyton 's Noddy , about a little wooden boy from Toyland , first appeared in the Sunday Graphic on 5 June 1949 , and in November that year Noddy Goes to Toyland , the first of at least two dozen books in the series , was published . The idea was conceived by one of Blyton 's publishers , Sampson , Low , Marston and Company , who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator <unk> van der Beek . Despite having to communicate via an interpreter , he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented . Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher , to be forwarded to van der Beek . The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best @-@ known series , and were hugely popular in the 1950s . An extensive range of sub @-@ series , spin @-@ offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade , including Noddy 's Library , Noddy 's Garage of Books , Noddy 's Castle of Books , Noddy 's Toy Station of Books and Noddy 's Shop of Books . 
 In 1950 Blyton established the company Darrell Waters Ltd to manage her affairs . By the early 1950s she had reached the peak of her output , often publishing more than fifty books a year , and she remained extremely prolific throughout much of the decade . By 1955 Blyton had written her fourteenth Famous Five novel , Five Have Plenty of Fun , her fifteenth Mary Mouse book , Mary Mouse in Nursery Rhyme Land , her eighth book in the Adventure series , The River of Adventure , and her seventh Secret Seven novel , Secret Seven Win Through . She completed the sixth and final book of the Malory Towers series , Last Term at Malory Towers , in 1951 . 
 Blyton published several further books featuring the character of Scamp the terrier , following on from The Adventures of Scamp , a novel she had released in 1943 under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock . Scamp Goes on Holiday ( 1952 ) and Scamp and Bimbo , Scamp at School , Scamp and Caroline and Scamp Goes to the Zoo ( 1954 ) were illustrated by Pierre Probst . She introduced the character of Bom , a stylish toy drummer dressed in a bright red coat and helmet , alongside Noddy in TV Comic in July 1956 . A book series began the same year with Bom the Little Toy Drummer , featuring illustrations by R. Paul @-@ <unk> , and followed with Bom and His Magic Drumstick ( 1957 ) , Bom Goes Adventuring and Bom Goes to Ho Ho Village ( 1958 ) , Bom and the Clown and Bom and the Rainbow ( 1959 ) and Bom Goes to Magic Town ( 1960 ) . In 1958 she produced two annuals featuring the character , the first of which included twenty short stories , poems and picture strips . 
 = = = Final works = = = 
 Many of Blyton 's series , including Noddy and The Famous Five , continued to be successful in the 1960s ; by 1962 , 26 million copies of Noddy had been sold . Blyton concluded several of her long @-@ running series in 1963 , publishing the last books of The Famous Five ( Five Are Together Again ) and The Secret Seven ( Fun for the Secret Seven ) ; she also produced three more Brer Rabbit books with the illustrator Grace Lodge : Brer Rabbit Again , Brer Rabbit Book , and Brer Rabbit 's a Rascal . In 1962 many of her books were among the first to be published by Armada Books in paperback , making them more affordable to children . 
 After 1963 Blyton 's output was generally confined to short stories and books intended for very young readers , such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965 , and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966 . Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend . Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series , Noddy and the Aeroplane , in February 1964 . In May the following year she published Mixed Bag , a song book with music written by her nephew Carey , and in August she released her last full @-@ length books , The Man Who Stopped to Help and The Boy Who Came Back . 
 = = Magazine and newspaper contributions = = 
 Blyton cemented her reputation as a children 's writer when in 1926 she took over the editing of Sunny Stories , a magazine that typically included the re @-@ telling of legends , myths , stories and other articles for children . That same year she was given her own column in Teachers ' World , entitled " From my Window " . Three years later she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine , in which she published letters from her fox terrier dog Bobs . They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as Letters from Bobs , and sold ten thousand copies in the first week . Her most popular feature was " Round the Year with Enid Blyton " , which consisted of forty @-@ eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather , pond life , how to plant a school garden and how to make a bird table . Among Blyton 's other nature projects was her monthly " Country Letter " feature that appeared in The Nature Lover magazine in 1935 . 
 Sunny Stories was renamed Enid Blyton 's Sunny Stories in January 1937 , and served as a vehicle for the serialisation of Blyton 's books . Her first Naughty Amelia Jane story , about an anti @-@ heroine based on a doll owned by her daughter Gillian , was published in the magazine . Blyton stopped contributing in 1952 , and it closed down the following year , shortly before the appearance of the new fortnightly Enid Blyton Magazine written entirely by Blyton . The first edition appeared on 18 March 1953 , and the magazine ran until September 1959 . 
 Noddy made his first appearance in the Sunday Graphic in 1949 , the same year as Blyton 's first daily Noddy strip for the London Evening Standard . It was illustrated by van der Beek until his death in 1953 . 
 = = Writing style and technique = = 
 Blyton worked in a wide range of fictional genres , from fairy tales to animal , nature , detective , mystery , and circus stories , but she often " blurred the boundaries " in her books , and encompassed a range of genres even in her short stories . In a 1958 article published in The Author , she wrote that there were a " dozen or more different types of stories for children " , and she had tried them all , but her favourites were those with a family at their centre . 
 In a letter to the psychologist Peter McKellar , Blyton describes her writing technique : 
 I shut my eyes for a few minutes , with my portable typewriter on my knee – I make my mind a blank and wait – and then , as clearly as I would see real children , my characters stand before me in my mind 's eye ... The first sentence comes straight into my mind , I don 't have to think of it – I don 't have to think of anything . 
 In another letter to McKellar she describes how in just five days she wrote the 60 @,@ 000 @-@ word book The River of Adventure , the eighth in her Adventure Series , by listening to what she referred to as her " under @-@ mind " , which she contrasted with her " upper conscious mind " . Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book , which coupled with the lack of variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously , and clearly did , plagiarise the books she had read , including her own . Gillian has recalled that her mother " never knew where her stories came from " , but that she used to talk about them " coming from her ' mind 's eye ' " , as did William Wordsworth and Charles Dickens . Blyton had " thought it was made up of every experience she 'd ever had , everything she 's seen or heard or read , much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory " but never knew the direction her stories would take . Blyton further explained in her biography that " If I tried to think out or invent the whole book , I could not do it . For one thing , it would bore me and for another , it would lack the ' verve ' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination . " 
 Blyton 's daily routine varied little over the years . She usually began writing soon after breakfast , with her portable typewriter on her knee and her favourite red Moroccan shawl nearby ; she believed that the colour red acted as a " mental stimulus " for her . Stopping only for a short lunch break she continued writing until five o 'clock , by which time she would usually have produced 6 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 words . 
 A 2000 article in The Malay Mail considers Blyton 's children to have " lived in a world shaped by the realities of post @-@ war austerity " , enjoying freedom without the political correctness of today , which serves modern readers of Blyton 's novels with a form of escapism . Brandon <unk> of The Independent refers to the Blyton universe as " crammed with colour and character " , " self @-@ contained and internally consistent " , noting that Blyton exemplifies a strong mistrust of adults and figures of authority in her works , creating a world in which children govern . Gillian noted that in her mother 's adventure , detective and school stories for older children , " the hook is the strong storyline with plenty of cliffhangers , a trick she acquired from her years of writing serialised stories for children 's magazines . There is always a strong moral framework in which bravery and loyalty are ( eventually ) rewarded " . Blyton herself wrote that " my love of children is the whole foundation of all my work " . 
 Victor Watson , Assistant Director of Research at <unk> College , Cambridge , believes that Blyton 's works reveal an " essential longing and potential associated with childhood " , and notes how the opening pages of The Mountain of Adventure present a " deeply appealing ideal of childhood " . He argues that Blyton 's work differs from that of many other authors in its approach , describing the narrative of The Famous Five series for instance as " like a powerful spotlight , it seeks to illuminate , to explain , to demystify . It takes its readers on a roller @-@ coaster story in which the darkness is always banished ; everything puzzling , arbitrary , evocative is either dismissed or explained " . Watson further notes how Blyton often used minimalist visual descriptions and introduced a few careless phrases such as " gleamed enchantingly " to appeal to her young readers . 
 From the mid @-@ 1950s rumours began to circulate that Blyton had not written all the books attributed to her , a charge she found particularly distressing . She published an appeal in her magazine asking children to let her know if they heard such stories , and after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents ' meeting at her daughter 's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation , Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings . The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year , but the rumours that Blyton operated " a ' company ' of ghost writers " persisted , as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work . 
 = = Charitable work = = 
 Blyton felt a responsibility to provide her readers with a positive moral framework , and she encouraged them to support worthy causes . Her view , expressed in a 1957 article , was that children should help animals and other children rather than adults : 
 [ children ] are not interested in helping adults ; indeed , they think that adults themselves should tackle adult needs . But they are intensely interested in animals and other children and feel compassion for the blind boys and girls , and for the <unk> who are unable to walk or talk . 
 Blyton and the members of the children 's clubs she promoted via her magazines raised a great deal of money for various charities ; according to Blyton , membership of her clubs meant " working for others , for no reward " . The largest of the clubs she was involved with was the Busy Bees , the junior section of the People 's Dispensary for Sick Animals , which Blyton had actively supported since 1933 . The club had been set up by Maria Dickin in 1934 , and after Blyton publicised its existence in the Enid Blyton Magazine it attracted 100 @,@ 000 members in three years . Such was Blyton 's popularity among children that after she became Queen Bee in 1952 more than 20 @,@ 000 additional members were recruited in her first year in office . The Enid Blyton Magazine Club was formed in 1953 . Its primary object was to raise funds to help those children with cerebral palsy who attended a centre in Cheyne Walk , in Chelsea , London , by furnishing an on @-@ site hostel among other things . 
 The Famous Five series gathered such a following that readers asked Blyton if they might form a fan club . She agreed , on condition that it serve a useful purpose , and suggested that it could raise funds for the Shaftesbury Society Babies ' Home in Beaconsfield , on whose committee she had served since 1948 . The club was established in 1952 , and provided funds for equipping a Famous Five Ward at the home , a paddling pool , sun room , summer house , playground , birthday and Christmas celebrations , and visits to the pantomime . By the late 1950s Blyton 's clubs had a membership of 500 @,@ 000 , and raised £ 35 @,@ 000 in the six years of the Enid Blyton Magazine 's run . 
 By 1974 the Famous Five Club had a membership of 220 @,@ 000 , and was growing at the rate of 6 @,@ 000 new members a year . The Beaconsfield home it was set up to support closed in 1967 , but the club continued to raise funds for other paediatric charities , including an Enid Blyton bed at Great Ormond Street Hospital and a mini @-@ bus for disabled children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital . 
 = = Jigsaw puzzles and games = = 
 Blyton capitalised upon her commercial success as an author by negotiating agreements with jigsaw puzzle and games manufacturers from the late 1940s onwards ; by the early 1960s some 146 different companies were involved in merchandising Noddy alone . In 1948 Bestime released four jigsaw puzzles featuring her characters , and the first Enid Blyton board game appeared , Journey Through Fairyland , created by <unk> . The first card game , Faraway Tree , appeared from Pepys in 1950 . In 1954 Bestime released the first four jigsaw puzzles of the Secret Seven , and the following year a Secret Seven card game appeared . 
 Bestime released the Little Noddy Car Game in 1953 and the Little Noddy Leap Frog Game in 1955 , and in 1956 American manufacturer Parker Brothers released Little Noddy 's Taxi Game , a board game which features Noddy driving about town , picking up various characters . Bestime released its <unk> Noddy <unk> series in 1957 and a Noddy jigsaw series featuring cards appeared from 1963 , with illustrations by Robert Lee . Arrow Games became the chief producer of Noddy <unk> in the late 1970s and early 1980s . Whitman manufactured four new Secret Seven jigsaw puzzles in 1975 , and produced four new Malory Towers ones two years later . In 1979 the company released a Famous Five adventure board game , Famous Five <unk> Island Treasure . Stephen Thraves wrote eight Famous Five adventure game books , published by Hodder & Stoughton in the 1980s . The first adventure game book of the series , The Wreckers ' Tower Game , was published in October 1984 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 On 28 August 1924 Blyton married Major Hugh Alexander Pollock , DSO ( 1888 – 1971 ) at Bromley Register Office , without inviting her family . Pollock was editor of the book department in the publishing firm of George Newnes , which became her regular publisher . It was he who requested that Blyton write a book about animals , The Zoo Book , which was completed in the month before they married . They initially lived in a flat in Chelsea before moving to Elfin Cottage in Beckenham in 1926 , and then to Old Thatch in Bourne End ( called <unk> in her books ) in 1929 . 
 Blyton 's first daughter Gillian , was born on 15 July 1931 , and after a miscarriage in 1934 , she gave birth to a second daughter , Imogen , on 27 October 1935 . In 1938 Blyton and her family moved to a house in Beaconsfield , which was named Green Hedges by Blyton 's readers following a competition in her magazine . By the mid @-@ 1930s , Pollock – possibly due to the trauma he had suffered during the First World War being revived through his meetings as a publisher with Winston Churchill – withdrew increasingly from public life and became a secret alcoholic . With the outbreak of the Second World War , he became involved in the Home Guard . Pollock entered into a relationship with a budding young writer , Ida Crowe , and arranged for her to join him at his posting to a Home Guard training centre at Denbies , a Gothic mansion in Surrey belonging to Lord Ashcombe , and work there as his secretary . Blyton 's marriage to Pollock became troubled , and according to Crowe 's memoir , Blyton began a series of affairs , including a lesbian relationship with one of the children 's nannies . In 1941 Blyton met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters , a London surgeon with whom she began an affair . Pollock discovered the liaison , and threatened to initiate divorce proceedings against Blyton . Fearing that exposure of her adultery would ruin her public image , it was ultimately agreed that Blyton would instead file for divorce against Pollock . According to Crowe 's memoir , Blyton promised that if he admitted to infidelity she would allow him parental access to their daughters ; but after the divorce he was forbidden to contact them , and Blyton ensured he was subsequently unable to find work in publishing . Pollock , having married Crowe on 26 October 1943 , eventually resumed his heavy drinking and was forced to petition for bankruptcy in 1950 . 
 Blyton and Darrell Waters married at the City of Westminster Register Office on 20 October 1943 . She changed the surname of her daughters to Darrell Waters and publicly embraced her new role as a happily married and devoted doctor 's wife . After discovering she was pregnant in the spring of 1945 , Blyton miscarried five months later , following a fall from a ladder . The baby would have been Darrell Waters 's first child and it would also have been the son for which both of them longed . 
 Blyton 's health began to deteriorate in 1957 , when during a round of golf she started to complain of feeling faint and breathless , and by 1960 she was displaying signs of dementia . Her agent George Greenfield recalled that it was " unthinkable " for the " most famous and successful of children 's authors with her enormous energy and computer @-@ like memory " to be losing her mind and suffering from what is now known as Alzheimer 's disease in her mid @-@ sixties . Blyton 's situation was worsened by her husband 's declining health throughout the 1960s ; he suffered from severe arthritis in his neck and hips , deafness , and became increasingly ill @-@ tempered and erratic until his death on 15 September 1967 . 
 The story of Blyton 's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid , which aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Four on 16 November 2009 . Helena Bonham Carter , who played the title role , described Blyton as " a complete workaholic , an achievement junkie and an extremely canny businesswoman " who " knew how to brand herself , right down to the famous signature " . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 During the months following her husband 's death Blyton became increasingly ill , and moved into a nursing home three months before her death . She died at the Greenways Nursing Home , London , on 28 November 1968 , aged 71 . A memorial service was held at St James 's Church , Piccadilly , and she was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium , where her ashes remain . Blyton 's home , Green Hedges , was auctioned on 26 May 1971 and demolished in 1973 ; the site is now occupied by houses and a street named Blyton Close . An English Heritage blue plaque commemorates Blyton at Hook Road in Chessington , where she lived from 1920 to 1924 . In 2014 a plaque recording her time as a Beaconsfield resident from 1938 until her death in 1968 was unveiled in the town hall gardens , next to small iron figures of Noddy and Big Ears . 
 Since her death and the publication of her daughter Imogen 's 1989 autobiography , A Childhood at Green Hedges , Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature , unstable and often malicious figure . Imogen considered her mother to be " arrogant , insecure , pretentious , very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind , and without a trace of maternal instinct . As a child , I viewed her as a rather strict authority . As an adult I pitied her . " Blyton 's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however , as " a fair and loving mother , and a fascinating companion " . 
 The Enid Blyton Trust for Children was established in 1982 with Imogen as its first chairman , and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child . Enid Blyton 's Adventure Magazine began publication in September 1985 , and on 14 October 1992 the BBC began publishing Noddy Magazine and released the Noddy CD @-@ Rom in October 1996 . 
 The first Enid Blyton Day was held at Rickmansworth on 6 March 1993 , and in October 1996 the Enid Blyton award , The Enid , was given to those who have made outstanding contributions towards children . The Enid Blyton Society was formed in early 1995 , to provide " a focal point for collectors and enthusiasts of Enid Blyton " through its thrice @-@ annual Enid Blyton Society Journal , its annual Enid Blyton Day , and its website . On 16 December 1996 Channel 4 broadcast a documentary about Blyton , Secret Lives . To celebrate her centenary in 1997 exhibitions were put on at the London Toy & Model Museum ( now closed ) , Hereford and Worcester County Museum and Bromley Library , and on 9 September the Royal Mail issued centenary stamps . 
 The London @-@ based entertainment and retail company Trocadero plc purchased Blyton 's Darrell Waters Ltd in 1995 for £ 14 @.@ 6 million and established a subsidiary , Enid Blyton Ltd , to handle all intellectual properties , character brands and media in Blyton 's works . The group changed its name to Chorion in 1998 , but after financial difficulties in 2012 sold its assets . Hachette UK acquired from Chorion world rights in the Blyton estate in March 2013 , including The Famous Five series but excluding the rights to Noddy , which had been sold to DreamWorks Classics ( formerly Classic Media , now a subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation ) in 2012 . 
 Blyton 's granddaughter , Sophie Smallwood , wrote a new Noddy book to celebrate the character 's 60th birthday , 46 years after the last book was published ; Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle ( 2009 ) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall . In February 2011 , the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel , Mr <unk> 's Caravan , was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories , National Centre for Children 's Books in a collection of papers belonging to Blyton 's daughter Gillian , purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death . It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949 , but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s , which had been rejected by a publisher . 
 In a 1982 survey of 10 @,@ 000 eleven @-@ year @-@ old children Blyton was voted their most popular writer . She is the world 's fourth most translated author , behind Agatha Christie , Jules Verne and William Shakespeare . From 2000 to 2010 , Blyton was listed as a Top Ten author , selling almost 8 million copies ( worth £ 31 @.@ 2 million ) in the UK alone . In 2003 The Magic Faraway Tree was voted 66 in the BBC 's Big Read . In the 2008 Costa Book Awards , Blyton was voted Britain 's best @-@ loved author . Her books continue to be very popular among children in Commonwealth nations such as India , Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Singapore , Malta , New Zealand , and Australia , and around the world . They have also seen a surge of popularity in China , where they are " big with every generation " . In March 2004 Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise , which included bringing the character to an animated series on television , with a potential audience of a further 95 million children under the age of five . Chorion spent around £ 10 million digitising Noddy , and as of 2002 had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide . 
 Novelists influenced by Blyton include the crime writer Denise Danks , whose fictional detective Georgina Powers is based on George from the Famous Five . Peter Hunt 's A Step off the Path ( 1985 ) is also influenced by the Famous Five , and the St. Clare 's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for Jacqueline Wilson 's Double Act ( 1996 ) and Adèle <unk> 's Egerton Hall trilogy ( 1990 – 92 ) respectively . 
 = = = Ghost writing = = = 
 After Blyton 's death author Pamela Cox was asked to continue two of the author 's series , St. Clare 's and Malory Towers . To date Cox has published three St. Clare 's novels , Third Form at St. Clare 's , Sixth Form at St. Clare 's , and Kitty at St Clare 's , and six in the Malory Towers series , New Term At Malory Towers , Summer Term At Malory Towers , Winter term At Malory Towers , Fun And Games At Malory Towers , Secrets At Malory Towers , and Goodbye Malory Towers . 
 = = Critical backlash = = 
 Blyton 's range of plots and settings has been described as limited and continually recycled . Responding to claims that her moral views were " dependably predictable " , Blyton commented that " most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for – you have found them in my books , and a writer 's books are always a faithful reflection of himself " . Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians , deemed unfit for children to read , and removed from syllabuses and public libraries . 
 From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC operated a de facto ban on dramatising Blyton 's books for radio , considering her to be a " second @-@ <unk> " whose work was without literary merit . The children 's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton 's books to " slow poison " , and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC 's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton 's ability to churn out " mediocre material " , noting that " her capacity to do so amounts to genius ... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago " . Michael Rosen , Children 's Laureate from 2007 until 2009 , wrote that " I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books . " The children 's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton 's work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008 , in which she noted the " drip , drip , drip of disapproval " associated with the books . Blyton 's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12 , claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from " stupid people who don 't know what they 're talking about because they 've never read any of my books " . 
 Although Blyton 's works have been banned from more public libraries than those of any other author , there is no evidence that the popularity of her books ever suffered , and by 1990 she was still described as being very widely read . Although some criticised her in the 1950s for the volume of work she produced , Blyton astutely capitalised on being considered a more " savoury " English alternative to what was seen by contemporaries as an invasion by American culture in the form of Disney and comics . 
 = = = Simplicity = = = 
 Some librarians felt that Blyton 's restricted use of language , a conscious product of her teaching background , was prejudicial to an appreciation of more literary qualities . In a scathing article published in Encounter in 1958 , the journalist Colin Welch remarked that it was " hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the 11 @-@ plus or even with the Cambridge English Tripos " , but reserved his harshest criticism for Blyton 's Noddy , describing him as an " unnaturally priggish ... sanctimonious ... witless , spiritless , snivelling , sneaking doll . " 
 The author Nicholas Tucker notes that it was common to see Blyton cited as people 's favourite or least favourite author according to their age , and argues that her books create an " encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age , leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification " . Fred Inglis considers Blyton 's books to be technically easy to read , but to also be " emotionally and cognitively easy " . He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality . Woods surmised that Blyton " was a child , she thought as a child , and wrote as a child ... the basic feeling is essentially pre @-@ adolescent ... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas ... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child @-@ hater . If true , such a fact should come as no surprise to us , for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her . " Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work , with a powerful belief in " representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership " . Blyton 's daughter Imogen has stated that she " loved a relationship with children through her books " , but real children were an intrusion , and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing . 
 = = = Racism , xenophobia and sexism = = = 
 Accusations of racism in Blyton 's books were first made by Lena <unk> in a Guardian article published in 1966 , in which she was critical of Blyton 's The Little Black Doll , published a few months earlier . Sambo , the black doll of the title , is hated by his owner and the other toys owing to his " ugly black face " , and runs away . A shower of rain washes his face clean , after which he is welcomed back home with his now pink face . Jamaica Kincaid also considers the Noddy books to be " deeply racist " because of the blonde children and the black golliwogs . In Blyton 's 1944 novel The Island of Adventure , a black servant named Jo @-@ Jo is very intelligent , but is particularly cruel to the children . 
 Accusations of xenophobia were also made . As George Greenfield observed , " Enid was very much part of that between @-@ the @-@ wars middle class which believed that foreigners were untrustworthy or funny or sometimes both " . The publisher Macmillan conducted an internal assessment of Blyton 's The Mystery That Never Was , submitted to them at the height of her fame in 1960 . The review was carried out by the author and books editor Phyllis Hartnoll , in whose view " There is a faint but unattractive touch of old @-@ fashioned xenophobia in the author 's attitude to the thieves ; they are ' foreign ' ... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality . " Macmillan rejected the manuscript , but it was published by William Collins in 1961 , and then again in 1965 and 1983 . 
 Blyton 's depictions of boys and girls are considered by many critics to be sexist . In a Guardian article published in 2005 Lucy Mangan proposed that The Famous Five series depicts a power struggle between Julian , Dick and George ( Georgina ) , in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to , as when Dick lectures George : " it 's really time you gave up thinking you 're as good as a boy " . 
 = = = Revisions to later editions = = = 
 To address criticisms levelled at Blyton 's work some later editions have been altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards issues such as race , gender and the treatment of children ; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs , for instance . The golliwogs who steal Noddy 's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in Here Comes Noddy Again are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision , who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return at the end of the story to apologise . 
 The Faraway Tree 's Dame Slap , who made regular use of corporal punishment , was changed to Dame Snap who no longer did so , and the names of Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie . Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare 's series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking , but are instead scolded . References to George 's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to Five on a Hike Together , reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal . 
 In 2010 Hodder , the publisher of the Famous Five series , announced its intention to update the language used in the books , of which it sold more than half a million copies a year . The changes , which Hodder described as " subtle " , mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative . For instance , " school tunic " becomes " uniform " , " mother and father " becomes " mum and dad " , " bathing " is replaced by " swimming " , and " jersey " by " jumper " . Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers , whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising . 
 = = Stage , film and TV adaptations = = 
 In 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage , producing the Noddy in Toyland pantomime in just two or three weeks . The production was staged at the 2660 @-@ seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway , London at Christmas . Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season for five or six years . Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience , and attended the theatre three or four times a week . TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers . In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced , and in January 1997 the King 's Head Theatre embarked on a six @-@ month tour of the UK with The Famous Five Musical , to commemorate Blyton 's centenary . On 21 November 1998 The Secret Seven Save the World was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff . 
 There have also been several film and television adaptations of the Famous Five : by the Children 's Film Foundation in 1957 and 1964 , Southern Television in 1978 – 79 , and Zenith Productions in 1995 – 97 . The series was also adapted for the German film <unk> Freunde , directed by Mike <unk> and released in 2011 . 
 The Comic Strip , a group of British comedians , produced two extreme parodies of the Famous Five for Channel 4 television : Five Go Mad in Dorset , broadcast in 1982 , and Five Go Mad on <unk> , broadcast the following year . A third in the series , Five Go to Rehab , was broadcast on Sky in 2012 . 
 In October 2014 it was announced that a deal had been signed with publishers Hachette for " The Faraway Tree " series to be adapted into a live action film by director Sam Mendes ’ production company . Marlene Johnson , head of children ’ s books at Hachette , said : " Enid Blyton was a passionate advocate of children ’ s storytelling , and The Magic Faraway Tree is a fantastic example of her creative imagination . " 
 = = Papers = = 
 Seven Stories , the National Centre for Children 's Books in Newcastle upon Tyne , holds the largest public collection of Blyton 's papers and typescripts . The Seven Stories collection contains a significant number of Blyton 's typescripts , including the previously unpublished novel , Mr <unk> 's Caravan , as well as personal papers and diaries . The purchase of the material in 2010 was made possible by special funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund , the MLA / V & A Purchase Grant Fund , and two private donations . 
 = Hurricane Bridget ( 1971 ) = 
 Hurricane Bridget of June 1971 was one of the worst hurricanes to strike the Mexican city of Acapulco . It formed on June 14 as a tropical depression , which is a minimal tropical cyclone with winds less than gale force . However , it was soon upgraded to a tropical storm , and Bridget steadily intensified to become a hurricane on June 15 . After peaking at Category 2 intensity , it weakened to a tropical storm on June 17 , then made landfall in Mexico . Hours later , however , it turned offshore as a tropical depression . Bridget dissipated on June 20 after leaving heavy damage and 17 deaths in the Acapulco area . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on June 3 . Around four days later the system entered the Caribbean Sea , passing over the San Andres islands on June 12 . The area of convection , or thunderstorms , spread across Central America . A surface circulation developed offshore El Salvador , and the system formed into a tropical depression on June 14 . For much of the summer of 1971 , a large pool of anomalously warm water temperatures extended from Central America to the Gulf of California off the Mexican coast , reaching 89 @.@ 6 ° F ( 32 ° C ) . This allowed for steady intensification as it tracked through the Gulf of Tehuantepec . 
 Early on June 15 , a ship reported winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) and 13 ft ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) seas , which prompted the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center ( EPHC ) to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Bridget . The storm maintained a general northwest track toward the southwest Mexican coastline . It gradually intensified , and satellite images late on June 16 indicated that Bridget attained hurricane status about 55 mi ( 95 km ) southwest of Puerto Ángel , Oaxaca . It quickly intensified as it neared the coast , reaching winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) just southwest of Acapulco coastline before weakening . Bridget paralleled the Mexican coastline just offshore before making landfall at 1200 UTC on June 17 , about 100 mi ( 160 km ) southeast of Manzanillo , Colima . The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain , emerging into the Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression after being over land for only a few hours . Bridget turned westward as a weak tropical cyclone , eventually dissipating on June 20 to the south of the Baja California peninsula . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 While passing to the southwest of Acapulco , Bridget produced heavy rainfall and strong wind gusts reaching 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) . The winds damaged or destroyed many roofs across Acapulco , signs , and windows . Strong winds also downed trees and power lines , which left most of Acapulco without electricity . Along the coast , the hurricane produced high tides and waves which flooded low @-@ lying coastal areas with around 1 @.@ 5 ft ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) of water . The high tides damaged coastal properties and destroyed 21 boats , including the flagship of the Admiral of the Mexican Navy . Debris @-@ clogged drains caused drainage facilities to exceed their capacities following the heavy rainfall . Overall , the storm killed 17 people in the region , and caused five additional injuries . 
 Damage in the area around Acapulco was estimated at around 500 million pesos ( $ 40 million USD ) . This made it the worst hurricane to hit the city in at least 25 years . Where Bridget made its final landfall , no damage reports were available due to the sparse population of the area . 
 = Yadier Molina = 
 Yadier Benjamin Molina ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born July 13 , 1982 ) , also known as " Yadi " , is a Puerto Rican professional baseball catcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . A two @-@ time World Series champion , he is considered an essential figure in the Cardinals ' postseason success , with nine appearances in his twelve seasons . Other awards realized include seven consecutive selections to the All Star Game , eight consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Awards , and one Silver Slugger Award . He has accrued more than 1 @,@ 500 hits , 100 home runs , 600 runs batted in , and a .283 batting average . He became the all @-@ time Cardinals ' leader in games caught with his <unk> on April 8 , 2016 . 
 Coming from a baseball family , Molina grew up in Vega Alta , Puerto Rico . His father was an amateur second baseman in Puerto Rico , and his two older brothers , Bengie and José , were also major league catchers . Molina 's pitch @-@ handling and throwing skills originally caught the attention of scouts before being drafted . The Cardinals ' fourth round selection in the 2000 MLB draft , he made his MLB debut four years later , quickly garnering a reputation for possessing one of the strongest and most accurate arms in the game . As of 2014 , he had thrown out 44 % of runners attempting a stolen base over his career and led active MLB catchers with 55 pickoffs . Molina also formulates fielder positioning plans and complete pitching strategies to opposing hitters , earning a reputation as an on @-@ field leader . 
 Initially considered a light hitter , Molina significantly improved his offense and raised his career batting average from .248 in 2007 . As of 2014 , he had a .290 career batting average in the postseason . In 2006 , he became just the third catcher to play in two World Series before age 25 , following Johnny Bench and Yogi Berra . He also played for Puerto Rico in all three tournaments of the World Baseball Classic . Molina is under contract through 2017 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Molina was born in Bayamón , Puerto Rico , to Gladys Matta and Benjamín Molina , Sr. and attended Maestro <unk> Martínez High School in Vega Alta . Molina 's father played second base as an amateur and worked as a tools technician ten hours per day in a Westinghouse factory . He was a .320 lifetime hitter and the all @-@ time hits leader in the Doble @-@ A <unk> league , gaining election to the Puerto Rican baseball hall of fame in 2002 . Molina 's two older brothers , Bengie and José , eventually also became major league catchers . Each day when he completed work , Molina directly went home , ate dinner and crossed the street from his family 's home with his sons to Jesús <unk> <unk> Park , where he spent countless evening hours teaching them the fundamentals of the sport . He remained hopeful that his sons would become professional baseball players . 
 Molina 's catching aptitude showed as early as age five , and he developed quickly . Nonetheless , he played all over the baseball field , and as Bengie Molina recalled , always seemed to " be the first player taken in the youth league draft . " Molina concentrated on infield positions until about age 16 , when he began developing into the familiar Molina physique ; as of 2013 , he stood 5 ' 11 " and weighed 220 pounds . 
 Molina 's father also sought to accelerate him on the diamond . Following a suspension from his youth league about age 15 , Benjamín Molina anticipated the <unk> would stagnate his development , so he searched for an alternative . Against the wishes of coaches , family members and friends , he scheduled Yadier for a workout with the Hatillo Tigres , an amateur league team . Molina made the team after a single workout and immediately became the starting catcher . The Tigres ' first baseman , Luis Rosario , was the one that recommended him to the organization . The Tigres played in a league composed mainly of players ten or more years older than Molina , well before he was eligible for the Major League Baseball draft . 
 = = Scouting and minor leagues = = 
 Minnesota Twins scout Edwin Rodríguez scrutinized Molina starting in high school . He observed that Molina 's skills closely resembled that of both his older brothers – both accomplished major league catchers – and decided that his defense was " polished " enough to be considered more advanced than most high schoolers in the United States . However , Molina 's hitting lagged behind his defense . The initial report on his skill set was " defensive catcher , great arm , weak bat " ; his closest comparable hitter as catcher was one who the Cardinals eventually placed at the top of their organizational ladder , and his future manager , Mike Matheny . Before he was drafted , Molina worked out for the Cincinnati Reds . He put on a spectacle at Riverfront Stadium with his arm and bat that grabbed the attention of executives , scouts , and prominent former Reds who attended his workout , including Johnny Bench and Bob Boone . As Molina recalled , he left the session with the impression the Reds intended to draft him . 
 Undeterred by the universal reservations about his offensive ceiling , the St. Louis Cardinals instead took Molina in the fourth round of the 2000 MLB draft and signed him for $ 325 @,@ 000 . In the spring training following his draft , the young catcher was described as " raw " and purposed with fascination to emulate Matheny . Matheny , in turn , told his wife one day that he " saw the kid that 's going to steal [ his ] job . " 
 In that extended spring training , longtime Cardinals instructor Dave Ricketts observed Molina from a golf cart during a game as he was still learning how to catch ; he had been transitioning from third base . After allowing a passed ball through his legs with a runner on third base , Molina raced to the backstop to retrieve the ball . Still hoping to prevent the runner from scoring , he instead found Ricketts in the golf cart parked on top of home plate . Ricketts had a reputation for getting upset when Cardinals minor league catchers allowed balls to bounce between their legs ; for this , he removed Molina from the game and drove him to the batting cage . There , Ricketts batted 150 to 200 ground balls , as Molina estimated , to improve the young catcher 's ability to block pitches . 
 Molina began his professional career with the Johnson City Cardinals of the Rookie @-@ level Appalachian League in 2001 , playing 44 total games and batting .259 . He advanced one level in each of four seasons in the minor leagues . Even without highly developed offensive skills , Molina proved difficult to strike out . Mainly a singles hitter who favored hitting the ball the other way , he batted .278 with 14 home runs and 133 runs batted in ( RBI ) with 118 strikeouts in 1 @,@ 044 at bats in four minor league seasons . In his first three seasons , he threw out 111 base runners attempting to steal while allowing 133 stolen bases , for a caught @-@ stealing percentage of 45 % .

 Molina 's first chance in the Major Leagues arrived when incumbent Matheny went on the disabled list ( DL ) with a strained rib in the Cardinals ' pennant @-@ winning season of 2004 . Molina made his Major League debut on June 3 . One of his first game @-@ winning hits occurred on August 7 . He stroked a broken @-@ bat single to shallow center field in the bottom of the ninth inning against the New York Mets that center fielder Mike Cameron did not recognize had splintered , allowing Jim Edmonds to score . Three weeks later ( August 29 ) , the Cardinals were victorious over the Pittsburgh Pirates 6 – 4 thanks in part to two separate plays in which Molina tagged out the runner at home plate , including a collision with Ty Wigginton . 
 Molina appeared in 51 regular @-@ season games and batted .267 with two home runs and 15 RBI in 151 plate appearances . He made an immediate impact with his arm , throwing out more than 50 % percent of would @-@ be basestealers ( nine of 17 ) . In the World Series against the Boston Red Sox , manager Tony La Russa elected to start Molina over Matheny in Game 4 . The Red Sox swept the Cardinals and claimed the title that game , their first in 86 years . The following offseason , Matheny signed a three @-@ year , $ 10 @.@ 5 @-@ million contract with the San Francisco Giants , clearing the way for Molina to become the Cardinals ' starting catcher . 
 In 2005 , Molina struggled with injuries and saw a drop off in the offensive performance in his rookie season . He doubled and scored on David Eckstein 's go @-@ ahead single on his way to three hits in a June 12 defeat of the New York Yankees , 5 – 3 . Molina returned from a 33 @-@ game absence on August 19 induced by a hairline fracture of his left fifth metacarpal bone from being hit by a pitch on July 7 . Starting pitcher Chris Carpenter , attempting to extend a winning streak to ten games on an August 20 game versus the San Francisco Giants , found himself in a 4 – 0 deficit in the ninth inning . Capped by Molina 's three @-@ run home run , the Cardinals rallied and won 5 – 4 in the ninth . The next day , Molina 's suicide squeeze bunt scored Mark <unk> , tying the game and allowing the Cardinals to win 4 – 2 . Those were just two wins of 100 as St. Louis made their way to another division title following 105 wins the season before . 
 In 114 games , Molina posted a .252 batting average with eight home runs and 49 RBI with just 30 strikeouts in 421 plate appearances . Defensively , he registered career @-@ highs of nine pickoffs and a 64 % caught @-@ stealing percentage from throwing out 25 of 39 would @-@ be basestealers . According to Baseball @-@ Reference.com , as of 2013 , that percentage ranked as the 26th @-@ highest all @-@ time season @-@ single caught stealing percentage . Further , it was the second @-@ highest figure since 1957 ; only Mike LaValliere 's 1993 figure of 72 @.@ 7 % was higher during that time period . 
 Before the 2006 season commenced , Molina participated in the inaugural World Baseball Classic ( WBC ) for Puerto Rico . After returning to the Cardinals , he changed his jersey number from 41 to 4 . However , the regular season presented some of his greatest offensive challenges as he struggled through a career @-@ worst .216 batting average in 461 regular @-@ season plate appearances . In fact , in a culmination of a three @-@ year downward trend in his offense , Molina 's on @-@ base plus slugging percentages declined from <unk> in 2004 , .654 in 2005 and a career @-@ worst .595 in 2006 . The low batting average was due in part to a deflated batting average on balls in play ( BABIP ) of <unk> ( normal is around .300 ) , a career low . 
 In a May 27 game against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park in San Diego with the Cardinals holding a 4 – 3 lead in the bottom of the ninth , Molina picked Brian Giles off first to end the game , the first pickoff to end a major league game in nearly four years . The Cardinals faced the Padres again in the National League Division Series ( NLDS ) playoff game in the playoffs , he again picked a Padre off at first , this time Mike Piazza , while bailing pitcher Jeff Suppan out of a jam . For the season , he caught 41 % of all base @-@ stealing attempts and picked off seven runners . 
 Even as his bat languished , Molina 's defense was instrumental in propelling the Cardinals to the National League Central division crown in a season heavily marred by injuries . However , the following playoffs marked a turning point in his career offensive output . He posted a .358 composite batting average , .424 on @-@ base percentage ( OBP ) , two home runs and eight RBI in 16 games as the Cardinals reached the World Series . He batted .308 in the National League Division Series ( NLDS ) , .348 in the National League Championship Series ( NLCS ) and .412 in the World Series . 
 One of Molina 's landmark playoff performances came in Game 7 of the NLCS against the New York Mets , the final game of the series tied at three games each . Starting in the top of the ninth , he batted with a 1 – 1 score . In the sixth inning , Mets left fielder <unk> Chávez had prevented the Cardinals from taking the lead when he leapt to catch Scott Rolen 's near @-@ miss home run over the center field fence . This time , however , Molina hit a two @-@ run home run off Aaron Heilman over center field that was too high for Chávez to catch and gave the Cardinals a 3 – 1 edge . 
 In the bottom of the ninth , rookie pitcher Adam Wainwright – filling in as an emergency closer – found himself in a two @-@ out , bases @-@ loaded situation against center fielder Carlos Beltrán , who had already homered three times in the NLCS . Molina called for a mound conference . Initially , he wanted a sinker from Wainwright but changed his mind because he suspected he would overthrow it and give Beltrán an easy pitch to hit . He made an unconventional choice by calling for a changeup to start the sequence against Beltrán . It was called for a strike . Had Beltrán successfully got a base hit , the scheme may have caused tension for the third @-@ year catcher with La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan because throwing a first @-@ pitch changeup ran contrary to Duncan 's teaching . Molina then called for two curveballs . Beltrán fouled off the first , but Wainwright struck him out looking at a " bender that started up and away and bit hard to the low inside corner " for the final out of the game . The Cardinals ' conquest of the NLCS gave them a return trip to the World Series after two years . They proceeded to defeat the Detroit Tigers in five games , giving Molina his first championship ring . His mask was turned in for display at the Baseball Hall of Fame .

 Batting out of the number @-@ five spot in the batting order for the first time in his career on Opening Day , 2007 , Molina collected two hits . In a game against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 15 , Molina picked Prince Fielder off first base as he leaned far off the bag , tipping off Molina and first baseman Albert Pujols to a hit and run the Brewers were planning . Four days later , Molina faced his brother Bengie for the first time in a game against the San Francisco Giants . It was also the first time they had seen each other in about three and one @-@ half years . 
 From May 1 to May 24 , Molina strung together a then @-@ career high 15 @-@ game hitting streak , during which he batted .373 . It was the longest streak for a Cardinals catcher since Erik Pappas ' 16 @-@ game streak in 1993 . Molina was absent for most of the month of June due of a fractured left wrist . In the third inning of the May 29 game against Colorado , he took a foul tip off his wrist from Rockies right fielder Brad <unk> 's bat . After missing 26 games , the Cardinals activated him from the disabled list on June 28 . 
 The first multi @-@ error game of Molina 's career occurred July 13 against the Philadelphia Phillies on a catch and throw . In a span of 11 starts from August 2 – 16 , he racked up four three @-@ hit games . On August 16 , he hit two home runs against the Brewers for his first career multi @-@ homer game . Molina homered and stroked the go @-@ ahead double in an August 22 defeat of Florida . One week later , he homered in back @-@ to @-@ back games against the Cincinnati Reds ; he , Edmonds , and Rick Ankiel each drove in three runs in an 11 – 3 victory on September 2 . On Yadier Molina Bobblehead Night September 19 versus Philadelphia , he stroked three hits including the game @-@ winning single in the tenth inning . 
 Molina suffered a concussion in September and underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee . The knee surgery ended his season early on September 24 . In Molina 's final 50 games , he successfully collected 49 hits in 158 AB for a .310 AVG . Of his final 35 starts , 12 were multi @-@ hit games . His .281 batting average after the All @-@ Star break ranked fifth among NL catchers .

He threw out 50 % ( 23 of 46 ) baserunners attempting to steal , the highest percentage in the majors . From 2005 – 07 , he led all MLB with a 47 % caught @-@ stealing rate and 18 pick @-@ offs . 
 On January 14 , 2008 , Molina and the Cardinals agreed to a four @-@ year , $ 15 @.@ 5 million deal with a club option for a fifth , cementing his position as their starting catcher . He reported to spring training having lost 15 pounds and in improved physical shape from rehabilitating following knee surgery . He started the season with an Opening Day home run and seven @-@ game hitting streak . After a home plate collision with Eric Bruntlett on June 15 against the Philadelphia Phillies in the ninth inning , Molina sustained head and neck injuries and was removed from the field on a stretcher . There were no indications of a concussion . He held on to the ball to help the Cardinals win . He missed the next four games . To that point , Molina was batting .295 with three home runs and 24 RBI . He also had thrown out 10 of 32 baserunners ( 31 @.@ 3 % ) – well below his career average of 45 % – but an Associated Press reporter attributed the decline to an inexperienced pitching staff . 
 Molina returned to the field against Boston at Fenway Park as the designated hitter . In that game , his solo home run provided the difference in a 5 – 4 Cardinals victory . It was also the first game of the first of two 13 @-@ game hitting streaks for the season . His first career start at first base , also against Boston , occurred two days later . During that streak , he collected 17 hits in 47 at @-@ bats for a .362 batting average . The second hitting streak spanned from August 16 to September 2 , where he successfully hit 19 times in 50 at bats for a .380 average . On September 2 , he and Felipe López hit consecutive home runs against the Arizona Diamondbacks en route to an 8 – 2 victory . 
 Overall , Molina enjoyed a breakout offensive season , finishing with new career highs with a .304 batting average – his first over .300 – and in hits ( 135 ) , OBP ( .349 ) , SLG ( .392 ) , runs ( 37 ) and RBI ( 56 ) . Of all catchers in franchise history with at least 450 PA in a season , he became just the second ever , after Simmons , to bat over .300 ; it was then the fourth @-@ best season batting average ; and , his 29 strikeouts were the fewest since Simmons fanned 20 times in 1976 . Molina led the team and was sixth in the NL with a .340 batting average with runners in scoring position . For the season , he successfully caught 35 % of opposing baserunners , still higher than the league average of 27 % . He led all MLB with seven pickoffs . That November , Molina received his first Gold Glove Award , becoming the third Cardinal catcher ever to win the honor , after Tom <unk> and Matheny . 
 Before the 2009 season commenced , Molina participated with Puerto Rico in his second WBC . When the event concluded , he returned to the Cardinals . In an April 16 game against the Arizona Diamondbacks , he reached base in all five of his plate appearances in a 12 – 7 victory . Starting pitcher Joel Piñeiro – struggling with his fastball command in previous starts – experimented with a sinker and shut out the New York Mets on June 24 with just two hits . Molina erased a Mets runner by throwing out Luis Castillo attempting to steal second base . Molina was batting .278 with five home runs and 25 RBI through July 5 , 2009 . He was selected through fan vote to represent the Cardinals in the All @-@ Star Game in St. Louis ' Busch Stadium – his first All @-@ Star Game . As the top vote @-@ getter among NL catchers with 2 @,@ 641 @,@ 467 votes , Molina was named the NL 's starting catcher . He caught eight innings and drove home a run . 
 Following the All @-@ Star break on July 18 , Molina 's four hits and Albert Pujols ' two home runs helped cap Chris Carpenter 's 6 – 1 victory over the Diamondbacks , who pitched around nine runners on base in eight innings . On August 15 , Molina picked off San Diego 's Kevin <unk> at first on the way to a 7 – 4 victory , the 33rd of his career . At that point , Bill James Online rated that Molina saved his team fifteen total runs from pickoffs alone in his career .

 On Opening Day , April 5 , 2010 , Molina connected for a grand slam , becoming just the third Cardinals player to hit an Opening Day grand slam , following Mark McGwire and Scott Rolen . On April 17 , he caught all 20 innings of a game against the Mets . Molina turned in a productive April , driving in 15 runners , the most for a Cardinals catcher in the month of April since Ted Simmons drove in 20 in 1977 . He also continued his productivity with the bases loaded that month , collecting four hits and 11 RBI in five at bats . 
 Before the All @-@ Star break , Molina batted just .223 . However , he was voted to start his second consecutive game , and second overall , and played four innings . After the All @-@ Star break , his hitting improved , as he stroked 63 hits in 200 at bats for .315 batting average . During a game against the Cincinnati Reds on August 10 , as second baseman Brandon Phillips came to bat , he exchanged words with Molina that escalated to a bench @-@ clearing confrontation , although no one was ejected . On September 17 , he amassed a career @-@ high five RBI and career @-@ tying four hits against San Diego , including two doubles .

He led all MLB catchers in innings ( 1138 @.@ 0 ) , games started ( 130 ) and assists ( 79 ) , and led the NL for the third time in caught @-@ stealing percentage at 49 % . On November 1 , he won his fourth consecutive Fielding Bible Award as the sole catcher . In addition , Molina became the first player at any position to win the award unanimously with a perfect score of 100 . Nine days later , he was awarded his third consecutive Gold Glove Award . 
 With increased offensive productivity in 2011 , Molina continued to help anchor the middle of Cardinals lineup in addition to the pitching staff and defense . From May 15 to May 18 , he put together four consecutive multi @-@ hit games . Selected to his third consecutive All @-@ Star Game , he substituted for the starter , McCann , played four innings and doubled in his only at @-@ bat . Molina hit safety in 14 consecutive games from July 21 to August 11 , one fewer than his career high . From July 22 – 25 , he homered in three consecutive games , the second time in his career he had done so . 
 On August 2 , Molina was ejected from a game against the Milwaukee Brewers for arguing a called strike . He bumped umpire Rob Drake in the chest multiple times and appeared to spit upon him . Molina later apologized , stating that he did not intend to spit on the umpire and that he " was caught up in the moment . That 's what happens when you 're caught up in the race and trying to win . I didn 't handle it the right way . " He served a five @-@ game suspension handed down by MLB for " making contact with umpire Rob Drake multiple times and spraying him with spit twice while arguing . " 
 Although the Cardinals stayed competitive , they were , at best , on the fringes of making the playoffs through August . As of August 28 , with a 70 – 64 record , they faced a 10 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ game deficit to the Braves for the wild card playoff berth with 28 left to play . Molina provided a spark to the offense in the close of the season , batting .342 in August and .341 in September . With his 30th double on September 21 , he became the fourth catcher in Cardinals history to reach that milestone , following Simmons , Bob O 'Farrell and Walker Cooper . 
 St. Louis won 20 of 28 games to finish the season , allowing them to tie the Braves for the wild card lead going into the final day . Molina caught Carpenter 's 8 – 0 shutout of the Astros , the final game of the regular season . Meanwhile , the Philles defeated the Braves 4 – 3 in 13 innings , giving the Cardinals the wild card title and eliminating the Braves from the playoffs . The 10 1 ⁄ 2 games @-@ won deficit marked the largest lead surrendered with 28 left to play in MLB history , consummating what St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch sportswriter Bernie Miklasz termed an " improbable comeback , " and one of the greatest sports history . It was just the first in a series of improbable comebacks for the Cardinals in 2011 . 
 Molina compiled a .305 batting average , 32 doubles , 14 home runs and 65 RBI during the 2011 regular season . His batting average led the Cardinals and was eighth in the NL . However , his posted a career @-@ low 29 % caught @-@ stealing percentage . His OPS + ( 126 ) , batting average , and hit totals led NL catchers , doubles placed second and RBI third .

He also led all NL catchers with 12 three @-@ hit games , and collated 39 multi @-@ hit games and 13 multi @-@ RBI games . 
 By making the playoffs , Molina became the first catcher in franchise history to appear in five postseasons for the Cardinals . He batted .333 in the NLCS against Milwaukee , including five hits in eight AB in the final two games . In Game 1 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers , Molina threw out Ian Kinsler attempting to steal in the first inning on the way to a 3 – 2 win . It was the Rangers ' only attempted steal of the game . That caught stealing gave Molina five in seven total chances in the 2011 postseason to that point ; the Rangers had been tied with the Cardinals for most steals in that postseason . For the series , the Rangers attempted to steal four bases and were successful just once . In Game 3 , Molina accumulated four RBI , and two more each in Games 6 and 7 . 
 The Cardinals won the Series in seven games , giving Molina his second championship ring . He batted .333 and set a team World Series record with nine RBI .

He also won the first @-@ ever National League Rawlings Platinum Glove Award , bestowed upon one player in each league . For the second time in his career , he won MVP consideration ; he finished tied for 21st for the NL MVP balloting . 
 = = = 2012 = = = 
 On March 1 , 2012 , Molina signed a five @-@ year extension with the Cardinals worth $ 75 million through 2017 . The contract included a $ 1 million signing bonus , no @-@ trade clause , and a mutual option for 2018 worth another $ 15 million . The deal made him the second @-@ highest @-@ paid catcher in the majors . He collected his tenth career four @-@ hit game against the Brewers on April 29 with a two @-@ run home run that led the Cardinals to a 7 – 3 win . On May 1 , Molina mounted the first of two two @-@ stolen base games of the season ; the other occurred August 3 . 
 On May 27 against the Phillies , Molina blasted his third career grand slam against Roy Halladay . His made his 1,000th career appearance in an MLB game against the Chicago White Sox on June 12 . From July 25 to August 7 , he maintained a season @-@ best 11 @-@ game hitting streak in which he batted .413 . In a game against Pittsburgh at PNC Park on August 28 , he sustained head , neck and back injuries – although no concussion – in a second @-@ inning home plate collision with second baseman Josh Harrison . In August , he batted .403 with a <unk> OBP , both tied for third in the NL . As the season progressed , he garnered widespread consideration for the National League MVP award . On September 4 , Molina collected his 1,000th career hit , an infield single against the Mets at home in the second inning . 
 The 2012 season was one of Molina 's crowning achievements as a hitter , especially considering early professional scouting reports did not forecast his bat being much of a factor in the major leagues . He set new career highs in multiple offensive categories , including a .315 batting average , 22 home runs , 76 RBI , 65 runs scored , .373 OBP , .501 slugging percentage and 12 stolen bases . He led the team in batting average for the second straight season , thus becoming the first catcher in franchise history to do so . 
 Panning Molina 's performance National League @-@ wide , he ranked fourth batting , tenth in OBP , 14th in SLG and tied for 18th with 46 <unk> games . He led NL catchers in stolen bases and set a Cardinals single @-@ season record for catchers , and ranked second among NL catchers in HR and third in RBI and batting average . An aggressive hitter , he batted .380 with seven HR on the first pitch ; the HR total on first pitches ranked seventh in the NL . His 32 baserunners caught stealing topped MLB , 47 @.@ 9 caught stealing percentage ranked second , and three pickoffs tied for first in the NL and were second in MLB . 
 From a historic perspective , Fangraphs ' Dave Cameron noted that Molina 's combination of offensive productivity and interception of base runners in 2012 was one of the rarest performances in history . He became just the ninth MLB catcher to post a season with a weighted runs created ( WRC + ) factor of 140 and 45 percent of runners caught stealing . At 143 , his WRC + was tied for eighth all @-@ time among catchers with at 45 % of base runners caught stealing . Further , those figures aligned with peak seasons of other catchers such as Johnny Bench , Elston Howard , Carlton Fisk , and Rick Wilkins . 
 After being the subject of much speculation for the MVP award throughout the season , Molina ultimately finished fourth . He and winner Buster Posey became the first pair of catchers to finish in the top four in the award 's 88 @-@ year history . However , like in years past , other awards were on their way . In November , he won his fifth straight Gold Glove award , making him the first Cardinal since Jim Edmonds to win that many consecutively , which Edmonds did in 2004 . On December 4 , he won his first <unk> Award for Defensive Player of the Year . The St. Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers ' Association of America ( BBWAA ) named him the St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year for 2012 . In a Los Angeles Times report that published the top MLB jersey sales from the All @-@ Star break until October 1 , his jersey ranked 18th . 
 = = = 2013 = = = 
 With increased profile coming in conjunction with his offensive breakout from the year before , Molina 's popularity with fans around the game also increased . Following his 2012 fourth @-@ place MVP finish , his 2013 in @-@ season jersey sales rose to third place , just after Posey and retiring New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera , according to a July 11 report . On June 2 he was ejected by 1st base umpire Clint Fagan for throwing his helmet . Molina collected two doubles in a three @-@ hit game on June 12 , giving him 21 doubles for the season , a pre @-@ All @-@ Star break career high . It was also the second @-@ highest pre @-@ All @-@ Star break total in franchise history following Ted Simmons ' 29 thirty @-@ five years earlier . That three @-@ hit game also gave Molina 78 for his career , tied for 43 on the all @-@ time list for catchers . 
 Through July 15 , Molina led the NL with a .341 ( 110 hits in 323 at @-@ bats ) batting average . In the final All @-@ Star Game balloting , Molina ( 6 @,@ 883 @,@ 258 votes ) edged out Posey ( 6 @,@ 474 @,@ 088 ) for the role of the NL 's starting catcher in the game held at Citi Field in Queens , New York City . The Cardinals placed Molina on the 15 @-@ day disabled list on July 31 due to a right knee sprain . At the time he went on the DL , Molina was batting .330 with eight homers , thirty doubles , and 54 RBI . A magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) indicated inflammation but no structural damage , so the knee was drained of excess fluid buildup and Molina was given a cortisone injection . 
 The knee injury impacted his batting average , contributing to a late @-@ season slump . On September 16 , Molina collected four hits with three runs scored to help the Cardinals to a 12 – 2 win over the Seattle Mariners and break an 0 – 15 slump , raising his batting average to .317 . Eight days later , Molina was behind the plate to call rookie Michael Wacha 's one @-@ hit , 8 2 ⁄ 3 innings of shutout work in a 2 – 0 victory over the Washington Nationals . It was actually a no @-@ hitter through that point until Ryan Zimmerman broke it up with a high @-@ bouncing ground ball that glanced off Wacha 's glove for the Nationals ' only hit of the game . 
 For the year , Molina set new career highs in batting average ( .319 ) , doubles ( 44 ) , runs scored ( 68 ) , and RBI ( 80 ) . He also hit .373 with runners in scoring position ( RISP ) in a season in which the Cardinals set the all @-@ team team record for batting average with RISP at .330 . He finished fourth in the NL in batting average , second in doubles and sixth in batting average with RISP . His 44 doubles were the most in the Major Leagues among catchers since Iván Rodríguez ' 47 in 1996 . 
 Molina was also noted for his handling of the pitching staff . The Cardinals overcame losing key pitchers Chris Carpenter , Jason Motte , and Jaime García – among others – early in the season by substituting twelve rookie pitchers en route to winning a competitive NL Central division title over the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds ( each team finished with at least 90 wins ) . A continuously evolving core exceeded expectations by filling in for 52 games started , 36 wins , and five saves and Molina was credited with their success in a large part due to his pitch @-@ calling skills and aptness to guide . The rookies ' 36 wins were the most in franchise history since 1941 . 
 The Cardinals squared off against the Pirates in the NLDS . Two weeks removed from just missing a no @-@ hitter , Wacha again nearly repeated the feat with Molina behind the plate in an elimination game , Game 4 . Molina threw out pinch runner Josh Harrison attempting to steal second base in the eighth inning to help the Cardinals preserve a 2 – 1 lead . In the World Series against the Boston Red Sox , Molina became just the ninth player – and the first in the expansion era – in franchise history to appear in four World Series with the club , and the first since Stan Musial in the 1946 World Series , also against the Red Sox . Molina collected more awards following the season , including his first Silver Slugger Award , sixth Gold Glove , and a third @-@ place finish in MVP voting . Molina was a co @-@ winner , along with Wainwright and Matt Carpenter , for the BBWAA St. Louis Baseball Man of the Year .

 Along with three other players each separately displayed , Sports Illustrated featured Molina on the cover of their March 31 issue complementing the 2014 MLB season preview article . On the 2014 Opening Day – the same day Sports Illustrated published the Molina cover edition – he stroked his second season @-@ entry home run and the 90th of his career , accounting for the difference in a 1 – 0 defeat of the Reds in Cincinnati . It also secured the 100th win for batterymate Adam Wainwright . Molina added a single for two of the Cardinals ' five hits . 
 With a one ball , two strike pitch from relief pitcher Randy Choate incoming to Cubs outfielder Nate Schierholtz in a May 4 game , the batter foul tipped the pitch . Instead of Molina being in a position to catch it cleanly with his glove , the ball hit the thigh . Molina instantly hunched over the ball , trapping it between the thigh and rib cage . He held on , qualifying it as a third strike . 
 With the All @-@ Star Game nearing , Brewers catcher Jonathan <unk> aired a satirical television commercial in the style of a political advertising campaign on June 17 to outgain Molina in the All @-@ Star voting totals . The voice @-@ over narrator posed the question , " Do you want another St. Louis Cardinals catcher to star in an All Star game ? Isn ’ t there a better way ? Cast a ballot for change . Cardinals fans need to know that enough is enough . " At that point , Molina led the vote total for NL catchers with more than two million , while Posey was second at 1 @.@ 4 million and <unk> third with 1 @.@ 1 million . 
 Some , including Matheny , took the message literally . However , Brad Weimer , the advertisement 's creator , confirmed the humor was meant to be tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek . Molina stayed in the lead and won the vote as the starting catcher in the All @-@ Star Game at Target Field in Minneapolis , Minnesota , his sixth consecutive appearance . 
 His season was interrupted on July 9 against the Pirates . While sliding past third base , he attempted to grab the bag to stay on . However , during the play , he injured his right thumb . An MRI revealed torn ligaments , requiring surgery and forcing him to miss the next eight to 12 weeks . Regarding the injury as having a significance impact on the Cardinals ' season , St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch sportswriter Bernie Miklasz commented , " Losing the best catcher in the world for the next 8 to 12 weeks with a torn thumb ligament is a horrendous , demoralizing setback for the Cardinals . This could be a season @-@ ending injury . " At that point , he was batting .287 with a .341 OBP , .409 SLG , 16 doubles , seven homers , and 30 RBI through 83 games . He also led MLB with a 49 caught @-@ stealing percentage . 
 He returned from the DL ahead of schedule , about seven weeks and 40 games missed after the injury , and was activated August 29 before a series against the Cubs . However , he still had not fully recovered , as he batted .250 in September with a pronounced drop in power production . His 110 appearances were his fewest since his rookie season in 2004 . He finished the season with a .282 batting average , seven HR , 38 RBI , 21 doubles , a .333 OBP and .386 SLG , all lower totals than 2013 , and many since 2010 . Among players with at least 90 games played , Molina 's 48 % caught stealing and 3 @.@ 20 catcher 's ERA were both first in the major leagues . 
 During Game 1 of the NLDS against the Dodgers , Wainwright hit Adrian Gonzalez with a pitch , and both benches cleared . Umpire Jerry Meals attempted to get between Gonzalez and Molina , but Molina briefly shoved Meals . MLB fined Molina $ 5 @,@ 000 without suspending him . In Game 2 of the NLCS against the Giants , Molina collected his 89th career hit in the postseason , passing Pujols for the franchise record . However , he sustained his second significant injury of the season in that same game , straining his left abdominal oblique muscle during another at bat , due in part to compensation in his swing for lost power following his thumb injury earlier in the season . 
 After missing the next game , his string of 83 consecutive playoff games started was stopped , which was a major league record . The last playoff game he had not started was Game 3 of the 2004 World Series . On November 4 , Molina was announced as winning his seventh consecutive Gold Glove , tying Boone as having won the third @-@ most Gold Gloves among catchers . Further , only Bench and Rodríguez had won more consecutive ( 10 each ) as catchers in major league history . He won the National League Platinum Glove award on November 8 , his third time in the award 's first four years .

 With his 11th consecutive Opening Day start on April 5 , 2015 , against the Cubs , Molina became the first catcher in club history to achieve this feat . On May 10 against the Pirates , he was on the dubious end of a piece of MLB history : lining out into the first " 4 – 5 – 4 " triple play in MLB history . Second baseman Neil Walker caught his line drive with two runners on , then threw to third baseman Jung @-@ ho Kang to double up Jhonny Peralta for the second out . Kang briefly pirouetted the ball in his hand , albeit confused , but threw back to Walker to tag Jason Heyward for the third out . Molina 's first home run of the season and first in 95 games occurred against the Minnesota Twins on June 15 ; his previous home run dated back to June 27 , 2014 . 
 On July 7 , he was selected to his seventh consecutive All @-@ Star Game , played at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati . In the Reds ' clubhouse for the All @-@ Star Game , Molina shared a locker with Reds ' second baseman Brandon Phillips . Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010 , the two mended their schism , and Molina has a photograph of their families together . When informed whose locker he was using , Molina replied , " This is Phillips ' locker ? How about that ? I 'll have to write something to him . " While the pregame roster introductions were made , Reds fans booed all six Cardinals players who were selected , and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols . When Molina was introduced , he smiled and turned and pointed his thumbs toward the back of his jersey . Pujols provided levity when he then joined in the booing . After the game , Molina remarked to reporters , " when you spend 12 years coming to Cincinnati and you beat them so many times , they ’ re going to boo you . " In his career to that point , he hit .319 with a .352 on @-@ base percentage and .500 slugging percentage in 270 career at @-@ bats at Great American Ball Park . 
 Hitting his first triple in more than four years and 2 @,@ 000 at bats , with the bases loaded , Molina provided the decisive run in a 3 – 2 outcome against the Chicago White Sox on July 22 . In the annual Baseball America Toolbox Awards , managers and coaches around the National League rated Molina as both the " Best hit and run artist " and " Best defensive catcher " in the NL . His 100th career home run was well @-@ timed , becoming the game @-@ winning run in the bottom of the eighth inning at Busch Stadium on August 19 in a 4 – 3 win over San Francisco . After sustaining an injury to his left thumb during a September 20 game against the Cubs , an MRI revealed a partial ligament tear , preventing him from playing . Molina won his eighth consecutive Gold Glove Award and fourth Platinum Glove Award in 2015 . In December , it was revealed that Molina had a second surgery on his left thumb , pushing his return to late in 2016 spring training . He was winner of the Darryl Kile Good Guy Award .

 At age 33 , Molina broke the Cardinals ' all @-@ time games caught record on April 8 , 2016 , in his <unk> game , passing Ted Simmons ( 1968 – 80 ) . His 1 @,@ 343 games started since the beginning of the 2005 season was the highest total in the major leagues . He made his 1,500th career major league appearance on May 14 in a 5 – 3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers . While playing the Washington Nationals in the seventh inning of a 2 – 1 loss at Nationals Park on May 26 , Stephen Drew hit a high infield fly that stayed over the pitcher 's mound . With both <unk> Díaz and Mike Leake attempting to catch the ball , Molina posited himself and waited . As the ball deflected off Díaz ' glove , he almost collided with Leake , but Molina instinctively moved his glove and caught the ball before it hit the ground . He recorded his 1,500th career hit on July 2 against Milwaukee , becoming the 34th catcher in MLB history , and second for the Cardinals , after Simmons . 
 = = Puerto Rico ( World Baseball Classic ) = = 
 Three World Baseball Classic ( WBC ) tournaments have been held – 2006 , 2009 and 2013 – and Molina has participated in all of them for the Puerto Rican team . He was fellow defensive standout Iván Rodríguez ' understudy in 2006 and 2009 and the primary catcher for the 2013 squad . 
 In his first classic in 2006 , Molina played four games and collected three hits in five at @-@ bats . In a 2009 tournament game against the Netherlands on March 9 , Molina 's eighth @-@ inning double keyed a rally in which Puerto Rico won 3 – 1 . Speaking the next day , Molina stated that the previous night 's double had been a bigger thrill than his two @-@ run homer to beat the Mets in Game 7 of the 2006 NLCS . 
 With Molina as the starting catcher in 2013 , Puerto Rico earned the silver medal . Edwin Rodríguez , who scouted Molina in Puerto Rico before the Cardinals signed him , became the manager for the 2013 squad . Shortly after learning he would be the 2013 manager , Rodríguez contacted Molina for input on constructing the roster . Molina prepared for the Classic by playing 14 games for the winter league team in Puerto Rico Rodríguez managed . Molina was voted on the All @-@ World Baseball Classic Team for the first time . 
 In a 2013 semifinal game against Japan , Molina <unk> took advantage of a baserunning mistake to record an unusual putout . With Shinnosuke Abe batting for Japan in the top of the eighth inning , and Hirokazu Ibata on second and Seiichi Uchikawa on first , J. C. Romero was pitching for Puerto Rico . Abe took a pitch from Romero inside for a ball as the runners went in motion . However , Ibata retreated to second as Uchikawa charged toward him . Instead of throwing and risking an error , Molina held on to the ball . He then chased Uchikawa , cornered him by positioning himself between first and second and tagged out Uchikawa – an unassisted caught stealing . The Japanese later stated they were attempting to exploit Romero 's slow delivery .

 The winner of eight consecutive Gold Gloves , Molina has been widely praised for his preparation , defense and leadership , not just of the pitching staff , but also of the entire team . Fellow catchers Jorge Posada and Brian McCann stated in 2009 that Molina was " the best defensive catcher in baseball ; " Víctor Martínez also called him " the best behind the plate . " In 2013 , a scout pronounced Molina the " one piece the St. Louis Cardinals cannot lose " while another commented that he is " irreplaceable . " When the club did lose Molina midway through the 2014 season to a thumb injury , ESPN 's Keith Law tweeted , " Yadier Molina missing two @-@ plus months would be bad for the Cardinals , but also just bad for baseball , period . " In his time in the major leagues , Molina has been widely viewed as evolving into a competitive influence and an unofficial , on @-@ field coach . 
 As a part of his pre @-@ game preparation , Molina meticulously studies and prepares for the upcoming game 's opposing hitters by creating a complete pitching and defensive plan . Other preparation includes handling ground balls at shortstop and third base , extending his agility for blocking pitches thrown in the dirt . According to former Cardinals starter Jake Westbrook , he was " a part of every aspect of the game : starters , relievers , offense , defense . " 
 Advanced defensive metrics – known as sabermetrics – show he is a top defender among catchers in MLB history . Molina ranked second all @-@ time among catchers at the end of the 2014 season on Baseball @-@ Reference.com 's career defensive runs saved ( DRS ) with 120 , behind only Iván Rodríguez ( 167 ) , and ahead of Jim Sundberg ( 114 ) , Bob Boone ( 107 ) and Gary Carter ( 106 ) , the only catchers with over 100 on the list . He was the season leader in the NL every year from 2005 – 14 , except 2008 and 2011 – 12 . Fangraphs tallied his career DRS at 106 , with a career @-@ high of 20 in 2010 . The <unk> stat defensive wins above replacement ( DWAR ) has also ranked Molina 's defense highly ; he has never had a full season with a negative DWAR , and he had a career @-@ high 2 @.@ 9 DWAR in 2010 . 
 Molina is known for his in @-@ game pitch @-@ calling skills , and pitchers rarely reject signs that he shows for the next pitch . Matheny stated , " We tell all our young pitchers when they come up to pitch their game . Yadi needs to find out how they work . He 's a quick study . But at the same time , they tend to just follow him . We do put them in Yadi 's hands . " Molina reads opposing hitters and will move fielders with subtle signs and gestures to align them with his pitch calling . La Russa commented that " it 's not just instinct . It 's sense , based on how a hitter 's standing , how he responds to the pitch or two before , and he 's very creative in how he makes his adjustment based on what he sees with the hitter and knowing what his pitcher can do . " 
 " You don 't ever have to worry about bouncing a ball to Yadier " , said Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright . " He 's a human vacuum behind the plate . The only thing you have to think about is making the pitch , because you know Yadi 's going to catch whatever you throw . " Former Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan remarked , " During the course of games , he would do something and I 'd go , ' I can 't believe he did that . ' But it worked . His pitch calling , sometimes you 're thinking he 's doing something so out of the norm , yet it was the right thing to do at the time . " 
 Baseball Prospectus estimated in 2013 that Molina saved 35 defensive runs per season through his pitch framing and had moved 301 out @-@ of @-@ zone pitches that were called strikes between April 1 and June 30 , 2013 . As of July 2013 , Molina had also thrown out 45 % of would @-@ be base stealers . At one time , an Arizona Diamondbacks official stated a team policy existed not to run on Molina . With pickoffs , Molina throws from behind left @-@ handed batters to obfuscate the runner 's view of his motion to first base . Besides studying hitters at the plate , Molina also studies base runners to watch their decision @-@ making process about stealing bases or when they are less guarded against a pickoff . He practices pickoff moves and coordinates signals with the first basemen to indicate when he is primed to move for a pickoff throw . In 2012 , a Sports Illustrated poll of 306 players found that Molina was the " toughest catcher to run on . "

 As the publication Viva El <unk> wrote , " Yadier Molina broke into the majors as a light @-@ hitting defensive specialist " , who hit mostly singles . Molina pushed to shed the light @-@ hitter label he had in common with his brothers . A <unk> with his batting stance early in his career , Molina mimicked and vacillated between more accomplished hitters such as Andrés Galarraga and Albert Pujols . However , it was a dip in his swing and an inability to get around on fastballs that sapped his efforts . Over time , with assistance of teammates such as Pujols , Molina found his comfortable stance , sounder mechanics and adopted a line @-@ drive style of swing that eliminated the dip and helped him hit fastballs with more authority . 
 Thus , he became a more consistent hitter as his career progressed , defying the scouting reports that he would have a weak bat . In combination with an improved his ability to pull the ball and hit it up the middle , he improved his batting average , batting .293 or higher in five of his last six seasons . His line @-@ drive pull percentage of 2009 – 11 increased by about 6 % in 2012 – 13 ; BABIP increased from .280 in 2005 – 10 to .327 in 2011 – 13 and pull weighted on @-@ base average ( <unk> ) has increased from .290 in 2009 to over .520 in 2013 . To keep his bat in the lineup but allow respite from the rigors of his in @-@ game catching duties , Molina has occasionally started at first base . 
 Aside from swinging with increased line @-@ drive contact and hitting fastballs with more authority , very little has actually changed in the catcher 's approach . One trait that has always persisted is that Molina is an aggressive and free @-@ swinging – but high @-@ contact – hitter . Through 2012 , he swung at more than 51 % percent of the pitches he saw – he has a reputation for swinging at pitches in and out of the strike zone , low and away and even in toward his hands . Because of his free @-@ swinging tendency , he naturally has a walk rate ( 7 @.@ 1 % ) below the Major League average ( 8 @.@ 4 % ) . Combined with his ability to put the bat on the ball quite frequently ( 87 % ) and his improved approach at the plate , he increased his career @-@ high single @-@ season batting average five times between 2006 and 2013 . 
 Despite batting just .238 in his first three seasons and .240 after 1 @,@ 000 at @-@ bats , Molina increased his average to .284 average after 3 @,@ 983 at @-@ bats ( 1 @,@ 132 hits ) as of 2013 due in part to having only one season lower than .293 from 2009 – 13 . He hit into 27 double plays in 2009 , but in 2012 reduced that figure to ten . Molina 's home run and doubles rates also increased ; from 2011 – 13 , he hit 104 of his 226 career doubles .

 " Long , Long , Long " is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 album The Beatles ( also known as " the White Album " ) . It was written by George Harrison following the group 's attendance at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi 's Transcendental Meditation course in India in early 1968 . Although Harrison later stated that he was addressing God in the lyrics , it is the first of his compositions that invites interpretation as both a standard love song and a paean to his deity . 
 Harrison wrote " Long , Long , Long " during a period that marked his emergence as a prolific songwriter , coinciding with his return to the guitar after two years of studying the Indian sitar . His musical inspiration for the song was " Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands " by Bob Dylan , while the understated arrangement reflects the influence of the Band 's 1968 album Music from Big Pink . The Beatles recorded the song in London towards the end of the troubled sessions for the White Album . Sequenced to follow the heavy rock @-@ styled " Helter Skelter " , the otherwise gentle and meditative track ends with a partly improvised segment , which was inspired by the eerie sound of a wine bottle vibrating on a speaker in the recording studio . 
 " Long , Long , Long " has received praise from many music critics for its lilting , expressive qualities . Ian MacDonald described it as Harrison 's " touching token of exhausted , relieved reconciliation with God " and considered it to be his " finest moment on The Beatles " . Elliott Smith and Jim James are among the other artists who have recorded or performed the song . 
 = = Background and inspiration = = 
 George Harrison wrote " Long , Long , Long " in August 1968 , while the Beatles were part @-@ way through the recording of their eponymous double album , also known as " the White Album " . It was one of many songs that marked Harrison 's return to the guitar as his principal musical instrument , after he had dedicated himself to mastering the Indian sitar in 1966 . This period coincided with a new , prolific period in his songwriting , which musicologist Walter Everett likens to the arrival of John Lennon and Paul McCartney as composers in 1963 . 
 According to author and critic Kenneth Womack , the " origins " of " Long , Long , Long " date from the Beatles ' stay in Rishikesh , India , between February and April 1968 . Led by Harrison 's commitment , the four band members studied Transcendental Meditation there under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . They departed for England separately , however , between 1 March and 12 April , and their mixed experiences on the course contributed to the divisiveness that pervaded the group upon their return . Alone among the Beatles , Harrison continued to espouse the Maharishi 's teachings , a position that left him isolated within the band . Author Simon Leng describes " Long , Long , Long " as the first song in which Harrison " share [ d ] the spiritual refuge he 'd found " through meditation , as well as " a confluence of the Indian , folk , and spiritual influences " that had preoccupied him since 1966 . 
 In his autobiography , I , Me , Mine , Harrison states that " the ' you ' in ' Long Long Long ' is God . " He also says that his musical inspiration for the composition was Bob Dylan 's " Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands " – specifically , " D to E minor , A and D – those three chords and the way they moved " . As a further influence in " Long , Long , Long " , Leng cites the release of the Band 's debut album , Music from Big Pink , which " signaled the rebirth of ' the song ' " as an alternative to the excesses of 1967 @-@ era psychedelia . 
 = = Composition = = 
 According to musicologist Alan Pollack , " Long , Long , Long " is " an off @-@ beat mixture " of contemporary musical styles ; he identifies it as " a three @-@ way cross between jazz waltz , folk song , and late sixties psychedelia " . The song is in the key of F , played with a capo on the guitar 's third fret , so allowing for the chord shapes that Harrison admired in " Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands " . The melody appears to fluctuate from the home key , however , due to its avoidance of perfect cadences , as the dominant , C7 chord resists anchoring on the tonic I chord of F major . In addition , all plagal changes ( in this case , B ♭ to F major ) are fleeting . The composition also makes use of jazz @-@ style ninth chords . 
 Lyrically , the song takes the form of a reconciliation with a loved one after a long period of estrangement . Theologian Dale Allison considers that , given the " cryptic " nature of the lyrics , it is only through Harrison 's subsequent comments that the listener knows that he is addressing God rather than a woman . Allison likens the song 's message to that of later Harrison compositions such as " Try Some , Buy Some " and " Heading for the Light " , through its conveying of a " conversion experience " . 
 The lyrics ' reference to an extreme length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6 / 8 metre into 9 / 8 , and , during the verses , by the appending of a measure @-@ long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody . Partly as a result of the absence of resolution in the home key , the descending bassline in the verses – a 4 @-@ 3 @-@ 2 @-@ 1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV @-@ iii @-@ ii @-@ I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic . 
 The mood of the song is gentle and meditative , with the more strident middle eight providing a brief departure from the calmness . In this section , Harrison sings of " So many tears I was searching / So many tears I was wasting " , a statement that , according to author Ian Inglis , reflects the singer 's " rejoicing in his discovery of a deity to guide him through the vicissitudes of life " . Everett remarks on the close similarity between " Long , Long , Long " and " Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands " , as well as an understated musical mood akin to the Band 's early work . The song 's ending , which would come about through happenstance while the Beatles were working in the recording studio , is marked by Harrison playing a final , G minor 7th chord , which author Ian MacDonald considers " one of the most resonant [ chords ] in The Beatles ' discography " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Under the working title " It 's Been a Long , Long , Long Time " , recording for the song began at EMI 's Abbey Road Studios in London on 7 October 1968 , during the final week of sessions for the White Album . Since the start of the project , in late May , the album sessions had been fraught with disharmony , partly as a result of the constant presence of Yoko Ono , Lennon 's new partner , and disagreements within the band over their new business venture , Apple Corps . While noting the context of the song 's recording , MacDonald describes " Long , Long , Long " as Harrison 's " touching token of exhausted , relieved reconciliation with God " . 
 The session for " Long , Long , Long " was a relaxed occasion , with the burning of Indian incense helping to create the requisite atmosphere in the studio . The Beatles recorded 67 takes of the rhythm track , with Harrison on vocals and acoustic guitar , McCartney playing Hammond organ , and Ringo Starr on drums . 
 In his book on the history of ambient music , Mark Prendergast cites " Long , Long , Long " as a ballad " noteworthy for its Ambient production " . The idea for the end of the song was inspired by the sound created by a wine bottle sitting on a Leslie speaker , through which the organ was connected . Whenever McCartney played a certain note on the keyboard , the bottle began to vibrate , producing an eerie clattering sound that the Beatles decided to incorporate in their subsequent performances of the track . To compound the effect on the selected take , Starr played a fast snare drum roll and Harrison vocalised a prolonged , high @-@ pitched wail . While noting the " palpable spiritual longing " conveyed in the song , Chris Gerard of PopMatters describes this coda as a " weird spectral ending , with Harrison wailing like a wounded ghost while the band members rattle their instruments ominously " . 
 Nine hours after this all @-@ night session , the band returned to Abbey Road to carry out overdubs . Harrison added a second vocal and another acoustic guitar part , the latter consisting of riffs that recall the sound of a sitar , due to the strings buzzing against the frets . During the same session , McCartney overdubbed bass guitar onto the track . The recording was finished on 9 October , with the addition of a brief harmony vocal from McCartney and piano , over the middle eight , played by Chris Thomas . 
 Mixing on " Long , Long , Long " was completed on 14 October , with Starr 's drum fills given prominence in the mix . Relative to the stereo version , the contrast between the song 's quiet and louder moments is less pronounced in the mono mix , where Harrison 's second vocal part also arrives earlier on the opening line . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Apple Records released The Beatles on 22 November 1968 , with " Long , Long , Long " appearing as the final track on side three of the double LP . The sequencing ensured that the song provided what author Mark Hertsgaard terms " a calm landing pad " after McCartney 's heavy rock @-@ styled " Helter Skelter " . Shortly after the album 's release , Harrison spent time with Dylan and the Band in Woodstock , in upstate New York . In addition to co @-@ writing " I 'd Have You Anytime " with Dylan , Harrison further established his independence from the Beatles during this visit , which music critic John Harris views as the foundation for his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass . 
 Among contemporary reviews of The Beatles , Alan Walsh of Melody Maker admired the song as " a gentle , lilting track " while , less impressed , Record Mirror considered it " not a strong tune " , with drums " monopolising the sound " . In his review for The Times , William Mann described " Long , Long , Long " as " a melting love song in slow waltz tempo " and rated it the equal of the nine best , " superbly inventive " compositions credited to Lennon – McCartney . 
 Recalling the release in his 1977 book The Beatles Forever , Nicholas Schaffner said that in departing from the overtly Indian style of his previous compositions for the Beatles , Harrison had provided " a quartet of more conventionally accessible pop songs that many felt were among the finest on the [ White Album ] " . While acknowledging Harrison 's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney , Schaffner added : " but when he tones his voice down to an ethereal near @-@ whisper , as in ' Long Long Long , ' he can evoke as well as anyone the magic and the mystery of what [ music journalist ] Jonathan Cott has called ' the music of deep silence . ' " 
 = = Retrospective assessment and legacy = = 
 AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine views " Long , Long , Long " as " haunting " and , along with its composer 's three other White Album tracks – " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " , " Savoy Truffle " and " Piggies " – evidence that Harrison 's songwriting " deserved wider exposure " than his typical quota of two songs on each Beatles LP . Less impressed with Harrison 's other contributions to the album , Ian MacDonald welcomes " Long , Long , Long " with the words : " at last – the real George . " MacDonald considers it to be " Harrison 's finest moment on The Beatles : simple , direct , and , in its sighing , self @-@ annihilating coda , devastatingly expressive " . Conversely , although he acknowledges its effectiveness in following " Helter Skelter " , Tim Riley identifies " Long , Long , Long " as the weakest of the four Harrison songs , which are otherwise all " essentials " and " regain [ ed ] the promise " shown by his three compositions on the Beatles ' Revolver album . Author Jonathan Gould praises the track as a " dark beautiful ballad " and a " breakthrough " for Harrison as a vocalist and composer , since it represents " the first time he ever allowed himself to sound humbled by his emotions in a song " . Music critic Chris Ingham , writing for Rough Guides , similarly includes it among " a new phase " of Harrison compositions , along with " Something " and " Here Comes the Sun " , in which " warmth and sweetness " replaced the dissonant qualities of his Indian @-@ inspired melodies . 
 In a 1998 review , the NME described " Long , Long , Long " as " redemptive " and " one of many hidden delights " on The Beatles , in addition to citing it as an example of how , even when relations within the band were at their most disharmonious , " the Beatles ' riches were manifold " . Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002 , Greg Kot deemed the song to be " quintessential Harrison , summarizing the impending exhaustion of the Beatles and the era they defined , while pointing the way toward the spiritual heights achieved by his solo debut masterpiece , All Things Must Pass " . In his obituary of the former Beatle , for Rock 's Backpages , Mat Snow included " Long , Long , Long " among his favourite Harrison compositions , saying : " for my money the music of George Harrison is most compelling when dwelling in those strange shadows of elusive regret and longing , even fear ... " David Quantick of Uncut admires the track as " a yearning , beautiful song ... an oasis of calm and faith " . 
 " Long , Long , Long " was ranked 80th in Mojo magazine 's 2006 list " The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs " , where musician Colin Newman described it as " achingly beautiful " and " like the album in microcosm ... A lament for a long @-@ lost love which ends with a ghostly freakout . " In a similar list , in 2011 , Rolling Stone ranked the song at number 98 . Conversely , in 2012 , readers of The Daily Telegraph voted " Long , Long , Long " as the fifth worst Beatles track . The following year , Mojo listed it at number 9 in a poll to determine " the ultimate list of connoisseurs ' Beatles ' songs " , as defined by any track not included on the band 's greatest @-@ hits compilations 1962 – 1966 and 1967 – 1970 . 
 = = Cover versions = = 
 In 1987 , Daniel Amos vocalist Terry Scott Taylor recorded what Trouser Press admired as a " first @-@ rate cover " of " Long , Long , Long " for his album A Briefing for the Ascent . Conversely , Sean Carruthers of AllMusic considers singer Tom Hooper 's 2002 cover to be a version that " manages to drain the life " out of the composition . Elliott Smith included " Long , Long , Long " in his live performances .
