 Christus frames his sitter in a rigid and balanced architectural setting . She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space , before a <unk> wall . The image is divided by the horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse , which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress . The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture : Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail , in contrast to the elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck , who is often regarded as Christus ' master . It is defined entirely by its material , a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion . The wall sets her in a realistic interior , perhaps intended to represent a space within her home . 
 Light falls on the pictorial space from the left , creating shadows against the back wall , the strongest cast by the girl 's hennin . The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing , which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck . The light throws a murky but curved shadow on the wall behind the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline . 
 The girl has pale skin , almond and slightly oriental eyes and a petulant mouth . She reflects the Gothic ideal of elongated facial features , narrow shoulders , tightly pinned hair and an almost unnaturally long forehead , achieved through tightly pulled @-@ back hair which has been plucked at the top . She is dressed in expensive clothing and jewellery and seems to be uncommonly elegant . She looks out of the canvas in an oblique but self @-@ aware and penetrating manner that some art historians have described as unnerving . Joanna Woods @-@ Marsden remarks that a sitter acknowledging her audience in this way was virtually unprecedented even in Italian portrait painting . Her acknowledgment is accentuated by the painting 's crop , which focuses the viewer 's gaze in a near @-@ invasive manner that seems to question the relationship between artist , model , patron and viewer . 
 The headdress is a variant of the truncated or bee @-@ hive hennin , then fashionable at the Burgundian court . A very similar style , with no tail , is seen on the older of two girls in the donor panels of Presentation of Christ by the Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi , a pupil of Rogier van der Weyden . The black band under the chin is rarely found in other images from the period , and has been interpreted as a style borrowed from the male chaperon hat , which always has a long tailing tail or cornette , sometimes worn wrapped under the chin in this way . 
 The influence of van Eyck can be seen in the delicate rendering of the textures and details of the dress , trimmings and adornments . Her pale skin and strong bone structure is strongly van Eyckian , and recalls the male sitter in his Arnolfini Portrait . But in other ways Christus abandons the developments made by van Eyck and Robert Campin . He reduces the emphasis on volume of those artists , in favour of an elongation of form ; the narrow , slight upper body and head are , according to the art historian Robert <unk> , " heightened by the V @-@ shaped neckline of the ermine and the cylindrical hat . " Further , while the first generation of Early Netherlandish painters benefited from the patronage of the newly emerging middle class , <unk> portraiture , and removing it from the preserve of royalty , Christus renders the girl as aristocratic , haughty , sophisticated , and exquisitely dressed . 
 = = Identity of the sitter = = 
 In a letter dated 1824 or 1825 Gustav Waagen , later Director of the Berlin Museums , gave his interpretation of Latin inscriptions he had seen on the original frame of the portrait , which was subsequently lost . As well as a Christus signature , he found an identification of the sitter as " a niece of the famous Talbots " ( eine <unk> des <unk> Talbots ) . His research led to a consensus that the sitter was a member of the leading English family , the Talbots , then headed by the Earl of Shrewsbury . In 1863 George Scharf suggested the panel was intended as the right @-@ hand wing to a diptych with the 1446 Portrait of Edward Grimston ( or " <unk> " ) in the National Gallery , London , leading to speculation that the girl might be Grimston 's first wife , Alice . This was rejected by Grete Ring in 1913 , on the basis that neither the dimensions nor background of the panels match , and that the Berlin panel was most probably completed some 20 – 30 years after the Grimston portrait . 
 Joel Upton , supporting Waagen 's analysis , investigated whether the " famous Talbot " was John Talbot , 1st Earl of Shrewsbury , killed at the Battle of Castillon in 1453 . However , John Talbot had only one niece , <unk> , who died in infancy in 1421 . Lorne Campbell suggests that given the Latin signature , Waagen might have misinterpreted the word " nepos " , which can also mean " grandchild " . Upton concludes that she was more likely a daughter of John Talbot , 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury , either Anne or Margaret . Their parents married between 1444 and 1445 , suggesting that the sitter was under 20 at the time of the portrait . She may have travelled to Bruges to attend the famously lavish wedding in 1468 of Margaret of York , sister of Edward IV of England , to Charles the Bold , Duke of Burgundy . 
 = = Provenance = = 
 The earliest extant record of the painting is in a 1492 inventory of the Medici family , where it is described as a small panel bust of a French lady , coloured in oil , the work of Pietro <unk> of Bruges . However , it seems from other works in the collection that the scribe was uninformed and noted any piece of northern art in the collection as " French " . It was highly valued , with an unusually high price of 40 florins , and prominently displayed . The record does not address the matter of the girl 's identity beyond her nationality , indicating that the painting was regarded as of aesthetic rather than historical interest . 
 In the 20th century Erwin Panofsky was instrumental in furthering Christus ' reputation as a major 15th @-@ century northern painter , described the work as an " enchanting , almost French @-@ looking portrait " , perhaps noting the resemblance to the virgin in Jean Fouquet 's Melun Diptych . Sterling picks up on this , noting the many similarities between the two women , including their tightly pulled @-@ back hair , high cheek bones , slanted eyes and sulky expressions . 
 The portrait entered the Prussian royal collection with the purchase in 1821 of the Edward Solly collection , from which the then @-@ recently formed Gemäldegalerie , Berlin , was allowed to take its pick . It was positively identified in 1825 as an original by Christus when Waagen identified the lettering on the ( now lost ) frame " <unk> <unk> " as shorthand for " Petrus <unk> " , which he associated with the " Pietro Christa " mentioned by Giorgio Vasari in the 1568 edition of his " Lives of the Most Excellent Painters , Sculptors , and Architects " . In this way , Waagen also identified Christus ' so @-@ called Saint Eligius panel , now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , New York ( and seen as just a portrait of a goldsmith ) , marking the painter 's rediscovery after centuries of obscurity . 
 Before this identification , a number of his paintings had been attributed to Jan van Eyck , but became identified with Christus after Waagen established him as a distinct and separate master . Christus is known to have signed six extant works , sometimes with the text " <unk> <unk> ME FECIT " ( Petr <unk> made me ) . Over the next century sketches of Christus ' biography were constructed , as art historians – notably Panofsky – slowly disentangled his works from those of van Eyck . 
 = = Dating = = 
 The painting was dated c . 1446 by Wolfgang Schöne in the 1930s , mainly by matching the style and fashion of her clothing to contemporary trends . In the early 20th century the dating and authorship of works then attributed to Christus were challenged . Max Friedländer proposed a number of dates and an ordering of works in the 1957 volume of his Early Netherlandish painting , but many of his assumptions were discounted by Otto Pächt just a few years later . 
 In 1953 , Erwin Panofsky established that Schöne 's dating was at least twenty years too early . In his view , the girl 's dress resembles Burgundian high fashion of the late 1460s to mid @-@ 1470s . He compared the hennin worn by Maria Portinari in a c . 1470 portrait by Hans Memling , and her gown to that worn by a lady in an illumination from around the 1470s Froissart of Louis of <unk> of Bruges . Sterling , placing the work as c . 1465 , remarks that the hennin in the Berlin panel is of a different type to that of the New York painting . The New York headdress is far more extended , and seems to be of a style prevalent a few years after , and moreover lacks the draped and hanging veil . Sterling further notes that the panel has increased depth of field and more intricate detailing of light than Christus ' earlier works . On this basis he believes the work was executed late in the artist 's career . 
 = Thomas of Bayeux = 
 Thomas of Bayeux ( died 18 November 1100 ) was Archbishop of York from 1070 until 1100 . He was educated at Liège and became a royal chaplain to Duke William of Normandy , who later became King William I of England . After the Norman Conquest , the king nominated Thomas to succeed Ealdred as Archbishop of York . After Thomas ' election , Lanfranc , Archbishop of Canterbury , demanded an oath from Thomas to obey him and any future Archbishops of Canterbury ; this was part of Lanfranc 's claim that Canterbury was the primary bishopric , and its holder the head of the English Church . Thomas countered that York had never made such an oath . As a result , Lanfranc refused to consecrate him . The King eventually persuaded Thomas to submit , but Thomas and Lanfranc continued to clash over ecclesiastical issues , including the primacy of Canterbury , which dioceses belonged to the province of York , and the question of how York 's obedience to Canterbury would be expressed . 
 After King William I 's death Thomas served his successor , William II , and helped to put down a rebellion led by Thomas ' old mentor Odo of Bayeux . Thomas also attended the trial for rebellion of the Bishop of Durham , William de St @-@ Calais , Thomas ' sole suffragan , or bishop subordinate to York . During William II 's reign Thomas once more became involved in the dispute with Canterbury over the primacy when he refused to consecrate the new Archbishop of Canterbury , Anselm , if Anselm was named the Primate of England in the consecration service . After William II 's sudden death in 1100 , Thomas arrived too late to crown King Henry I , and died soon after the coronation . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Thomas is sometimes referred to as Thomas I to distinguish him from his nephew Thomas , who was also an Archbishop of York . The elder Thomas ' father was a priest named Osbert ; his mother was named Muriel , but little else of them is known . He had a brother named Samson , who was Bishop of Worcester from 1086 until 1112 . He was of Norman descent . Under the patronage of Odo , Bishop of Bayeux , both boys were sent to Liège for their education . Thomas may also have studied with Lanfranc in Normandy while the latter was teaching at the Abbey of Bec , and some scholars contend that he also studied in Germany and Spain . Thomas then returned to Normandy to become one of Bishop Odo 's officials and a chaplain , or secretary . He was a canon and the treasurer of Bayeux Cathedral as well as a member of Duke William 's ducal clergy before the Norman Conquest of England . The new King named him a royal clerk after the Battle of Hastings . 
 = = Archbishop under William I = = 
 Thomas succeeded Ealdred as Archbishop of York in 1070 ; he was nominated on 23 May and was probably consecrated on 25 December . The appointment of Thomas was a departure for the King , who had usually promoted Norman nobles or monks when he was still Duke of Normandy . The appointment was more consistent with English norms , as most of those appointed to the English episcopate before the Conquest had previously been royal clerks . 
 Shortly after Thomas ' election , Lanfranc , pursuing a claim that Canterbury was the primatial see , or bishopric , of England , demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury . Thomas declined to make such a written promise , so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him . Thomas argued that Lanfranc 's demand was unprecedented , as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before . King William wanted clear lines of authority in the church to match the lines of authority in the secular sphere ; thus , the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute . Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated , but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury . Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc , it was the beginning of the long @-@ running Canterbury – York dispute over the claims of Canterbury to have jurisdiction over York . 
 The next year both archbishops travelled to Rome for their <unk> , where Thomas took advantage of the opportunity to ask Pope Alexander II to decree that the sees of Canterbury and York were equal . Thomas also sought to have the pope declare that the midland sees of Worcester , Dorchester on Thames , and Lichfield – all south of the River Humber – were part of the Archdiocese of York rather than Canterbury . The 12th @-@ century chronicler Eadmer , a monk at Canterbury , wrote much later that Thomas had resigned and surrendered his archiepiscopal symbols , but they were promptly returned to him by Lanfranc on the pope 's orders . The story 's partisan source casts some doubt on its accuracy . 
 The pope referred the dispute to a council of English prelates , which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072 . The council decided that the Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River . This meant that the disputed bishoprics were taken from the province of York , an outcome that probably had the support of the King , who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England . By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans , William limited York 's power and separatist tendencies . The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury , the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England – such as the Danish king . However , the council of Windsor also ruled that York 's province included Scotland . Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc 's successors , the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury , and it did not bind Thomas ' successors . 
 All of these decisions were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year , witnessed by the King and the papal legate , or representative of the pope , as well as many bishops and abbots . Thomas then made a written profession of obedience , some time after late May . Lanfranc wrote to Alexander II , attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury 's primacy , but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued . Alexander died in 1073 . His successor , Pope Gregory VII , was opposed to the idea of <unk> , and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere . In 1073 , with the help of Wulfstan , Bishop of Worcester and Peter , Bishop of Chester , Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York 's authority in Scotland . Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas , especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest . 
 Thomas reorganised the cathedral chapter during his archiepiscopate , establishing a group of secular canons with individual prebends to provide the clergy with income . The cathedral chapter at York had until then lived in a group , but Thomas ' reforms allowed the clergy to live in their own houses . Thomas also set up a number of officials within the cathedral chapter , including a dean , treasurer , and precentor . He increased the number of clergy in the chapter , increasing it from the three he found at York when he took office , and reorganised the episcopal and chapter 's estates , giving a number of estates to the chapter . He introduced the continental system of archdeacons to the Diocese of York , dividing the diocese into territorial units and appointing an archdeacon to each . <unk> were responsible for aiding the bishop or archbishop with his episcopal duties , collecting revenues , and presiding over some judicial courts . 
 = = Rebuilding the cathedral = = 
 Shortly before Thomas ' appointment , York Minster , the cathedral of the archdiocese , was damaged in a fire that swept through York on 19 September 1069 , and which also destroyed the refectory and dormitory for the canons . Soon after his consecration , Thomas had a new dormitory and refectory built and a new roof put on the cathedral ; these appear to have been temporary measures however , as some time later , probably in about 1075 , he ordered the construction of a new cathedral on a different site . The new building , much larger than the one it replaced , has not survived . It was excavated between 1966 and 1973 , showing the plan of the cathedral to be different from most others built in England around that time . It was longer , had no aisles in the nave , and it had a rectangular ring crypt that had been long out of style in 1075 . Because of the way the foundations were laid out , it appears likely that the entire building was planned and built in one design phase , with few modifications . It may have been that Thomas designed his cathedral to be as unlike Canterbury Cathedral as possible , perhaps because of the conflict between York and Canterbury over primacy . William of Malmesbury , a 12th @-@ century writer , states that Thomas finished the cathedral , and this is corroborated by the fact that Thomas was buried in the minster in 1100 . Some elements of Thomas ' structure are still visible in the crypt of York Minster . 
 = = Serving William II = = 
 After the death of the Conqueror , Thomas was loyal to the third son , William Rufus , who had inherited England instead of the eldest brother , Robert Curthose . Thomas supported Rufus despite a rebellion led by his old mentor Odo of Bayeux , and the Archbishop accompanied the King on his campaigns to put down the revolt . Thomas attended the subsequent trial for rebellion in 1088 of William de St @-@ Calais , Bishop of Durham , who had sided with Odo . William was Thomas ' sole suffragan bishop , but it was Thomas who pronounced the sentence of the court . 
 In 1092 and again in 1093 the dispute with Canterbury resurfaced , when Thomas complained about what he felt were infringements of York 's rights . The first of these occasions was over the dedication of Remigius de Fécamp 's new cathedral at Lincoln and the second concerned the consecration of Anselm as Archbishop of Canterbury . Thomas refused to consecrate Anselm if the latter was referred to as Primate of England . The impasse was finally resolved by naming Anselm the Metropolitan of Canterbury . The medieval chronicler Eadmer , Anselm 's biographer and a Canterbury partisan , says that Anselm was consecrated as the primate . Hugh the Chanter , who was a member of the York community , stated that the metropolitan title was used . Modern historical opinion is divided , with Frank Barlow , author of The English Church 1066 – 1154 inclined towards the primatial title , but with Richard Southern , in his biography of Anselm , leaning towards the metropolitan title . The whole affair is probably subject to much duplicity and dishonesty , with both sides presenting biased accounts . 
 Herbert de Losinga was appointed a papal legate in 1093 by Pope Urban II to investigate the matter of Thomas ' profession of obedience to Lanfranc . Herbert seems to have done nothing about investigating the issue . Also in 1093 , King William II gave the Archbishops of York the right to appoint the Abbot of Selby Abbey in compensation for the loss of York 's claim to the Diocese of Lincoln . While Anselm was in exile after quarrelling with the King in 1097 , Thomas consecrated Herbert de Losinga as Bishop of Norwich , Ralph de Luffa to the See of Chichester , and Hervey le Breton as Bishop of Bangor , an unusual step because these dioceses were in Canterbury 's province , and it was Anselm 's right to consecrate the new bishops . In 1100 after the sudden death of King William II and the seizure of power by the King 's younger brother Henry , Thomas arrived in London too late to crown Henry I , as the ceremony had already been performed by Maurice , Bishop of London , in the absence of both archbishops . Anselm at this time was still in exile . Thomas was initially angry at the slight , until it was explained to him that the King had worried over the chance of disorder in the kingdom if there was a delay . To mollify him , Thomas was allowed to crown the King publicly at a church council held soon after the coronation . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Thomas died at York on 18 November 1100 . He was considered to have been an excellent archbishop , and ensured his cathedral clergy was well cared for . He repaired the cathedral and did much to promote trade in the city of York . Thomas also helped to advance the careers of his family ; one of his nephews , Thomas II of York , became Archbishop of York in 1108 , and another , Richard , became Bishop of Bayeux in 1107 . 
 During his lifetime , Thomas was praised for his learning , his encouragement of education in his diocese , and his generosity . He was an excellent singer and composed hymns . In his youth , he was known for having a sturdy build , and in his old age he had a ruddy complexion and snow white hair . 
 Thomas composed the epitaph placed on William the Conqueror 's tomb in St. Etienne in Caen , but the chronicler Orderic Vitalis felt that Thomas was chosen more for his rank than for his skill in composition . Thomas did not concern himself with the church – state issues surrounding the Investiture Crisis , but he was tenacious in defending the independence of York against the efforts of Canterbury to assert primacy over the whole of England . Later authors , including William of Malmesbury and Hugh the <unk> , praised Thomas for his generosity , chastity , elegance , and charm . 
 = Póvoa de Varzim = 
 Póvoa de Varzim ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] , locally [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ) , also spelled <unk> de Varzim , is a Portuguese city in Northern Portugal and sub @-@ region of Greater Porto . It sits in a sandy coastal plain , a cuspate foreland , halfway between the Minho and Douro rivers . The population of the municipality was 63 @,@ 408 at the time of the 2011 census . According to the 2001 census , there were 63 @,@ 470 inhabitants , with 42 @,@ 396 living in the city proper . The city expanded , southwards , to Vila do Conde , and there are about 100 @,@ 000 inhabitants in the urban area alone . It is the seventh @-@ largest urban agglomeration in Portugal and the third largest in Northern Portugal . 
 Permanent settlement in Póvoa de Varzim dates back to around four to six thousand years ago ; around 900 BC , unrest in the region led to the establishment of Cividade de Terroso , a fortified city , which developed maritime trade routes with the civilizations of classical antiquity . Modern Póvoa de Varzim emerged after the conquest by the Roman Republic of the city by 138 BC , fishing and fish processing units soon developed , which turned out to be the foundations of the local economy . By the 11th century , the fish industry and fertile farmlands were the economic base of a feudal lordship and Varzim was fiercely disputed between the local overlords and the early Portuguese kings , which resulted in the establishment of the present day 's municipality in 1308 and being subdued to monastic power some years later . Póvoa de Varzim 's importance reemerged with the Age of Discovery due to its shipbuilders and merchants proficiency and wealth , who traded around the globe in complex trade routes . By the 17th century , the fish processing industry rebounded and , some time later , Póvoa became the dominant fishing port in northern Portugal . 
 Póvoa de Varzim has been a well @-@ known beach resort for over three centuries , the most popular in Northern Portugal , which unfolded an influential literary culture and artistic patronage in music and theater . Póvoa de Varzim is one of the few legal gambling areas in Portugal , and has significant textile and food industries . The town has retained a distinct cultural identity and ancient customs such as the writing system of siglas poveiras , the <unk> farming technique and festivals .

 = = = Castro Culture and Roman conquest = = = 
 Discoveries of Acheulean stone tools suggest Póvoa de Varzim has been inhabited since the Lower Palaeolithic , around 200 @,@ 000 BC . The first groups of shepherds settled on the coast where Póvoa de Varzim is now located between the 4th millennium and early 2nd millennium BC . A Neolithic @-@ <unk> necropolis , with seven known burial mounds , can still be seen around São Félix Hill and Cividade Hill . 
 Widespread pillaging by rival and migrant tribes led the resident populations of the coastal plain of Póvoa de Varzim to raise a town atop the hill that stood next to the sea . The acropolis protection was reinforced by successive rings of walls and a trench at the base of the hill . Established by the 9th or 8th century B.C. , the city area covered 12 @,@ 000 m2 ( 3 @.@ 0 acres ) and had several hundred inhabitants . Its location near waterways helped it to maintain commercial relations with the Mediterranean civilizations , especially noticeable during the Carthaginian dominion of the southern Iberian Peninsula . 
 During the Punic Wars , the Romans became aware of the Castro region 's rich deposits of gold and tin . Viriathus , leading Lusitanian troops , hindered the expansion of the Roman Republic north of the river Douro . His murder in 138 BC opened the way for the Roman legions . Over the following two years , Decimus Junius Brutus advanced into the Castro region from south of the Douro , crushed the Castro armies , and left Cividade de Terroso , in ruins . 
 The region was pacified during the reign of Caesar Augustus and the Castro people returned to the coastal plain , where Villa Euracini and Roman fish factories were built . With the annexation by the Roman Republic , trading supported regional economic development , with Roman merchants organized in true commercial companies who looked for monopoly in commercial relations . 
 = = = Feudalism and <unk> = = = 
 With the fall of the Roman Empire , Suebi populations established themselves in the countryside . It was first mentioned on March 26 , 953 during the rule of <unk> Dias , Countess of Portugal . The region was attacked by the Vikings in the 960s , by the Moors in 997 and again by Norman pirates in 1015 @-@ 1016 . Hints indicate a Norse settlement in Villa Euracini after those invasions . During the Middle Ages , the name Euracini evolved to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and , eventually , Varzim . 
 In 1033 , <unk> Pelayo , a leading captain of the Reconquista for the County of Portugal , was recognized by <unk> , Emperor in <unk> , as the Lord of Varzim , during the <unk> epoch following <unk> 's attack on the Christian realms . Henry , the Portuguese count , recognized his rule over the port of Varzim amongst several other possessions . Varzim overlords gained significant power and , when Portugal was already a stable kingdom , Sancho I of Portugal attacked the fief and seized the port , destroyed most of the properties and expelled the farmers . The northern area became known as Varzim dos <unk> ( Knights ' Varzim ) and belonged to the military order of the Knights Hospitaller , who inherited the wealth of the local overlords . Lower Varzim , the royal southern land , was the location of the port and contiguous farmlands . 
 According to a 1258 chronic , while Sancho II of Portugal was disputing the throne with his brother , Afonso , who was invited by the knights to take over the Portuguese throne , <unk> of Varzim used the opportunity to destroy the king 's assets in Lower Varzim . He violently entered in the king 's lands , destroyed it significantly , in such a way that no bread could be sowed , nor a car could cross that place as it often used to do . Sancho II was overthrown , Afonso became king and ordered the resettlement of the royal land and king 's chronicler explicitly stated that all the port was property of the king . 
 Gomes Lourenço , of the Honour of Varzim , was a very influential knight and godfather of King Denis . He took advantage of his relationship with important people in the kingdom in order to get the recognition of the seaport , located in Lower Varzim , as his honour . He tried to convince King Denis , that the king 's father , Afonso , took it from him unfairly . Justifying the attitude with the Honour of Varzim , Gomes and his descendants went to the port to get the tribute from the fishermen . 
 In 1308 , King Denis granted a charter , the <unk> , giving the royal land to 54 families of Varzim ; these had to found a municipality known as Póvoa around Praça Velha , siding Varzim Old Town , controlled by the knights . In 1312 , King Denis donated Póvoa to his bastard son , Afonso Sanches , Lord of Albuquerque , who included it in the patrimony of the Monastery of Santa Clara , which he had just founded in Vila do Conde . In 1367 , King Ferdinand I confirmed the charters , privileges and uses of Póvoa de Varzim . These were again confirmed by John I in 1387 . But the domain of the monastery over the town grew stronger and the people asked King Manuel I to end the situation . In 1514 , during the era of charter reform , the King granted a new charter to Póvoa de Varzim . Besides the town hall and square , the town gained a pillory , granted significant self @-@ government , and involved itself in the Portuguese discoveries . 
 = = = Shipbuilders , seafarers and fishermen = = = 
 In the 16th century , the fishermen started to work in maritime activities , as pilots or seafarers in the crew of the Portuguese ships , due to their high nautical knowledge . The fishermen of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since , at least , 1506 . During the reign of John III the Povoan <unk> art was already renowned , and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon 's Ribeira das <unk> shipyard due to their high technical skills . The single floored houses dominated the town 's landscape , but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture . The seafarers ' social class , well @-@ off gentlemen , was associated with this richer architecture around Praça Velha square . 
 In the 17th century , the shipbuilding industry boomed in Ribeira , area around Póvoa Fortress in the sheltered bay , and one third of the population had some relation with this activity , building ships for the merchant navigation . During this period there was a relevant urban expansion : the Praça civic center with the town hall and the Madre Deus Chapel , the area of the old town where the Main church was located and the fishermen neighborhood of Junqueira was starting its affirmation as a new urban center . 
 In the beginning of the 18th century , there was a decline in the Ribeira shipyard activities , due to the <unk> of the Portuguese coast and the Povoan shipyard started to work in the construction of fishing vessels . There was a significant increase of the fisher community in the middle of the century , becoming the main activity , and during the reign of Joseph I with the country in the middle of an economic crisis , Póvoa started a rapid development . The Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon noticed their overwhelming notoriety in the Minho coast and considered <unk> to be the most expert fishermen from Cape St. Vincent to <unk> , with a sizable number of fishermen , ships and high sea fishing . The result was a very considerable quantity of caught fish . 
 The community became wealthier and , following a royal provision by Queen Mary I in 1791 , the inspector general Almada reorganized the town 's layout , a new civic center with a monumental city hall , streets and infrastructure were built , all of which provided potential for a new business — sea baths .

 Since 1725 , the iodine @-@ rich <unk> of Póvoa , due to the peculiar high quantities of seaweed that ends up in Póvoa beaches from the sheltered bay to Cape Santo André , brought by ocean currents , lead that Benedictine monks choose to take sea @-@ baths in there , searching cures for skin and bone problems . Still in the 18th century , other people went to Póvoa with the same concerns . In the 19th century , the town became popular as a summer destination for the wealthy of Entre @-@ Douro @-@ e @-@ Minho province and Portuguese Brazilians , due to its large sandy beaches and the development of theaters , hotels and casinos . It then became renowned for its refined literary culture , artistic patronage in music and theater , and intellectual <unk> . 
 On February 27 , 1892 , a shipwreck had critical impact in community . Seven <unk> poveiras wrecked in a storm and 105 fishermen were killed , just metres off the shore . Over @-@ fishing by steamboats created severe social problems and fishermen emigration . The fishing industry lost much of its importance . Meanwhile , Póvoa developed into the most popular holiday destination in northern Portugal , The textile and food industries thrived . Streetcars appeared in 1874 and endured until the first years of the 20th century . The rail connection to Porto opened in 1875 and to inland Minho region in 1878 . National highways linking the city to Barcelos , Famalicão and Viana do Castelo opened . The first urbanization project for the waterfront was drafted in 1891 . All these events led to a major growth between the 1930s and 1960s . 
 Póvoa de Varzim developed a cosmopolitan style and became a service @-@ sector city . It is one of northern Portugal 's main urban centres . Póvoa is the focal point of a larger area , which includes Vila do Conde and Esposende .

 Occupying an area of 82 @.@ 1 km2 ( 31 @.@ 7 sq mi ) , Póvoa de Varzim lies between the <unk> and Ave rivers , or , from a wider perspective , halfway between the Minho and Douro rivers on the northern coast of Portugal — the Costa Verde .

To the west , it has a shoreline on the Atlantic Ocean . 
 The rocky cliffs , common features downstream of the Minho 's estuary , disappear in Póvoa de Varzim , giving way to a coastal plain . The plain is located in a cuspate foreland , an old marine plateau , conferring a sandy soil to the coastal lands , and forming sand dunes , currently preserved only in northern Aguçadoura . Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André , the tip of the cuspate foreland and the Avarus Promontory , referred to by Ptolemy . 
 São Félix Hill ( 202 m or 663 ft ) and Cividade Hill ( 155 m or 509 ft ) rise above the landscape . Despite their modest rise , the expanse of the plain makes them easy reference points on the horizon . The mountain chain known as Serra de Rates divides the municipality in two distinctive areas : the coastal plain and hills where the forests become more abundant and the soils have less sea influence . In this landscape dominated by the plain and low hills , only the hill of <unk> da <unk> ( 150 m or 490 ft ) in the interior , is easily recognizable . 
 The municipality has no large rivers , but abundant small water streams exist . Some of these courses are permanent , such as the Este River , which feeds into the Ave . The source of the <unk> Stream is located at the base of Cividade Hill and empties at the beach of Aver @-@ o @-@ Mar , while the Alto River 's source is at the base of São Félix and reaches the Atlantic at Rio Alto Beach . The land is well @-@ irrigated , springs and wells are very common , since underground water is often close to the surface . 
 The forest areas suffer from strong demographic pressure and intensive agriculture . Forests are still important in parishes surrounded by the Serra de Rates , whose flora is distinguished by the pedunculate oak or the european holly . In the 18th century , the monks of <unk> planted pines , which characterized the civil parish of Estela . In the past the Atlantic forest predominated , with trees such as oaks , ash trees , hazels , strawberry trees , holm oak , and alders . The rocks throughout the entire coastline are home to large populations of clams , fish and seaweed . These rocks and the dunes form rich ecosystems , but are threatened by holiday @-@ makers , dune sports and waterfront construction . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Póvoa 's climate is classified as Mediterranean climate ( Csb in the Köppen climate classification system ) , with gentle summers and mild winters , influenced by the Atlantic ocean . Average temperatures oscillate between 12 @.@ 5 and 15 ° C ( 54 @.@ 5 and 59 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Temperature extremes recorded at Sá Carneiro Airport , records started in 1967 , range from − 3 @.@ 8 ° C ( 25 @.@ 2 ° F ) to 38 @.@ 3 ° C ( 100 @.@ 9 ° F ) . Between 1971 and 2000 , on average there were 4 @.@ 2 days a year below 0 ° C ( 32 @.@ 0 ° F ) and 10 @.@ 1 days a year above 30 ° C ( 86 @.@ 0 ° F ) . The city possesses a microclimate and is considered the region least subject to frosts in all northern Portugal , and very uncommon snowfall , due to the winter winds that normally blow from the south and southwest . 
 Most of the rain is concentrated in the winter months , due to the Azores High which influences the subsidence of the air resulting in very dry air during the summer . Topography and distance from the sea influences precipitation even at short distances . The urban area receives between 900 millimetres ( 35 in ) and 1 @,@ 200 millimetres ( 47 in ) of rain per year , while the city 's countryside can get up to 1 @,@ 500 millimetres ( 59 in ) . The prevailing northern winds , known as <unk> , arise in the summer after midday . During its dry summer , a mass of hot and wet air , brought by the south and western maritime winds , creates the city 's characteristic fog covering only the coast , which often dissipates with the afternoon sun .

 A native of Póvoa de Varzim is called a Poveiro which can be rendered into English as Povoan . According to the 2001 Census , there were 63 @,@ 470 inhabitants that year , 38 848 ( 61 @.@ 2 % ) of whom lived in the city . The number goes up to 100 @,@ 000 if adjacent satellite areas are taken into account , ranking it as the seventh largest independent urban area in Portugal , within a polycentric agglomeration of about 3 million people , ranging from Braga to Porto . 
 The urban area has a population density of 3035 / km2 ( 7 @,@ 864 / mi ² ) , while the rural and suburban areas have a density of 355 @.@ 5 / km2 ( 920 / mi ² ) . The rural areas away from the city tend to be scarcely populated , becoming denser near it . During the summer the resident population in the city triples ; this seasonal movement from neighbouring cities is due to the draw of the beach and 29 @.@ 9 % of homes had seasonal use in 2001 , the highest in Greater Porto . Póvoa de Varzim is the youngest city in the region with a birth rate of 13 @.@ 665 and mortality rate of 8 @.@ 330 . Unlike other urban areas of greater Porto , it is not a satellite city . Significant commuting occurs only with Vila do Conde , an urban expansion area of Póvoa since the 18th century . 
 For centuries a fishing community of mostly Norman origin , where ethnic isolationism was a common practice , Póvoa de Varzim is today a cosmopolitan town , with people originating from the Ave Valley who settled in the coastal Northern districts during the 20th century , the ancient immigration from Galicia , Portuguese @-@ Africans ( who arrived in significant numbers after the independence of Angola and Mozambique ) in the late 1970s and people of diverse nationalities , the biggest immigrant communities are Ukrainians , Brazilians , Chinese , Russians , and Angolans . 
 The population of the entire municipality grew only 1 % between 1981 and 1991 , then increased by 15 @.@ 3 % between 1991 and 2001 . During that period , the urban population had grown 23 % , with the number of families increasing considerably — by about 44 @.@ 5 % . In 2005 Expresso considered it as the most developed in Porto district and Primeiro de Janeiro as the " city of future " in the Porto district , the quality of living , the infrastructure development such as the light rail metro and a 15 minutes distance from Porto and Braga , prompted new residents originating from near @-@ by cities such as Guimarães , Famalicão , Braga and Porto which led to a real estate development that may double the resident population in the medium term . 
 Due to the practice of endogamy and the caste system , Póvoa 's fishing community maintained local ethnic characteristics . Anthropological and cultural data indicate Nordic fishermen settling during the period of the coast 's resettlement . In As <unk> de Portugal ( Beaches of Portugal , 1876 ) , Ramalho <unk> wrote that the Povoan fishermen were a " race " in the Portuguese coast ; entirely different from the Mediterranean type of <unk> and <unk> , Poveiro is of " Saxon " type . On the other hand , the man from the interior was a farmer with Galician character ( Paleo and <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . In a 1908 research , anthropologist Fonseca Cardoso considered that Poveiros were the result of a mixture of Phoenicians , Teutons , Jews and , mostly , Normans . In the book The Races of Europe ( 1938 ) , Poveiros were distinguished by having a greater than usual degree of <unk> , broad faces of unknown origin , and broad jaws . 
 Poveiros have migrated to other places and this attenuated the population growth . One should notice that the Poveiros tended to create their own associations abroad , there are Casa dos Poveiros ( Poveiros House ) in Brazil ( Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo ) , <unk> in South Africa and Toronto in Canada . In Rio de Janeiro , the community was known by not wanting other peoples of other origins , including Portuguese born in other regions , within their community . In 1920 , many Poveiros emigrated in Brazil returned , as many refused to lose Portuguese nationality . The governor of Angola , with an ambition to develop fisheries , suggested the creation of a Povoan colony in Porto Alexandre . Due to fisher classes affairs , the fisher areas of Vila do Conde , Esposende and Matosinhos have strong Povoan cultural influence and half of the population of Vila do Conde and Matosinhos are of Povoan descent . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of Póvoa de Varzim is driven by tourism ( namely gambling , hotels and restaurants ) , manufacturing , construction , fishing , and agro @-@ business . During the 2001 census , 1770 companies are headquartered in Póvoa de Varzim , of which 2 @.@ 82 % were of the primary sector , 33 @.@ 73 % of the secondary and 63 @.@ 45 % of the tertiary . Despite its weight in Greater Porto international trade is weak , in 2004 it represented 1 @.@ 1 % of departures and 0 @.@ 9 % of arrivals , its coverage rate of arrivals against departures suppressed the 100 % mark . The activity rate had grown from 48 % to 51 @.@ 1 % from 1991 to 2001 , but there were <unk> citizens unemployed in June 2006 . 
 Póvoa de Varzim has been noted internationally for its Renewable energy industry . The world 's first commercial wave farm was located in its coast , at the <unk> Wave Park . The wave farm used Pelamis P @-@ 750 machines . The project failed and was replaced by the <unk> project , a new <unk> on offshore wind farms , from a distinct company , that is still operating . Energie , a company headquartered in Póvoa de Varzim , developed a thermodynamic solar system combining solar energy and a heat pump to generate energy . 
 The fact that it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim 's economy : the fishing industry , from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city 's fish market , beach agriculture , seaweed @-@ gathering for fertilizing fields , and tourism are the result of its geography . Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa 's economy these days , as fisheries have lost importance . Nevertheless , the mean value of fish landed in 2004 , in its seaport , was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels ' capacity . Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average . A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production , 80 to 85 % , is exported and deals with high @-@ end brands in canned fish , for MDC markets such as Japan , the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Italy , Scandinavia , Austria , Singapore and Australia . Export market brands include : Poveira , D 'Henry IV , Ala @-@ Arriba , Minerva , and Alva . 
 Monte Adriano , the seventh largest construction company in Portugal , and the joint venture between the Royal <unk> <unk> and <unk> & <unk> , producer of deepwater mooring systems , are two large companies based in the city . The manufacturing industry is an important employer , mostly in the textile industry that has low productivity and income . These industries are located out of the city in Beiriz , <unk> , and Rates . Other employers include the blanket handicraft industry of Terroso and Laundos , and the wood industries of Rates . One of the initiatives of the municipality is the Parque Industrial de Laundos ( Industrial Park of Laundos ) , in the city 's outskirts , next to the A28 Motorway . 
 In the coast , the <unk> farm fields were developed . This technique increases agricultural yields by using large , rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes , with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression . Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south , east and west , and trees and reeds on the northern slope act as a windbreak against the prevailing northern wind . Garden crops are grown in the central depression . Póvoa de Varzim is part of the ancient <unk> Verde winemaking region . Production is still specialized in horticultural goods , but most of the <unk> were substituted by greenhouses and a significant share of the production is exported to other Western European markets . The inland valley region is committed to milk production and the Agros corporation headquarters of <unk> , the largest dairy products and milk producer company in the Iberian Peninsula , is located in Espaço Agros and has several departments such as exhibition park and laboratories , and the largest agricultural project in northern Portugal . 
 = = Government = = 
 Póvoa de Varzim is governed by a Câmara Municipal ( City Council ) composed of nine councilmen . A Municipal Assembly exists and it is the legislative body of the municipality . 
 After the first free elections , with the end of the Estado Novo period , only right @-@ wing parties have governed the city : the city council was governed by the CDS between 1976 and 1989 and since then by the PSD . The CDS saw its popularity suffer an abrupt decline in 1997 , and has since then been the third political party . On the other hand , the PSD in the same year achieved its first absolute majority with 62 @.@ 4 % of the votes . After the 2013 municipal elections , five councilmen were members of the centre @-@ right Partido Social <unk> ( PSD ) , three of the centre @-@ left Partido Socialista ( PS ) and one of the right @-@ wing Centro Democrático e Social - Partido Popular ( CDS @-@ PP ) . The mayor is Aires Pereira , for the PSD , elected with 46 @.@ 01 % of the votes . The PSD holds the majority of public offices both in the Municipal Assembly and in the administrative parishes . Póvoa de Varzim Assembly is singly elected and comprises 27 members , with the PSD holding 14 seats , the PS 8 , the CDS 4 and the left @-@ wing CDU , 1 . 
 Póvoa de Varzim is the northernmost municipality in the Porto Metropolitan Area , about 27 km ( 17 mi ) north of Porto . However , it is not a Porto 's Commuter town . Póvoa de Varzim is also part of the Association of Municipalities of the Ave Valley , along with neighbouring cities such as Vila do Conde , Guimarães , and Famalicão , with which it has the most important modern demographic links . 
 Since the establishment of the County of Portugal around 1095 , Varzim was an administrative and military unit that stretched from the sea to Cividade de Terroso and São Félix Hills . Póvoa de Varzim was established as a municipality in 1308 with the election of a town hall judge and boundary exemption . As the town achieved broad self @-@ government in the 16th century , restricted borders were created , which split the town itself and since disputed by the town hall . Over time , these were expanded to approach the medieval lordship boundaries . However , <unk> and <unk> da Barca , south expansion areas of Póvoa de Varzim in the 18th and 19th centuries with fisher populations from Póvoa , are administrated by Vila do Conde , in spite of the centuries @-@ old requests of Póvoa de Varzim for these to be incorporated in its municipality . Inland , the parishes of Rio Mau , <unk> , and Arcos are also historically disputed . 
 The origin of the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown , but it certainly has local traits and symbolism . The coat of arms consists of a golden sun and a silver moon ; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms , representing safety at sea . Over the cross , a ring , of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms , representing faith and divine protection . The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status . The flag is broken in blue and white . Between 1939 and 1958 , a different coat of Arms and flag were used , which the population criticized ; it consisted of a golden shield , covered by a red net , the sea and a black Poveiro boat ; the flag was plain red . The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored .

 Located in the coastal plain between the sea and hills , the city of Póvoa de Varzim has eleven Partes ( parts ) , or districts . These districts are , in turn , part of two formal administrative structures known as freguesias ( civil parishes ) : <unk> Póvoa de Varzim , Beiriz e Argivai and <unk> Aver @-@ o @-@ Mar , Amorim e Terroso . To the south , the city is extending out to combine with Vila do Conde . 
 The city started from an inland town that extended to the coast . The Bairro da Matriz , whose nucleus was the centre from whence the city grew , is intersected by 14th century narrow and twisted streets lined by single family homes . The historical district has old buildings such as the sixteenth @-@ century house in front of Matriz Church — the main church , the old Town Hall ( 14th century ) , the seventeenth century Solar dos <unk> and house of Captain Leite Ferreira , and the eighteenth century Limas and the <unk> Houses . The fishermen were grouped in the south coast , around Póvoa Cove ( <unk> da Póvoa ) ; The fisher district was already developed in the 18th century with its structure of narrow streets parallel to the coast . 
 Póvoa de Varzim City Centre or Centro is dominated by the service sector and by the shopping streets of Junqueira and Mousinho de Albuquerque Avenue . Praça do Almada , the central square , is tipped by City Hall , municipal departments , banks and other services . In the middle of the square , to the west , the Manueline pillory of Póvoa de Varzim stands . The Pelourinho , granted to the town in 1514 , is a national monument representing the municipal emancipation of Póvoa de Varzim . 
 Bairro Norte , the beach district , is north of town and is densely occupied . Continuous to this area , the Agro @-@ <unk> beach district , mostly known as Nova Póvoa , is the area of the city with most high @-@ rises , the largest of which the Nova Póvoa , with 30 floors and 95 metres ( 312 ft ) high , complete in 1979 , was the tallest building in Portugal until the year 2000 and is still today one of the five tallest buildings . Close at hand , Barreiros and Parque da Cidade are districts from the latest expansion . 
 Inland , <unk> , derived from the old village of <unk> that , with Argivai , formed the main nucleus of the settlement before the 14th century , and whose <unk> ( farmers ) set up " Póvoa " in the coast . Argivai is divided by the Santa Clara Aqueduct , the second largest aqueduct in Portugal , construction started in 1626 . The old areas of <unk> , Regufe , <unk> , and <unk> have modest development , possess different topologies and are residential with small central areas . The Regufe Quarter has as symbol the Regufe Lighthouse , a sample from the 19th century iron art . Aver @-@ o @-@ mar is the northernmost urban coastal district and also of residential nature , with the exception of Santo André also known as <unk> , which keeps an untouched fishing character recognized by family homes that have grown up in a spontaneous way . 
 Of the diverse religious buildings the 18th century Baroque churches are prominent : the Matriz Church , the Senhora das <unk> Church and its six chapels , and the fishermen Lapa Church , with its curious Lapa Lighthouse . On the other hand , Misericórdia Church and Coração de Jesus Basilica denote the preference for the Neoclassical style in the end of the 19th century . The Romanesque revival style can be seen in São José de <unk> . 
 = = = Beaches and parks = = = 
 Póvoa de Varzim 's beach is a 12 km , or 7 @.@ 5 mi ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) , stretch , forming sheltered bays and divided by rocks , rich in iodine . Most beaches in the city are family @-@ oriented such as Redonda , Salgueira or Lagoa Beach and during the summer period it can get crowded while those away from the city core , such as Santo André , are less crowded . Salgueira and Aguçadoura are surfing beaches . Located near a camping park , Rio Alto Beach is chosen by naturists given its difficult access and the privacy offered by the sand dunes . 
 The Póvoa de Varzim City Park is almost entirely landscaped and includes hills , an island , small ponds , a stream , and a lake shaped by man . It has great lawn areas , rustic buildings and amphitheatres . It is a popular place for jogging , cycling and birdwatching . It stretches from the A28 freeway to Pedreira Lake . 
 Espaço Agros is a private @-@ sponsored park with 22 hectare in the former Anjo woodland that kept the essential rural values of the location , with some landscaping and environmental improvements , such as a lake . Damaged by the construction of high speed roads , the woodland is expected to get a further 5 @.@ 2 hectare public parkland . 
 São Félix Hill ( Monte São Félix ) , with iconic panoramic views over the city and the countryside , is a religious and forested hill that has the Senhora da Saúde Sanctuary at the foot of the hill and São Félix church at the summit .

 The culture of Póvoa de Varzim derives from different working classes and with influences arriving from the maritime route from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean . The docudrama film Ala @-@ Arriba ! by José Leitão de Barros , popularized this unique Portuguese fishing community within the country during the 1940s . The local expression ala @-@ <unk> means " go upwards " and it represents the co @-@ operation between the inhabitants . 
 <unk> <unk> are a form of proto @-@ writing system , with a restricted number of symbols that were combined to form more complex symbols ; these were used as a rudimentary visual communication system , and as a signature to mark belongings . Merchants wrote them in their books of credit ; fishermen used it in religious rituals by marking them in the door of Catholic chapels near hills or beaches ; in the table of the church during marriage and in their tombstone ; and also had magical significance , such as the São <unk> sigla , that could be used as a protecting symbol and not as family mark . Children used the same family mark with piques as a form of cadency . The youngest son would not have any pique and would inherit his father 's symbol . The siglas are still used , though much less commonly , by some families ; and are related with Viking traditions . 
 The Poveiro is a specific genre of boat characterized by a wide flat @-@ bottom and a deep helm . There were diverse boats with different sizes , uses and shapes . The most notable of which , the <unk> Poveira , was believed to be derived from the Drakkar Viking , but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail . Each boat carried carvings , namely a sigla <unk> mark for boat identification and magical @-@ religious protection at sea . According to a tradition that persists to this day , the youngest son is the heir of the family , as in old Brittany and Denmark , because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old . Women govern the family , because men were usually away from home fishing . 
 The <unk> is the traditional dress of the fishermen of Póvoa de Varzim . The <unk> Poveira are pullovers , part of the dress , that have fishery motifs in white , black and red , with the name of the owner embroidered in siglas poveiras . Other dresses include the urban <unk> <unk> for women and children 's <unk> caps . Handicrafts include the <unk> de Beiriz rustic carpets . 
 Formerly , the population was divided into different " castes " , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> which were stratified depending on their Poveiro boat and fisheries caught . Apart from them , the <unk> ( the farmers ) and the <unk> and <unk> , who went to the sea searching for fertilizers . As a rule , the groups remained distinct , and mixed marriages between them were forbidden , mostly because of the isolationism of the fishermen . 
 São Félix Hill is a reference point for fishermen at sea and on the last Sunday of May , there is the Pilgrimage of Nossa Senhora da Saúde ( Our Lady of Good Health ) which covers a distance of 7 km ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) between the Matriz Church and the hill . In Cape Santo André there is the Saint 's Rock , which has a mark that the Povoan fishermen believe to be a footprint of Saint Andrew . The saint is seen as the " Boatman of Souls " , fishing the souls of those who drown in the sea after a shipwreck , and helped in fisheries and marriages . The procession to the cape occurs on the dawn of the last day of November , when groups of men and women , wearing black hoods and holding lamps , go to the chapel via the beach . On August 15 , the pinnacle of the fishermen 's Feast of the Assumption occurs in the seaport with carefully arranged boats and fireworks .

 The most traditional ingredients of the local cuisine are locally @-@ grown vegetables and fish . The fish used in the traditional cuisine are divided in two categories , the " poor " fish ( sardine , ray , mackerel , and others ) and the " wealthy " fish ( such as whiting , snook , and <unk> ) . The most famous local dish is <unk> à Poveira ( Poveira Whiting ) , whose main ingredients are , along with the fish that gives the name to the dish , potatoes , eggs and a boiled onion and tomato sauce . Other fishery dishes include the <unk> de <unk> ( sardine rice ) , <unk> de Peixe ( fish stew ) , <unk> <unk> à Poveiro ( Poveiro stuffed squids ) , <unk> de Marisco ( seafood rice ) and <unk> <unk> ( steamed spiny lobster ) . Shellfish and boiled <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> de bacalhau are popular snacks . Other dishes include <unk> Poveira , made with white beans and served with dry rice ( <unk> <unk> ) ; and <unk> Poveira made in long bread that first appeared in 1962 as fast food for holidaymakers . 
 Restaurants specializing in Portuguese barbecued chicken , seafood , <unk> , bacalhau can be found along the Estrada Nacional 13 road and other areas of the city .

The meeting occurs in the city pool complex belonging to Varzim Lazer , a municipal company that also runs other sports venues found north of the city : the tennis academy , the bullring , and the municipal pavilion . The other complex is property of Clube Desportivo da Póvoa , a club that is notorious , in the city , because it competes in several sports : rink hockey , volleyball , basketball , auto racing , and athletics . Other small clubs for other sports exist : Clube de <unk> da Póvoa de Varzim in Handball , Póvoa Futsal Club in Futsal and Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde united clubs exists for Baseball and American Football , Villas Vikings and Villas Titans , respectively . Beach volley and <unk> are more popular sports , and it was in Póvoa that <unk> was , for the first time , practiced in Portugal . 
 The marina , near the seaport , offers sea activities developed by the local yacht club - the Clube Naval <unk> . Costa Verde Trophy , linking Póvoa and Viana do Castelo , is one of the regattas organized by the club and Rally Portugal yacht racing is a sailing and sightseeing event along the west Iberian coast . 
 The Grande <unk> de São Pedro ( Saint Peter Grand Prix ) , which occurs in the city 's streets during the summer , is part of the national calendar of the Portuguese Athletics Federation .

 = = Education = = 
 Higher education has limited history and availability . The Superior School of Industrial Studies and Management ( <unk> ) , part of Porto Polytechnic , was founded in 1990 . The school was based in two campuses , one in Avenida <unk> de Albuquerque and another one in Vila do Conde , but it was united in a single campus in 2001 . The new campus has 31 @,@ 544 square metres ( 7 @.@ 795 acres ) and includes facilities such as an auditorium and research space . <unk> offers undergraduate and post @-@ graduate education . Academic choices are centered around industrial engineering , industrial design , biomedical engineering , management , human resources , accountancy , and corporate finance . 
 Póvoa de Varzim has public , denominational and independent schools in the city and outskirts . Public education in the municipality is provided by five school districts : <unk> Gonçalves , <unk> do Maio , Aver @-@ o @-@ Mar , Campo <unk> , and Rates . These school districts arrange kindergartens and schools to the 9th grade of different locales of the municipality and are headed by <unk> de <unk> Básica do 2 . ° e 3 . ° <unk> ( 6th to the 9th grade schools ) that give the name to each district . Private schools are primarily run by Catholic parishes or groups , but the Grande Colégio da Póvoa de Varzim and Campo Verde School of Agriculture are eminent independent schools and <unk> is a large facility and school for children with down syndrome . Colégio do Sagrado Coração de Jesus , where Agustina Bessa @-@ Luís studied and developed her writing style , reopened in the 2007 @-@ 2008 school year , planning to become a leading catholic school . 
 High schools ( 10th to the 12th grade ) are situated in the school section at Póvoa city centre : Escola Secundária Eça de Queirós and Escola Secundária Rocha Peixoto . The Colégio de Amorim is an independent school in the outskirts that also offers secondary education . Eça de Queirós was a lyceum created in 1904 that maintains its humanist outlook and Rocha Peixoto was a former industrial and commercial school created in 1924 . 
 The Rocha Peixoto Municipal Library , established in 1880 , on the 300th anniversary of the death of Luís de Camões was housed in the current building in 1991 . Small suburban library branches and Diana Bar Library are extension posts of the municipal library . A little more than one quarter of the population now has intermediate or superior level qualifications . The illiteracy level was 5 @.@ 9 percent in 2001 .

 The first healthcare structure , the Santa Casa da Misericórdia da Póvoa de Varzim ( Holy House of Mercy ) , opened in 1756 . The hospitals of the city are the São Pedro Pescador Hospital ( state @-@ run ) and <unk> Hospital ( private ) . The public hospital suffers from lack of bed spaces . Due to this , it underwent expansion works and there is an ongoing plan to build a modern hospital , in the border between the cities of Póvoa de Varzim and Vila do Conde , to serve the population of both municipalities . The Centro de Saúde da Póvoa de Varzim ( Health Centre ) is a public primary care building which has extensions in the main suburbs . 
 The Municipal Police of Póvoa de Varzim , one of the first to be established in the country , is an administrative police force that acts solely within the municipality and reports directly to the mayor . The Polícia de Segurança Pública ( PSP ) does the city policing , while the Guarda Nacional Republicana ( GNR ) is responsible for the countryside . Regarding crime , Póvoa de Varzim is considered by the Polícia de Segurança Pública as a " calm " zone in all categories of offense ; violent crime , in particular , is practically non @-@ existent . Mostly , crime consists of minor robberies to homes , stores , or from cars . 
 Póvoa is one of the twelve national sea borders controlled by the <unk> de <unk> e <unk> ( <unk> ) . The Escola <unk> dos Serviços , just east of the city by the A28 motorway , is the national headquarters for military administration instruction , with the Battalion of Military Administration , and , due to the reorganization of army services , the former Escola <unk> de <unk> Militar , from 2006 onwards it gained the material and transport services , thus increasing its range of functions and troop numbers . 
 = = = Transport = = = 
 Póvoa de Varzim is served by a transportation network that employs maritime , aerial and terrestrial travel . The terrestrial access infrastructure is composed of national motorways ( freeways ) , the national roads system , and light rail metro . These infrastructures and the airport , bus terminal , marina and harbour are daily used by commuters . 
 Public transportation within the city is provided by private @-@ owned companies . The Central de <unk> is a terminus for urban and long distance buses that provide mass transit in the surrounding region , namely the city 's countryside , Porto , Minho Region , and Galicia in Spain . Litoral Norte as a wholly urban transportation network with 5 lines , while Linhares has the oldest bus network operating in the city , now owned by Transdev . 
 The Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport ( <unk> , better known as Porto Airport ) is located 18 km ( 11 mi ) south of the city . It is one of the busiest international airports in Portugal and serves all Greater Porto . Póvoa Aerodrome , officially known as S. Miguel de Laundos , is small @-@ sized , with only 270 meters long for ultralight aviation and other small planes . 
 Line B of Porto Metro links Póvoa de Varzim to Porto and the airport with two services : a standard and a shuttle ( the Expresso ) ; through Verdes station , Metro trains link the city and the airport . The line operates on a former railway , which opened in 1875 and closed in 2002 to give way for the metro . The railway network was expanded and reached Famalicão in 1881 , it was closed entirely in 1995 and became a rail trail . 
 The city is connected by road on a north @-@ south axis from Valença , Viana do Castelo , and Esposende to Porto by the A28 motorway . It is also reached by the A7 ( from Guimarães and Vila Nova de Famalicão ) and A11 ( from Braga and Barcelos ) motorways on an east @-@ west axis , through the south and north of the city , in that order , and both cross the A28 . Although it lost usefulness for average and long distances , the National Roads system has acquired municipal interest : <unk> that cuts the city in half , in a north @-@ south direction , is used by commuters originating from the northern suburbs and from the city of Vila do Conde , in the south , to travel downtown . The <unk> and the <unk> are used by commuters starting from the interior of the municipality . 
 The traditional road system of the city , composed of roads that run parallel in the direction of the sea , can be seen in any of the following avenues : Avenida do Mar , Avenida Vasco da Gama , Avenida <unk> de Albuquerque , and Avenida Santos Graça . The Avenida dos <unk> and Avenida dos Banhos , in other hand , run parallel to the coast . The growth of the city inland and northwards made ring roads more important , this can be seen in Avenida 25 de Abril , an urban belt road .

 Within the European Union , Póvoa de Varzim is twinned , since 1986 , with the city of <unk> in France , with Eschborn in Germany ( since 1998 ) and Żabbar in Malta ( since 2001 ) and it received , due to the partnership with other European cities , the 1995 and 2005 Golden Stars of Town @-@ twinning from the European Commission . 
 In Brazil , Póvoa de Varzim is twinned with major cities . It is twinned with Rio de Janeiro since November 8th , 1989 it also built town @-@ twinning links with the city of São Paulo . These metropolises hold Casa dos Poveiros , voluntary associations of immigrants from Póvoa de Varzim . The one from Rio was established in 1930 and the one from São Paulo in 1991 . There are also Casa dos Poveiros in <unk> , Johannesburg , South Africa and Toronto , Canada . The partnership with Rio was established by Brazilian actress <unk> Amaral when she was a <unk> and president of Rio de Janeiro 's chamber of parliament , who since the age of 6 was frequently seen in Rio 's Casa dos Poveiros and visited Póvoa de Varzim for the 21st anniversary commemorations . Mata de São João ( Bahia ) is a sister @-@ community ( Comunidade @-@ <unk> ) of Rates parish in Póvoa de Varzim since 2010 . It is not a regular program , it is based on affection due to very strong cultural and historical connections , as Mata de São João was one of the towns in Bahia established by settlers from Rates and the establishment of Brazil itself . 
 In 2016 , the regional government of Príncipe Island , an autonomous region of São Tomé and Príncipe , and the municipality of Póvoa de Varzim , established a cooperation protocol , which has diverse fields of cooperation using human and technical resources . The protocol was signed after a visit to Póvoa de Varzim by the president of Príncipe Island , José Cardoso Cassandra .

 = HMS Victorious ( 1895 ) = 
 HMS Victorious was one of nine Majestic @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the British Royal Navy . She was armed with a main battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) guns in two twin turrets , and was capable of a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . She served primarily on home waters , and participated in the Fleet Review for the Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria in 1897 . She served briefly in the Mediterranean in 1898 before being transferred to the China Station later that year ; Victorious remained in East Asian waters until 1900 , when she returned to the Mediterranean . 
 After returning to the United Kingdom in 1904 , Victorious served as the second flagship of the Channel Fleet . She remained in active service with the fleet in various units until 1908 , when she was modernized and then placed in reserve . At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 she was mobilized with three of her sister ships into the 9th Battle Squadron , though by January 1915 she was again withdrawn from front @-@ line service . In September her main guns were removed to arm a pair of monitors . Victorious was subsequently used as a repair ship . After the end of the war she was renamed Indus II ; plans to use her as a harbor ship were cancelled and , in April 1923 , she was sold for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Victorious was laid down at the Chatham Dockyard on 28 May 1894 , launched on 19 October 1895 — after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the Royal Navy about a year later , on 4 November 1896 . The ship was 421 feet ( 128 m ) long overall and had a beam of 75 ft ( 23 m ) and a draft of 27 ft ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She displaced up to 16 @,@ 060 t ( 15 @,@ 810 long tons ; 17 @,@ 700 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines powered by eight coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . By 1907 – 1908 she was re @-@ boilered with oil @-@ fired models . Her engines provided a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) at 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers , although they suffered from high fuel consumption . She had a crew of 672 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with four BL 12 @-@ inch Mk VIII guns in twin turrets , one forward and one aft . The turrets were placed on pear @-@ shaped barbettes ; six of her sisters had the same arrangement , but her sisters Caesar and Illustrious and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes . Victorious also carried twelve QF 6 @-@ inch / 40 guns . They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships . She also carried sixteen QF 12 @-@ pounder guns and twelve QF 2 @-@ pounder guns . She was also equipped with five 18 in ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes , four of which were submerged in the ship 's hull , with the last in a deck @-@ mounted launcher . Victorious and the other ships of her class had 9 inches ( 229 mm ) of Harvey armour , which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour . This allowed Victorious and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection . The barbettes for the main battery were protected with 14 in ( 360 mm ) of armor , while the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides . The ship 's armored deck was 2 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 in ( 64 to 114 mm ) thick . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 HMS Victorious was commissioned on 4 November 1896 for service in the Fleet Reserve at Chatham Dockyard . On 8 June 1897 she went into full commission for service in the Mediterranean Fleet . Before leaving the United Kingdom , she was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria on 26 June 1897 . She moved to the Mediterranean where she relieved the battleship Anson . In February 1898 Victorious was detached from the Mediterranean Fleet for service on the China Station . On 16 February she ran hard aground while entering the harbor at Port Said en route to China . Several tugs attempted to free her but were unable ; pump dredgers were needed to shift the sediment around the hull to get her free . She was successfully refloated on 18 February . In 1900 , she returned to the Mediterranean and underwent a refit at Malta . Her Mediterranean service over , Victorious was paid off at Chatham on 8 August 1903 and began a refit there that lasted until February 1904 . 
 Victorious was recommissioned at Devonport on 2 February 1904 to serve as second flagship of the Channel Fleet . On 14 July 1904 the torpedo boat TB 113 rammed her at Hamoaze , slightly damaging her . When under a reorganization on 1 January 1905 , the Channel Fleet became the new Atlantic Fleet , and Victorious became an Atlantic Fleet unit . Captain Robert Falcon Scott , the Antarctic explorer , served as her Captain , acting as Flag Captain to Rear @-@ Admiral George Egerton aboard her , for a period in 1906 . Her Atlantic Fleet service ended when she paid off at Devonport on 31 December 1906 . On 1 January 1907 Victorious was recommissioned to serve at the Nore as part of the Nore Division of the new Home Fleet . She underwent a refit at Chatham in 1908 in which she was converted to burn fuel oil and had main battery fire control and radio installed . She was reduced to a nucleus crew , in commission in reserve , in March 1909 . Victorious was transferred to the Devonport Division , Home Fleet , in January 1911 , and to the 3rd Fleet in May 1912 . She damaged her sternwalk in a collision with her sister ship Majestic in fog on 14 July 1912 and began a short refit at Chatham in December 1913 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 In July 1914 the Royal Navy began a precautionary mobilization as war began to seem imminent . As part of this , Victorious and her sister ships Hannibal , Mars , and Magnificent , formed the 9th Battle Squadron on 27 July 1914 , stationed at the Humber to defend the British coast ; Victorious remained there as guard ship after the 9th Battle Squadron was dissolved on 7 August 1914 . In December 1914 she transferred to the Tyne to serve as guard ship there . On 4 January 1915 Victorious paid off at Elswick . The Majestic @-@ class ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy ; Victorious was laid up on the Tyne February until September 1915 and her 12 @-@ inch ( 305 @-@ mm ) guns were removed for use aboard the new Lord Clive @-@ class monitors Prince Rupert and General Wolfe . Between September 1915 and February 1916 , Palmers converted her into a repair ship at Jarrow . 
 The converted Victorious was commissioned as a repair ship on 22 February 1916 and arrived at Scapa Flow to replace the converted merchant ship Caribbean , which had been lost in September 1915 , as repair ship for the Grand Fleet . Victorious performed this role there until March 1920 when she was renamed Indus II and transferred to Devonport for a refit to prepare her for service with the Indus Establishment . She arrived at Devonport on 28 March 1920 and paid off into a care and maintenance status while she awaited the beginning of her refit . Plans for the refit , however , were cancelled ; work began to convert her into a harbor depot ship but , in April 1922 , that conversion was cancelled before it could be completed and she was placed on the disposal list that month . Indus II was sold for scrapping on 19 December 1922 , but the sale was cancelled on 1 March 1923 . She was again sold on 9 April 1923 and was towed from Devonport to Dover to be scrapped . 
 = Monsoon trough = 
 The monsoon trough is a portion of the Intertropical Convergence Zone as depicted by a line on a weather map showing the locations of minimum sea level pressure , and as such , is a convergence zone between the wind patterns of the southern and northern hemispheres . 
 Westerly monsoon winds lie in its equatorward portion while easterly trade winds exist poleward of the trough . Right along its axis , heavy rains can be found which usher in the peak of a location 's respective rainy season . As it passes poleward of a location , hot and dry conditions develop . The monsoon trough plays a role in creating many of the world 's rainforests . 
 The term " monsoon trough " is most commonly used in monsoonal regions of the Western Pacific such as Asia and Australia . The migration of the ITCZ / monsoon trough into a landmass heralds the beginning of the annual rainy season during summer months . Depressions and tropical cyclones often form in the vicinity of the monsoon trough , with each capable of producing a year 's worth of rainfall in a relatively short time frame . 
 = = Movement and strength = = 
 Monsoon troughing in the western Pacific reaches its zenith in latitude during the late summer when the wintertime surface ridge in the opposite hemisphere is the strongest . It can reach as far as the 40th parallel in East Asia during August and the 20th parallel in Australia during February . Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure over the warmest part of the various continents . In the Southern Hemisphere , the monsoon trough associated with the Australian monsoon reaches its most southerly latitude in February , oriented along a west @-@ northwest / east @-@ southeast axis . 
 = = = Effect of wind surges = = = 
 Increases in the relative vorticity , or spin , with the monsoon trough are normally a product of increased wind convergence within the convergence zone of the monsoon trough . Wind surges can lead to this increase in convergence . A strengthening or equatorward movement in the subtropical ridge can cause a strengthening of a monsoon trough as a wind surge moves towards the location of the monsoon trough . As fronts move through the subtropics and tropics of one hemisphere during their winter , normally as shear lines when their temperature gradient becomes minimal , wind surges can cross the equator in oceanic regions and enhance a monsoon trough in the other hemisphere 's summer . A key way of detecting whether a wind surge has reached a monsoon trough is the formation of a burst of thunderstorms within the monsoon trough . 
 = = = Embedded depressions = = = 
 If a circulation forms within the monsoon trough , it is able to compete with the neighboring thermal low over the continent , and a wind surge will occur at its periphery . Such a circulation which is broad in nature within a monsoon trough is known as a monsoon depression . In the Northern Hemisphere , monsoon depressions are generally asymmetric , and tend to have their strongest winds on their eastern periphery . Light and variable winds cover a large area near their center , while bands of showers and thunderstorms develop within their area of circulation . 
 The presence of an upper level jet stream poleward and west of the system can enhance its development by leading to increased diverging air aloft over the monsoon depression , which leads to a corresponding drop in surface pressure . Even though these systems can develop over land , the outer portions of monsoon depressions are similar to tropical cyclones . In India , for example , 6 to 7 monsoon depressions move across the country yearly , and their numbers within the Bay of Bengal increase during July and August of El Niño events . Monsoon depressions are efficient rainfall producers , and can cause a year 's worth of rainfall when they move through drier areas such as the outback of Australia . 
 = = Roles = = 
 = = = In rainy season = = = 
 Since the monsoon trough is an area of convergence in the wind pattern , and an elongated area of low pressure at the surface , the trough focuses low level moisture and is defined by one or more elongated bands of thunderstorms when viewing satellite imagery . Its abrupt movement to the north between May and June is coincident with the beginning of the monsoon regime and rainy seasons across South and East Asia . This convergence zone has been linked to prolonged heavy rain events in the Yangtze river as well as northern China . Its presence has also been linked to the peak of the rainy season in locations within Australia . As it progresses poleward of a particular location , clear , hot , and dry conditions develop as winds become westerly . Many of the world 's rainforests are associated with these climatological low pressure systems . 
 = = = In tropical cyclogenesis = = = 
 A monsoon trough is a significant genesis region for tropical cyclones . Vorticity @-@ rich low level environments , with significant low level spin , lead to a better than average chance of tropical cyclone formation due to their inherent rotation . This is because a pre @-@ existing near @-@ surface disturbance with sufficient spin and convergence is one of the six requirements for tropical cyclogenesis . There appears to be a 15 @-@ 25 day cycle in thunderstorm activity associated with the monsoon trough , which is roughly half the wavelength of the Madden – Julian oscillation , or MJO . This mirrors tropical cyclone genesis near these features , as genesis clusters in 2 – 3 weeks of activity followed by 2 – 3 weeks of inactivity . Tropical cyclones can form in outbreaks around these features under special circumstances , tending to follow the next cyclone to its poleward and west . 
 Whenever the monsoon trough on the eastern side of the summertime Asian monsoon is in its normal orientation ( oriented east @-@ southeast to west @-@ northwest ) , tropical cyclones along its periphery will move with a westward motion . If it is reverse oriented , or oriented southwest to northeast , tropical cyclones will move more poleward . Tropical cyclone tracks with S shapes tend to be associated with reverse @-@ oriented monsoon troughs . The South Pacific convergence zone and South American convergence zones are generally reverse oriented . The failure of the monsoon trough , or ITCZ , to move south of the equator in the eastern Pacific ocean and Atlantic ocean during the southern hemisphere summer is considered one of the reasons that tropical cyclones normally do not form in those regions . It has also been noted that when the monsoon trough lies near 20 degrees north latitude in the Pacific , the frequency of tropical cyclones is 2 to 3 times greater than when it lies closer to 10 degrees north .

 In an interview with Sound on Sound , Levine said that the team , The Smeezingtons , never met Supa Dups personally and that " Liquor Store Blues " was finished by exchanging files of the song . The latter producer helped finishing the track by providing a dub sound , something the three of them " could just not nail it " . During an interview granted to Vibe Mars said that he never met Damien Marley , since the latter did " his part " after a show in Washington . Nevertheless , the singer explained how Marley was guested in the song : 
 " Liquor Store Blues " was written by Bruno Mars , Philip Lawrence , Ari Levine , Damien Marley and Thomas Pentz and produced by the former three , under their alias , The Smeezingtons , and Dwayne " Supa Dups " Chin @-@ Quee . The latter was in charge of programming and arranging the drums , which he played . Levine engineered the song at Levcon Studios in California .

He found the tune to be " reggae @-@ tinged jam " . Scott Mervis of Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette felt that " Liquor Store Blues " was in a " heavier dub zone with toaster Damian Marley " furthering a personal matter " the young singer should have stuck to the liquor store ' cause he was busted for cocaine in Vegas last month " .

He concluded by deeming the recording a " faux reggae track " . A writer for Rap @-@ Up magazine commented that the recording 's lyrics regard " a quick escape from his bad fortune in an odd foreshadowing of events " .

 = 10 euro note = 
 The ten euro note ( € 10 ) is the second @-@ lowest value euro banknote and has been used since the introduction of the euro ( in its cash form ) in 2002 . The note is used in the 23 countries which have it as their sole currency ( with 22 legally adopting it ) ; with a population of about 332 million . 
 It is the second @-@ smallest note measuring <unk> with a red colour scheme . The ten euro banknotes depict bridges and arches / doorways in Romanesque architecture ( between the 11th and 12th centuries ) . 
 The ten euro note contains several complex security features such as watermarks , invisible ink , holograms and microprinting that document its authenticity . In September 2011 , there were approximately 2 @,@ 005 @,@ 149 @,@ 600 ten euro banknotes in circulation around the eurozone . 
 = = History = = 
 The euro was founded on 1 January 1999 , when it became the currency of over 300 million people in Europe . For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency , only used in accountancy . Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002 , when it replaced the national banknotes and coins of the countries in eurozone 12 , such as the Italian lira and the German mark . 
 Slovenia joined the Eurozone in 2007 , Cyprus and Malta in 2008 , Slovakia in 2009 , Estonia in 2011 , Latvia joined on 1 January 2014 @.@ and Lithuania joined on 1 January 2015 . 
 = = = The changeover period = = = 
 The changeover period during which the former currencies ' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months , going from 1 January 2002 until 28 February 2002 . The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state . The earliest date was in Germany , where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001 , though the exchange period lasted for two months more . Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender , they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from ten years to forever . 
 = = = Changes = = = 
 Notes printed before November 2003 bear the signature of the first president of the European Central Bank , Wim Duisenberg , who was replaced on 1 November 2003 by Jean @-@ Claude Trichet , whose signature appears on issues from November 2003 . Notes issued after March 2012 bear the signature of the third president of the European Central Bank , incumbent Mario Draghi . 
 A new series , similar to the current one , was released on 23 September 2014 . The European Central Bank will , in due time , announce when banknotes from the first series lose legal tender status . 
 The first series issues do not reflect the expansion of the European Union : Cyprus is not depicted on those notes as the map does not extend far enough east ; Malta is also missing as it does not meet the first series ' minimum size for depiction . 
 Since the European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or eight years after each issue , a second series ( Europa series ) of banknotes was already in preparation in 2012 . New production and anti @-@ counterfeiting techniques are employed on the new notes , but the design is of the same theme and similar colours of the current series ; bridges and arches . However , they are recognisable as a new series . 
 = = Design = = 
 The ten euro note is the second smallest at 127 millimetres ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) × 67 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) with a red colour scheme . All bank notes depict bridges and arches / doorways in a different historical European style ; the ten euro note shows the Romanesque era ( between the 11th and 12th centuries ) . Although Robert Kalina 's original designs were intended to show real monuments , for political reasons the bridge and art are merely hypothetical examples of the architectural era . 
 Like all euro notes , it contains the denomination , the EU flag , the signature of the president of the ECB and the initials of said bank in different EU languages , a depiction of EU territories overseas , the stars from the EU flag and twelve security features as listed below .

 = Michael Salvatori = 
 Michael C. Salvatori ( born 1954 ) is an American composer best known for his collaboration with colleague Martin O 'Donnell for the soundtracks to the Halo video game series . Salvatori became acquainted with O 'Donnell in college ; when O 'Donnell was given a job offer to score a colleague 's film , Salvatori and O 'Donnell formed a partnership and eventually created their own production company , TotalAudio . Salvatori continued to manage TotalAudio and worked on his own music for clients such as Disney and Wideload Games . He most recently co @-@ composed the soundtrack to the 2014 video game Destiny .

 = = = Early works = = = 
 Salvatori wrote music for his own rock band while he was in college , and became friends with Martin O 'Donnell . O 'Donnell eventually moved to Chicago after completing his degrees , and was approached with a job offer to score a colleague 's film . Since Salvatori had his own recording studio , O 'Donnell offered to split the job with him ; the two became partners . 
 Soon after producing the music for Myth II , Bungie contracted O 'Donnell for several of Bungie 's other projects , including the third @-@ person game Oni . Bungie wanted to re @-@ negotiate the contracts for Oni in 1999 , which resulted in O 'Donnell joining the Bungie team ten days before the company was bought by Microsoft . Salvatori remained behind to manage the business aspect of TotalAudio , which he continues to do . 
 = = = Bungie = = = 
 O 'Donnell and Salvatori 's company TotalAudio was contracted to produce the music for Bungie 's upcoming title , Halo : Combat Evolved . As of 2009 , the only official work TotalAudio has done has been for the Halo series . During production Bungie decided that instead of contracting work to O 'Donnell , they would hire him . Salvatori remained at TotalAudio to manage the business aspect of the company , and shortly after O 'Donnell joined the team , Bungie was bought by Microsoft . Salvatori co @-@ composed the music for Halo 's sequels — Halo 2 and Halo 3 — with O 'Donnell , who has called Salvatori one of his musical influences . 
 For the music to Halo 3 : ODST , O 'Donnell began work on crafting the game 's themes before Salvatori joined the team in February 2009 . " Marty [ O 'Donnell ] had started writing before me , and sent me some of his ideas , " Salvatori said . " I picked a few that I felt I could add some magic to , and worked on those . I also came up with several ideas that I sent to Marty that he put his hands on . " Once the duo felt they had enough material , the Chicago @-@ based Salvatori flew to Bungie in Seattle to complete the arrangements and record live musicians . 
 Early on , the team decided that rather than rely on old Halo themes , ODST would feature all @-@ new music . " It was a bit intimidating at first , " Salvatori recalled , " because in previous Halo games if new ideas weren 't coming , I could always dust off an old one and give it a new spin . I was afraid that we might hit some writer 's block along the way , but that didn 't happen at all . Instead , we had the freedom to explore some new musical territory , and the ideas flowed pretty quickly . " With the exception of the main player character , O 'Donnell and Salvatori did not compose themes to represent characters . While the game 's setting in Africa inspired some percussion pieces , the team was interested in a sparser atmosphere , which Salvatori described as " a bit darker and less epic " . 
 He most recently co @-@ composed the soundtrack to the 2014 video game , Destiny . 
 = = = Collections and other work = = = 
 O 'Donnell and Salvatori 's music has been packaged and released in physical and digital forms . The soundtracks feature " frozen " arrangements that represent an approximation of a play @-@ through of the games . The Halo Original Soundtrack sold over 40 @,@ 000 copies , and was followed by two different releases of the music to Halo 2 . The two volumes of the Halo 2 Original Soundtrack were produced by Nile Rodgers , with the first album being released in sync with the video game in 2004 and became the best @-@ selling game soundtrack of all time . The second album was released more than a year after the soundtrack had been mixed and mastered . Halo 3 's soundtrack was released in November 2007 , and featured a fan contribution that was the select winner from a pool of entries judged by O 'Donnell , Rodgers , and others . All of Salvatori 's contemporary work on the series was repackaged as Halo Trilogy — The Complete Original Soundtracks in December 2008 , alongside preview tracks written by Halo Wars composer Stephen Rippy . The music for ODST was released in a two @-@ disc set on September 22 , 2009 . 
 Salvatori continues to engineer , produce and compose his own music . Aside from Halo and Destiny , he has served as the audio lead and composer for Stubbs the Zombie . He also created the music for Disney 's Guilty Party . 
 = The Great American Bash ( 2004 ) = 
 The Great American Bash ( 2004 ) was the 15th Great American Bash professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event , and the first produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . The event , presented by Subway , took place on June 27 , 2004 , at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk , Virginia and was a SmackDown ! brand @-@ exclusive event . Three of the eight matches on the card were contested for a championship ; one was lost while the other two were retained . The event grossed $ 325 @,@ 000 with 6 @,@ 500 ticket sales and received a 0 @.@ 47 buyrate . 
 The main event was a Handicap match between The Dudley Boyz ( Bubba Ray and D @-@ Von ) and The Undertaker . Undertaker won the match after pinning D @-@ Von following a Tombstone Piledriver . One of the featured matches on the undercard was a Texas Bullrope match for the WWE Championship between John " Bradshaw " Layfield ( JBL ) and champion Eddie Guerrero . JBL won the match and the WWE Championship after touching all four turnbuckles in succession . Guerrero was at first declared the winner , but General Manager Kurt Angle came out and showed that JBL had touched the final turnbuckle before Guerrero . Another primary match on the undercard was Rey Mysterio versus Chavo Guerrero for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship , which Mysterio won with a sunset flip . 
 = = Background = = 
 The main feud heading into The Great American Bash was between The Dudley Boyz ( Bubba Ray and D @-@ Von ) and The Undertaker . On the May 27 episode of SmackDown ! , Paul Heyman told The Dudleys to " make an impact " . As part of the storyline , The Dudleys responded by abducting Paul Bearer , Undertaker 's manager . The following week , Heyman told Undertaker that the only way he would ever see Bearer again , was to align himself with The Dudleys . Two weeks later , on the June 17 episode of SmackDown ! , a Handicap match between The Dudleys and The Undertaker was booked for The Great American Bash , with the stipulation being if Undertaker lost , Bearer , as part of the scripted events , would be cemented in a glass crypt . 
 Another primary feud heading into the event was between Eddie Guerrero and John " Bradshaw " Layfield ( JBL ) over the WWE Championship . At the previous SmackDown ! brand pay @-@ per @-@ view event , Judgment Day , JBL defeated Guerrero by disqualification after Guerrero hit JBL with the WWE Championship belt . Since a championship cannot be lost via countout or disqualification , Guerrero retained the title . Two weeks later , on the May 27 episode of SmackDown ! , General Manager Kurt Angle announced that JBL was the number @-@ one contender to the WWE Championship at The Great American Bash , and that JBL was allowed to choose the stipulation for the match . The following week , JBL announced that his match against Guerrero would be a Texas Bullrope match , in which the object is to touch all four turnbuckles ( one in each corner of the ring ) in succession . 
 One of the main matches on the undercard was a Fatal Four @-@ Way Elimination match for the WWE United States Championship between the champion , John Cena , René Duprée , Booker T , and Rob Van Dam . At Judgment Day , Cena defeated Duprée to retain the United States Championship . Four days later , on SmackDown ! , Cena faced Duprée in a rematch for the title . Duprée executed a low blow on Cena outside the ring , which caused Cena to be counted out . Duprée won the match , but not the title since a championship cannot be lost via countout or disqualification . The following week , Cena defeated Duprée in a Lumberjack match to retain the title . On the June 3 episode of SmackDown ! , Cena confronted Booker about his interference in the Lumberjack match the week before . As General Manager Kurt Angle told Cena to leave the arena , Booker attacked Cena from behind and pushed him onto Angle . Angle claimed he was going to strip Cena of the United States Championship for what he did . The next week , on SmackDown ! , Cena faced Booker , Van Dam , and Duprée , respectively , in one @-@ on @-@ one matches with a five @-@ minute time limit . The man to defeat Cena would become the number @-@ one contender to the United States Championship at The Great American Bash . Cena , however , won all three matches as no man was able to defeat him within the time limit . This led to Angle booking Cena in a Fatal Four @-@ Way match for the title at The Great American Bash . On the June 17 episode of SmackDown ! , Angle changed the match to an elimination match . 
 The Divas rivalry heading into the event was between Sable and Torrie Wilson . Sable and Torrie teamed together at WrestleMania XX and defeated Raw Divas Miss Jackie and Stacy Keibler , but when Torrie was featured on the cover of SmackDown ! Magazine , Sable turned villainous by displaying jealousy over Torrie 's cover and berating her in a backstage segment , leading to a brawl between the two Divas . The events led to the announcement that Sable and Torrie will face each other at The Great American Bash .

In order to win the bout , one must touch all four turnbuckles ( one in each corner of the ring ) in succession . One preplanned move in the match saw Guerrero hit JBL with a steel chair , which caused JBL to bleed . Guerrero then got back in the ring and went on to touch three turnbuckles ; however , he was unable to touch the fourth as JBL was holding him back . Guerrero executed a dropkick on JBL and attempted to touch the fourth again . JBL , however , held him back and took the advantage . JBL threw Guerrero into the Spanish announce table and executed a powerbomb onto him through it . Towards the end of the match , each man had touched three turnbuckles and were vying for the fourth . Guerrero attempted to jump over JBL and touch the remaining turnbuckle , but was unsuccessful ; he splashed himself and JBL into the turnbuckle as a result . Guerrero was declared the winner , as it appeared he had touched all four turnbuckles first , but General Manager Kurt Angle came out and reversed the decision . He showed on the TitanTron that JBL had touched the final turnbuckle before Guerrero ; as a result , JBL was declared the winner and new WWE Champion . 
 The final match on the card was the main event , which saw The Undertaker face off against The Dudley Boyz ( Bubba Ray and D @-@ Von ) in a Handicap match . Per the pre @-@ match stipulation , Paul Bearer would be cemented in a glass crypt if Undertaker lost . Throughout the duration of the match , Bearer was locked on a chair inside a glass crypt with the pump of cement truck above him . After a match evenly controlled by The Undertaker and The Dudleys , Undertaker pinned D @-@ Von following a Tombstone Piledriver to win . After the match , Undertaker pulled the lever to the cement truck , which in turn filled the crypt with Bearer inside full of cement .

 Following the conclusion of his title match against JBL at the event , Eddie Guerrero began to feud with Kurt Angle . During a Steel Cage match between Guerrero and JBL for the WWE Championship , El Gran Luchadore ( Kurt Angle in disguise ) interfered on JBL 's behalf , which allowed JBL to escape the cage and win the match .

 = Robot Building = 
 The Robot Building , located in the <unk> business district of Bangkok , Thailand , houses United Overseas Bank 's Bangkok headquarters . It was designed for the Bank of Asia by Sumet Jumsai to reflect the computerization of banking ; its architecture is a reaction against neoclassical and high @-@ tech postmodern architecture . The building 's features , such as progressively receding walls , antennas , and eyes , contribute to its robotic appearance and to its practical function . Completed in 1986 , the building is one of the last examples of modern architecture in Bangkok . 
 = = Design = = 
 Thai architect Sumet Jumsai designed the Robot Building for the Bank of Asia , which was acquired by United Overseas Bank in 2005 . He had been asked by the Bank of Asia 's directors to design a building that reflected the modernization and computerization of banking and found inspiration in his son 's toy robot . 
 Sumet designed the building in conscious opposition to postmodern styles of the era , particularly classical revivalism and high @-@ tech architecture as embodied in the Centre Pompidou . While Sumet praised the inception of postmodernism as a protest against puritanical , bland modern design , he called it " a protest movement which seeks to replace without offering a replacement " . Sumet dismissed mid @-@ 1980s classical revivalism as " intellectual [ ly ] bankrupt [ ] " and criticized the " catalogue [ s ] of meaningless architectural motifs " that characterized classical revivalism in Bangkok . He further dismissed high @-@ tech architecture , " which engrosses itself in the machine while at the same time secretly ... <unk> [ ing ] ... handmade artifacts and honest manual labor " , as a movement without a future . 
 Sumet wrote that his building " need not be a robot " and that a " host of other metamorphoses " would suffice , so long as they could " free the spirit from the present intellectual impasse and propel it forward into the next century " . He wrote that his design might be considered post @-@ high @-@ tech : rather than exhibiting the building 's inner workings , he chose to adorn a finished product with the abstractions of mechanical parts . His building , he argued , struck against the 20th century vision of the machine as a " separate entity " often " elevated on a pedestal for worship " and , by becoming " a part of our daily lives , a friend , ourselves " , cleared the way for the 21st century amalgam of machine and man . 
 The building was completed in 1987 at a cost of US $ 10 million . By the mid @-@ 1980s , architectural modernism had faded in Bangkok ; this building is one of the last examples of the style . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The building is 20 stories tall and has a total floor area of 23 @,@ 506 m ² ( 253 @,@ 016 ft ² ) . The floor areas decrease progressively at the 4th , 8th , 12th , 16th , and 18th floors ; the staggered shape both contributes to the robot 's appearance and is an efficient solution to setback regulations requiring an 18 degree incline from each side of the property line . The building 's ground floor is a double @-@ height banking hall . The hall 's interior architecture , designed in association with the firm 7 Associates , was designed to further the robotic appearance of the building ; four sculptures by Thai artist <unk> <unk> stand at the main door . Mezzanine floors located on each side of the banking hall contain offices and meeting rooms . The building 's second floor features a large multipurpose hall , offices , and training rooms , and its upper floors contain general office space . An eight @-@ story parking garage is located behind the main building . 
 The building 's decorative exterior contributes its building 's robotic appearance , though it often serves practical functions as well . Two antennas on the building 's roof are used for communications and as lightning rods . On the building 's upper facade , in front of the main meeting and dining rooms of the top executive suites , are two 6 m ( 19 @.@ 7 ft ) lidded eyeballs that serve as windows . The eyeballs are made of reflective glass ; the lids are made of metallic louvers . Nuts made of glass @-@ reinforced concrete adorn the building 's sides ; the building 's largest nuts measure 3 @.@ 8 m ( 12 @.@ 5 ft ) in diameter and were the largest in the world at the time of their construction .

 = 2 / 18th Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 2 / 18th Battalion was an Australian Army infantry unit that served during World War II . Formed in June 1940 , the battalion was assigned to the 22nd Brigade , which formed part of the Australian 8th Division . After completing basic training , the 2 / 18th was sent to Singapore and Malaya to strengthen the defences of the British colonies in February 1941 against a possible Japanese attack . The 2 / 18th Battalion subsequently undertook garrison duties throughout the year at various locations in Malaya , where it conducted jungle training and constructed defences along the eastern coast . 
 Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific in December 1941 , the 2 / 18th saw action against Japanese forces in the Malayan campaign , during which they took part in a large @-@ scale ambush of a Japanese force on the Malay Peninsula before joining the withdrawal to Singapore in early 1942 . Assigned to defend part of the north @-@ west coast of the island , the battalion participated in the unsuccessful defence of Singapore in early February 1942 . Following the fall of Singapore the majority of the battalion 's personnel were taken as prisoners of war . Many of these men died in captivity ; the survivors were liberated in 1945 and returned to Australia where the battalion was disbanded .

 = = = Formation = = = 
 The 2 / 18th Battalion was raised around Sydney , New South Wales , in June 1940 , with its first subunits being formed on 13 July at Wallgrove Camp . Formed as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) from volunteers for overseas service , the battalion 's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Varley , a grazier from Inverell , New South Wales , and a World War I veteran who had previously commanded the 35th Battalion while serving in the Militia during the interwar years . The battalion concentrated at Wallgrove on 15 July , and a cadre of commissioned and senior non @-@ commissioned officers ( NCOs ) who were selected from the Militia — in many cases personally by Varley — was established , while the remainder of the battalion 's NCOs were appointed from recruits following their arrival . 
 The majority of the battalion 's personnel arrived on 27 and 28 July . Coming from across the state of New South Wales , the men were drawn from places such as Tamworth , Newcastle , Wagga , Goulburn , and Liverpool , with roughly 60 percent coming from rural backgrounds . With an authorised strength of around 900 men , the battalion was organised around a battalion headquarters , with a regimental aid post , four rifle companies and a headquarters company consisting of various support platoons and sections including signals , mortars , transport ( later carriers ) , pioneers , anti @-@ aircraft and administration . 
 Along with the 2 / 19th and 2 / 20th Battalions , it was assigned to the 22nd Brigade , which formed part of the 8th Division . The colours chosen for the battalion 's Unit Colour Patch ( UCP ) were the same as those of the 18th Battalion , a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921 . These colours were purple over green , in a diamond shape , although a border of gray in an oval shape was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart ; the oval shape designated the battalion as part of the 8th Division . 
 Basic training began at Wallgrove on 1 August , and was provided by experienced regular soldiers and personnel who had previously served in the Militia . In mid @-@ August the battalion moved to Ingleburn , and by the end of the month individual training had been completed . Collective training followed , and on 5 October the battalion took part in a divisional march through Sydney . A further move came in November when the 2 / 18th was transported to Bathurst , where more complex exercises were undertaken , including at brigade and divisional levels . 
 Although the fighting had not yet spread to the Pacific , by late 1940 there were growing concerns amongst the Allies about the possibility of a war with Japan . After a review of the defences around Singapore and Malaya , the British government requested Australian troops be sent to garrison the region . In October , the Australian government committed the 22nd Brigade and supporting elements . As a result , the 2 / 18th — with a strength of 793 men — subsequently embarked upon the RMS Queen Mary and left Sydney on 4 February 1941 , bound for Singapore . The Australian government wished to send the brigade to the Middle East to join the 6th , 7th and 9th Divisions , so the deployment was only intended to be short , as the British government pledged to release an Indian division to replace the Australians in May . Consequently , the Australian forces were deployed having only been partially trained and equipped and while they were still in the process of being brought up to full strength . 
 = = = Malayan campaign = = = 
 The men arrived in Singapore on 18 February 1941 and moved into barracks at Port Dickson , in the north of Malaya . While there , the battalion undertook further training to prepare it for jungle warfare , before moving to Seremban in March . Further drafts of reinforcements arrived during this time as the battalion was brought up to its wartime establishment . The rigours of jungle training and the tropical heat had an impact on the men , and a number of personnel were hospitalised during this time with illnesses such as malaria , measles , mumps and serious tropical skin diseases . Some of these were repatriated back to Australia , and by the end of March , the 2 / 18th was still below its authorised establishment , with an actual strength of 898 . 
 Amidst growing concerns amongst Australian military commanders about Japanese intentions , the scheduled replacement of the 22nd Brigade was cancelled , and the 2 / 18th remained in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August . The following month they were sent north to Mersing , which , situated on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula , was considered a likely place for a Japanese landing as it offered a short route of advance towards Singapore . At Mersing , the battalion was set to work digging defensive positions and constructing wire obstacles , punctuated by familiarisation patrols and anti @-@ aircraft , anti @-@ gas and mortar training . 
 The battalion was placed on a war footing on 6 December as tensions in the region escalated . Two days later , the Japanese invasion of Malaya commenced ; while the fighting raged elsewhere , the 2 / 18th remained unengaged around Mersing . On 26 December , a small group of 2 / 18th men were detached to an ad hoc British raiding force known as " <unk> " to take part in a raid behind Japanese lines , ambushing a Japanese convoy . It was not until 3 January however that the battalion came into contact with the Japanese for the first time , with a patrol from the 2 / 18th capturing two Japanese airmen who had been shot down near the mouth of the <unk> River . A fortnight later , Japanese advances along the peninsula to the west led to concerns about the coastal defences being outflanked and cut off . As result , on 17 January , the 2 / 18th was ordered to withdraw south 10 miles ( 16 km ) to Jemaluang without having met the Japanese in battle . Following a landing around Mersing , the Japanese began to advance south towards Jemaluang in large numbers . In response , on 26 January the 2 / 18th Battalion , supported by two batteries of artillery from the 2 / 10th Field Regiment , was tasked with establishing an ambush near the Nithsdale Estate and the rubber plantation at Joo Lye . 
 Establishing themselves along the Mersing – Jemaluang road , ' D ' Company was deployed to the north on the western side of the road as the lookout force , while ' B ' Company was positioned further to the south on the opposite side of the road . South of them , ' A ' Company formed the blocking force , with their position stretched across the road oriented to the north . Behind them , ' C ' Company was positioned in reserve , further south . The plan had been for the ambush to be sprung during the day , but the Japanese advance had proceeded more slowly than thought , and it was not until after dark that they entered the ambush site . In order to inflict as many casualties as possible , the Japanese force , which was estimated to be battalion @-@ sized , was allowed to pass through ' D ' and ' B ' Companies . By 3 : 00 am they came up against ' A ' Company 's blocking position and the ambush was finally initiated . <unk> indirect fire from artillery and mortars inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese ; however , as the northernmost company — ' D ' — turned south to attack the Japanese from the rear , they came up against determined resistance from a force of Japanese that had managed to infiltrate the ambush site and dig in on a small feature to the east of the estate 's pig farm , north of ' B ' Company . This effectively cut them off from the rest of the battalion . 
 Fighting raged throughout the early morning as ' B ' Company vainly attempted to assist the cut @-@ off ' D ' Company . Varley decided to launch a counterattack with ' A ' Company , but at 8 : 00 am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters , cancelling the attack . Covered by the reserve company , ' A ' and some of ' B ' Company were able to break contact and fall back . ' D ' Company , along with those of ' B ' Company that were still isolated and in contact , had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion 's lines . By the time they arrived , there were only enough men left to form one platoon . The 2 / 18th 's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed , wounded or missing . Japanese losses are unknown , but are thought to be significant and they were unable to take Jemaluang for two more days . 
 = = = Fighting in Singapore = = = 
 After the withdrawal from Nithsdale , the battalion fell back along the Jemaluang – Kota Tinggi Road , before helping to cover the Allied withdrawal over the Johor – Singapore Causeway to Singapore Island . No engagements were fought during this phase , but the 2 / 18th patrolled constantly and provided rearguard detachments . During this time , the battalion was briefly commanded by Major William Fraser , when Varley temporarily took over <unk> , which consisted of the 22nd Brigade and a number of Indian and Malay formations , filling in for Brigadier Harold Burfield Taylor , who was temporarily detached to organise a force to cover the withdrawal . Following its arrival on the island , Varley returned to the battalion , which received a small number of reinforcements — about 90 men — and was allocated to the defence of the Western Area along with the rest of the 8th Division . Forming part of the 22nd Brigade 's defensive line in the north @-@ west sector , stretching from the Causeway to the Sungei <unk> , the battalion was responsible for defending a frontage of 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) . With a strength of 37 officers and 826 other ranks , the battalion occupied a position in the centre of the brigade that stretched from the 2 / 20th 's position around Kranji to the 2 / 19th 's around Sungei Sarimbun , north @-@ east of the village of Ama Keng and Tengah Airfield . 
 Consisting of " tidal mud flats and mangrove swamps intersected with streams and inlets " , there had been no work done to prepare the area that the battalion was allocated to defend prior to its arrival due to political concerns about alarming the local population . The wide frontage stretched the 2 / 18th thin on the ground , with no depth and large gaps between positions that were separated in places by tidal waterways . Due to the thick vegetation along the shoreline , the battalion 's positions had the added handicap of poor visibility of the water and limited fields of fire that , combined with their isolation , meant that they were unable to support each other . After occupying their positions on 1 February , the battalion worked to improve them as best they could , working under the cover of darkness so as to avoid Japanese artillery and air attacks . 
 The Japanese attack on the north @-@ west coast came on the night of 8 / 9 February , beginning with a heavy artillery and aerial bombardment of the 22nd Brigade 's positions throughout the day , followed by a waterborne assault across the Johore Strait , which began around 10 : 30 pm . Confronted by 16 battalions from the Japanese 5th and 18th Divisions , which concentrated upon the 2 / 18th 's and 2 / 20th 's positions , the 2 / 18th 's two forward companies — ' A ' and ' C ' — strongly resisted two frontal assaults during the day . Heavy casualties were inflicted on the Japanese over the course of several hours , but the defenders were eventually forced back by heavy indirect fire and overwhelming numbers . Exploiting the holes in the battalion 's perimeter to avoid resistance , by 1 : 30 am on 9 February the Japanese had penetrated towards battalion headquarters near the Lim Chau Kang road , threatening to roll up the battalion 's rear . Varley then ordered the forward companies to make a fighting withdrawal and fall back on battalion headquarters . Heavy fighting followed , during which the Australians suffered grave losses as groups became lost in the darkness in the thick country , before the battalion was able to re @-@ establish itself around Ama Keng . 
 The 2 / 18th attempted to defend the Tengah Airfield , but by 1 : 00 pm in the afternoon of 9 February they had been reduced to only 330 men and were withdrawn back to the south @-@ east of the airfield , occupying a position around Bulim along the Chu Kang Road , with the 2 / 29th Battalion on their left . Throughout the night of 9 / 10 February , minor clashes occurred as patrols were sent out to fend off Japanese probes . The battalion continued to hold the line until 6 : 00 am when , following receipt of orders to withdraw , it moved back to Keat Hong village to take up the role of brigade reserve . The carrier platoon covered the battalion 's withdrawal , and amidst heavy artillery shelling , they ambushed two Japanese columns , each roughly company @-@ sized , inflicting heavy casualties upon them with their Vickers machine @-@ guns before breaking contact . 
 As a result of a misinterpretation of orders , the 22nd Brigade fell back towards Reformatory Road where the 2 / 18th took up positions to the west between the junctions of the Ulu Pandan and Bukit Timah Roads . When the brigade launched a counterattack later that day , the majority of the battalion was held back in reserve , after suffering many casualties . A single company , though , was detached at this time to an ad hoc formation dubbed " X Battalion " , tasked with launching a counterattack . Meanwhile , the rest of the battalion moved back into the reserve position along the Bukit Panjang Road . 
 That evening the 2 / 18th occupied a position north of a feature dubbed " 127 " , but early on the morning of 11 February they were moved back south of there to gain better fields of fire . Shortly after this , the 2 / 18th came under attack from front and rear after the Japanese managed to infiltrate behind their position , forcing the 2 / 18th to fall back further under the cover of the fire from the carriers once again . Later during 11 February , the 22nd Brigade headquarters , situated around Wai Soon Gardens , came under attack from a Japanese force moving south from Bukit Timah . In response , the 2 / 18th launched a counterattack across Reformatory Road with bayonets . At the same time , a section from the battalion 's carrier platoon , under the command of Lieutenant Iven John Mackay , son of Lieutenant General Iven Giffard Mackay , conducted a daring attack that stopped the Japanese advance . Rolling up the axis of the road , firing machine @-@ guns and hurling grenades , they advanced to the Bukit Timah Road before heading south to Holland Road and then returning to battalion headquarters . 
 After this , the 22nd Brigade moved back towards the junction of Holland and Ulu <unk> Roads . Moving while under heavy fire , the battalion established itself in its new position before 9 : 00 am , but in the confusion of the move , some men found themselves separated from the main body and cut off . In the afternoon , after the brigade position was reoriented to the west , the battalion was placed in reserve . The battalion 's positions in the north , situated on the high ground , experienced heavy attack from Japanese aircraft and artillery , as the brigade — supported by Australian and British artillery — fought off two regiments from the Japanese 18th Division during the course of the night of 11 / 12 February . 
 Early the following morning , Varley was promoted to brigadier and took over as commander of the 22nd Brigade from Taylor , who was taken ill . In Varley 's place , Major Charles O 'Brien , who had previously been the battalion second @-@ in @-@ command , took over command of the battalion . After a brief lull in the fighting in the 22nd Brigade 's sector , the Japanese 18th Division attacked again , attempting to take the brigade on its left flank . In response , the 2 / 18th was sent to retake some of the high ground south @-@ east of the Ulu Pandan and Reformatory Roads late in the afternoon . Attacking with about 60 men , supported by three British armoured cars and artillery fire , they were unable to retake the position after the light failed . The Japanese then pressed heavily against the 22nd Brigade 's position , and they were forced to give ground , falling back to the junction of Buona Vista and Holland Roads , by which time the 2 / 18th was down to only 250 men . 
 On 13 February , in an attempt to gain room for a possible counterattack , the Allied commander , Lieutenant General Arthur Percival , ordered a shortening of the Allied lines towards the south @-@ east and the formation of a 25 @-@ mile ( 40 km ) perimeter around Singapore city . As a part of this , the Australian forces were concentrated into a 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) perimeter centred around Farrer and Holland Roads , about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the city , tasked with defending the north @-@ east sector of the defensive line . The 2 / 18th was positioned among the gravestones of Cemetery Hill , and apart from a few minor skirmishes and overflights by Japanese aircraft spotting for artillery , a period of respite followed in the Australian sector . The Japanese skirted the position , moving in an easterly direction towards the city , by way of gaps in the line which opened to the north and south of the Australians through positions held by British , Indian and Malay units . 
 The Japanese continued to advance into the outskirts of Singapore throughout 14 February . Threatened with being isolated , the Australians made plans to make a last stand . With the Japanese closing in , the island 's civilian population began to suffer heavily as they were subjected to heavy artillery bombardment and aerial attacks from Japanese aircraft that were increasingly unopposed as anti @-@ aircraft guns ran out of ammunition . Supplies of water and food also dwindled , and the water shortage was made worse by the loss of the island 's reservoirs . Finally , in the morning of 15 February , after the Japanese had succeeded in infiltrating towards Mount Pleasant Ridge , Percival determined that a counterattack was not viable and instead decided to surrender the garrison . The battalion 's final involvement in the fighting came that afternoon when ' A ' and ' D ' Companies were heavily shelled . A short time later , at 8 : 30 pm , the surrender came into effect and the men of the 2 / 18th received orders not to escape . 
 = = = Prisoners of War = = = 
 While the majority of the 2 / 18th obeyed the order not to escape following the surrender , a small number of men attempted to evade capture . Along with other members of the battalion who had found themselves cut off from the rest of the battalion earlier in the fighting , they attempted to make their way back to Allied lines via Sumatra . There , some were eventually captured , while others managed to get away to Ceylon . Of these , 24 eventually managed to return to Australia , some of whom were transferred to other units and later took part in further fighting in New Guinea . When the Japanese arrived to effect the capture of the 2 / 18th , six men from the carrier platoon , which had earlier inflicted heavy casualties upon the Japanese during the fighting , were ordered to move the battalion 's carriers , before being tied up and executed . Four other 2 / 18th soldiers were killed in the massacre at the Alexandra Hospital . The surviving members of the battalion were then marched 25 miles ( 40 km ) to the prisoner of war camp at Changi . 
 Shortly afterwards , the men were split up and sent to various locations to serve as forced labourers . The majority of the 2 / 18th 's personnel were sent to <unk> Mati , but some remained in Changi , while others were sent to Japan or were sent to work on the Thai – Burma Railway . A total of 174 men were sent to Borneo where in 1945 they were subjected to the Sandakan Death Marches , which only about ten percent of the 2 / 18th men survived . Despite being separated , though , wherever possible the 2 / 18th men sought to stay together in their groups and the battalion structure was maintained even in captivity . The battalion 's first commanding officer , Varley , was one of those sent to Burma where , as senior Allied officer , he worked to secure the welfare of over 9 @,@ 000 men working on the railway , including many from the 2 / 18th . He was later sent to Thailand before being brought back to Singapore once work was completed . In late 1944 he was transferred to Formosa . On 12 September , while en route , the transport ship — <unk> Maru — that he and around 1 @,@ 250 other prisoners were on , was torpedoed by a US submarine , USS Sealion . Varley took charge of several lifeboats of prisoners during the evacuation , attempting to lead them to safety . They were never seen again and are believed to have been machine @-@ gunned several days later by Japanese frigates that were in the area . 
 During their time in captivity , men from the 2 / 18th undertook a number of subversive activities including building a radio transmitter , which they used to contact local resistance groups who provided them with assistance in the form of medicine and intelligence . They were also involved in numerous escape attempts , some of which were successful , alongside Australians from other units . One of these successful escapes involved a group of eight men who escaped from the camp on Berhala Island in two groups . One group escaped while out of camp on a work detail , while the other simply walked out the front gate to use the ablutions and never came back . After meeting up outside the camp , the men split up again . One group included Lieutenant Charles Wagner , who had previously been decorated with the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions around the Nithsdale Estate and who had been commissioned in the field . Having bribed one of the camp guards , Wagner 's group had contacted the local guerillas and arranged to rendezvous with a fishing vessel . After hiding out for three weeks , the vessel eventually arrived offshore and took them on board . The group then met up with the other escapees on Tawi @-@ Tawi where in mid @-@ 1943 they began working with the Filipino guerilla forces , fighting alongside them until the end of the war . Other escapes occurred later in the war , including one in which five men escaped from Ranau over the course of two days in early July 1945 during one of the death marches . After effecting their escape , these men were helped by locals who provided food and information , before the men were able to meet up with some Australians from Z Special Unit . 
 Following the end of the war in August 1945 , the men that survived as prisoners of war were repatriated to Australia . Returning by aircraft and ship , this was largely completed by October , and later that year the battalion was officially disbanded . A total of 1 @,@ 323 men served in the battalion throughout its existence , including reinforcements and personnel that were transferred . The battalion 's battle casualties amounted to 80 killed and 10 wounded in Malaya , as well as 175 killed and 238 wounded in Singapore . On top of this 225 men from the 2 / 18th died in captivity as prisoners of war . For their involvement in the war , members of the battalion received the following decorations : one Military Cross , two Distinguished Conduct Medals , one Military Medal , two Members of the Order of the British Empire , and 11 Mentions in Despatches .

 = The Great Naktong Offensive = 
 The Great Naktong Offensive was a North Korean military offensive against United Nations and Republic of Korea forces early in the Korean War , taking place from September 1 – 15 , 1950 . It was the North Korean People 's Army 's unsuccessful final bid to break the Pusan Perimeter established by the United Nations Command . 
 For the first several months of the war , the North Korean Army successfully defeated and pushed back the United Nations ( UN ) forces south at each encounter . However , by August the UN troops ( which were composed mostly of troops from the United States ( US ) , United Kingdom ( UK ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) had been forced into the 140 @-@ mile ( 230 km ) Pusan Perimeter on the southeast tip of the Korean peninsula . For the first time , the UN troops formed a continuous line which the North Koreans could neither flank nor overwhelm with superior numbers . North Korean offensives on the perimeter were stalled and by the end of August all momentum was lost . Seeing the danger in a prolonged conflict along the perimeter , the North Koreans sought a massive offensive for September to collapse the UN line . 
 The North Koreans subsequently planned a simultaneous offensive for their entire army along five axes of the perimeter ; and on September 1 intense fighting erupted around the cities of Masan , Kyongju , Taegu , Yongch 'on and the Naktong Bulge . What followed was two weeks of extremely brutal fighting as the two sides vied to control the routes into Pusan . Initially successful in some areas , the North Koreans were unable to hold their gains against the numerically and technologically superior UN force . The North Korean army , again stalled at the failure of this offensive , was subsequently destroyed in the UN counterattack at Inchon . 
 = = Background = = 
 From the outbreak of the Korean War following the invasion of South Korea by the North in June 1950 , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them , attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , with the establishment of the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line which the North Koreans could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . 
 When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the NK 6th Division , and later the NK 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan , initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before attacking Komam @-@ ni and Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with large standing units of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of Masan , the NK 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area . In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserves were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the NK 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In the Taegu region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu . Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the NK 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P 'ohang @-@ dong during the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong . All along the front , the North Korean troops were reeling from these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were failing . 
 By the end of August the North Korean troops had been pushed beyond their limits and many of the original units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness . Logistic problems racked the North Korean Army , and shortages of food , weapons , equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for the North Korean units . By late August , the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did , and UN superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily . North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds , and they had fewer than 100 tanks by the time of the Pusan Perimeter fight , to the Americans ' 600 tanks . By the end of August the North Koreans ' only remaining advantage was their initiative . However , the North Korean force retained high morale and enough supply to allow for a large @-@ scale offensive . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use a frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . Fed with intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware that the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu . 
 North Korean planners enlarged the North Korean force in anticipation of a new offensive . The army , originally numbering 10 divisions in two corps , was enlarged to 14 divisions with several independent brigades . The new troops were brought in from reserve forces from North Korea . Marshal Choe Yong Gun served as deputy commander of the North Korean Army , with General Kim Chaek in charge of the Front Headquarters . Beneath them were the NK II Corps in the east , commanded by Lieutenant General Kim Mu Chong , and NK I Corps in the west , under Lieutenant General Kim Ung . II Corps controlled the NK 10th Division , NK 2nd Division , NK 4th Division , NK 9th Division , NK 7th Division , NK 6th Division and NK 105th Armored Division , with the NK 16th Armored Brigade and NK 104th Security Brigade in support . I Corps commanded the NK 3rd Division , NK 13th Division , NK 1st Division , NK 8th Division , NK 15th Division , NK 12th Division , and NK 5th Division with the NK 17th Armored Brigade in support . This force numbered approximately 97 @,@ 850 men , although a third of it comprised raw recruits , forced conscripts from South Korea , and lacked weapons and equipment . By August 31 they were facing a UN force of 120 @,@ 000 combat troops plus 60 @,@ 000 support troops . 
 On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ prong attack against the UN lines . These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back . Five battle groupings were ordered : 
 NK 6th and 7th Divisions break through the US 25th Infantry Division at Masan . 
 NK 9th , 4th , 2nd , and 10th Divisions break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Naktong Bulge to Miryang and Yongsan . 
 NK 3rd , 13th , and 1st Divisions break through the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Division to Taegu . 
 NK 8th and 15th Divisions break through the ROK 8th Division and ROK 6th Division to Hayang and Yongch 'on . 
 NK 12th and 5th Divisions break through the ROK Capital Division and ROK 3rd Division to P 'ohang @-@ dong and Kyongju . 
 On August 22 the North Korean premier , Kim Il Sung , had ordered his forces to conclude the war by September 1 , yet the scale of the offensive did not allow this . Groups 1 and 2 were to begin their attack at 23 : 30 on August 31 , and Groups 3 , 4 and 5 would begin their attacks at 18 : 00 on September 2 . The attacks were to closely connect in order to overwhelm UN troops at each point simultaneously , forcing breakthroughs in multiple places that the UN would be unable to reinforce . The North Koreans relied primarily on night attacks to counter UN air superiority and naval firepower , with the North Korean generals believing that such attacks would prevent UN forces from firing effectively and result in heavy casualties from friendly fire . 
 The attacks caught UN planners and troops by surprise . By August 26 , the UN troops thought they had destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter , and anticipated the war ending by late November . ROK units , in the meantime , suffered from low morale as a result of their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict , and a cautious US Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter to the P 'ohang @-@ dong area to shore up the ROK I Corps , which was falling apart due to low morale . UN troops were preparing for Operation Chromite , an amphibious assault on the port of Inchon on September 15 , and did not anticipate that the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then .

 The first North Korean attack struck the UN right flank on the east coast . Although the NK II Corps general attack in the north and east was planned for September 2 , the NK 12th Division , now with a strength of 5 @,@ 000 men , started to move forward from the mountains earlier than planned , from where it had reorganized after its defeat in the Kigye and P 'ohang @-@ dong area . The division was low in food supply , weapons , and ammunition , and its men suffered from low morale . Facing the NK 12th Division was the ROK Capital Division . At 04 : 00 on August 27 , a North Korean attack overran one company of the ROK 17th Regiment , Capital Division , north of Kigye . This caused the whole regiment to buckle and retreat . Then the ROK 18th Regiment to the east fell back because of its exposed flank . The ROK 17th Regiment lost the town of Kigye in pulling back , and the entire Capital Division fell back 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to the south side of the Kigye valley . 
 Walker ordered Major General John B. Coulter to observe the ROK troops on the east . Coulter flew to Kyongju , arriving there at 12 : 00 that day . Walker in the meantime formally appointed Coulter Deputy Commander , Eighth Army , placing him in command of the ROK I Corps which controlled the Capital and 3rd Divisions , the US 21st Infantry Regiment , the 3rd Battalion , US 9th Infantry Regiment , and the 73rd Medium Tank Battalion , less C Company . Coulter designated these units Task Force Jackson and established his headquarters in the same building in Kyongju in which the ROK I Corps commander and the Korean Military Advisory Group ( KMAG ) officers had their command post . 
 Coulter was tasked with eliminating the North Korean penetration in the Kigye area and of seizing and organizing the high ground extending from north of Yongch 'on to the coast at <unk> 'o @-@ ri , about 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of P 'ohang @-@ dong . This line passed 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of Kigye . Coulter was to attack as soon as possible with Task Force Jackson to gain the first high ground north of Kigye . The US 21st Infantry Regiment was moving to a position north of Taegu on the morning of August 27 , when Walker revoked its orders and instructed it to turn around and proceed as rapidly as possible to Kyongju and report to Coulter . Coulter immediately sent the 3rd Battalion north to An 'gang @-@ ni where it went into a position behind the ROK Capital Division . 
 Coulter 's plan to attack on August 28 had to be postponed . Brigadier General Kim Hong Il , the ROK I Corps commander , told him he could not attack , that there were too many casualties and the South Korean were exhausted . The NK 5th Division above P 'ohang @-@ dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back . On the 28th , the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division and Brigadier General Kim Suk Won clashed over whether the division should retreat or attack . That day , August 28 , Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army , and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense , Shin Sung @-@ mo . He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter , and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible , counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains . 
 At the same time , elements of the NK 5th Division penetrated the ROK 3rd Division southwest of P 'ohang @-@ dong . Coulter directed the 21st Infantry to repel this penetration . During the day on August 29 , B Company , 21st Infantry , supported by a platoon of tanks of B Company , 73rd Medium Tank Battalion , successfully counterattacked northwest from the southern edge of P 'ohang @-@ dong for a distance of 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) , with ROK troops following . The American units then withdrew to P 'ohang @-@ dong . That night the ROK 's withdrew , and the next day an American infantry @-@ tank force repeated the action of the day before . The 21st Infantry then took over from the ROK 3rd Division a sector extending north and northwest of P 'ohang @-@ dong . Also on August 29 , the ROK Capital Division , with American tank and artillery support , recaptured Kigye and held it during the night against North Korean counterattacks , only to lose it again at dawn . American air attacks continued at an increased tempo in the Kigye area . 
 At the same time , North Korean pressure built up steadily north of P 'ohang @-@ dong , where the NK 5th Division fed replacements on to Hill 99 in front of the ROK 23rd Regiment . This hill became almost as notorious as Hill 181 near Yongdok had earlier because of the almost continuous and bloody fighting that occurred there for its control . Although aided by US air strikes and artillery and naval gunfire , the ROK 3rd Division was not able to capture this hill , and suffered many casualties in the effort . On September 2 the US 21st Infantry attacked northwest from P 'ohang @-@ dong in an effort to help the South Koreans recapture Hill 99 . A platoon of tanks followed the valley road between P 'ohang @-@ dong and Hunghae . The regimental commander assigned K Company Hill 99 as its objective . The company was unable to take Hill 99 from the well dug @-@ in North Koreans . At dusk a North Korean penetration occurred along the boundary between the ROK Capital and 3rd Divisions 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Kigye . 
 The next morning , September 2 at 01 : 30 , the NK 12th Division , executing its part of the coordinated NK II Corps general attack , struck the Capital Division on the high hill masses south of the Kigye valley . This attack threw back the ROK 18th Regiment on the left in the area of Hills 334 and 438 , and the ROK 17th Regiment on the right in the area of Hill 445 . By dawn of September 3 , the North Korean penetration there had reached the vital east @-@ west corridor road 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of An 'gang @-@ ni . As a result of this gain during the night , the NK 12th Division had advanced 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) and the Capital Division all but collapsed . This forced Coulter to withdraw the 21st Infantry from the line northwest of P 'ohang @-@ dong and concentrate it in the vicinity of Kyongju . The 2nd Battalion had joined the regiment on August 31 , but Coulter had held it in the task force 's reserve at An 'gang @-@ ni . That battalion now took up a horseshoe @-@ shaped defense position around the town , with some elements on high ground 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east where they protected the Kyongju to P 'ohang @-@ dong highway . The rest of the regiment closed into an assembly area north of Kyongju . At the same time , Walker started the newly activated ROK 7th Division toward the North Korean penetration . Its ROK 5th Regiment closed at Yongch 'on that afternoon , and the ROK 3rd Regiment , less its 1st Battalion , closed at Kyongju in the evening . Walker also authorized Coulter to use the 3rd Battalion , 9th Infantry ; the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company ; and the 15th Field Artillery Battalion as he deemed advisable . These units , held at Yonil Airfield for its defense , had not previously been available for commitment elsewhere . 
 During the day on September 3 , Coulter and the KMAG advisers continued to clash with the ROK 3rd Division commander , who repeatedly attempted to withdraw his troops against their orders . That night , September 3 / 4 , the remainder of the ROK I Corps front collapsed . Three North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment . Following a mortar preparation , the North Koreans entered An 'gang @-@ ni at 0220 . An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused . American units disengaged and withdrew and by nightfall , North Koreans held the town and began advancing southward along the railroad . 
 By 12 : 00 on September 4 , North Korean units had established roadblocks along the Kyongju @-@ An 'gang @-@ ni road within 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of Kyongju . A 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) gap existed between the ROK 3rd and Capital Divisions in the P 'ohang @-@ dong area . But the big break in the UN line was in the high mountain mass west of the Hyongsan valley and southwest of An 'gang @-@ ni . In this area northwest of Kyongju there was an 8 miles ( 13 km ) gap between the Capital Division and the ROK 8th Division to the west . From that direction the North Koreans posed a threat to the railroad and the road net running south through the Kyongju corridor to Pusan . Faced with this big gap on his left flank , Coulter put the US 21st Infantry in the broad valley and on its bordering hills northwest of Kyongju to block any approach from that direction . 
 The night of September 5 / 6 , events reached a climax inside P 'ohang @-@ dong . The ROK division commander , Brigadier General Lee Jun <unk> and several members of his senior staff claimed they became sick after their command post was hit with artillery fire . The division withdrew from P 'ohang @-@ dong , and on September 6 it was again in North Korean hands . The ROK Army relieved both the ROK I Corps and the ROK 3rd Division commanders . At this time new commanders were appointed for these major commands . Brigadier General Kim Paik Il took command of ROK I Corps , while Capital Division came under command of Colonel Song Yo Ch 'an , and ROK 3rd Division came under command of Colonel Lee Jong Ch 'an .

 In the high mountains between the Taegu sector on the west and the Kyongju @-@ east coast sector , two North Korean divisions , the 8th and 15th , also prepared an attack south on September 1 to break the supply route between Taegu and P 'ohang @-@ dong , which was in the vicinity of Hayang and Yongch 'on . This attack would coordinate with the North Korean offensive in the Kigye @-@ P 'ohang area . Hayang is 12 miles ( 19 km ) , and Yongch 'on 20 miles ( 32 km ) east of Taegu . The NK 8th Division was astride the main Andong @-@ <unk> @-@ Yongch 'on road 20 miles ( 32 km ) northwest of Yongch 'on and the NK 15th Division was eastward in the mountains just below Andong , 35 miles ( 56 km ) north of Yongch 'on on a poor and mountainous secondary road . The objective of the NK 8th Division was Hayang ; the objective of the 15th was Yongch 'on , which the division had orders to take at all costs . Opposing the NK 8th Division was the ROK 6th Division ; in front of the NK 15th Division stood the ROK 8th Division . 
 In ten days of fighting the NK 8th Division gained only a few miles ( km ) , and not until September 12 did it have possession of <unk> @-@ dong , 14 miles ( 23 km ) northwest of Yongch 'on . In this time it lost nearly all the 21 new T @-@ 34 tanks of the 17th Armored Brigade that were supporting it . Just below <unk> @-@ dong , mountains close in on the road , with Hill 928 ( Hwa @-@ san ) on the east and lesser peaks on the west . At this passage of the mountains into the Taegu corridor , the ROK 6th Division decisively defeated the NK 8th Division and practically destroyed it . By September 8 some of the North Korean battalions could muster no more than 20 men . 
 On the next road eastward above Yongch 'on , the NK 15th Division launched its attack against the ROK 8th Division on September 2 . Although far understrength , with its three regiments reportedly having a total of only 3 @,@ 600 men , it penetrated in four days to the lateral corridor at Yongch 'on . North of the town , one regiment of the ROK 8th Division crumbled when a T @-@ 34 tank got behind its lines . Elements of the North Korean division were in and south of Yongch 'on by September 6 . The North Koreans did not remain in the town , but moved to the hills south and southeast of it overlooking the road between Taegu and P 'ohang @-@ dong . On September 7 some of the North Korean troops established a roadblock 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) southeast of Yongch 'on , and other elements attacked a ROK regiment 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of the town . During the day , however , the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division , attacking from the east along the lateral corridor , cleared Yongch 'on itself of North Koreans and then went into a defensive position north of the town . But the next day , September 8 , additional elements of the NK 15th Division arrived before Yongch 'on and recaptured it . That afternoon the ROK 11th Regiment of the ROK 1st Division arrived from the Taegu front and counterattacked the North Koreans in and near the town . This action succeeded in clearing the North Koreans from most of Yongch 'on , but some North Koreans still held the railroad station southeast of it . Still others were an unknown distance southeast on the road toward Kyongju . 
 In the hills southeast and east of Yongch 'on , the NK 15th Division encountered very stiff resistance . Its artillery regiment outpaced the North Korean infantry , expended its ammunition , and , without support , was then largely destroyed by ROK counterattack . The North Korean artillery commander was killed in the action . After the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments arrived in the vicinity of Yongch 'on to reinforce the demoralized 8th Division , South Korean action against the North Korean units was so intense that the two armies had no chance to regroup for co @-@ ordinating action . On September 9 and 10 ROK units surrounded and virtually destroyed the NK 15th Division southeast of Yongch 'on on the hills bordering the Kyongju road . The North Korean division chief of staff , Colonel Kim Yon , was killed there together with many other high @-@ ranking officers . The part played by KMAG officers in rounding up stragglers of the ROK 8th Division and in reorganizing its units was an important factor in the successful outcome of these battles . On September 10 , the ROK 8th Division cleared the Yongch 'on @-@ Kyongju road of the North Koreans , capturing two tanks , six howitzers , a 76 mm self @-@ propelled gun , several antitank guns , and many small arms . 
 Advancing north of Yongch 'on after the retreating survivors of the NK 15th Division , the ROK 8th Division and the 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division encountered almost no resistance . On September 12 , elements of the two ROK organizations were 8 miles ( 13 km ) north of the town . On that day they captured four 120 mm mortars , four antitank guns , four artillery pieces , nine trucks , two machine guns , and numerous small arms . ROK forces now also advanced east from Yongch 'on and north from Kyongju to close the breach in their lines . 
 The most critical period of the fighting in the east occurred when the NK 15th Division broke through the ROK 8th Division to Yongch 'on . The North Korean division attempted to turn east and southeast and take Task Force Jackson in the rear or on its left flank . But Walker 's quick dispatch of the ROK 5th and 11th Regiments from two widely separated sectors of the front to the area of penetration resulted in destroying the force before it could exploit its breakthrough . Walker was commended for his judgment of the reinforcements needed to stem the North Korean attacks in the Kyongju and Yongch 'on areas .

 While four divisions of the NK II Corps attacked south in the P 'ohang @-@ dong , Kyongju , and Yongch 'on area , the remaining three divisions of the corps — the 3rd , 13th , and 1st — conducted a converging attack on Taegu from the north and northwest . The NK 3rd Division was to attack in the Waegwan area northwest of Taegu , the NK 13th Division down the mountain ridges north of Taegu along and west of the Sangju @-@ Taegu road , and the NK 1st Division along the high mountain ridges just east of the road . 
 Defending Taegu , the US 1st Cavalry Division had a frontage of approximately 35 miles ( 56 km ) . The Divisional Commander Major General Hobart R. Gay <unk> the main avenues of entry into his zone and kept his three regiments concentrated behind these outposts . Walker ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to attack north on September 1 in an effort to divert some of the North Korean strength from the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions in the south . Gay 's initial decision upon receipt of this order was to attack north up the Sangju road , but his staff and regimental commanders all joined in urging that the attack instead be against Hill 518 in the US 7th Cavalry zone . Only two days before , Hill 518 had been in the ROK 1st Division zone and had been considered a North Korean assembly point . The US 1st Cavalry Division , accordingly , prepared for an attack in the 7th Cavalry sector and for diversionary attacks by two companies of the 3rd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , on the 7th Cavalry 's right flank . This left the 8th Cavalry only one infantry company in reserve . The regiment 's 1st Battalion was on the hill mass to the west of the Bowling Alley and north of Tabu @-@ dong ; its 2nd Battalion was astride the road . 
 This planned attack against Hill 518 coincided with the defection of Major Kim Song Jun of the NK 19th Regiment , NK 13th Division . He reported that a full @-@ scale North Korean attack was to begin at dusk that day . The NK 13th Division , he said , had just taken in 4 @,@ 000 replacements , 2 @,@ 000 of them without weapons , and was now back to a strength of approximately 9 @,@ 000 men . Upon receiving this intelligence , Gay alerted all front @-@ line units to be prepared for the attack . 
 <unk> with Eighth Army 's order for a spoiling attack against the North Koreans northwest of Taegu , Gay ordered the 7th Cavalry to attack on September 2 and seize Hill 518 . Situated north of the lateral Waegwan @-@ Tabu – dong road , and about midway between the two towns , it was a critical terrain feature dominating the road between the two places . After securing Hill 518 , the 7th Cavalry attack was to continue on to Hill 314 . Air strikes and artillery preparations were to precede the infantry attack . 
 On the morning of September 2 the US Air Force delivered a 37 @-@ minute strike against Hills 518 and 346 . The artillery then laid down its concentrations on the hills , and after that the planes came over again with napalm , leaving the heights on fire . Just after 10 : 00 , and immediately after the final napalm strike , the 1st Battalion , US 7th Cavalry , attacked up Hill 518 . The heavy air strikes and the artillery preparations had failed to dislodge the North Koreans . From their positions they delivered mortar and machine @-@ gun fire on the climbing infantry , stopping the weak lead elements of the US force short of the crest . In the afternoon the US battalion withdrew from Hill 518 and attacked northeast against Hill 490 , from which other North Korean troops had fired in support of the North Koreans on Hill 518 . The next day at 12 : 00 , the newly arrived 3rd Battalion resumed the attack against Hill 518 from the south , as did the 1st Battalion the day before , in a column of companies that resolved itself in the end into a column of squads . Again the attack failed . Other attacks failed on September 4 . A North Korean forward observer captured on Hill 518 said that 1 @,@ 200 North Koreans were dug in on the hill and that they had large numbers of mortars and ammunition to hold out . 
 While these attacks were in progress on its right , the 2nd Battalion , 5th Cavalry Regiment , on September 4 attacked and captured Hill 303 . The next day it had difficulty in holding the hill against counterattacks . By September 4 it had become clear that the NK 3rd Division in front of the 5th and 7th Cavalry Regiments was also attacking , and despite continued air strikes , artillery preparations , and infantry efforts on Hill 518 , it was infiltrating large numbers of its troops to the rear of the attacking US forces . That night large North Korean forces came through the gap between the 3rd Battalion on the southern slope of Hill 518 and the 2nd Battalion westward . The North Koreans turned west and occupied Hill 464 in force . By September 5 , Hill 464 to the rear of the US 7th Cavalry had more North Koreans on it than Hill 518 to its front . The North Koreans cut the Waegwan to Tabu @-@ dong road east of the regiment so that its communications with other US units now were only to the west . During the day the 7th Cavalry made a limited withdrawal on Hill 518 , giving up on capturing the hill . 
 On the division 's right , Tabu @-@ dong was in North Korean hands , on the left Waegwan was a no @-@ man 's land , and in the center strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518 . The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan @-@ Tabu @-@ dong lateral supply road behind it , and was in danger of being surrounded . After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker , on September 5 Gay issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position . 
 Heavy rains fell during the night of September 5 / 6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked vehicles in the withdrawal . The 2nd Battalion disengaged from the North Korean and began its withdrawal at 03 : 00 on September 6 . The North Koreans quickly discovered that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it . In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by North Koreans . Moving by itself and completely cut off from all other units , G Company , numbering only about 80 men , was hardest hit . 
 On the division 's left , meanwhile , the 2nd Battalion , 5th Cavalry , on Hill 303 came under heavy attack and the battalion commander wanted to withdraw . This battalion suffered heavy casualties before it abandoned Hill 303 on the September 6 to the North Koreans . While G Company was trying to escape from Hill 464 , the rest of the 2nd Battalion was cut off at the eastern base of Hill 380 , to the south . Later in the day on September 7 , the battalion received radio orders to withdraw by any route as soon as possible . It moved southwest into the 5th Cavalry sector . 
 East of the 2nd Battalion , the North Koreans attacked the 1st Battalion in its new position on September 7 and overran the battalion aid station , killing four and wounding seven men . That night the 1st Battalion was attached to the 5th Cavalry Regiment . The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment moved to a point near Taegu in division reserve . During the night of September 7 / 8 the 5th Cavalry Regiment on division orders withdrew still farther below Waegwan to new defensive positions astride the main Seoul @-@ Taegu highway . The North Korean 3rd Division was still moving reinforcements across the Naktong . Observers sighted barges loaded with troops and artillery pieces crossing the river 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Waegwan on the evening of the 7th . On the 8th the North Korean communiqué claimed the capture of Waegwan . 
 The next day the situation grew worse for the 1st Cavalry Division . On its left flank , the NK 3rd Division forced the 1st Battalion , 5th Cavalry , to withdraw from Hill 345 , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Waegwan . The North Koreans pressed forward and the 5th Cavalry was immediately locked in hard , seesaw fighting on Hills 203 and 174 . The 1st Battalion , 7th Cavalry , before it left that sector to rejoin its regiment , finally captured the latter hill after four attacks . 
 Only with difficulty did the 5th Cavalry Regiment hold Hill 203 on September 12 . Between midnight and 04 : 00 on September 13 , the North Koreans attacked again and took Hill 203 from E Company , Hill 174 from L Company , and Hill 188 from B and F Companies . In an afternoon counterattack the regiment regained Hill 188 on the south side of the highway , but failed against Hills 203 and 174 on the north side . On the 14th , I Company again attacked Hill 174 , which had by now changed hands seven times . In this action the company suffered 82 casualties . Even so , the company held only one side of the hill , the North Korean held the other , and grenade battles between the two continued for another week . The battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment were so low in strength at this time that they were not considered combat effective . This seesaw battle continued in full 8 miles ( 13 km ) northwest of Taegu . 
 = = = = Ka @-@ san = = = = 
 The 1st Cavalry Division commander , Gay , alerted all of his division 's front @-@ line units to be prepared for the attack in the Ka @-@ san sector as well . ROK 1st Division commander Major General Paik Sun Yup also braced his men for attack . 
 The attack hit with full force in the " Bowling Alley " area north of Taegu . The attack caught the US 8th Cavalry Regiment unprepared at Sangju . The division was poorly deployed along the road to that town , lacking a reserve force to counterattack effectively . The North Koreans struck the 2nd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , the night of September 2 / 3 on Hill 448 west of the Bowling Alley and 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Tabu @-@ dong , and overran it . The overrun 2nd Battalion withdrew through the 3rd Battalion which had assembled hastily in a defensive position south of Tabu @-@ dong . During the day , elements of the NK 1st Division forced the 8th Cavalry I & R Platoon and a detachment of South Korean police from the Walled City of Ka @-@ san on the crest of Hill 902 , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east of Tabu @-@ dong . On September 3 , therefore , the UN command , the Eighth Army lost both Tabu @-@ dong and Hill 902 , locally called Ka @-@ san , the dominant mountain @-@ top 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of Taegu . 
 This sudden surge of the North Koreans southward toward Taegu concerned Walker . The Army ordered an ROK battalion from the Taegu Replacement Training Center to a position in the rear of the 8th Cavalry , and the 1st Cavalry Division organized Task Force Allen , to be commanded by Assistant Division Commander Brigadier General Frank A. Allen , Jr . It was to be used in combat as an emergency force should the North Koreans break through to the edge of Taegu . Eighth Army countered the North Korean advance down the Tabu @-@ dong road by ordering the 1st Cavalry Division to recapture and defend Hill 902 . This hill , 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of Taegu , afforded observation all the way south through Eighth Army positions into the city , and , in North Korean hands , could be used for general intelligence purposes and to direct artillery and mortar fire . 
 Colonel Raymond D. Palmer , commanding the 8th Cavalry Regiment was ordered to retake the mountain with the help of several support units . The next morning , September 4 , the force moved to Ka @-@ san and set up an assembly area near the village of <unk> @-@ dong 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of the Tabu @-@ dong road . During the afternoon and evening of September 3 , the NK 2nd Battalion , 2nd Regiment , 1st Division , had occupied the summit of Ka @-@ san . The engineer company started its attack up the mountain about noon of September 4 , following a trail up a southern spur . Less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) up the trail , the company came under machine gun fire twice . North Korean mortar fire also struck the company during its climb , but the head of the company arrived at the bowl @-@ shaped summit of Hill 755 , the southern arm of the Hill 902 crest . The platoon commander placed the 90 men of his company in position facing in an arc from west to northeast ; the 2nd Platoon took the left flank near the stone wall , the 1st Platoon took the center position on a wooded knoll , and the 3rd Platoon the right flank at the edge of a woods . The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall . 
 As several squads left the hill on a patrol , North Koreans attacked the main company position behind it . The platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left . Some of the men in the advanced squad made their way back to US lines , but North Koreans captured most near the bottom of Ka @-@ san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines . About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755 , an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902 . The company to turned back this attack . That night , North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks . 
 At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked . The engineers repulsed this attack but suffered some casualties . Ammunition was running low and three US C @-@ 47 Skytrain aircraft came over the area to make an airdrop . The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the North Korean positions . Immediately after the airdrops , two F @-@ 51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company , also in error . Soon after this aerial attack , North Korean troops attacked the positions . 
 Sometime between 10 : 00 and 11 : 00 , E Company , 8th Cavalry Regiment , arrived on top of Hill 755 and came into D Company 's perimeter . North Korean fire , killing several of the porters , turned it back . Shortly after the E Company platoon joined Vandygriff , the North Koreans attacked again unsuccessfully . The American units , out of ammunition , relied on captured North Korean equipment . At 13 : 30 Gay ordered the 8th Cavalry Regiment to withdraw its men off Ka @-@ san . Gay believed he had insufficient forces to secure and hold it and that the North Koreans had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery and mortar fire . Rain started falling again and heavy fog closed in on the mountain top and severely reduced visibility there . Again the North Koreans attacked as the final units began their withdrawal . When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled , Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties ; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action . 
 Soldiers of the ROK 1st Division captured a North Korean near Ka @-@ san on September 4 who said that about 800 North Korean soldiers were on Ka @-@ san with three more battalions following them from the north . The engineer company had succeeded only in establishing a perimeter briefly within the North Korean @-@ held area . By evening of September 5 , Ka @-@ san was securely in North Korean hands with an estimated five battalions , totaling about 1 @,@ 500 soldiers , on the mountain and its forward slope . By September 10 , 400 – 500 North Koreans were on the ridge of Ka @-@ San , as observed by a T @-@ 6 Mosquito spotter plane . Now , with Ka @-@ san firmly in their possession , the NK 13th and 1st Divisions made ready to press on downhill into Taegu they set up a roadblock which was repulsed the next day . Even though the 1st Cavalry Division fell back nearly everywhere on September 7 , Walker ordered it and the ROK II Corps to attack and seize Hill 902 and Ka @-@ san . On the morning of September 8 , an estimated 1 @,@ 000 North Korean soldiers were on Hill 570 , 8 miles ( 13 km ) north of Taegu , and Walker decided the continued pressure against the eastern flank of the 1st Cavalry Division sector was the most immediate threat to the UN Forces at Pusan Perimeter . That same day , the 1st Cavalry Division canceled a planned continuation of the attack against Hill 570 by the 3rd Battalion , US 7th Cavalry Regiment , when North Korean forces threatened Hills 314 and 660 , south and east of 570 . 
 In the midst of this drive on Taegu , an ammunition shortage became critical for the UN forces . Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105 mm howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day , except in cases of emergency . Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply . The 17th Field Artillery Battalion , with the first 8 @-@ inch howitzers to arrive in Korea , could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition . 
 The NK 1st Division now began moving in the zone of the ROK 1st Division around the right flank of the 1st Cavalry Division . Its 2nd Regiment , with 1 @,@ 200 men , advanced 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) eastward from the vicinity of Hill 902 to the towering 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) high mountain of P 'algong @-@ san . It reached the top of P 'algong @-@ san about daylight on September 10 , and a little later new replacements made a charge toward the ROK positions . The ROK repulsed the charge , killing or wounding about two @-@ thirds of the attacking force . 
 The US 1st Cavalry Division now had most of its combat units concentrated on its right flank north of Taegu . The 3rd Battalion , 7th Cavalry , attached to the 8th Cavalry Regiment , was behind that regiment on Hills 181 and 182 astride the Tabu @-@ dong road only 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north of Taegu . The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment ( the 1st Battalion rejoined the regiment during the day ) was in the valley of the Kumho River to the right rear between the North Koreans and the Taegu Airfield , which was situated 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) northeast of the city . The US 5th Cavalry Regiment was disposed on the hills astride the Waegwan road 8 miles ( 13 km ) northwest of Taegu . On its left the entire 8th Engineer Combat Battalion was in line as infantry , with the mission of holding a bridge across the Kumho River near its juncture with the Naktong River east of Taegu . 
 The fighting north of Taegu on September 11 in the vicinity of Hills 660 and 314 was heavy and confused . For a time , the 1st Cavalry Division feared a breakthrough to the blocking position of the 3d Battalion , 7th Cavalry . The rifle companies of the division were now very low in strength . While the 3rd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , again vainly attacked Hill 570 on September 11 , North Korean soldiers seized the crest of Hill 314 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) southeast of it and that much closer to Taegu . The 3rd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , hurried to the scene from its attacks on Hill 570 and tried to retake the position . The 3rd Battalion , 7th Cavalry , command post had to fight off infiltrating North Koreans on September 12 as it issued its attack order and prepared to attack through the 8th Cavalry lines against Hill 314 . This attack on the 12th was to be part of a larger American and ROK counterattack against the NK 13th and 1st Divisions in an effort to halt them north of Taegu . The 2nd Battalion , 7th Cavalry , relieved the ROK units on Hill 660 , east of Hill 314 , and had the mission of securing that hill . Farther east the ROK 1st Division had the mission of attacking from P 'algong @-@ san toward Ka @-@ san . The point nearest Taegu occupied by North Korean forces at this time was Hill 314 . The NK 13th Division valued its possession and had concentrated about 700 soldiers on it . The North Koreans intended to use Hill 314 in making the next advance on Taegu . From it , observation reached to Taegu and it commanded the lesser hills southward rimming the Taegu bowl . Hill 314 is actually the southern knob of a 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) hill mass which lies close to the east side of Hill 570 and is separated from that hill mass only by a deep gulch . The southern point rises to 314 metres ( 1 @,@ 030 ft ) and the ridge line climbs northward from it in a series of knobs . The ridge line is 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) in length , and all sides of the hill mass are very steep . 
 Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch 's 3rd Battalion , 7th Cavalry , numbered 535 men on the eve of its attack against Hill 314 , less its rear echelons . The US troops took the hill and fended off a <unk> . Many of the officers in the companies were wounded but refused evacuation and simply continued the attack . The North Korean soldiers on Hill 314 wore American uniforms , helmets , and combat boots . Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines . About 200 North Korean dead were on the hill . Of the other 500 estimated to have been there , most of them had been wounded or were missing . After the capture of Hill 314 on September 12 , the situation north of Taegu improved . On September 14 the 2nd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , attacked and , supported by fire from Hill 314 , gained part of Hill 570 from the NK 19th Regiment , 13th Division . 
 Across the army boundary on the right , the ROK 1st Division continued its attack northwest and advanced to the edge of Ka @-@ san . The ROK 11th Regiment seized Hill 755 about dark on September 14 , and small elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached the stone ramparts of the Ka @-@ san area at the same time . The ROK and North Korean troops fought during the night and on into the 15th at many points along the high mountain backbone that extends southeast from Ka @-@ san to Hills 755 and 783 and on to P 'algong @-@ san . The ROK 1st Division later estimated that approximately 3 @,@ 000 North Koreans were inside Ka @-@ san 's walled perimeter and about 1 @,@ 500 or 2 @,@ 000 outside it near the crest . At this time the bulk of the NK 1st Division was gradually withdrawing into Ka @-@ san and its vicinity . Indications were that the NK 13th Division also was withdrawing northward . Aerial observers on the afternoon of September 14 reported that an estimated 500 North Korean troops were moving north from Tabu @-@ dong . While these signs were hopeful , Walker continued to prepare for a final close @-@ in defense of Taegu . As part of this , 14 battalions of South Korean police dug in around the city . 
 The fighting continued unabated north of Taegu on the 15th . The 2nd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , still fought to gain control of Hill 570 on the east side of the Tabu @-@ dong highway . On the other side , the 3rd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , attacked Hill 401 where a North Korean force had penetrated in a gap between the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments . The fighting on Hill 401 was particularly severe . Both sides had troops on the mountain when night fell .

 During the North Koreans ' September 1 offensive , the US 25th Infantry Division 's US 35th Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle of Nam River north of Masan . On the 35th Regiment 's right flank , just north of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River , was the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division . There , in the southernmost part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone , the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) long , including the bulge area of the Naktong where the First Battle of Naktong Bulge had taken place earlier in August . Each US infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front . 
 During the last week of August , US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river , which they thought were North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the Naktong against a possible American attack . There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry 's forward positions , but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action . On August 31 , the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines . Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming . 
 On the west side of the Naktong , North Korean Major General Pak Kyo Sam , commanding the NK 9th Division , issued his operations order to the division on August 28 . Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at Naktong Bulge by capturing the Miryang and Samnangjin areas to cut off the US 2nd Division 's route of supply and withdrawal between Taegu and Pusan . However , the North Koreans were not aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the Naktong River . Consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea . They had only recently been moved into the line . The North Koreans began crossing the Naktong River under cover of darkness at certain points . 
 The first North Korean crossing at the <unk> ferry caught a Heavy Mortar Platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons . It also caught most of the D and H Company , 9th Infantry men at the base of Hill 209 , .5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from the crossing site . The North Koreans killed or captured many of the troops there . The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attack engulfed the men below . It hurried on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter . This group was not attacked during the night . 
 From 21 : 30 until shortly after midnight the NK 9th Division crossed the Naktong at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line positions . Then , when the artillery barrage preparation lifted , the North Korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults . These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward . At each crossing site the North Koreans would overwhelm local UN defenders before building pontoon bridges for their vehicles and armor . 
 At 02 : 00 , B Company was attacked . The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311 , a rugged terrain feature a 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the river and the North Koreans ' principal immediate objective . On Hill 209 the North Koreans drove B Company from its position , inflicting very heavy casualties on it . 
 At 03 : 00 , 1 September , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve , E Company , to move west along the Yongsan @-@ Naktong River road and take a blocking position at the pass between Cloverleaf Hill and Obong @-@ ni Ridge , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the river and 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from Yongsan . This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the Naktong Bulge . Fighting began at the pass at 02 : 30 . A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire at 03 : 30 from positions astride the road east of the pass . With the critical parts of Cloverleaf Hill and Obong @-@ ni Ridge , the best defensive terrain between Yongsan and the river , the North Koreans controlled the high ground . The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of Yongsan on relatively poor defensive terrain , the low hills at the western edge of the town . 
 North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the Naktong , the US 23rd Infantry Regiment on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion of the US 38th Infantry Regiment , which in turn had only a few days before relieved the US 21st Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division . It took over a 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) front on the Naktong River without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north . On August 31 the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector . 
 At 21 : 00 the first shells of what proved to be a two @-@ hour North Korean artillery and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon . As the barrage rolled on , North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire . At 23 : 00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked along the battalion outpost line . As the North Korean attack developed during the night , 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force , less C Company , just north of Lake U @-@ p 'o and the hills there covering the northern road into Changnyong , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of the river and 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west of the town . B Company lost heavily in this action . 
 When word of the disaster that had overtaken 1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters , G and F Companies from 2nd Division reserve were sent to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road toward Pugong @-@ ni and C Company . This force was unable to reach C Company , but Lieutenant Colonel Carl C. Jensen collected stragglers from it and seized high ground astride this main approach to Changnyong near <unk> 'o @-@ ri above Lake <unk> , and went into a defensive position there . The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of the 23rd Regiment in front of Changnyong . North Korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion 's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions . The 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Service Companies and other miscellaneous regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of Changnyong . 
 Before the morning of 1 September had passed , reports coming in to US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that North Koreans had penetrated to the north @-@ south Changnyong @-@ Yongsan road and cut the division in two ; the 38th and 23d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south . Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces . Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes , in command of the northern group . Southward , in the Yongsan area , Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley , Assistant Division Commander , in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment , the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , most of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and other miscellaneous units of the division . This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley . 
 All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division — the 4th , 17th , and 6th , in line from north to south — crossed during the night to the east side of the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector . The NK 2nd Division , concentrated in the Sinban @-@ ni area west of the river , had , in effect , attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U @-@ p 'o . On August 31 , 1950 , Lake U @-@ p 'o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow . The massive North Korean attack had made deep penetrations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry . The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry ; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry ; and the NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hyongp 'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector . 
 Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken . As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a hole 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) wide and 8 miles ( 13 km ) deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe penetrations elsewhere . The front @-@ line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of disorganization and some companies had virtually disappeared . Keiser hoped he could organize a defense along the Changnyong @-@ Yongsan road east of the Naktong River , and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading to Miryang and Ch <unk> . 
 Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Division sector . There the North Koreans threatened Miryang and with it the entire Eighth Army position . Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward Craig , commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the Marines to move at once . The Marines made ready to depart for the Naktong Bulge at 13 : 30 . 
 North of the US 9th Infantry and the battles in the Naktong Bulge and around Yongsan , the US 23rd Infantry Regiment after daylight of September 1 was in a very precarious position . Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) westward . Approximately 400 North Koreans now overran the regimental command post , compelling Colonel Paul L. Freeman to withdraw it about 600 yards ( 550 m ) . There , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of Changnyong , the US 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Headquarters Company , miscellaneous regimental units , and regimental staff officers checked the North Koreans in a 3 @-@ hour fight . 
 Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active . At 06 : 00 on September 3 , 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post . This fight continued until September 5 . On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 North Koreans . 
 Meanwhile , during these actions in its rear , the 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , was cut off 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of the nearest friendly units . On the morning of September 1 , 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near Mosan @-@ ni to open the road to the 1st Battalion . On the second day of the fighting at the pass , the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire . The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17 : 00 on September 2 . That evening , North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry , on Hill 209 north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion , driving one company from its position . 
 On September 4 , Haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments , giving the northern part of the 23rd 's sector to the 38th Infantry , thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to Changnyong . The 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , about 1 @,@ 100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men . The 23rd Infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on the Pugong @-@ ni @-@ Changnyong road . The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion . At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position . In this regimental perimeter , the 23rd Infantry fought a series of hard battles . Simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating North Koreans from Changnyong and from its supply road . 
 The NK 2nd Division made a new effort against the 23rd Infantry 's perimeter in the predawn hours of September 8 , in an attempt to break through eastward . This attack , launched at 02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery , penetrated F Company . It was apparent that unless F Company 's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse . When all its officers became casualties , First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson , adjutant of the 2nd Battalion , assumed command of the company . 
 The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight , but that night it resumed . The North Koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line . This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September . The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops . Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning . All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points . At one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men . When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent . 
 This heavy night and day battle cost the NK 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength . The medical officer of the NK 17th Regiment , 2nd Division , captured a few days later , said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in Pugong @-@ ni , and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1 @,@ 300 killed and 2 @,@ 500 wounded in the fighting west of Changnyong . Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9 , the division continued to harass rear areas around Changnyong with infiltrating groups as large as companies . Patrols daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town . North Korean and US troops remained locked in combat along the Naktong River for several more days . The North Koreans ' offensive capability was largely destroyed , and the US troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack .

 On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the NK 9th Division , in their first offensive of the war , stood only a few miles short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line . The 3rd Regiment had been left at Inch 'on , but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong . As the NK 9th Division approached Yongsan , its 1st Regiment was on the north and its 2nd Regiment on the south . The division 's attached support , consisting of one 76 mm artillery battalion from the NK I Corps , an antiaircraft battalion of artillery , two tank battalions of the NK 16th Armored Brigade , and a battalion of artillery from the NK 4th Division , gave it unusually heavy support . Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division , a greatly weakened organization , far understrength , short of weapons , and made up mostly of untrained replacements . A captured North Korean document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban @-@ ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of NK I Corps . Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1 . 
 On the morning of September 1 , with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand , the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan . Division commander Major General Lawrence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment . The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan . The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest . Disorganized US forces were ordered to pull back to Yongsan . The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan , bent around the western tip of this mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base . In its position , they not only commanded the town but also its exit , the road to Miryang . North Koreans had also approached Yongsan from the south . That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south . 
 US troops attempted to rally and fend off the North Korean attack , but were too disorganized to mount effective resistance . By evening the North Koreans had been driven into the hills westward . In the evening , the 2nd Battalion and A Company , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , occupied the first chain of low hills 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) beyond Yongsan , the engineers west and the 2nd Battalion northwest of the town . For the time being at least , the North Korean drive toward Miryang had been halted . In this time , the desperately undermanned US units began to be reinforced with Korean <unk> ( KATUSAs . ) However , the cultural divide between the KATUSAs and the US troops caused tensions . At 09 : 35 on September 2 , while the North Koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang , Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co @-@ ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines , with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line . The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished . 
 Between 03 : 00 and 04 : 30 on September 3 , the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade moved to forward assembly areas . The 2nd Battalion , 5th Marines assembled north of Yongsan , the 1st Battalion , 5th Marines south of it . The 3rd Battalion , 5th Marines established security positions southwest of Yongsan along the approaches into the regimental sector from that direction . The Marine attack started at 08 : 55 on September 3 , across the rice paddy land toward North Korean @-@ held high ground 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) westward . Air strikes , artillery concentrations , and machine gun and rifle fire of the 1st Battalion now caught North Korean reinforcements in open rice paddies moving up from the second ridge and killed most of them . That night the Marines dug in on a line 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of Yongsan . Total Marine casualties for September 3 were 34 killed and 157 wounded . Coordinating its attack with that of the marines , the 9th Infantry advanced abreast of them on the north . The counterattack continued at 08 : 00 September 4 , at first against little opposition . By nightfall the counterattack had gained another 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) . That night was quiet until just before dawn . The North Koreans then launched an attack against the 9th Infantry on the right of the marines , the heaviest blow striking G Company . It had begun to rain again and the attack came in the midst of a downpour . American artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the North Koreans in this night and day battle . 
 That morning , September 5 , after a 10 @-@ minute artillery preparation , the American troops moved out in their third day of counterattack . As the attack progressed , the Marines approached Obong @-@ ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before . There , at midmorning , on the high ground ahead , they could see North Korean troops digging in . The Marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions in front of the North Korean @-@ held high ground . At 14 : 30 approximately 300 North Korean infantry came from the village of Tugok and concealed positions , striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok . Two T @-@ 34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks . Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire , four others withdrew to better positions . Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch rocket launchers rushed into action , took the tanks under fire , and destroyed both of them , as well as an armored personnel carrier following behind . The North Korean infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and the Marine 81 mm mortars helped repel it . September 5 was a day of heavy casualties everywhere on the Pusan Perimeter . Army units had 102 killed , 430 wounded , and 587 missing in action for a total of 1 @,@ 119 casualties . Marine units had 35 killed , 91 wounded , and none missing in action , for a total of 126 battle casualties . Total American battle casualties for the day were 1 @,@ 245 men . It is unknown how many North Koreans were killed or wounded on that day , but they likely suffered heavy casualties . 
 The American counteroffensive of September 3 – 5 west of Yongsan , according to prisoner statements , resulted in one of the bloodiest debacles of the war for a North Korean division . Even though remnants of the NK 9th Division , supported by the low strength NK 4th Division , still held Obong @-@ ni Ridge , Cloverleaf Hill , and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on September 6 , the division 's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack . The NK 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive . 
 Just after midnight on September 6 , the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was ordered back to Pusan in order to travel to Japan and merge with other Marine units to form the 1st Marine Division . This was done after a heated disagreement between Walker 's command and MacArthur 's command . Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve , while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines . MacArthur responded by assigning the 17th Infantry Regiment , and later the 65th Infantry Regiment , would be added to Walker 's reserves , but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective . Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter at a time when it was unclear if it would hold . 
 = = = Masan = = = 
 = = = = Haman = = = = 
 On the extreme west flank , in the center of the 25th Division line , Lieutenant Colonel Paul F. Roberts ' 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , held the crest of the second ridge west of Haman , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the town . From Chungam @-@ ni , in North Korean territory , a secondary road led to Haman along the shoulders of low hills and across rice paddy ground , running east 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of the main Chinju @-@ Masan road . It came through Roberts ' 2nd Battalion position in a pass 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of Haman . Late in the afternoon of August 31 , observers with G Company , 24th Infantry , noticed activity 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) in front of their positions . They called in two air strikes that hit this area at dusk . US Artillery sent a large concentration of fire into the area , but the effect of this fire was not known . All US units on the line were alerted for a possible North Korean attack . 
 That night the North Koreans launched their coordinated offensive against the entire UN force . The NK 6th Division advanced first , hitting F Company on the north side of the pass on the Chungam @-@ ni @-@ Haman road . The ROK troops in the pass left their positions and fell back on G Company south of the pass . The North Koreans captured a 75 mm recoilless rifle in the pass and turned it on American tanks , knocking out two of them . They then overran a section of 82 mm mortars at the east end of the pass . South of the pass , at dawn , First Lieutenant Houston M. McMurray found that only 15 out of 69 men assigned to his platoon remained with him , a mix of US and ROK troops . The North Koreans attacked this position at dawn . They came through an opening in the barbed wire perimeter which was supposed to be covered by a man with a M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle , but he had fled . Throwing grenades and spraying the area with burp gun fire , the North Koreans quickly overran the position . Numerous officers and non @-@ commissioned officers attempted to get the men back into line , but they would not follow these orders . In one instance South Korean troops killed their own company commander when he tried to stop them from escaping . 
 Shortly after the North Korean attack started most of the 2nd Battalion , 24th Infantry , fled their positions . One company at a time , the battalion was struck with strong attacks all along its front , and with the exception of a few dozen men in each company , each formation quickly crumbled , with most of the troops running back to Haman against the orders of the officers . The North Koreans passed through the crumbling US lines quickly and overran the 2nd Battalion command post , killing several men there and destroying much of the battalion 's equipment . With the 2nd Battalion broken , Haman was open to direct North Korean attack . As the North Koreans encircled Haman , Roberts , the 2nd Battalion commander , ordered an officer to take remnants of the battalion and establish a roadblock at the south edge of the town . Although the officer directed a large group of men to accompany him , only eight did so . The 2nd Battalion was no longer an effective fighting force . Pockets of its soldiers remained in place and fought fiercely , but the majority fled upon attack , and the North Koreans were able to move around the uneven resistance . They surrounded Haman as the 2nd Battalion crumbled in disarray . 
 When the North Korean attack broke through the 2nd Battalion , Regimental commander Colonel Arthur S. Champney ordered the 1st Battalion , about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south of Haman on the Chindong @-@ ni road , to counterattack and restore the line . Roberts assembled all the 40 men of the disorganized 2nd Battalion he could find to join in this counterattack , which got under way at 0730 . Upon contact with the North Koreans , the 1st Battalion broke and fled to the rear . Thus , shortly after daylight the scattered and disorganized men of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 24th Infantry had fled to the high ground 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of Haman . The better part of two regiments of the NK 6th Division poured into and through the Haman gap , now that they had captured the town and held it . 
 At 14 : 45 on September 1 , division commander Major General William B. Kean ordered an immediate counterattack to restore the 24th Infantry positions . For 30 minutes US Air Force aircraft struck North Korean positions around Haman with bombs , napalm , rockets , and machine gun fire . They also attacked the North Korean @-@ held ridges around the town . Fifteen minutes of concentrated artillery fire followed . Fires spread in Haman . Lieutenant Colonel Gilbert Check 's 1st Battalion infantry moved out in attack west at 16 : 30 , reinforced by a platoon of tanks from A Company , 79th Tank Battalion . Eight tanks , mounting infantry , spearheaded the attack into Haman , capturing the city easily , as most of the North Korean troops had abandoned it . North Koreans in force held the ridge on the west side of the town , and their machine gun fire swept every approach . North Korean fire destroyed one tank and the attacking infantry suffered heavy casualties . But Check 's battalion pressed the attack and by 18 : 25 had seized the first long ridge 500 yards ( 460 m ) west of Haman . By 20 : 00 it had secured half of the old battle position on the higher ridge beyond , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of Haman . Just 200 yards ( 180 m ) short of the crest on the remainder of the ridge , the infantry dug in for the night . It had recaptured Haman and was pushing back to the 24th 's old positions . 
 The North Koreans attacked Haman daily for the next week . Following the repelling of North Korean infiltration on September 7 , the North Korean attack on Haman ground to a halt . The North Koreans , racked by logistical and manpower shortages , focused more heavily on their attacks against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain , as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River . 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18 . 
 = = = = Nam River = = = = 
 Meanwhile , the North Korean 7th Division troops committed all of their effort into attacking the US 35th Infantry line . At 23 : 30 on August 31 , a North Korean SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled high @-@ velocity gun from across the Nam fired shells into the position of G Company , 35th Infantry , overlooking the river . Within a few minutes , North Korean artillery was attacking all front @-@ line rifle companies of the regiment from the Namji @-@ ri bridge west . Under cover of this fire a reinforced regiment of the NK 7th Division crossed the Nam River and attacked F and G Companies , 35th Infantry . Other North Korean soldiers crossed the Nam on an underwater bridge in front of the paddy ground north of Komam @-@ ni and near the boundary between the 2nd Battalion , led by Lieutenant Colonel John L. Wilkins , Jr . , holding the river front and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard G. Teeter 's 1st Battalion holding the hill line that stretched from the Nam River to Sibidang @-@ san and the Chinju @-@ Masan highway . The 35th Infantry , facing shortages of equipment and reinforcements , was under @-@ equipped but nonetheless prepared for an attack . 
 In the low ground between these two battalions at the river ferry crossing site , Lieutenant Colonel Henry Fisher had placed 300 ROK National Police , expecting them to hold there long enough to serve as a warning for the rest of the forces . Guns from the flanking hills there could cover the low ground with fire . Back at Komam @-@ ni he held the 3rd Battalion ready for use in counterattack to stop an enemy penetration should it occur . Unexpectedly , the ROK police companies near the ferry scattered at the first North Korean fire . At 00 : 30 , North Korean troops streamed through this hole in the line , some turning left to take G Company in its flank and rear , and others turned right to attack C Company , which was on a spur of ground west of the Komam @-@ ni road . The I & R Platoon and elements of C and D Companies formed a defense line along the dike at the north edge of Komam @-@ ni where US tanks joined them at daybreak . But the North Koreans did not drive for the Komam @-@ ni road fork 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south of the river as Fisher expected them to ; instead , they turned east into the hills behind 2nd Battalion . 
 At daybreak on September 1 , a tank @-@ led relief force of C Company headquarters troops cleared the road to Sibidang @-@ san and resupplied the 2nd Platoon , B Company , with ammunition just in time for it to repel another North Korean assault , killing 77 and capturing 21 North Koreans . Although Fisher 's 35th Infantry held all its original positions , except that of the forward platoon of G Company , 3 @,@ 000 North Korean soldiers were behind its lines . The farthest eastern penetration reached the high ground just south of Chirwon overlooking the north @-@ south road there . 
 By midafternoon , Kean felt that the situation was so dangerous that he ordered the 2nd Battalion , US 27th Infantry Regiment , to attack behind the 35th Infantry . A large part of the division artillery was under direct North Korean infantry attack . During the morning hours of September 1 , when the NK 7th Division troops had attacked , the first American unit they encountered was G Company , 35th Infantry , at the north shoulder of the gap . While some North Korean units peeled off to attack G Company , others continued on and engaged E Company , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) downstream from it , and still others attacked scattered units of F Company all the way to its 1st Platoon , which guarded the Namji @-@ ri bridge . There , at the extreme right flank of the 25th Division , this platoon drove off a North Korean force after a fierce fight . By September 2 , E Company in a heavy battle had destroyed most of a North Korean battalion . 
 Bitter , confused fighting continued behind the 35th Infantry 's line for the next week . Battalions , companies , and platoons , cut off and isolated , fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them . Airdrops also supplied relief forces trying to reach the front @-@ line units . Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips . In general , the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions , while at first one battalion , and later two battalions , of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3 @,@ 000 North Koreans operating in its rear areas . 
 Although the 25th Division generally was under much less enemy pressure after 5 September , there were still severe local attacks . Heavy rains caused the Nam and Naktong Rivers to rise on 8 and 9 September , reducing the danger of new crossings . However , North Korean attacks against 2nd Battalion , 35th Infantry occurred nightly . The approaches to the Namji @-@ ri bridge , one of their key targets to protect were mined . At one time there were about 100 North Korean dead lying in that area . From September 9 to 16 , there were limited attacks on the 35th Infantry 's front but most of the North Korean 's momentum had been broken and they could not muster strong attacks against the regiment again . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Great Naktong Offensive was one of the most brutal fights of the Korean War . The North Koreans were initially successful in breaking through UN lines in multiple places and making substantial gains in surrounding and pushing back UN units . On September 4 – 5 the situation was so dire for the UN troops that the US Eighth Army and ROK Army moved their headquarters elements from Taegu to Pusan to prevent them from being overrun and losing their heavy communications equipment , though Walker remained in Taegu with a small forward detachment . They also prepared their logistics systems for a retreat to a smaller defensive perimeter called the " Davidson Line . " By September 6 , however , Walker decided another retreat would not be necessary . 
 Some historians contend the goals of Great Naktong Offensive were unattainable from the beginning . The Americans , who had been better equipped than the North Koreans , were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line , according to historian T. R. Fehrenbach . At the same time , the North Koreans did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time . 
 The subsequent Inchon landings were a crushing blow for the North Korean army , catching them completely unprepared and breaking the already @-@ weak forces along the perimeter . With virtually no equipment , exhausted manpower and low morale , the North Koreans were at a severe disadvantage and would not be able to continue pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon . By September 23 , the North Koreans were in full retreat from Pusan Perimeter , with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way . 
 The destruction of the North Korean army at Pusan made the continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone . The massive equipment and manpower loses rivaled those of the ROK Army in the first stages of the war . The North Koreans totally collapsed as a fighting force , and the remainder of their military retreated into North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force , which was now on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land , air and sea . Many of the outmaneuvered North Korean units simply surrendered , having been reduced from units of thousands to just a few hundred men .

 Rise of Mana , known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu : Rise of Mana , is a Japanese action role @-@ playing video game developed by Square Enix and <unk> for iOS , Android and PlayStation Vita . It was published by Square Enix in 2014 for mobile devices and 2015 for the Vita . It is the eleventh game in the Mana series , featuring a new narrative unconnected to other games in the series . The gameplay uses a similar action @-@ based battle system to earlier Mana titles while using a free @-@ to @-@ play model in common with mobile titles . The story focuses on two characters , an angel and a demon , who are cast down to the mortal world in the midst of a battle and are forced to share a body in order to survive . 
 The game began development in 2012 : the project began when Masaru Oyamada told series producer Koichi Ishii that he could create a legitimate entry in the Mana series for mobile platforms . His idea was for a game true to the series that would reach a wide audience . The game 's multiplayer , inspired by that used in Secret of Mana , was developed using the Photon Server middleware . The art director was series newcomer Hiroyuki Suzuki , while the character and monster designs were done by <unk> and Ryota Murayama . The music was composed by a team led by Tsuyoshi Sekito . The theme song was written and performed by singer @-@ songwriter Kokia . 
 First announced in February 2014 , it was released the following month on iOS . The Android release followed several months later . The Vita port released the following year . By April 2015 , the mobile version had over two million active players , and later the Vita version achieved 150 @,@ 000 downloads by August 2015 . It received generally positive opinions from critics : while many praised its graphics , story and gameplay , there were opinions that it was not a worthy part of the Mana series . The game is set to be discontinued as a free @-@ to @-@ play title in March 2016 , and Square Enix is seeking to release the game in a different form . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Rise of Mana is an action role @-@ playing game where the player takes control of two protagonists inhabiting a single body : the characters ' genders and names can be customized prior to beginning the game . During gameplay , the character can switch between angelic and demonic forms : this enables the player to see thoughts in different non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) , with each form showing different types of thought or prompting a different reaction from NPCs . The game uses a free @-@ to @-@ play gaming model : while the game can be downloaded and played for free , players have the option of spending money on in @-@ game items . The characters ' base is a room in a small village : in the room , players can check messages , and set their current equipment and weapons . A message board in the town provides access to social features . In the town , NPC @-@ run shops enable the crafting of new weapons and equipment in exchange for in @-@ game currency , along with the buying and selling of various in @-@ game items . 
 There are four types of available quests , most of which are accepted from NPCs : main quests which advance the story , quests with a time limit that disappear after a certain period , challenge quests that pit the player against hordes of enemies , and raid battles against bosses . Each quest consumes a part of the player characters ' " mental energy " , a stamina meter that refills as real @-@ world time passes . Gems can be bought and used to refill it faster . When the characters gain an experience level , the meter is recharged completely . As each scenario and quest is completed or when new quests are available , the game 's map is automatically updated . After selecting a quest , a player chooses one of a number of " familiars " , creatures that aid the player in battle and grant stat boosts . 
 Rise of Mana uses an action @-@ based battle system similar to other entries in the Mana series : navigation and actions occur in real time within battlefields rendered to the scale of characters within it . After each battle , treasure chests are unlocked which can contain items or new familiars . During battle , the character can attack , switching forms to deliver different attacks , and dodge enemy attacks when correctly timed . During battle , assigned abilities are displayed in the lower right @-@ hand corner of the screen . After each skill is used in battle , a cooldown meter is activated . The skill cannot be used again until the meter is empty . Three types of weapons are available in @-@ game : swords , spears and bows . Each weapon , when equipped , grants a different skill and elemental attribute . The elemental attributes can be used against monsters aligned with a vulnerable element . Enemies can also be weak to attacks using certain weapons . In addition to single @-@ player battles , raid battles allow up to eight players to participate using an online connection .

 The story takes place in a variation of the Mana high fantasy setting , and is divided between the human and the spirit realms . In the spirit realm , two opposing factions face each other in eternal battle : the angelic Rasta and the demonic Daruka . The main protagonists are the chosen champions of each of their races . The two are forced to confront agents sent from the spirit realm by each side to retrieve them : the archangel knight Vibra and the warrior demon Toryu . Another major character is Folon , a being known as the " goddess of time " . According to the game 's director , <unk> is not a goddess in the fullest sense , as the world 's true goddess could be said to be " Mana " itself . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The game opens with a battle between the respective Champions of Light and Darkness in front of the Mana Tree . While they are fighting near a Mana waterfall , they are swept by it into the mortal world . There , their power is drastically diminished and their existence is threatened . The two decide to make a temporary alliance , sharing a body until they can find their way back to the spirit world . During their journey , they become the protectors of a local village . The pair eventually become the heirs to the mystical Mana Sword . The main campaign was delivered in chapters . The original main campaign , which involved a battle with the hostile Folon , lasted for twenty chapters . Following this , new campaign missions were issued following the characters ' mission to confront threats using the Mana Sword . At the end of the game , the Champions confront Folon at the Mana Tree , along with Vibra and Toryu . After their final confrontation , <unk> willingly disperses after she and Mana explain why they summoned the Champions : to bring them together through circumstance and pave the way for peace between the Rasta and Daruka . Having become friends through their journey , the Champions agree to bring peace , and return to their own realms .

 Rise of Mana was the brainchild of Square Enix producer Masaru Oyamada , who had made a name for himself within the company working in its mobile division on mobile ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana . Speaking with series producer Koichi Ishii , Oyamada said that he could create an original mobile title that would be a legitimate entry in the series . Instead of a social or card @-@ based game , which were the most prevalent genres in mobile gaming at the time , Oyamada wanted to create an action role @-@ playing game that was accessible to a large number of casual gamers , something which would worry him throughout its production . The main staff were made up of Oyamada , director Masato Yagi , and art director Hiroyuki Suzuki . Hiroyuki had previously only worked on the Final Fantasy series . After the initial release of Rise of Mana , Yagi was responsible for the main scenario alongside Oyamada and post @-@ launch content producer <unk> Takuma . Oyamada also initially tried to bring Chaos Rings producer Takehiro Ando on board , but Ando would have nothing to do with the project . Development began in July 2012 . The game was constructed using the Unity engine . In addition to staff from Square Enix , main development was done by Japanese developer <unk> , and its server security and technical assistance was handled by Fixer . The protagonists and some NPCs were designed by Japanese artist <unk> , while another artist <unk> Murayama handled NPC and monster designs . The game 's key art was created by in @-@ house designer <unk> Masahiko : he was brought in after regular Mana key art illustrator Hiroo <unk> died in 2013 . Masahiko was asked by Oyamada to create something similar to <unk> 's previous artwork in creating a representation of pointillism . The game 's title was indicative of the title 's nature as a new entry in the Mana series ; other than a small card @-@ battle mobile game in 2013 , Circle of Mana , Rise was the first Mana title since Heroes of Mana in 2007 . 
 Rise of Mana was intended to reach a wide audience , gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006 . The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi . The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies , with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game 's artificial intelligence . The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game 's multiplayer component . The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware , but the rebuild needed would have taken a whole year , threatening the project 's existence . In search of suitable middleware , the team contacted Fixer , who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server . Trying out Photon Server , all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two @-@ month period , and the middleware 's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project 's engineers to greenlight its use . Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server . The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android , as Android had higher graphical power . During the early development stage , the team thought it would be fun to re @-@ create the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana . The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests , but this took up too much operational space to be practical , so they reduced this to raid battles . Due to the use of Photon Server , additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost @-@ like transparent helpers . 
 Development of the PlayStation Vita port began shortly before the start of the game 's service in 2014 . The team formed a partnership with Sony to develop the title , but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version , along with adjusting the controls from touch @-@ based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita . There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada 's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game . When the project was proposed to Sony , the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform 's processing power . In addition , the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita . The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform . By the time of the Vita version 's announcement , only the preliminary development work had been completed , but development was proceeding according to plan . Technical troubles related to the game 's performance persisted beyond this point , resulting in the release being delayed into the following year . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music of Rise of Mana was composed by a group of different composers : the majority of the music was handled by Tsuyoshi Sekito . In addition to Sekito , the soundtrack was also contributed to by three previous Mana composers : Kenji Ito ( Final Fantasy Adventure , Children of Mana , Dawn of Mana ) , Hiroki Kikuta ( Secret of Mana , Seiken Densetsu 3 ) and Yoko Shimomura ( Legend of Mana , Heroes of Mana ) . Also joining the team was sound engineer Yasuhiro Yamanaka . In all , 21 out of the 28 composed pieces were done by Sekito . Ito , Kikuta , Shimomura and Yamanaka each contributed one track . The soundtrack featured an arrangement for piano of " Rising Sun " , the series ' main theme . Yamanaka acted as sound director , while <unk> @ <unk> created the piano arrangements for both " Rising Sun " and the game 's theme song . 
 The game 's theme song , " Believe in the Spirit " , was composed , written and sung by Japanese singer @-@ songwriter Kokia . Prior to coming on board , she had little knowledge of the Mana series . As with her previous compositions for video games , Kokia tried to get a feel for the game 's atmosphere before starting , either through playing the game directly or looking at behind @-@ the @-@ scenes material related to the game 's world . With " Believe in the Spirit " , she worked to create a song that would appeal to both players and the production team . The track was performed using strings , a tin whistle , an acoustic guitar and percussion . The arrangement was done by Mina Kubota . 
 Seiken Densetsu : Rise of Mana Original Soundtrack was released on April 24 , 2014 through Square Enix 's music label . Andrew Barker of RPGFan was cautiously positive about the album : he described " Believe in the Spirit " as being " hit @-@ or @-@ miss " for different listeners while evoking memories of earlier Mana games . The rest of the soundtrack was generally praised : the first half 's restful melodies were the stand @-@ out tracks and said to be the strongest , while the later upbeat tracks were praised for their various energizing qualities . Some tracks , such as " The Drip Drip Drip of Memory " , he called fairly weak and forgettable . Barker generally compared the music to that of Final Fantasy XII , recommending it for fans of the latter and finishing that the album was generally good despite some unmemorable pieces . Chris Greening of Video Game Music Online gave the album a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ star rating out of five : he was most positive about the tracks from the guest composers like Ito and Shimomura . While he praised Sekito for moving away from his traditional musical style , he felt that the result was fairly mixed , with some tracks lacking the proper emotional drive and others " falling flat " . " Believe in the Spirit " was praised for avoiding J @-@ pop elements and sticking with its Celtic style , being favorably compared to the theme songs of Xenogears . Overall , Green felt that , while it had good production value and was substantially better than other mobile game soundtracks , but lacked the emotional impact of previous Mana titles in the majority of its tracks . Many reviewers of the game also praised the soundtrack . 
 = = Release = = 
 The game 's existence was first hinted at when a trademark for the title was registered . Similar trademarks were registered in Europe and North America . The game was officially announced by Square Enix in an issue of Famitsu magazine in February 2014 . The game 's service began on March 6 , 2014 for iOS . The version for Android released nearly three months later on June 25 . A version for the Vita was announced later in 2014 , originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of that year . Due to technical difficulties , the Vita port needed to be delayed well into the following year , and was eventually released on May 14 , 2015 . Pre @-@ registration was made available from May 10 . 
 During its lifetime , Rise of Mana entered multiple collaborations with other games both for mobiles and other platforms : these included Final Fantasy Agito , Bravely Default , Final Fantasy Tactics : The War of the Lions , Final Fantasy Adventure and Diffusion Million Arthur . In January 2016 , it was announced that Rise of Mana would cease operation on all platforms on March 31 . In the release , Square Enix said that a developing imbalance between content quality and revenue , in addition to problems with future content creation , had convinced them that Rise of Mana was no longer a profitable concern . Despite it ending service as a free @-@ to @-@ play title , the company is looking into alternative ways of distributing the title . A final story episode was released prior to the game 's closure , and its final cinematic was released online through Square Enix Japan 's YouTube channel on March 28 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Within the first few days of operation , Rise of Mana had 500 @,@ 000 active players . Within a month of its release , that number had increased to one million registered players . In an interview , Oyamada said that sales of the title had increased with the release of more powerful mobile devices . By May 2015 , the smartphone versions had over two million registered players . The Vita version was similarly successful : within two months of release , it had been downloaded 100 @,@ 000 times . That figure rose by an additional 50 @,@ 000 over the following month . 
 Japanese reviews of the title have been generally positive . Famitsu generally praised several aspects , but found the item management and weapon structures confusing , saying that it did not live up to the legacy of the Mana series . Reviewing the Vita port , Famitsu praised the game 's general ease of play and use of the Mana series , but the button layout was criticized . Kyōsuke Takano of <unk> praised the gameplay and graphics , noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience . His one point of reservation was that he would have preferred the game on another platform . 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options , the feel of gameplay , and the graphics . The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations , as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models . 
 Opinions from western journalists have echoed many of those from Japanese reviewers . Christopher Allison , writing for tech website Tech in Asia , was highly positive about the game , saying his last experience of this kind was when playing the 1998 game The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time : he greatly enjoyed the battle system despite the touch controls sometimes working against the player , and referred to the environments as " wonderfully drawn " . Shaun Musgrave of Touch Arcade , in a preview of the game , echoed other reviewers ' opinions on the graphics and gameplay , and hoped that Square Enix would both handle it wisely and bring it overseas . Kerry <unk> , in an article for Nintendo Life , referred to the story as " engaging " , and again held similar sentiments as other reviewers about the graphics and gameplay . She noted that the game stood out from others of its kind due to its overall quality . 
 = Fantastic Story Quarterly = 
 Fantastic Story Quarterly was a pulp science fiction magazine , published from 1950 to 1955 by Best Books , a subsidiary imprint of Standard Magazines . The name was changed with the Summer 1951 issue to Fantastic Story Magazine . It was launched to reprint stories from the early years of the science fiction pulp magazines , and was initially intended to carry no new fiction , though in the end every issue contained at least one new story . It was sufficiently successful for Standard to launch Wonder Story Annual as a vehicle for more science fiction reprints , but the success did not last . In 1955 it was merged with Standard 's Startling Stories . Original fiction in Fantastic Story included Gordon R. Dickson 's first sale , " Trespass " , and stories by Walter M. Miller and Richard Matheson . 
 = = Publication history and contents = = 
 The first science fiction ( sf ) magazine , Amazing Stories , was launched in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback at the height of the pulp magazine era . It helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre , and by the mid @-@ 1930s several more sf magazines had appeared , including Wonder Stories , also published by Gernsback . In 1936 , Ned Pines of Beacon Publications bought Wonder Stories from Gernsback . Pines changed the title to Thrilling Wonder Stories , and in 1939 and 1940 added two more sf titles : Startling Stories and Captain Future . Pines had acquired reprint rights to the fiction published in Wonder Stories as part of the transaction , and he instituted a " Hall of Fame " department in Startling Stories to carry some of this material . Captain Future also carried reprint material , but neither Startling nor Captain Future had room for some of the longer stories in the backfile . At the end of the 1940s a boom in science fiction magazines encouraged Pines to issue a new magazine , titled Fantastic Story Quarterly , as a vehicle for reprinting this older material . The original plan was for the magazine to carry no new fiction , but this policy was changed shortly before publication , and at least one new story was included in every issue . 
 The initial schedule was quarterly . The magazine became popular with fans because of the access it gave them to old favorite stories , and it was immediately successful , soon becoming more popular than the other Standard Magazine science fiction pulps . The success led Standard to issue Wonder Story Annual in 1950 to provide an outlet for reprinting longer material . In late 1952 it switched to a bimonthly schedule , having changed its title to Fantastic Story Magazine the previous year , but this only lasted until the following year , by which time it was no longer doing well financially . It was back on a quarterly schedule starting with the Winter 1954 issue . The pulps were in rapid decline by the mid @-@ 1950s , and both Fantastic Story Magazine and Thrilling Wonder Stories were merged with Startling Stories in mid @-@ 1955 , though Startling itself ceased publication at the end of that year . 
 The pulp format was intended to appeal to readers who were nostalgic for the early years of the science fiction pulp market . Sf historian Mike Ashley suggested that Pines was right to launch Fantastic Story Quarterly as a pulp ; in Ashley 's words , " Early pulp fiction somehow never reads right in book form . You need the crumbling paper , the smell of <unk> , and the mixture of advertisements , illustrations and old pulp @-@ style text to create the right atmosphere " . Most of the contents were reprinted from Wonder Stories , but occasionally material from other publishers appeared , such as A.E. van Vogt 's novel , <unk> , which had originally appeared in Street and Smith 's Astounding Science Fiction in 1940 , and which was reprinted in Fantastic Story 's Summer 1952 issue . New fiction included Richard Matheson 's " Lazarus II " , and Walter M. Miller 's " A Family Matter " . Fantastic Story also printed Gordon R. Dickson 's first sale , " Trespass " , a collaboration with Poul Anderson which appeared in the very first issue . In addition to fiction , there was an editorial page and a letter column . Illustrators whose work appeared in its pages included Virgil Finlay , Ed Emsh , and Earle Bergey . 
 = = Bibliographic details = = 
 The magazine was a quarterly for all but six issues , from November 1952 to September 1953 . The title changed from Fantastic Story Quarterly to Fantastic Story Magazine with the fifth issue , and remained under that title through the end of its run , though the magazine was still a quarterly at the time the title changed . The Fall 1952 issue was also dated September 1952 . There were seven volumes of three issues , and a final volume of two issues . The magazine was in pulp format and priced at 25 cents throughout its life ; it began at 160 pages and dropped to 144 pages with the Spring 1951 issue , then to 128 pages with the September 1953 issue , and finally to 112 pages for the last two issues . The publisher was Best Books , of Kokomo , Indiana , which was owned by Standard Magazines of New York . The editor was initially Sam Merwin ; Samuel Mines took over with the Winter 1952 issue , and the last two issues were edited by Alexander Samalman . 
 A Canadian edition of the first four editions appeared from Better Publications in Toronto with the same contents as the U.S. editions .

 The word Digambara is a combination of two Sanskrit words : dig ( directions ) and <unk> ( clothes ) , referring to those whose garments are of the element that fills the four quarters of space . Digambara monks do not wear any clothes as it is considered to be parigraha ( possession ) , which ultimately leads to attachment . A Digambara monk has 28 <unk> <unk> ( primary attributes ) . These are : five <unk> ( supreme vows ) ; five samitis ( regulations ) ; <unk> <unk> ( five @-@ fold control of the senses ) ; <unk> ( six essential duties ) ; and seven niyamas ( rules or restrictions ) . 
 The monks carry picchi , a broom made up of fallen peacock feathers for removing small insects without causing them injury , <unk> ( the gourd for carrying pure , sterilized water ) and shastra ( scripture ) . The head of all monastics is called Āchārya , while the saintly preceptor of saints is the <unk> . The Āchārya has 36 primary attributes ( <unk> <unk> ) in addition to the 28 mentioned above . The monks perform kayotsarga daily , in a rigid and immobile posture , with the arms held stiffly down , knees straight , and toes directed forward .

 According to Digambara texts , after liberation of the Lord Mahavira , three <unk> <unk> attained <unk> ( omniscience ) sequentially – Gautama <unk> , Acharya <unk> , and <unk> in next 62 years . During the next hundred years , five Āchāryas had complete knowledge of the scriptures , as such , called <unk> <unk> , the last of them being Āchārya Bhadrabahu . Spiritual lineage of heads of monastic orders is known as <unk> . 
 The Digambara tradition was divided into two main orders : 
 Mula Sangha , which includes Sena Gana , <unk> Gana and <unk> Gana traditions 
 <unk> Sangha , which includes the Mathura Gana and Lat @-@ <unk> Gana traditions

 Relics found from <unk> excavations like seals depicting <unk> posture , idols in Padmasana and a nude bust of red limestone give insight about the antiquity of the Digambara tradition .

 The Digambara Jains worship completely nude idols of tirthankaras ( omniscient beings ) and siddha ( liberated souls ) . The tirthankara is represented either seated in yoga posture or standing in the <unk> posture .

 The Digambara sect of Jainism rejects the authority of the texts accepted by the other major sect , the <unk> . 
 According to the Digambaras , Āchārya <unk> guided two Āchāryas , Pushpadanta and Bhutabali , to put the teachings of Mahavira in written form , 683 years after the nirvana of Mahavira . The two Āchāryas wrote Ṣaṭkhaṅḍāgama on palm leaves which is considered to be among the oldest known Digambara texts . Āchārya Bhutabali was the last ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original Jain Agamas . Later on , some learned Āchāryas started to restore , compile and put into written words the teachings of Lord Mahavira , that were the subject matter of Agamas . 
 Digambaras group the texts into four literary categories called anuyoga ( exposition ) . The <unk> ( first exposition ) contains the universal history , the <unk> ( calculation exposition ) contains works on cosmology and the <unk> ( behaviour exposition ) includes texts about proper behaviour for monks and <unk> .

Terapanthi is a reformist sect of Digambara Jainism that distinguished itself from the Bispanthi sect . It formed out of strong opposition to the religious domination of traditional religious leaders called <unk> during 12 – 16th century A.D.

 The men 's ski jumping at the 1928 Winter Olympics took place at the 70 @-@ meter ( 230 ft ) Olympiaschanze in St. Moritz , Switzerland , on 18 February . Thirty @-@ eight competitors from thirteen nations competed , with the event being won by Norway 's Alf Andersen ahead of countryman Sigmund Ruud and Czechoslovakia 's Rudolf Burkert . 
 Norway sent a strong contingent with four jumpers able to win the event , including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob <unk> Thams . Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events . World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems . Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time , also becoming the first Asian country to do so . After the first jump , three Norwegians were in the lead . A 40 @-@ minute discussion erupted regarding the speed , with Central European jumpers wanting it increased .

 The event took place at Olympiaschanze , located in the neighborhood of St. Moritz Bad . The town 's first ski jumping hill , <unk> , opened in 1895 .

 Norway sent a strong delegation with four participants able to win the event .

The rest of the delegation consisted Alf Andersen , Sigmund Ruud — the oldest of the Ruud brothers — and Hans Kleppen . Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualifications for the Olympics . Other favorites were Rudolf Burkert , who had won and the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined event , and the host nation 's Gérard Vuilleumier . Asia participated for the first time in an international tournament , represented by Japan 's Motohiko Ban . 
 Canada had originally planned to send two ski jumpers , Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie . Nelsen held world record for the longest ski jump . However , lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter . These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation , who organized the Canadian team and who felt working for their fare was inappropriate and not fitting for the team , and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics . 
 = = Race = = 
 The jury consisted of <unk> of Norway , <unk> of Czechoslovakia and <unk> of Switzerland . Because of ice on the in @-@ run , a reduced speed was used during the first round .

Thams , Kleppen and Poland 's Bronisław Czech all jumped 56 @.@ 5 meters , but both Kleppen and Czech fell . In terms of points , the three Norwegians Andersen , Ruud and Thams were in the lead , ahead of <unk> and Vuilleumier . 
 In the break , a number of Central Europeans , including Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani , asked for top speed . This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers , and a 40 @-@ minute discussion broke out . At one point , one of the facilitators at the in @-@ run received a telephone call confirming top speed . The facilitator was skeptical , and chose to call back to the judges , who could confirm that they had not given such a go @-@ ahead . In the end , the judges chose to allow higher speeds , with a compromise of 5 @.@ 0 meters more distance . However , the facilitator only moved the rope 4 @.@ 5 meters . This made the Swiss furious , and they used their knives to cut the rope . They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards . 
 Andersen and Ruud skied down the in @-@ run in a standing position to reduce their speed , and had the two longest standing jumps . The event is regarded as the international break @-@ through for Ruud . Thams gave full speed and landed at 73 @.@ 0 meters , but fell and ended on a 28th place .

Afterwards he stated : " I at least showed those guys that we are not cowards " .

Co @-@ written by several House producers and directed by Greg Yaitanes , " House 's Head " premiered on May 12 , 2008 on Fox . 
 The episode revolves around Dr. Gregory House ( Hugh Laurie ) , who , after being involved in a bus accident , vaguely remembers seeing someone who is " going to die " . House tries to trace back his steps throughout the episode to find out the identity of this person . A woman ( Ivana Miličević ) , who claims to be " the answer " , guides House through hallucinations about the crash . The episode eventually ends in a cliffhanger . 
 14 @.@ 84 million American viewers watched the broadcasting of " House 's Head " , making House the ninth most @-@ watched program of the week . The episode , and in particular a strip tease scene involving Cuddy ( Lisa Edelstein ) , gained positive responses . The episode was submitted for five Primetime Emmy Awards , from which two nominations followed . Greg Yaitanes won the Emmy for " Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series " , but Hugh Laurie lost the award in the category " Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series " to Bryan Cranston of AMC 's Breaking Bad . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode opens in a strip club where Dr. Gregory House is getting a lap dance . Drunk , dazed , and suffering from a head wound , House has a short disjointed vision and presumes that " somebody 's going to die " . When he leaves the club , he sees that the bus he was on crashed . Back at Princeton @-@ Plainsboro Teaching Hospital , House is diagnosed with a concussion and post @-@ traumatic retrograde amnesia ; he orders his team to check the bus driver for a possible seizure that precipitated the crash . Dr. Robert Chase ( Jesse Spencer ) performs a medical hypnosis on House to stimulate his memory ; during this , House finds himself getting drunk in a bar , alone . Chase , Dr. James Wilson ( Robert Sean Leonard ) , and Wilson 's girlfriend Amber Volakis ( Anne Dudek ) guide House through the hallucination , and the only other person House recognizes is the bartender ( Fred Durst ) , who forced House to take the bus by taking away his keys . 
 While the team investigates several pathologies to fit the bus driver 's condition , House overdoses on his Vicodin and starts to hallucinate . He finds himself back on the bus , where he sees a woman ( Ivana Miličević ) who was not on the bus . However , before House can speak to her , Wilson awakens House to do an MRI on him . When House returns to the bus hallucination , Dr. Lisa Cuddy ( Lisa Edelstein ) is with him . As they discuss the bus driver 's possible diseases , House realizes they are in his head and tells Cuddy to accompany the discussion with a strip tease . Cuddy complies , but just before she takes off her bra , she notes she is distracting House , and stops . The woman from House 's earlier hallucination returns and introduces herself as " the answer " . She tells House to " look " at the bus driver 's shuffling feet , which House believes to indicate Parkinson 's disease . When the bus driver needs to be intubated due to a possible clot from a pulmonary embolism , House notices the driver 's recent dental work . He reasons that an air bubble , that got accidentally injected into the patient 's bloodstream through the gums , would explain all the symptoms . The bubble is extracted , and the patient is saved . House believes it over , but a dream that night causes him to realize that the bus driver is not the patient he saw a symptom in , the crash merely dislodged the air bubble and caused the driver 's problems . 
 In a renewed attempt to retrieve his memory , House has his team reenact the bus crash . House overdoses on physostigmine , a medication against Alzheimer 's disease , and his mind flashes back to the bus scene before the accident . " The answer " reminds House that since he values reason above everything else , there must be one for her presence in his mind . She keeps asking House what her necklace is made from , until House realizes that it 's made of amber . " The answer " transforms into Amber Volakis , and when Wilson and Cuddy manage to resuscitate House from his overdose @-@ induced cardiac arrest , House immediately informs Wilson that Amber 's life is in danger as he now remembers the crash . In the crash , Amber was injured with a bar through her leg and House saw her later being carried away to an ambulance . Wilson has not spoken to Amber since before the accident . " Thirteen " ( Olivia Wilde ) checks the patient roster and sees that a patient admitted to a different hospital matches Amber 's description .

 " House 's Head " was the fourth House episode directed by Greg Yaitanes . It was written by Peter Blake , David Foster , Russel Friend , Garrett Lerner and Doris Egan . Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the season finale was " a little bit different " than the episodes preceding it . " House 's Head " was supposed to air after the Super Bowl XLII but due to the 2007 @-@ 2008 WGA Strike the episode was derailed , and the House season 4 episode " Frozen " was aired instead . The T @-@ shirt House wears in the episodes , which shows a skeleton drinking coffee , and says " Coffin Break " , was created by a designer named <unk> . 
 When Lisa Edelstein ( Dr. Cuddy ) heard she had to do a strip scene in the episode , she called actress Sheila Kelley , wife of Richard Schiff ( with whom Edelstein had worked previously on The West Wing and Relativity ) . Kelley had worked on a movie about strippers long ago and Edelstein asked her for her advice on the choreography of the striptease . On the episode itself , Edelstein commented : " It is very interesting what happens in the first half of the finale in terms of learning about how House sees people and getting the world from his point of view entirely " . Before the filming of the scene started , Edelstein showed the dance to Hugh Laurie , who , according to Edelstein , was " incredibly supportive , like a cheerleader " . Edelstein commented that after the scene was filmed she , " felt beautiful , and it ended up being a really lovely experience " . 
 The whole bus @-@ crash sequence was storyboarded . Greg Yaitanes described stunt @-@ coordinator Jim Vickers as " crucial " for the filming of this sequence . The bus crash scene was filmed in a studio using a big spinning wheel ( which Anne Dudek referred to as a " gadget " ) . This gadget was mainly the back of the bus , and could be turned 360 degrees to increase the authenticity of the scene . For the rest of the bus , a greenscreen was used that surrounded the complete outside of the bus . The shots involving Anne Dudek were filmed at another time , using light effects and people simulating a bus crash experience in the otherwise motionless gadget .

 Overall , " House 's Head " was very well received by critics .

She was also pleased with the hypnotism scene , because it gave Chase " something to do " . Morrison graded the episode with an A + . Michelle Romero , of Entertainment Weekly , said that she can watch " House 's Head " twice and get as much out of the second viewing as the first . TV Guide 's Gina Dinunno stated : " It 's everything I imagined : brilliant , snarky , confusing ; even dirty ! They did an amazing job at leaving us with the cliffhanger of all cliffhangers as we wait to see what will happen to Amber " . Alan Sepinwall , from The Star @-@ Ledger , compared the episode to the House season two finale " No Reason " . He , however , also said that the episode had " several issues " , mainly the hints towards " the answer " being Amber . On this , Sepinwall commented " House is , at heart , a mystery , and when the show telegraphs the solution , it isn 't half as entertaining " . 
 James Chamberlin , of IGN , said that he hoped the second part of the season finale could live up to the first half . He also said that the scenes revolving around " the answer " reminded him of The Matrix . Chamberlin graded the episode with a 9 @.@ 5 on a ten scale . Barbara Barnett , of Blog Critics , praised both Hugh Laurie 's and Lisa Edelstein 's acting performances . She also said that , although there were many " memorable moments " in the episode , the scene in which the bus crashed was " intense " , " tension @-@ filled " and " heart @-@ stopping " . Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune 's The Watcher stated that , although she did predict the twist about midway through the episode , there were " so many other enjoyable elements " that it didn 't bother her . Jennifer Godwin of E ! said the episode was " easily one of House 's best finales ever " . Also , several critics were surprised by Fred Durst 's brief cameo as the bartender in House 's flashback . 
 The scene in which Lisa Cuddy did a pole dance was very positively received by critics , Mary <unk> , of the Los Angeles Times , stated that these scenes " in three minutes earned back the price of TiVo " . James Chamberlin of IGN stated that he never expected Edelstein to do a strip tease , although he had hoped it .

 = 1880 Republican National Convention = 
 The 1880 Republican National Convention convened from June 2 to June 8 , 1880 , at the Interstate Exposition Building in Chicago , Illinois , United States , and nominated Representative James A. Garfield of Ohio and Chester A. Arthur of New York as the official candidates of the Republican Party for President and Vice President , respectively , in the 1880 presidential election . 
 Of the 14 men in contention for the Republican nomination , the three strongest candidates leading up to the convention were Ulysses S. Grant , James G. Blaine , and John Sherman . Grant had served two terms as President from 1869 to 1877 , and was seeking an unprecedented third term in office . He was backed by the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party , which supported political machines and patronage . Blaine was a senator and former representative from Maine who was backed by the Half @-@ Breed faction of the Republican Party . Sherman , the brother of Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman , was serving as Secretary of the Treasury under President Rutherford B. Hayes . A former senator from Ohio , he was backed by delegates who did not support the Stalwarts or Half @-@ Breeds . 
 On the first ballot , Sherman received 93 votes , while Grant and Blaine had 304 and 285 , respectively . With 379 votes required to win the nomination , none of the candidates was close to victory , and the balloting continued . After the thirty @-@ fifth ballot , Blaine and Sherman switched their support to a new " dark horse " candidate , James Garfield . On the next ballot , Garfield won the nomination by receiving 399 votes , 93 higher than Grant 's total . Garfield 's Ohio delegation chose Chester A. Arthur , a Stalwart , as Garfield 's vice @-@ presidential running mate . Arthur won the nomination by capturing 468 votes , and the longest @-@ ever Republican National Convention was subsequently adjourned . The Garfield – Arthur Republican ticket later defeated Democrats Winfield Scott Hancock and William Hayden English in the close 1880 presidential election . 
 = = Background = = 
 As President of the United States , Rutherford B. Hayes had caused heated tensions within the Republican Party . Hayes had moved away from party patronage by offering government jobs to Southern Democrats instead of Northern Republicans . His actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party , such as Roscoe Conkling of New York and James G. Blaine of Maine . Hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880 , and had announced at his 1877 inauguration that he would not run for a second term . Without an incumbent president in the race , the rival factions within the Republican Party , the Stalwarts and the Half @-@ Breeds , eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election . 
 = = = Ulysses S. Grant = = = 
 At the close of Grant 's two terms as president in 1877 , the Republican @-@ controlled Congress suggested that Grant not return to the White House for a third term . Grant did not seem to mind and even told his wife Julia , " I do not want to be here [ in the White House ] another four years . I do not think I could stand it . " After Grant left the White House , he and his wife decided to use their US $ 85 @,@ 000 of savings to travel around the world . A biographer from the New York Herald , John Russell Young , traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called Around the World with General Grant . Young saw that Grant 's popularity was soaring , as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in Tokyo and Peking , China . 
 After Hayes ' falling @-@ out with the Republican Party and a perceived desire on the part of the United States ' electorate for a strong man in the White House , Grant returned to the United States ahead of schedule , in hopes of seeking a third term in office . With the backing of the Stalwarts and calls for a " man of iron " to replace the " man of straw " in the White House , Grant was confident that he would receive the Republican nomination for the presidency . Roscoe Conkling , the leader of the Stalwart faction , formed a " triumvirate " with J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of Illinois to lead the campaign for Grant 's return to the White House . With a Grant victory , Conkling and other Stalwarts would have great influence in the White House . Grant knew he could count on the Stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a Grant victory . Conkling was so confident in Grant 's nomination that he said , " Nothing but an act of God could prevent Grant 's nomination . " An aide to the ex @-@ president , Adam Badeau , commented that Grant had become " extremely anxious to receive the nomination " and did not think that there was any chance of failure . 
 However , close friends of Grant saw that his public support was slipping . John Russell Young took Grant aside and told him that he would lose the election , and should withdraw to avoid embarrassment . Young argued that Grant was being heavily attacked by opponents , who were against the concept of a presidential third term . Young also criticized the handling of the campaign and told Grant that if he won the election , he would be indebted to the " triumvirate " . Grant felt that his Stalwart friends had been of great assistance in his election bid , and they deserved political patronage in his administration . Grant , nonetheless , listened to Young 's advice and wrote a letter to J. Donald Cameron , authorizing his name to be withdrawn from the nomination contest after consultation with his other Stalwart backers . Upon hearing of his letter , Julia Grant was insistent that her husband should not withdraw his name from the contest . She said , " If General Grant were not nominated , then let it be so , but he must not withdraw his name – no , never . " Young delivered the letter to the " triumvirate " in Chicago on May 31 , but no action was taken to remove Grant 's name .

 The other main contender for the Republican nomination was James G. Blaine . Blaine , a senator from Maine who had also served in the United States House of Representatives , including holding the Speaker of the House position from 1869 to 1875 , was in the competition to prevent Grant 's nomination . Four years earlier Blaine had campaigned for the party 's nomination ; in the weeks prior to the 1876 convention , he was accused of committing fraudulent activities involving railroad stocks . The specifics of Blaine 's involvement were detailed in the Mulligan letters . Blaine pleaded his own defense on the floor of the House of Representatives , and he read aloud selected , edited portions of the letter that were not incriminating . Despite his attempt to clear his name , Blaine was tarnished by the scandal throughout the rest of his political career . On the Sunday before balloting was to begin in Cincinnati , Ohio , Blaine collapsed at the steps of Washington Congregational Church . He was unconscious for two days , and as a result , he lost supporters who were doubtful over his health and whether he was capable of handling the presidency . Blaine was also ridiculed by opponents , who accused him of faking illness to gain sympathy ; the New York Sun headlined " Blaine <unk> a Faint " . On the first ballot of the 1876 convention , Blaine received 285 votes , while his political enemy , Roscoe Conkling , was in second place with only 99 votes . Blaine and Conkling had a long @-@ standing political feud that started at a debate on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1866 . After six more ballots resulted in no consensus , Conkling switched his support to Rutherford B. Hayes , who ultimately beat Blaine for the nomination . 
 After Blaine 's failure in 1876 , his supporters believed that he needed to be nominated at the 1880 convention in Chicago if he was ever going to be President , reasoning that if he tried for the nomination twice and failed , he could not count on another opportunity . As his campaign manager , William E. Chandler , put it : 
 Despite the Mulligan letters scandal , Blaine had succeeded remarkably in his 1880 campaign , attracting nationwide support for his candidacy . He argued for the gold standard , support for big business , a tariff to protect American <unk> , civil rights for freed blacks and Irish independence .

 John Sherman was a longtime senator from Ohio who also served the state in the House of Representatives in the late 1850s and early 1860s . As a senator , Sherman led the planning of the national banking system . He also oversaw the national policy for the post @-@ Civil War banking system , and helped restore the nation 's finances after the Panic of 1873 . Under President Hayes , Sherman served as the Secretary of the Treasury , advocating for the gold standard and building up the country 's gold reserves . Sherman 's colleagues did not have much confidence in their presidential bid . Sherman was known as the " Ohio Icicle " for his <unk> personality , which made him unappealing to voters . His colleagues commented that in public , Sherman " was not eloquent , though a graceful speaker , confining himself almost entirely to statements of fact . " In private , he was " reserved , self @-@ contained , " a personality that many Americans were not comfortable with . As President , Sherman intended to continue his support for the gold standard . Prior to the start of the convention , papers had predicted Sherman to receive 110 votes in the balloting . Sherman felt that he still had a chance at the nomination once the Grant vote broke apart after five or six ballots .

 James Garfield came into Chicago as a Senator @-@ elect from Ohio , who had represented the state in the United States House since 1863 . In 1859 , as a Republican , Garfield was elected to the Ohio Senate . The following year , he was admitted to the Ohio bar . He served as state senator until 1861 , when he enlisted in the Union Army at the start of the Civil War . Garfield was assigned to command the 42nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry , and had the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky . Garfield later led an attack with a number of infantry regiments against a Confederate cavalry at Jenny 's Creek on January 6 , 1862 . The Confederates retreated , and for leading his men to victory , Garfield was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in March 1862 . 
 Garfield later served under Major General Don Carlos Buell at the Battle of Shiloh and under Thomas J. Wood at the Siege of Corinth . Garfield 's health deteriorated and he was sent to serve on a commission to investigate the conduct of Union general Fitz John Porter . In the spring of 1863 , Garfield returned to the field as Chief of Staff for William S. Rosecrans , commander of the Army of the Cumberland . After the disastrous Chickamauga campaign in September 1863 , Rosecrans was relieved of his command . Garfield saved his own reputation by fighting bravely during the battles , and he was subsequently promoted to the rank of Major General . Garfield 's fame spread , and William Dennison engineered Garfield 's 1863 election to Congress . As Whitelaw Reid commented , Garfield was " the most able and prominent of the young politicians who entered the army at the outbreak of the war . " Garfield did not want to leave the army , so he personally visited President Abraham Lincoln for advice on the matter . Lincoln told Garfield that he had more generals than he could handle , and what he needed was political support . 
 Garfield succeeded in gaining re @-@ election for his House seat every two years . In 1872 , Garfield faced charges for receiving $ 329 in tainted money from the Crédit Mobilier of America corruption scandal . Garfield repeatedly denied the charges and even hired William E. Chandler to defend him in front of the congressional investigators . There was not much evidence against Garfield , so his political career was not significantly affected . Four years later , when James G. Blaine moved from the House to the United States Senate , Garfield became the Republican floor leader of the House . That year , Garfield served as a member of the Electoral Commission that awarded 20 hotly contested electoral votes to Rutherford B. Hayes in his contest for the Presidency against Samuel J. Tilden . Prior to the 1880 Republican National Convention , Garfield had expressed that he was a Blaine supporter . It was not until John Sherman entered the race that Garfield switched sides , and offered his support for the " Ohio Icicle " . 
 = = Pre @-@ convention politics = = 
 In January , caucuses were held in local districts to pick delegates . The state conventions would then select a number of these delegates to represent the state at the national convention . Prior to the convention , there was a great deal of machine politics conducted by the candidates . John Sherman utilized Treasury Department employees who owed their jobs to him to meet up at local caucuses across the South to guarantee loyal state delegations . State @-@ level bosses , like Roscoe Conkling , used the state conventions to pick delegates that were politically allied to a particular candidate . In the state delegate @-@ selection convention at Utica , New York , Grant 's supporters carried only a 217 – 180 majority over Blaine supporters , but Conkling passed a resolution declaring that , " the Republicans of New York believe the re @-@ election of Ulysses S. Grant as Presidential candidate of urgent importance , and the delegates this day assembled are called upon and instructed to use their earnest and united efforts to secure his nomination . 
 Conkling commanded delegates to follow the resolution , and if they were to violate it , he guaranteed they would be victims of political revenge and personal dishonor . However , in Chicago , there were a number of New York delegates who went against the resolution and publicly expressed their support for Blaine . J. Donald Cameron used similar tactics to intimidate dissenters in the Pennsylvania state convention . The third member of the " triumvirate " , John A. Logan , literally locked out Blaine supporters from the Illinois state convention , and replaced them with personally chosen Grant supporters . 
 By May 29 , four days before the opening of the convention , trainloads upon trainloads of delegates , lobbyists , reporters , and campaign followers had arrived at the Union and Dearborn railway stations in Chicago . Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies . Pre @-@ convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources . One , from the Albany Evening Journal , predicted Blaine with 277 votes , Grant with 317 , Sherman with 106 , and 49 for the other candidates . All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win . Many in Chicago knew that a victor , most probably Grant , would only be determined if the unit rule , which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state 's delegation , was to be in effect . If that was not the case , then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other . 
 Before any voting began , the delegates had to vote on the important matter of the unit rule . Prior to the start of the convention , James Garfield noted , " I regard it [ the unit rule ] as being more important than even the choice of a candidate . " If the rule was supported by a majority of the delegates , then state party bosses , like the members of the " triumvirate " , would be able to solidify Grant 's nomination bid . If Conkling and the other Stalwart bosses had their way , the nearly sixty dissenters from the states represented by the " triumvirate " would be silenced . Unfortunately for Half @-@ Breeds , J. Donald Cameron was chairman of the Republican National Committee . Cameron planned to exercise his power to adopt new rules for the convention , and also suppress any dissenters of the unit rule . His plan was leaked , and within days , almost all the delegates in Chicago knew about it . Supporters of the Sherman and Blaine campaigns knew that they had to prevent Cameron from exercising his power . Blaine 's forces agreed that they could only prevent Cameron from imposing the unit rule by removing him as the chair of the Republican National Committee . 
 At 7 : 00 P.M. on May 31 , J. Donald Cameron convened the Republican National Committee 's last meeting before the opening of the convention . Of the forty @-@ six men at the meeting , Cameron counted only sixteen allies . The rest of the men were anti @-@ Grant delegates who had decided to gang up on Cameron . Colorado senator Jerome B. Chaffee was the first to bring up the unit rule at the meeting . Chaffee handed Cameron a handwritten motion that was orchestrated by William E. Chandler . Cameron expected this , and knew he had to find some fault in Chaffee 's motion . Cameron called Chaffee 's motion out of order . Upon being questioned by Chaffee , Cameron explained that the committee could only appoint a temporary chairman to the convention , and could not vote on the unit rule issue ( which he said belonged to the Rules Committee ) . Cameron then used George Cornelius Gorham , a California Stalwart delegate who as secretary of the United States Senate had become an expert on parliamentary procedure , to justify his ruling . One by one , anti @-@ Grant delegates unsuccessfully tried to appeal Cameron 's motion . Gorham proclaimed that as committee chairman , Cameron could do " as he saw fit . " Marshall Jewell , a Connecticut delegate member who had served in Grant 's administration as Postmaster General , spoke up against Cameron 's rulings . Cameron did not comment , and then called for a brief recess . After the recess , he acknowledged a motion from William E. Chandler to elect George Frisbie Hoar , a neutral senator and delegate from Massachusetts , as the convention 's temporary chairman . 
 The committee voted 29 – 17 in favor of electing Hoar as temporary chairman of the convention . At midnight , the committee was adjourned , and the members scheduled to continue the meeting the following morning . News of Cameron 's behavior had spread overnight , throughout town . His hardliner strategy had failed , and Conkling and other Grant managers sought to control the situation before it became any worse . The next morning , Conkling asked his trusted colleague , Chester A. Arthur , to solve the problem . Arthur assessed the situation and drew up a compromise . He met Chandler and the rest of the anti @-@ Grant cabal at the entrance of the committee 's suite . Arthur acknowledged that the Grant men had rejected Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman the day before , but said that the Grant men might perhaps reconsider . He proposed that the delegates decide on the unit rule in a free vote , and in return , Don Cameron would be restored as the chairman of the national committee . After discussing for a number of minutes , the two men came to an agreement . Arthur was confident that since Chandler , the leader of Blaine 's campaign , had accepted the deal , then " it would be agreed by the Grant men . " Chandler then discussed the compromise deal with the thirty anti @-@ Grant committee members , and also James Garfield , who had previously expressed his opposition to the unit rule . 23 out of 30 anti @-@ Grant men agreed to the terms , and Garfield commented that the proposition " must be accepted " in " spirit of reconciliation . " 
 The committee reconvened again on the afternoon of June 1 , with J. Donald Cameron sitting as the committee chairman . Arthur made a number of motions , indicating that the Grant men from New York and Pennsylvania would support Senator Hoar 's appointment as the temporary chairman of the convention . No one objected and the motions were accepted . The meeting was then adjourned . A reporter from the New York Tribune later remarked that the Grant followers had been " saved from utter ruin by the excellent management of General Arthur .... " 
 = = The convention = = 
 At noon on Wednesday , June 2 , J. Donald Cameron banged his gavel to commence the beginning of the seventh Republican National Convention . As instructed , Cameron placed the nomination for Senator Hoar as the temporary convention chairman . The nomination was passed unanimously . Later , delegates John H. Roberts of Illinois and Christopher L. Magee of Pennsylvania were made temporary convention secretaries . Senator Eugene Hale of Maine submitted a resolution for a roll call , in which the chairman of each delegation would announce the people from their delegation serving on the convention 's three committees . The committees were formed , and the convention was adjourned at five minutes past three in the afternoon . 
 The convention reconvened at 11 : 00 A.M. on June 3 . Roscoe Conkling submitted a motion for a recess , but the motion was rejected . Another New York delegate , Henry R. Pierson from the Committee on Permanent Organization , submitted a proposal to make the temporary convention assignments permanent . The motion was adopted , and the convention took a four @-@ hour recess until 5 : 00 P.M. After the recess , a motion was made for the Committee on Rules to be directed to report , but a substitute motion from George H. Sharpe of New York called for the Committee on Credentials to report . The substitute motion was rejected by a vote of 406 to 318 , and the original resolution was laid on the table . At 7 : 30 P.M. , the convention was adjourned until 10 : 00 A.M. the following morning . 
 The next morning , Conkling then submitted a resolution that bound every delegate in the hall to support the party 's nominee . Conkling said that " no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree . " A voice vote was called , and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support . However , about a dozen or so delegates answered " no " . Conkling was shocked . He asked , " [ who ] at a Republican convention would vote ' no ' on such a resolution ? " He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters . Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the " Glass Palace " . Only three delegates , all from West Virginia , voted " no " to the resolution , and were showered with a " storm of hisses . " Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention . The West Virginians revolted against Conkling 's resolution , and heavily criticized him for his motion . James Garfield , who was sitting at the Ohio delegation , stood up and tried to settle the matter . He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling 's motion , and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case . Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not " be disenfranchised because they thought it was not the time to make such an expression [ about a candidate ] . " He stated that " there never can be a convention ... that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever . " Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech . Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation . He scribbled a note to Garfield which read , " New York requests that Ohio 's real candidate and dark horse come forward ... R.C. " 
 Afterwards , the fight over credentials erupted into a free @-@ for @-@ all . After John A. Logan had barred anti @-@ Grant delegates from the state convention earlier in the year , they had decided to file credential reports . At the meeting between Arthur and Chandler , both men had agreed that the credentials issue could be discussed at the convention . A Chicago lawyer who supported Grant , Emery Storrs interrupted the legal argument over credentials by mocking the Blaine campaigners . His remarks set off a barrage of comments from both the Blaine and Grant sides . The convention went out of control , as people started shouting and jumping throughout the convention hall . As Garfield commented , the convention " seemed [ as if ] it could not be in America , but in the Sections of Paris in the ecstasy of the Revolution . " The fracas continued until 2 : 00 A.M. when acting chairman Green B. Raum , the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue , banged the gavel to end the demonstration . 
 = = = Presenting the nominees = = = 
 On Saturday night , the alphabetical roll call of the states to present nominees was conducted . The first candidate for the Republican nomination emerged when the Michigan delegation was in roll call . James F. Joy , the seventy @-@ year @-@ old president of the Michigan Central Railroad , gave the speech nominating Blaine . Joy was not a practiced public speaker , and he stumbled and rushed through his nomination speech , " because we are all now impatient for the voting . " Joy ended his speech by nominating " James S. Blaine " for the Republican ticket . Promptly , a number of delegates yelled back , " G ! G. Blaine , you fool ! " The delegates from the next state in the roll call , Minnesota , nominated Senator William Windom as their " favorite son " candidate . Nine states later , Roscoe Conkling of New York stepped up to the podium to present his nomination for Ulysses S. Grant . 
 And when asked what State he hail from , 
 Our sole reply shall be , 
 He hails from Appomattox , 
 And its famous apple tree . 
 The crowd of 15 @,@ 000 responded by erupting in cheers . Conkling built up the crowd 's energy with his speech , and then introduced his candidate by proclaiming , " New York is for Ulysses S. Grant . Never defeated – never defeated in peace or in war , his name is the most illustrious borne by living men . " He later spoke of Grant 's loyalty to the American people , and then scolded Grant 's enemies who had brought up the third term issue . Conkling tried to show that Grant was an honest person who had won the delegates " without patronage and without emissaries , without committees , [ and ] without bureaus .... " After Conkling finished his speech , boos and hisses came from Blaine and Sherman backers , while applause was heard from Stalwart supporters of Grant . After North Carolina 's roll call , the Ohio delegation brought out James Garfield to give the nomination speech for John Sherman . 
 Garfield had not actually written a speech , and was nervous about speaking in front of such a large crowd . Before heading to Chicago , Sherman told Garfield that Garfield 's speech should stress Sherman 's " courageous persistence in any course he had adopted . " Garfield started his speech by emphasizing his overwhelming pride for his role in the convention . Garfield then list the qualities that a president should possess and stressed the importance of party unity . It wasn 't until near his conclusion that he mentioned Sherman by name . Many reports of Garfield 's speech describe it as enthusiastic , eloquent , and well received . Some accounts indicate that it was so well @-@ received that it caused delegates to begin thinking of Garfield as a contender for the presidential nomination . 
 On the other hand , some members of the Sherman campaign were disappointed by Garfield 's speech . One telegram from a Sherman backer sent to Sherman himself claimed that , " [ Garfield ] has been of no service to you ... he was extremely lukewarm in his support . " Rumors began to spread that Ohio Governor Charles Foster and Garfield , who were in adjoining suites at the Grand Pacific Hotel , were " conspiring to bring Garfield out as [ a ] candidate .... " News of the finger @-@ pointing within the Sherman camp had carried into newspapers across the country . The Albany Evening Journal reported that " [ t ] here is a general belief that the Ohio delegation is ready to desert Sherman and go over to Blaine in a body . " 
 Although he had become popular with the delegates after his speech , Garfield was upset over the accusations of those inside the Sherman group , and he worried how they would affect him in the future . His close colleagues felt he was becoming too popular , too quickly . Friends , like Lorenzo Coffin , felt that his " time is not yet . " Garfield heeded the advice of his friends to lower his profile at the convention , but he had already made a deep impression on the delegates . Late Sunday night on June 6 , Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison , grandson of former President William Henry Harrison , came to Garfield 's hotel suite and asked him under what conditions he would accept the nomination . Garfield replied that he had come to the convention for the sole purpose of supporting John Sherman , and told Harrison that Garfield 's " name must not be used [ in the nomination ] . " 
 = = = Balloting = = = 
 At ten o 'clock on Monday morning , convention chairman Hoar banged his gavel to open the convention . Eugene Hale moved to immediately proceed to the presidential nominee balloting , and Roscoe Conkling seconded the motion . Newspapers had predicted the results of the balloting , and the delegates knew that it would take a number of ballots before a victor could be found . The first surprise during the balloting roll call came when John A. Logan of Illinois announced that of his state 's forty @-@ two delegates , only twenty @-@ four were in support of Grant . This was not as " solid " as Logan had previously advertised to the rest of the Grant backers . New York faced a similar situation . Of its seventy delegates , fifty @-@ one supported Grant , seventeen were for Blaine , and the remaining two supported Sherman . Pennsylvania fared even worse , as only thirty @-@ two of the state 's fifty @-@ eight delegates put in their support for Grant . 
 After all the states were polled , the results were tabulated . Grant received 304 votes , Blaine had 284 , Sherman had 93 , Vermont senator George F. Edmunds received 34 , Elihu B. Washburne , who had served as the United States Ambassador to France under President Grant , had 30 , and Minnesota senator William Windom received 10 . Of the states represented by the " triumvirate " , sixty delegates did not support Grant . None of the candidates were close to the 379 needed to secure the nomination , so the balloting continued throughout the day . 
 In Washington , D.C. , both Blaine and Sherman were disappointed by their first @-@ ballot vote totals . Blaine had been told that he should expect around 300 first @-@ ballot votes , but his actual total fell sixteen short , and it was also one vote fewer than the total he received on the first ballot at the 1876 Convention . Sherman was told to expect 110 votes , which was significantly lower than the expected totals for Blaine and Grant . However , Sherman felt his chance would come later , when the Grant vote split apart . After Sherman heard his first @-@ ballot vote totals , he grew visibly angry that " some of them [ the votes ] were taken away from him before the ballot began . " He was upset that nine Ohio delegates bolted from Sherman and voted instead for his opponent , James G. Blaine . Sherman blamed Blaine for causing the delegates to bolt from Ohio " by [ methods of ] falsehood , ridicule and treachery . " In Galena , Illinois , Grant did not express any emotions after being told about the first @-@ ballot vote totals . As one newsman reported , " [ t ] he silent soldier was smoking his cigar with all his usual serenity . " Grant 's wife , Julia , expected a deadlock , and suggested to her husband that he surprise the delegates in Chicago with a visit . Grant thought this was unwise because it gave an appearance of bad luck and bad manners . Despite his wife 's attempts to change his mind , Grant remained adamant . 
 Meanwhile , the delegates at the convention continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined . On the second ballot of the day , a Pennsylvania delegate named W. A. Grier cast a vote for James Garfield . However , the Garfield support remained with that one delegate 's vote for most of the day . The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner . After dinner , they came back and cast ten more ballots . Still , no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win . After twelve hours of balloting , Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night . A few Grant delegates objected , but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308 . After twenty @-@ eight ballots , Grant had 307 votes , Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91 , and the rest of the votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F. Edmunds . 
 Suggestions for introducing a " dark horse " candidate began to take place . Members backing each candidate were equally determined to win the nomination , but some felt that the deadlock could not be broken if new candidates were not introduced into the balloting . Backers for Sherman and Blaine met after the convention was adjourned . Chandler laid down his terms . Blaine had nearly 300 votes , and could not simply withdraw . As Chandler explained , even " [ i ] f Mr. Blaine permits his column to be broken , [ then ] Iowa , Nebraska , Kansas , Nevada , California , Oregon & twelve votes in the Territories will go to Grant ... [ as would ] Mr. Blaine 's Southern votes . " Both sides argued until two or three in the morning , but no decision had been reached . Grant leaders had also met that night in Roscoe Conkling 's suite in the Grand Pacific Hotel . They discussed the imposing dangers of Grant 's nomination bid , such as the third @-@ term resistors . Many speculated that Grant was not going to receive the nomination . The Grant backers discussed the other two chief candidates , and found them both to be unacceptable . Some of the men called for Conkling himself as a substitute for Grant . They argued that with Grant out of the race , Conkling would face little resistance for the Republican nomination . However , Conkling refused to accept the idea of being nominated for president . He said " [ even ] if I were to receive every other vote in the Convention , my own would still be lacking , and that I would not give . I am here as the agent of New York to support General Grant to the end . Any man who would forsake him under such conditions does not deserve to be elected , and could not be elected . 
 The first ballot on Tuesday morning , June 8 , saw two major breaks in the voting . Massachusetts switched their twenty @-@ one votes from Senator George Edmunds to John Sherman , spiking his total to 116 , the highest thus far . William Chandler also convinced three Minnesota delegates to switch their support from their " favorite son " candidate , William Windom , to James G. Blaine . By the thirty @-@ second ballot , Blaine had dropped six votes from the night before , and Grant had increased his total to 309 . Despite the relatively small changes in votes totals Roscoe Conkling confidently claimed that the " [ m ] embers of the N.Y. Delegation assert that Grant will be nominated before one o 'clock . " On the thirty @-@ third ballot , nine Wisconsin delegates shifted their support from Grant to Elihu Washburne . On the next ballot , sixteen of twenty Wisconsin delegates changed their vote to James Garfield . Garfield immediately called to chairman Hoar to raise a question of order . Garfield " challenge [ d ] the correctness of the announcement " , claiming that without his consent , he should not be receiving votes . Hoar dismissed Garfield 's question , claiming later that he denied Garfield because he did not want to see a presidency be undone by a simple point of order , meaning he did not want Garfield to stop the momentum for his own candidacy . After the ballot , the vote totals for the major candidates stood at 312 for Grant , 275 for Blaine , 107 for Sherman , and 17 for Garfield . In the thirty @-@ fifth ballot , Benjamin Harrison of Indiana announced that his state would shift all twenty @-@ seven of its votes ( mostly coming from the Blaine column ) to Garfield . Four Maryland delegates and one delegate each from Mississippi and North Carolina also switched their vote to Garfield , bringing his total to 50 . 
 Blaine saw that his chances for winning the nomination were slipping , commenting to a visitor trying to keep Blaine in the race that it was not necessary to have " wasted a card upon a falling market , " meaning that his guest had presented a calling card in order to see Blaine for a meeting that would not be productive . Blaine felt that the most suitable candidate was James Garfield . Garfield was a close friend , and he felt that by supporting Garfield , he could defeat Grant and Conkling and possibly receive an appointment in Garfield 's administration . Likewise , Sherman listened to advice from his colleagues and decided to shift all his support to Garfield , to " save the Republican Party . " Both candidates told their supporters to support Garfield 's nomination . 
 On the thirty @-@ sixth ballot , Garfield won the Republican nomination after receiving 399 votes , 93 higher than Grant 's total . Blaine finished with 42 , Washburne had 5 , John Sherman had 3 , and the remaining were split amongst other minor candidates . Garfield was so overwhelmed with emotion after winning the nomination that an Inter Ocean reporter noted that he looked " pale as death , and seemed to be half @-@ unconsciously to receive the congratulations of his friends . " The convention was in a mad frenzy as thousands of people chanted for Garfield , and later joined in the singing of the Battle Cry of Freedom . The Grant followers , like Roscoe Conkling , looked on with " glum faces " and made " no effort to conceal their disappointment . " Conkling took great pride in the 306 delegates who had supported Grant throughout the entire balloting . With the Grant supporters , Conkling formed a " Three Hundred and Six Guard " society . The society held annual dinners , and even drew up a commemorative coin with the inscription , " The Old Guard " . 
 Afterwards , chairman Hoar banged his gavel and announced , " James A. Garfield , of Ohio , is nominated for President of the United States . " Garfield wrote a letter to his wife stating that " if the results meet your approval , I shall be content [ with the nomination ] . " Garfield 's wife , Lucretia , was thrilled with her husband 's nomination and gave her approval . ( Garfield subsequently resigned the Senate seat to which he had been elected for the term beginning in 1881 , and the Ohio Legislature then elected Sherman . ) 
 Garfield and the Ohio delegation desired a New York Stalwart as Garfield 's vice presidential running mate , partly to placate Conkling , and partly to balance the ticket geographically . Levi P. Morton declined after consulting with Conkling , who was still unhappy over Grant 's loss and advised Morton not to accept . The nomination was then offered to Chester A. Arthur , who had close Stalwart ties to Conkling , but who had impressed delegates with his work to broker the compromise on the selection of a convention chairman . Conkling tried to talk Arthur out of accepting , but Arthur insisted that he would , calling the Vice Presidency " a greater honor than I ever dreamed of attaining . " Arthur won the nomination after he received 468 votes , next to the 193 for Elihu Washburne , and 44 for the third major candidate , Marshall Jewell . Former Governor Edmund J. Davis of Texas and several others were also nominated , but received little support . After convention chairman Hoar banged his gavel at 7 : 25 P.M. on June 8 , the longest ever Republican National Convention was adjourned . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Garfield led the first front porch campaign for the Presidency . He did not travel that much , and he usually stayed at home to present his presidential agenda to visitors . Garfield enlisted the support of the other candidates from the convention to help with the campaign . The 1880 Democratic National Convention chose Winfield Scott Hancock as the presidential candidate and William Hayden English as his vice @-@ presidential running mate . The election featured a very close popular vote , that put Garfield out with a majority of less than ten thousand votes , with some sources putting it as low as 2 @,@ 000 votes . However , Garfield won the election with 214 of the 369 electoral votes in the country . 
 On July 2 , 1881 , Garfield was shot by a former Chicago lawyer named Charles J. Guiteau at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington , D.C. Guiteau was a staunch supporter of the Stalwarts , and he even gave speeches in New York to rally Grant supporters . After Garfield was elected president , Guiteau repeatedly tried to contact the president and his Secretary of State James G. Blaine in hopes of receiving the consulship in Paris . After finally being told by Blaine that he would not get the position , Guiteau decided to seek revenge on Garfield . He planned Garfield 's assassination for weeks . After shooting Garfield , he proclaimed " I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be President . " Garfield died on September 19 , more than two and a half months after the shooting . After a lengthy trial , Guiteau was sentenced to death , and he was hanged on June 30 , 1882 . 
 = Wheel of Fortune ( U.S. game show ) = 
 Wheel of Fortune ( often known simply as Wheel ) is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin . The show features a competition in which contestants solve word puzzles , similar to those used in Hangman , to win cash and prizes determined by spinning a giant carnival wheel .

O 'Donnell left in 1980 , Woolery in 1981 , and Stafford in 1982 ; they were replaced , respectively , by Jack Clark , Pat Sajak , and Vanna White . After Clark 's death in 1988 , M. G. Kelly took over briefly as announcer until O 'Donnell returned in 1989 . O 'Donnell remained on the network version until its cancellation , and continued to announce on the syndicated show until his death in 2010 , when Jim Thornton succeeded him . Sajak left the network version in January 1989 to host his own late @-@ night talk show , and was replaced on that version by Rolf Benirschke . Bob Goen replaced Benirschke when the network show moved to CBS , then remained as host until the network show was canceled altogether . The syndicated version has been hosted continuously by Sajak and White since its inception . 
 Wheel of Fortune ranks as the longest @-@ running syndicated game show in the United States , with over 6 @,@ 000 episodes aired .
