 One of the topics his research focused on was the discussion of fashion and femininity in the French fin @-@ de @-@ siècle . This took the form of monographs and works including Son Altesse la femme ( French for Her Highness Woman ) , <unk> and La Française du siècle ( The Frenchwoman of the Century ) . His own works include novels and fantasy books , such as Surprises du Coeur and Contes pour les bibliophiles ( Tales for bibliophiles ) .

 Louis Octave Uzanne was born on 14 September 1851 in Auxerre , to a bourgeois family originating from Savoy . His parents were Charles @-@ Auguste Omer Uzanne , a merchant , and Elisabeth Laurence Octavie ; his elder brother Joseph , had been born the previous year . His classical studies began in his home town ; he moved to Paris after his father 's death to study at the Collège Rollin in Paris — a residential school for the children of the French upper @-@ class . In Paris he became interested in the evolution and history of manuscripts and books . During the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 1871 he was attached to a school at Richmond in England . Continuing with law studies , he abandoned this line of work when he came into an inheritance in 1872 , allowing him to pursue his literary interests . 
 He became a regular visitor of the Library of the Arsenal , where he joined a group of followers of the former librarian , Charles Nodier , along with the journalist Charles <unk> , writer <unk> <unk> , and author and bibliophile Paul Lacroix . He also joined the Société des Amis des Livres ( founded in 1874 ) , the first French bibliophilic association since the Société des Bibliophiles François ( founded in 1820 ) . 
 At the start of his career , Uzanne focused on the lesser @-@ known writers of the 18th century , creating four volumes of work published by <unk> , and an additional 20 + volumes published by Albert Quantin . He was an admirer of the Goncourt brothers , who were also writers on the subject of 18th @-@ century France . Uzanne looked for mentors who were bibliophiles like him , rather than literary scholars ( <unk> ) like his companions at the Arsenal . While focusing on past subjects , he was very up @-@ to @-@ date on the technical aspects of printing and publishing . His 1879 work Le bric @-@ à @-@ brac de l 'amour ( literally , A bric @-@ a @-@ brac of love ) was one of the first to employ the <unk> , a zincography technique , and photo @-@ mechanical reproduction . Jackson points out that Uzanne , in Les Zigzags d 'un curieux ( literally , Zigzags of a Curious Man ) , divided the book collectors in two groups : those who are interested in the book as if it were a kind of stock market share ( <unk> de Bourse ) , a market quotation whose fluctuations " they follow with a <unk> 's interest " , and those — whom he considers " <unk> " — attracted to the book itself , its contents , rarity or beauty . 
 = = = <unk> and journalist = = = 
 After leaving the Société des Amis des Livres , which he found too conservative and too concerned with the reissue of old works , he started two new bibliographic societies , the Société des Bibliophiles <unk> ( 1889 – 1894 ) and the Societé des Bibliophiles Indépendants ( 1896 – 1901 ) . The first consisted of 160 people , including the writers Jules <unk> and Jean Richepin , the artists Albert Robida and Paul Avril , and the journalist and critic <unk> <unk> . Uzanne also edited two magazines , <unk> du bibliophile ( literally , Adviser of bibliophile , 1876 – 1877 ) and Les <unk> <unk> ( The Bibliographical Miscellany , 1878 – 1880 ) , and then ran three consecutive bibliophilic magazines : Le livre : <unk> moderne ( literally , The Book : Modern Bibliography , 1880 – 1889 ) , Le livre moderne : revue du monde <unk> et des bibliophiles <unk> ( literally , The Modern Book : Journal of the Literary World and Contemporary Bibliophiles , 1890 – 1891 ) , and L 'Art et l <unk> : revue contemporaine du <unk> l <unk> et de la <unk> ( Art and Ideas : Contemporary Journal of the Literary <unk> and Curiosity , 1892 – 1893 ) . In the early 1890s , he was considered to be " ... the best authority that book lovers know on subjects specially interesting to book lovers " . Nevertheless , such books as Le Miroir du Monde ( The Mirror of the World ) or L 'ombrelle – le gant – le manchon ( The <unk> , Muff , and Glove ) received negative reviews from some newspapers for Avril 's illustrations . 
 In contrast to most bibliophiles of his time , Uzanne was chiefly interested in the creation of new , luxurious bibliophile works , collaborating closely with printers , binders , typographers and artists ( especially the Symbolists and early Art Nouveau artists ) . Among them were such painters as James McNeill Whistler , Adolphe <unk> and Jules Barbey d 'Aurevilly — who wrote the preface of Le bric @-@ à @-@ brac de l 'amour ( 1879 ) — , the writer Jean Lorrain , and jewellery artists and exponents of Japonisme such as Henri <unk> . One of the main artists collaborating with Uzanne was the Belgian Félicien Rops , who illustrated some of his books and created the cover illustration for Le Livre Moderne , and who called Uzanne " the <unk> 's dream " . The overall quality of Uzanne 's books was remarked upon by the New York Times when reviewing his 1894 work La Femme à Paris : " The book is a highly @-@ artistic achievement in a typographical sense ... This artistic element and the style of the author ... elevate the work from its sphere of usefulness into the sphere of pure literature . It will be serviceable a century from now to students of our civilization . " Other symbolic works of art were <unk> ( 1896 ) , in which Rops illustrated many scenes of worldly life , or Son Altesse la femme ( Her Highness Woman , 1885 ) , on which he drew a naked witch in the chapter on medieval women . In the work he explored the lives of women at all levels of French society of his time . But also , according to Silverman , Uzanne associate feminism with a dangerous debauchery of sexual and moral investment , making full use a series of medical and philosophical sources , with the intention of proving the inability of women to merge into public life and the labour market , because of their temperament . Uzanne further indicated that the female figure and ornaments were essential in the French decorative arts , something that was missing in the early 20th century . 
 Uzanne 's bibliophile activity in the early 1880s coincided with the gradual abandonment of manual methods of printing illustrations kin favour of <unk> methods . His collection of contemporary bibliophilic books was sold in 1894 by Hôtel Drouot . It contained some of the finest examples of late 19th @-@ century French bookbinding , by binders like Charles Meunier , Lucien Magnin , Pétrus <unk> , Camille Martin , René Wiener and Victor <unk> . 
 Uzanne was also well known in the literary circles of his day , as attested by this poem of Stéphane Mallarmé in Vers de <unk> ( 1920 ) : 
 Non comme pour <unk> 
 Aux <unk> dos de <unk> 
 <unk> avec mon laisser @-@ aller 
 je vous <unk> , Octave Uzanne 
 ( Not as if to sparkle with mirth 
 at the immortal sheepskin spines 
 late with my usual sloppiness 
 I greet you , Octave Uzanne ) 
 As a journalist , sometimes employing the pseudonym " la <unk> " , Uzanne wrote for L 'Écho de Paris , Le Gaulois and other newspapers . In addition , for other French and foreign magazines like The Studio , Magazine of Art , and Scribner 's Magazine , for which he wrote in 1894 an article , " The End of Books " , which he thought would come because of the rise of <unk> , where he predicted the rise of radio and television . Uzanne was fascinated by modern technology and the possibilities it offered for the reproduction and dissemination of words , sounds , and images , which was evidenced not only in that article or in his groundbreaking work in book publishing , but also in an article he wrote in 1893 for the French newspaper Le Figaro , about a visit he made to US President Grover Cleveland and the inventor Thomas Edison during the EXPO Chicago 1893 , where he witnessed the Kinetograph shortly before it went public . 
 Books and women , these were the first of Uzanne 's loves , and I do not think he has disowned them , because the library is always full of invaluable and rare books , and the first book that he wanted to retouch and republish for the general public , is precisely a monograph of the Parisienne . ... One thinks Sébastien Mercier and <unk> de la <unk> , and no wrong . It is between these two great observers of French mores and the human heart has its place naturally Octave Uzanne . 
 In general , Silverman assigned to him " anti @-@ Semitic tendencies " and the Bibliothèque nationale de France is credited with the authorship of the anti @-@ Semitic pamphlet <unk> chez John Bull : l 'Angleterre <unk> ( 1913 ) , under the pseudonym " <unk> @-@ <unk> " . The journalist Gustave <unk> , in the prologue of Pietro Longhi ( 1924 ) by Uzanne , also listed this work among other works of Uzanne . On this pamphlet , he criticized the British government , including figures as Benjamin Disraeli and Nathan Mayer Rothschild . Uzanne collaborated with Edouard Drumont on his antisemitic newspaper La Libre Parole . Drumont and Uzanne held a cordial friendship through mail , and Uzanne helped him in the publication of the essay La France <unk> ( Jewish France , 1886 ) . 
 As an art critic , Uzanne wrote several reviews of etchings , as in a critique of French painter and illustrator Félix <unk> : " <unk> is a visionary , one obsessed by the picturesqueness of modern life ; nervous to excess , tortured by a crowd of fleeting impressions and queer ideas , he suffered from a cruel inability to reproduce them as he wished . " Uzanne 's written style was characterized by the use of <unk> and eccentric neologisms . 
 = = = Fashion writer = = = 
 Another of Uzanne 's interests was female fashion , about which he wrote a number of books and articles that were later translated into English . Specifically , he was focused on the image of the Parisienne , the women of Paris . Uzanne is perceived by some to have had a desire to revive French national pride ; he shared the nationalistic feelings of other members of the generation who had experienced the defeat by Prussia in 1870 . This was reflected in their efforts to promote a renewal of the decorative arts . Silverman mentions that Uzanne believed that married bourgeois women should not only decorate the walls of their homes , but also " cultivate luxury and art in an ornament ignored by their aristocratic predecessors : their undergarments " . Uzanne felt that the eroticism of the theatrical atmosphere was no longer what it had been and had become " more moral , more bourgeois " . His first and perhaps most famous book on fashion was L 'Éventail ( 1882 , translated as The Fan in 1884 ) , a " delightful " illustrated story about the hand fans . He admitted that his book " in no way a work of powerful wisdom and erudition " , but simply the first in a projected series of " little books for the boudoir " . 
 " Among the jewels of female ornamentation , the fan is the priority because , in the land of grace and spirit , still shines in the front row . " 
 His second book about fashion , L 'ombrelle – le gant – le manchon ( 1883 , translated in the same year as The <unk> , Muff , and Glove ) , was also illustrated in rococo style by Paul Avril ; in one of its lines Uzanne emphasized a female clothing accessory : " The muff ! " , he said , " Its name alone has something adorable , downy , and voluptuous about it . " Later he published Les <unk> de la femme ( 1892 ) , that reproduced in one volume the combined texts of L 'Éventail and L 'ombrelle – le gant – le manchon . His 1898 work Monument <unk> du <unk> siècle : Les Modes de Paris , translated as Fashions in Paris , was according to the review in the New York Times " ... the most complete and exhaustive work on the subject of French fashions that has yet appeared " . However , in this book he wanted to re @-@ establish the intimate and feminine culture of the rococo — but during his life he became influenced by modernism — and also he criticized the " sartorial severity " of the femme nouvelle . 
 An example of the historical novel is La Française du siècle ( 1886 , published in English as The Frenchwoman of the Century in 1887 ) , where Uzanne suggests that the effect of the Revolution on the woman of the period was " lamentable and disastrous " : " All French spirit , grace , and finesse seemed to have been submerged in the bloody , <unk> of the crowd . " In a couple of chapters of the book he described the France of the late Eighteenth Century , during the French Revolution ; some of its pages exhibited the " frivolity of women " during those years . For example , in a chapter on one of the stages of the French Revolution — known as the Directory — he included descriptions of customs such as the <unk> des <unk> : to these dancing assemblies , held at the Hôtel Richelieu , only admitted " aristocrats who could boast a relative guillotined during the Terror " ; he wrote that women cut their hair , as if they would be guillotined — some even carried a red ribbon around their neck . Uzanne disclosed that the five Directors who had established themselves at the Luxembourg formed a kind of Court @-@ society , and gave frequent entertainments : the queens of this society were de Staël , Hamelin , Bonaparte and <unk> . 
 Some moralists have pretended that the costumes of women have almost always undergone the same variations as their virtue . This is possible , and the study might be made in an amusing parallel ; but carry , if you will , before the tribunal of fashion the cause of the <unk> of the Directory , the sincere friends of art will still recognise that amongst these pagan women pleasure obtained a brilliant victory over decency , and that their extreme grace made their absence of dignity forgotten . 
 Although he focuses on the French Revolution , the story ends in the 1880s , shortly after the Second French Empire , closely following the evolution of society and women ( see also Historiography of the French Revolution ) . Later , he republished what was essentially is the same book but with a different title , in both French and English : La Femme et la mode . Métamorphoses de la parisienne de 1792 à 1892 or Woman and Fashion : Metamorphoses of the Parisienne 1792 – 1892 in the English version ( 1892 ) , and Les Modes de Paris . Variations du goût et de l <unk> de la femme , 1797 – 1897 ( 1897 ) . According to the Westminster Review , the English edition was practically a facsimile of the French , and the translator literally wrote the sentences to the point of <unk> . 
 Seductive spirit , all in lace and fripperies , M. Uzanne has touched the Belles Lettres , darling the History , irritated the Psychology and flirted with the Criticism . He has made more intimate the erudition , to literature and powdered makeup the most gallant of the world . He has told us l 'Éventail , l <unk> , the most charming artifices of feminine beauty , the pleasant platitudes I appreciate all the charm , though they may be an insufficient approach to strict style studies . 
 = = = Later life and death = = = 
 Uzanne never married , and in later life he wrote in praise of celibacy ; however , according to Remy de Gourmont , in writing about women Uzanne would not have been one of those authors who " exalted ambrosia without having tasted it " . Uzanne 's feelings toward women , as well as those of Jules Barbey d 'Aurevilly , were ambivalent in nature , a mixture of attraction and indifference . He also explored the concept of woman artists , subscribing to the view that women lack creative ability , a quality he associated solely with men : " The curious and paradoxical physiologist [ Cesare Lombroso ? ] has argued that the woman genius does not exist , and when such genius manifests itself it is a hoax of nature ; in this sense , she is male . " Based on that , Uzanne said that women artists perpetrated mediocre studies and exhibitions of painting and sculpture , and used this argument to support the idea that gender difference is the foundation of creativity . 
 Silverman mentions that he became in an " archetypal figure of the Belle Époque " , a " handsome monsieur with a beard " ( <unk> monsieur avec une <unk> ) admired by Félicien Rops , and an " elegant storyteller " ( l <unk> <unk> ) according to Anatole France . Silverman notes a contrast between the snobbish , dandy and reactionary side of Uzanne with a penchant for forgotten authors of the 17th and 18th centuries , and he , in turn , was an innovative artist and bibliophile , the antithesis of the antique collectors of the " old guard " , formed by bibliophiles — mostly aristocrats — who organised the Société des Bibliophiles François . Uzanne spent his last years in his apartment in Saint @-@ Cloud , where he died on 21 October 1931 . His remains were cremated at the crematorium and cemetery Père Lachaise . 
 Monsieur , you have the feeling of women [ le sentiment de la femme ] . You have what no one else has in our cold era : a loving imagination .

 Theatre and nightlife of France were also covered in his criticisms : shortly before the First World War , he wrote that " the public is accustomed to the irregular life of an actress ... and each spectator gives himself the pleasure of imagining a possible liaison with one of these queens of the footlights . " Uzanne 's literary output in the early twentieth century declined to minor journal articles and inexpensive editions in cheap @-@ format books ; for example , his 1902 book L 'art et les artifices de la <unk> only contained illustrations in black and white . Uzanne also contributed notes , forewords or commentary to a number of other books , as an appendix in The two young brides ( 1902 , English translation of Mémoires de deux <unk> <unk> ) , whose theme was portraits : 
 [ When Balzac died ] Never was there a face more noble , more superbly youthful , more mighty in its repose , than this , the image of which is Eugene Giraud 's legacy to us .

 = Rupert Downes = 
 Major General Rupert Major Downes CMG , KStJ , VD , <unk> ( 10 February 1885 – 5 March 1945 ) was an Australian soldier , general , surgeon and historian in the first half of the 20th century . Downes attended the University of Melbourne , graduating with his medical degrees in 1907 . He returned to the university to pursue a Doctor of Medicine degree , which was awarded in 1911 . 
 The son of British Army officer Major Francis Downes , Downes joined the Army as a trumpeter while he was still at school . He was commissioned as a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps in 1908 , and joined the First Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) in 1914 as its youngest lieutenant colonel . He served in the Gallipoli campaign , and was appointed Assistant Director of Medical Services ( ADMS ) of the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division in 1916 , which he combined with the post of ADMS AIF Egypt . In 1917 , he became Deputy Director of Medical Services ( DDMS ) of the Desert Mounted Corps . After the war , he wrote articles on medical aspects of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , and the section on the campaign for the official history . 
 Returning to Australia , Downes became an honorary consulting surgeon at the Royal Children 's Hospital , Melbourne and Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital , and honorary surgeon at Prince Henry 's Hospital . He became a foundation fellow of the College of Surgeons of Australasia in 1927 , and president of the Victorian branch of the British Medical Association in 1935 . He lectured on medical ethics at the University of Melbourne , writing the course textbook . He was also Victorian State Commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade , which he led for 25 years , and was president of the St John Ambulance Association for eight years . 
 In 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services , the Australian Army 's most senior medical officer , with the rank of major general . He oversaw the construction of major military hospitals in the capital cities . In 1944 he accepted a commission to edit the medical series volumes of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1939 – 1945 but was never able to do so as he was killed in a plane crash in 1945 . 
 = = Education and early life = = 
 Rupert Major Downes was born on 10 February 1885 in Mitcham , South Australia . He was the youngest of fifteen children of Colonel Major Francis Downes — a British Army officer — and his wife Helen Maria , formerly Chamberlin , only five of whom survived to adulthood . After service in the Crimean War , Colonel Francis Downes served as commandant of the Colonial forces of South Australia and Victoria and retired with the rank of major general in the Australian Army in 1902 . 
 Rupert was educated at Haileybury , Melbourne as a boarding student . In March 1901 , at the age of 16 , he joined the Victorian Horse Artillery ( St Kilda Battery ) , a part @-@ time volunteer militia unit , as a trumpeter . In May 1901 he served in this capacity at the opening of the inaugural Parliament of Australia by The Duke of Cornwall and York at the Royal Exhibition Building . In 1903 , Downes became a medical student at the University of Melbourne . A good result in his first year examinations earned him a residential scholarship to Ormond College , and he graduated with the double degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery ( MBBS ) in 1907 . 
 Soon after graduation , Downes enlisted in the Militia . He was commissioned as a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps on 1 July 1908 and was promoted to major on 26 March 1913 . He served his residency at Melbourne Hospital and became a general practitioner in Malvern , Victoria , but soon returned to the university to pursue a doctorate . His Doctor of Medicine ( MD ) thesis , entitled " The anatomical relations of the Thymus , especially considered in regard to <unk> death with an account of cases of abnormality " , was accepted in 1911 . He also did the coursework for a Master of Surgery ( MS ) , and this degree was conferred in 1912 . 
 Downes married Doris Mary Robb on 20 November 1913 at St John 's Church , Toorak , Victoria . They had three children : Rosemary Major , born in 1914 ; Valerie Major , born in March 1918 ; and John Rupert Major , born in 1922 . 
 = = First World War = = 
 Downes joined the First Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) on 2 October 1914 , assuming command of the 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance with the rank of lieutenant colonel — making him the youngest officer of that rank in the AIF at the time . Soon after his taking command , the unit was renamed the 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance . After training at the Broadmeadows Army Camp near Melbourne , the unit embarked for Egypt on the transport <unk> on 2 February 1915 . 
 The 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance departed Alexandria for Gallipoli on 17 May 1915 . It moved to Lemnos in June , where it operated a hospital , but returned to ANZAC Cove for the August offensive . Downes missed this operation , as he remained on Lemnos supervising the hospital until he returned to Anzac on 11 August . He remained with his unit until 13 November , when he departed for Lemnos and then Egypt . 
 After the evacuation of Gallipoli , Downes was appointed Assistant Director of Medical Services ( ADMS ) of the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division on 15 March 1916 . He was given the temporary rank of colonel , before substantive promotion on 20 February 1917 . Downes combined this post with that of ADMS AIF Egypt from 6 September 1916 . Downes therefore had to travel back and forth to Cairo . In November 1916 , a Deputy ADMS was appointed to assist him . 
 Medically speaking , the health of the Anzac Mounted Division was remarkably good , but the Sinai Peninsula still had its challenges — especially for medical officers unfamiliar with conditions in the Middle East . The Battle of Romani revealed the importance of transportation in an area with few roads . A poorly organised casualty evacuation effort caused a great deal of preventable hardship and suffering for the wounded , and resulted in a number of avoidable deaths . An inquiry into the matter was held after the battle , at which Downes was called to testify . The Commander in Chief if the Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) , General Sir Archibald Murray , declined to assign blame to any individual , but implemented the inquiry 's recommendations for improving the casualty evacuation process . 
 There was also the heat , and the problem of supplying adequate quantities of potable water . Diseases included cholera , typhus and bilharzia . To combat these , Downes obtained the services of the Lieutenant Colonel Charles James Martin , and created the Anzac Field Laboratory to investigate these diseases . As a result of aggressively tackling the problem , Downes reduced rates of disease among Australian and New Zealand troops well below those of British troops serving alongside them . Martin advanced the notion that heat exhaustion and heat stroke were not the result of defective evaporation , as had previously been believed , but simply a matter of failing to drink enough water . He in turn converted Downes to the belief that " provided water is available in adequate amount the heat mechanism of the body can defy all ordinary climatic ranges of temperature even under conditions of hard work . " With so many people and horses , sanitation was a challenge , and discipline in this area was initially slack , as it had been with disastrous results at Gallipoli . Downes took measures to improve the situation . Although not normally one to engage in disputes , Downes repeatedly clashed with the British medical officers of the EEF , especially the DMS EEF , Colonel Alfred Keble , whose attitudes Downes regarded as endangering his troops . 
 Doris travelled to Egypt to visit her husband in March 1917 . By June , Rupert was becoming increasingly immersed in preparations for the Third Battle of Gaza and Doris , who had become pregnant during her visit , decided to return home . On her return journey to Australia in June 1917 , her ship , the P & O liner Mongolia struck a mine and was sunk in the Indian Ocean with the loss of 23 lives . Doris spent 11 hours in a crowded lifeboat , before being rescued by a passing steamer , which took her to Bombay . From there she eventually made her way back to Australia via Singapore and Batavia . In 1918 Doris was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) for her volunteer work among soldiers ' families as secretary of the Friendly Union of Soldiers ' Wives and Mothers . 
 On 10 August 1917 , Downes became Deputy Director of Medical Services ( DDMS ) of the Desert Mounted Corps , while still retaining the post of ADMS AIF Egypt . He was therefore answerable to three superiors — to Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel , the commander of the Desert Mounted Corps and AIF Egypt ; to Major General Neville Howse , the DMS AIF in London ; and to the new British DMS EEF , Major General William Travers Swan . As the EEF advanced into Palestine , the major medical problem remained transportation . During the operations in the Es Salt area , Downes experimented with the delivery of drugs and medical supplies by air . In the Jordan valley in 1918 , however , Downes was confronted with an epidemic of malaria and vigorous preventative and prophylactic efforts were required in order to bring it under control . 
 In October 1918 , with victory near , Downes was confronted by his most serious medical crisis . Damascus contained over 3 @,@ 000 sick and wounded Turkish soldiers , many of them in appalling condition . Downes appointed the <unk> of the Australian Mounted Division , Major W. Evans , as Principal Medical Officer of Damascus , and gave him orders to organise the medical arrangements , bury the dead and provide care for the living . The task was made more difficult by the poor communications and transport shortages , which hampered the delivery of supplies and evacuation of the hospitals ; by shortages of medical units ; and by the actions of Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence , who was more concerned with establishing the political authority of Hussein bin Ali , Sharif of Mecca over Damascus . At this point the Desert Mounted Corps itself began to experience epidemic diseases , particularly of bronchopneumonia , cholera and malaria , putting the medical services under enormous pressure . Through extraordinary measures , including the diversion of <unk> and motor vehicles to medical units , Downes managed to evacuate the sick to Beirut , and the crisis abated . 
 For his service in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , Downes was mentioned in despatches four times , and was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1918 . His citation read : 
 In addition to his duties as ADMS Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division , Colonel Downes has carried out those of <unk> , Australian Imperial Force in Egypt for many months . He has shown considerable administrative ability and has placed Australian A.M.C. matters on a much better footing than they were when he took over the appointment . 
 = = Interwar years = = 
 Returning to Australia , Downes was discharged from the AIF , but remained in the Army as a reservist . He became an honorary consulting surgeon at the Royal Children 's Hospital , Melbourne and Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital , and honorary surgeon at Prince Henry 's Hospital . He was a founding fellow of the College of Surgeons of Australasia in 1927 , and became president of the Victorian branch of the British Medical Association in 1935 . He established a reputation as one of Melbourne 's leading paediatric surgeons , but found himself in disagreement with certain medical practices then in vogue . In a 1922 paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia , he examined 100 cases of tonsillectomy in children , and concluded that the majority of them were unnecessary . It would be another four decades before the medical profession in Australia accepted this . He lectured on medical ethics at the University of Melbourne from the late 1930s until his death in 1945 , and wrote a course textbook on the subject , entitled Medical Ethics , which was published in 1942 . 
 In addition to his medical writings , Downes wrote a book @-@ length section on the Sinai and Palestine campaign for Volume I of the Official History of the Australian Army Medical Services in the War of 1914 – 1918 in the late 1920s under the direction of Medical Series editor Graham Butler . The two men had discussed the prospect during a visit Butler made to Egypt in 1918 to inspect the medical records of the AIF , and again in France in 1919 . Downes published an article in the Journal of the British Army Medical Corps entitled " The Tactical Employment of the Medical Services in a Cavalry Corps " in 1926 , which was expanded into one of the chapters of the Official History . Downes ' manuscript proved too long for the proposed book , and was extensively edited by Butler before it was published in 1930 . Downes was instrumental in supporting Butler 's Medical Series and helped obtain the funding necessary to complete the project . 
 Downes was chairman of the <unk> ' Registration Board , a councillor of the Victorian division of the Australian Red Cross , and chairman of the Red Cross National Council . He was Victorian State Commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade for 25 years . He was also president of the St John Ambulance Association for eight years , and chairman of the Victorian Civil Ambulance Service from 1937 to 1938 . In 1930 , he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John , and later became a Knight of Grace of the order in 1937 . At the same time , Doris became an Officer of the Order of Saint John , in recognition for her fund raising efforts for the Victorian branch . She also later served as a member of its council from 1942 to 1953 . Downes was instrumental in persuading the various state branches to come together as a national organisation , arguing that without a national body , the organisation would be eclipsed by the Red Cross . 
 In 1930 , Downes ' son John , then in his first year as a boarder at Geelong Grammar School , fell seriously ill with meningitis . Despite the best efforts of two eminent medical practitioners , Dr Keith Fairley and Dr Reginald Webster , John succumbed to toxaemia and died in 1933 , at the age of 10 . The failure of modern medicine to save his son affected Downes deeply , and led him to abandon his medical career in favour of a military one . 
 Downes remained in the Army throughout the inter @-@ war period . He became a colonel in the Australian Army Medical Corps on 8 January 1920 . He was DDMS of the 3rd Military District ( Victoria ) from 1 July 1921 to 26 June 1933 , and Officer in Charge of Voluntary Aid Detachments from 1 July 1921 to 15 March 1940 . He also served as head of the medical services of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Although the RAAF had become a separate service in 1921 , the Minister for Defence decided in 1927 that the Army 's Director General of Medical Services should be responsible for the administration of the RAAF 's medical services . In this capacity , Downes was answerable to the Air Board . In addition , he was honorary surgeon to the Governor General of Australia from 1 July 1927 to 30 June 1931 . 
 On 20 August 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services ( DGMS ) , a full @-@ time post and the Army 's most senior medical officer . His priority was a recruiting campaign to increase the number of medical professionals in the Army . The Munich Crisis caused people to believe that another war was imminent , and an Army @-@ wide recruiting campaign led by Major General Sir Thomas Blamey doubled the size of the Army from 35 @,@ 000 in 1938 to 70 @,@ 000 in 1939 . Downes ' efforts at recruiting were far more modest . In 1934 , there were 299 part @-@ time officers in the <unk> ; by 1939 there were 394 , and increase of only 32 per cent . This included 320 medical practitioners , 37 dentists and 13 pharmacists . Downes was acutely aware that a large Army would require mobilisation of the country 's doctors , and pushed for all doctors to be prepared for either military service or direction by civil authorities . He presided over a major effort to stockpile drugs and medical equipment required for a mobilisation . With the help of the Department of Health and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories , most of this was delivered by July 1939 . 
 In 1939 , Downes began a tour of military and other medical centres in India , the Middle East , the United Kingdom , France , the United States and Canada . While in London , he arranged for Doris and Valerie to be formally presented to the King and Queen at Buckingham Palace by Ethel Bruce , the wife of Stanley Bruce , the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom . Downes foresaw a major war , fought in the islands to the north of Australia . While in London , he took steps to obtain the services as consultants of two eminent Australian physicians , the surgeon Sir Thomas Dunhill and Neil Hamilton Fairley , an expert on tropical diseases . The outbreak of the Second World War caused Downes to curtail the North American leg of his tour , and return to Australia in October 1939 . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 Downes , in his role as DGMS , pressed for the construction of major military hospitals in the capital cities . He argued that , after the war , they should be handed over to the Repatriation Commission for the care of sick and disabled ex @-@ service personnel . Despite strong opposition on the grounds of cost , Downes won his case in October 1940 . Time soon vindicated his judgement ; and today the major military hospitals in the state capital cities , the Concord Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney , the Austin Hospital in Melbourne and <unk> Private Hospital in Brisbane remain his greatest legacy . 
 In late 1940 , medical units in the Middle East were experienced " precarious and at times acute " shortages of <unk> stores . Units were sent to the Middle East as fully equipped as was possible , with the expectation that the British Army would make up the difference , but British policy was that all possible sources had to be exploited before any demands could be made on the United Kingdom 's sources . General Sir Thomas Blamey , the Commander in Chief of the AIF , recognised this as something that had to be negotiated between the two governments , but medical officers in the Middle East blamed the Medical Services in Australia — and therefore Downes — for the situation . The Minister of the Army , Percy Spender decided to pay a visit to the Middle East to see the situation for himself but before he did so , he resolved that Downes should become Director of Medical Services , AIF ( Middle East ) . On arrival in the Middle East with the Chief of the General Staff , Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee , Spender found that Blamey had already appointed Major General Samuel Burston to that post . This came as a surprise to them as they had not realised that Blamey had the authority to make such an appointment ; but on seeing the situation for himself , Spender confirmed Burston 's appointment . 
 On returning to Australia , Spender appointed Major General F. A. Maguire as DGMS and Downes was appointed to the newly created post of Inspector General of Medical Services ( <unk> ) . As <unk> , Downes toured extensively — he visited all the Australian states and overseas locations where Australian troops had been sent , including Papua and New Guinea , Malaya , the Middle East and North Africa , as well as the Netherlands East Indies ( Indonesia ) , India and East Africa . When Blamey reorganised the Army on his return to Australia in 1942 , he appointed Burston as Director General of Medical Services . Downes became DMS of the Second Army on 6 April 1942 . He joined the Second AIF as a major general on 27 June 1942 , receiving the AIF serial number <unk> . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Downes held this post until 22 August 1944 . Due to the run @-@ down of the Army , the Second Army , always mainly a paper organisation , increasingly had less and less to do . Now nearly sixty , he then accepted an invitation to write the medical history series of the official history of Australia in the war . As part of this , in March 1945 , he decided to accompany Major General George Alan Vasey to New Guinea , where Vasey 's 6th Division had encountered an <unk> @-@ resistant strain of malaria in the Aitape @-@ Wewak campaign . On 5 March 1945 , the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft they were travelling in crashed into the sea about 400 yards ( 370 m ) from <unk> Beach , just north of the mouth of the Barron River near Cairns . Downes and Vasey were killed along with all nine other Australian service personnel on board . Their bodies were recovered and buried in Cairns War Cemetery with full military honours . Downes was survived by Doris , Valerie and Rosemary . A memorial service was held at St Paul 's Cathedral , Melbourne on 9 March 1945 . He became the third most senior Australian officer to die in the Second World War , after General Sir Brudenell White , who died in the Canberra air disaster in 1940 , and Lieutenant General Henry Wynter , who died on 7 February 1945 . 
 Downes ' papers are in the Australian War Memorial . The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons established the triennial Rupert Downes Memorial Lecture in his honour . The subject of the Lecture is " related to some aspect or aspects of military surgery , medical equipment ( military and civil ) , the surgery of children , neurosurgery , general surgery , medical ethics or medical history ; these being subjects in which Downes was particularly interested " .

 = Richard Williams ( RAAF officer ) = 
 Air Marshal Sir Richard Williams , KBE , CB , DSO ( 3 August 1890 – 7 February 1980 ) is widely regarded as the " father " of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . He was the first military pilot trained in Australia , and went on to command Australian and British fighter units in World War I. A proponent for air power independent of other branches of the armed services , Williams played a leading role in the establishment of the RAAF and became its first Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) in 1922 . He served as CAS for thirteen years over three terms , longer than any other officer . 
 Williams came from a working @-@ class background in South Australia . He was a lieutenant in the Army when he learned to fly at Point Cook , Victoria , in 1914 . As a pilot with the Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) in World War I , Williams rose to command No. 1 Squadron AFC , and later 40th Wing RAF . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and finished the war a lieutenant colonel . Afterwards he campaigned for an Australian Air Force run separately to the Army and Navy , which came into being on 31 March 1921 . 
 The fledgling RAAF faced several challenges to its continued existence in the 1920s and early 1930s , and Williams received much of the credit for maintaining its independence . However an adverse report on flying safety standards saw him dismissed from the position of CAS and seconded to the RAF prior to World War II . Despite support in various quarters for his reinstatement as Air Force chief , and promotion to air marshal in 1940 , he never again commanded the RAAF . After the war he was forcibly retired along with other World War I veteran officers . He took up the position of Director @-@ General of Civil Aviation in Australia , and was knighted the year before his retirement in 1955 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Williams was born on 3 August 1890 into a working @-@ class family in Moonta Mines , South Australia . He was the eldest son of Richard Williams , a copper miner who had emigrated from Cornwall , England , and his wife Emily . Leaving Moonta Public School at junior secondary level , Williams worked as a telegraph messenger and later as a bank clerk . He enlisted in a militia unit , the South Australian Infantry Regiment , in 1909 at the age of nineteen . Commissioned a second lieutenant on 8 March 1911 , he joined the Permanent Military Forces the following year . 
 In August 1914 , Lieutenant Williams took part in Australia 's inaugural military flying course at Central Flying School , run by Lieutenants Henry Petre and Eric Harrison . After soloing in a Bristol Boxkite around the airfield at Point Cook , Victoria , Williams became the first student to graduate as a pilot , on 12 November 1914 . He recalled the school as a " ragtime show " consisting of a paddock , tents , and one large structure : a shed for the Boxkite . Following an administrative and instructional posting , Williams underwent advanced flying training at Point Cook in July 1915 . The next month he married Constance Esther Griffiths , who was thirteen years his senior . The couple had no children . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Williams was promoted captain on 5 January 1916 . He was appointed a flight commander in No. 1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) , which was initially numbered 67 Squadron Royal Flying Corps by the British . The unit departed Australia in March 1916 without any aircraft ; after arriving in Egypt it received B.E.2 fighters , a type deficient in speed and manoeuvrability , and which lacked forward @-@ firing machine guns . Williams wrote that in combat with the German Fokkers , " our fighting in the air was of short duration but could mean a quick end " , and that when it came to bombing , he and his fellow pilots " depended mainly on luck " . He further quoted a truism in the Flying Corps that " if a new pilot got through his first three days without being shot down he was lucky ; if he got through three weeks he was doing well and if he got through three months he was set . Williams and the other Australians were initially involved in isolated tasks around the Suez Canal , attached to various Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) units . No. 1 Squadron began to operate <unk> in December 1916 , supporting the Allied advance on Palestine . Williams completed his RFC attachment in February 1917 . 
 On 5 March 1917 , shortly after commencing operations with No. 1 Squadron , Williams narrowly avoided crash @-@ landing when his engine stopped while he was bombing the railway terminus at Tel el Sheria . At first believing that he had been struck by enemy fire , he found that the engine switch outside his cockpit had turned off . Within 500 feet of the ground he was able to switch the engine back on and return to base . On 21 April , Williams landed behind enemy lines to rescue downed comrade Lieutenant Adrian Cole , having the day before pressed home an attack on Turkish cavalry whilst under " intense anti @-@ aircraft fire " ; these two actions earned him the Distinguished Service Order for " conspicuous gallantry " . He was promoted major in May and given command of No. 1 Squadron , which was re @-@ equipped with Bristol Fighters later that year . " Now for the first time , " wrote Williams , " after 17 months in the field we had aircraft with which we could deal with our enemy in the air . " His men knew him as a teetotaller and non @-@ smoker , whose idea of swearing was an occasional " Darn me ! " . 
 In June 1918 , Williams was made a brevet lieutenant colonel and commander of the RAF 's 40th ( Army ) Wing , which was operating in Palestine . It comprised his former No. 1 Squadron and three British units . As a Dominion officer , Williams found that he was not permitted to " exercise powers of punishment over British personnel " , leading to him being temporarily " granted a supplementary commission in the Royal Air Force " . Augmented by a giant Handley Page bomber , his forces took part in the Battle of Armageddon , the final offensive in Palestine , where they inflicted " wholesale destruction " on Turkish columns . Of 40th Wing 's actions at Wadi Fara on 21 September 1918 , Williams wrote : " The Turkish Seventh Army ceased to exist and it must be noted that this was entirely the result of attack from the air . " He also sent Captain Ross Smith in the Handley Page , accompanied by two Bristol Fighters , to aid Major T. E. Lawrence 's Arab army north of Amman when it was harassed by German aircraft operating from Deraa . In November , Williams was appointed temporary commander of the Palestine Brigade , which comprised his previous command , the 40th ( Army ) Wing , and 5th ( Corps ) Wing . His service in the theatre later saw him awarded the Order of the Nahda by the King of the Hejaz . Twice mentioned in despatches , by the end of the war Williams had established himself , in the words of RAAF historian Alan Stephens , as " the AFC 's rising star " . 
 = = Inter @-@ war years = = 
 = = = Birth of the Royal Australian Air Force = = = 
 Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours , Williams served as Staff Officer , Aviation , at Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) headquarters in London , before returning to Australia and taking up the position of Director of Air Services at Army Headquarters , Melbourne . The Australian Flying Corps had meanwhile been disbanded and replaced by the Australian Air Corps ( AAC ) which was , like the AFC , a branch of the Army . 
 Upon establishment of the Australian Air Board on 9 November 1920 , Williams and his fellow AAC officers dropped their army ranks in favour of those based on the Royal Air Force . Williams , now a wing commander , personally compiled and tabled the Air Board 's submissions to create the Australian Air Force ( AAF ) , a service independent of both the Army and the Royal Australian Navy . Though the heads of the Army and Navy opposed the creation of an independent air arm for fear that they would be unable to find air cover for their operations , support from Prime Minister Billy Hughes , as well as prominent parliamentary figures including Treasurer Joseph Cook and Defence Minister George Pearce allowed the proposal to succeed . The AAF was duly formed on 31 March 1921 ; Williams deliberately chose this day rather than 1 April , the founding date of the RAF three years earlier , " to prevent nasty people referring to us as ' April Fools ' " . The " Royal " prefix was added five months later . Williams proposed an ensign for the AAF in July 1921 , based on the Royal Air Force flag but featuring the five stars of the Southern Cross within the RAF roundel and the Commonwealth Star in the lower hoist quarter . This design was not adopted for the RAAF , the government employing instead a direct copy of the RAF ensign until 1949 , when a new design using the stars of the Australian Flag was chosen . 
 As the senior officer of the Air Board , Williams held the title of First Air Member , the nascent Air Force initially not being deemed suitable for a " Chief of Staff " appointment equivalent to the Army and Navy . He moved to consolidate the new service 's position by expanding its assets and training . Shortly after the AAF 's establishment , land was purchased for an air base at Laverton , eight kilometres ( five miles ) inland of Point Cook , and in July 1921 Williams made the initial proposal to develop a base at Richmond , New South Wales , the first outside Victoria . He also started a program to second students from the Army and Navy , including graduates of the Royal Military College , Duntroon , to bolster officer numbers ; candidates reaped by this scheme included future Air Force chiefs John McCauley , Frederick Scherger , Valston Hancock and Alister Murdoch , along with other senior identities such as Joe Hewitt and Frank Bladin . As a leader , Williams would gain a reputation for strong will , absorption in administrative minutiae and a " somewhat puritanical " nature . He became known throughout the service as " Dicky " . 
 = = = Chief of the Air Staff = = = 
 The position of First Air Member was replaced by Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) in October 1922 . Williams would serve as CAS three times over seventeen years in the 1920s and ' 30s , alternating with Wing Commander ( later Air Vice Marshal ) Stanley Goble . One motive suggested for the rotation was a ploy by Army and Navy interests to " curb Williams ' independence " . Instead the arrangement " almost inevitably fostered an unproductive rivalry " between the two officers . Although in a legal sense the Air Board was responsible for the RAAF rather than the Chief of Staff alone , Williams dominated the board to such an extent that Goble would later complain that his colleague appeared to consider the Air Force his personal command . 
 Williams spent much of 1923 in England , attending the British Army Staff College in Camberley and RAF Staff College , Andover , followed by further study in Canada and the United States the following year . Goble served as Chief of the Air Staff in his absence . Shortly after his return in February 1925 , Williams scuppered a plan by Goble to establish a small seaplane base at Rushcutters Bay in Sydney , instead organising purchase of Supermarine Seagulls , the RAAF 's first amphibious aircraft , to be based at Richmond . He was promoted to group captain in July and later that year drafted a major air warfare study , " Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia " . Considered prescient in many ways , it treated World War I ally Japan as Australia 's main military threat , and advocated inter @-@ service co @-@ operation while maintaining that none of the armed forces was " purely auxiliary to another " . Its concepts continue to influence RAAF strategy . 
 In 1926 , Williams mandated the use of parachutes for all RAAF aircrew . He had visited the Irvin Air Chute Company while in the US during 1924 and recommended purchase at the time , but a backlog of orders for the RAF meant that the Australian equipment took almost two years to arrive . Flying Officer Ellis Wackett was assigned to instruct volunteers at RAAF Richmond , and made the country 's first freefall descent from a military aircraft , an Airco DH.9 , on 26 May . Williams himself jumped over Point Cook on 5 August , having decided that it would set " a good example if , before issuing an order for the compulsory wearing of parachutes , I showed my own confidence in them ... " Though his descent took him perilously close to the base water tank ( " I thought it would be a poor ending to drown there , or even to be pulled out dripping wet " ) and " too close to be comfortable to a 30 @,@ 000 volt electric transmission line " , he completed the exercise unscathed . 
 The young Air Force was a small organisation with the atmosphere of a flying club , although several pioneering flights were made by its members . Goble had commanded the first circumnavigation of Australia by air in 1924 while he was CAS . On 25 September 1926 , with two crew members including Goble 's pilot , Ivor McIntyre , Williams commenced a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 16 @,@ 000 km ) round trip from Point Cook to the Solomon Islands in a De Havilland <unk> floatplane , to study the South Pacific region as a possible theatre of operations . The trio returned on 7 December to a 12 @-@ plane RAAF escort and a 300 @-@ man honour guard . Though seen partly as a " matter of prestige " brought on by contemporary newspaper reports that claimed " ' certain Foreign Powers ' " were planning such a journey , and also as a " reaction " by Williams to Goble 's 1924 expedition , it was notable as the first international flight undertaken by an RAAF plane and crew . Williams was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1927 King 's Birthday Honours in recognition of the achievement , and promoted to air commodore on 1 July the same year . 
 As CAS , Williams had to contend with serious challenges to the RAAF 's continued existence from the Army and Navy in 1929 and 1932 , arising from the competing demands for defence funding during the Great Depression . According to Williams , only after 1932 was the independence of the Air Force assured . Williams again handed over the reins of CAS to Goble in 1933 to attend the Imperial Defence College in London , resuming his position in June 1934 . His promotion to air vice marshal on 1 January 1935 belatedly raised him to the equivalent rank of his fellow Chiefs of Staff in the Army and Navy . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in June that year . 
 Williams encouraged the local aircraft industry as a means to further the self @-@ sufficiency of the Air Force and Australian aviation in general . He played a personal part in the creation of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in November 1936 , headed up by former Squadron Leader Lawrence Wackett , late of the RAAF 's Experimental Section . Williams made the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he accompanied Squadron Leader Allan Walters and two aircrew aboard a Tugan Gannet to Singapore in February 1938 . 
 A series of mishaps with Hawker Demons at the end of 1937 , which resulted in one pilot dying and four injured , subjected the Air Force to harsh public criticism . In 1939 Williams was dismissed from his post as CAS and " effectively banished overseas " , following publication of the Ellington Report that January . Its author , Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Edward Leonard Ellington , criticised the level of air safety observed in the RAAF , though his interpretation of statistics has been called into question . The Federal government praised Williams for strengthening the Air Force but blamed him for Ellington 's findings , and he was criticised in the press . Beyond the adverse report , Williams was thought to have " made enemies " through his strident championing of the RAAF 's independence . A later CAS , George Jones , contended that Ellington had been " invited to Australia in order to inspect Williams rather than the air force and to recommend his removal from the post of Chief of the Air Staff if necessary " . The government announced that it was seconding him to the RAF for two years . 
 = = World War II = = 
 When war broke out in September 1939 , Williams was Air Officer in charge of Administration at RAF Coastal Command , a position he had held since February that year , following a brief posting to the British Air Ministry . Goble had succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time but clashed with the Federal government over implementation of the Empire Air Training Scheme and stepped down in early 1940 . Williams was recalled from Britain with the expectation of again taking up the RAAF 's senior position but Prime Minister Robert Menzies insisted on a British officer commanding the service , over the protest of his Minister for Air , James Fairbairn , and the RAF 's Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett became CAS . In his volume in the official history of the Air Force in World War II , Douglas Gillison observed that considering Williams ' intimate knowledge of the RAAF and its problems , and his long experience commanding the service , " it is difficult to see what contribution Burnett was expected to make that was beyond Williams ' capacity " . Williams was appointed Air Member for Organisation and Equipment and promoted to air marshal , the first man in the RAAF to achieve this rank . 
 Williams returned to England in October 1941 to set up RAAF Overseas Headquarters , co @-@ ordinating services for the many Australians posted there . He maintained that Australian airmen in Europe and the Mediterranean should serve in RAAF units to preserve their national identity , as per Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme , rather than be integrated into RAF squadrons , but in practice most served in British units . Even nominally " RAAF " squadrons formed under the Scheme were rarely composed primarily of Australians , and Williams ' efforts to establish a distinct RAAF Group within Bomber Command , similar to the Royal Canadian Air Force 's No. 6 Group , did not come to fruition . He was able to negotiate improved conditions for RAAF personnel in Europe , including full Australian pay scales as opposed to the lower RAF rates that were offered initially . 
 When Air Chief Marshal Burnett completed his term in 1942 , Williams was once more considered for the role of CAS . This was vetoed by Prime Minister John Curtin and the appointment unexpectedly went to acting Air Commodore George Jones . A mooted Inspector Generalship of the Air Force , which would have seen Williams reporting directly to the Minister for Air , also failed to materialise . Instead Williams was posted to Washington , D.C. as the RAAF 's representative to the Combined Chiefs of Staff in the United States , and remained there until the end of the war . 
 = = Later career = = 
 In 1946 , Williams was forced into retirement despite being four years below the mandatory age of 60 . All other senior RAAF commanders who were veteran pilots of World War I , with the exception of the @-@ then Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal Jones , were also dismissed , ostensibly to make way for the advancement of younger officers . Williams regarded the grounds for his removal as " specious " , calling it " the meanest piece of service administration in my experience " . 
 Following his completion of duty in the Air Force , Williams was appointed Australia 's Director @-@ General of Civil Aviation , serving in the position for almost 10 years . His department was responsible for the expansion of communications and infrastructure to support domestic and international aviation , establishing " an enviable safety record " . Williams ' tenure coincided with the beginnings of the government carrier Trans Australia Airlines ( TAA ) and introduction of the Two Airlines Policy , as well as the construction of Adelaide Airport and redevelopment of Sydney Airport as an international facility . 
 William 's wife Constance died in 1948 and he married Lois Victoria Cross on 7 February 1950 . He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( KBE ) in the 1954 New Year Honours , the year before he retired from the Director @-@ Generalship of Civil Aviation . He then took up a place on the board of Tasman Empire Airways Limited ( <unk> ) , forerunner of Air New Zealand . In 1977 , Williams published his memoirs , These Are Facts , described in 2001 as " immensely important if idiosyncratic ... the only substantial , worthwhile record of service ever written by an RAAF chief of staff " . 
 Sir Richard Williams died in Melbourne on 7 February 1980 . He was accorded an Air Force funeral , with a flypast by seventeen aircraft . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 For his stewardship of the Air Force prior to World War II , as well as his part in its establishment in 1921 , Williams is considered the " father " of the RAAF . The epithet had earlier been applied to Eric Harrison , who had sole charge of Central Flying School after Henry Petre was posted to the Middle East in 1915 , and was also a founding member of the RAAF . By the 1970s , however , the mantle had settled on Williams . Between the wars he had continually striven for his service 's status as a separate branch of the Australian armed forces , seeing off a number of challenges to its independence from Army and Navy interests . He remains the RAAF 's longest @-@ serving Chief , totalling thirteen years over three terms : October to December 1922 ; February 1925 to December 1932 ; and June 1934 to February 1939 . 
 In his 1925 paper " Memorandum Regarding the Air Defence of Australia " , Williams defined " the fundamental nature of Australia 's defence challenge " and " the enduring characteristics of the RAAF 's strategic thinking " . Ignored by the government of the day , the study 's operational precepts became the basis for Australia 's defence strategy in the 1980s , which remains in place in the 21st century . However his input to debate in the 1930s around the " Singapore strategy " of dependence on the Royal Navy for the defence of the Pacific region has been criticised as limited , and as having " failed to demonstrate the validity of his claims for the central role of air power " . 
 Williams ' legacy extends to the very look of the RAAF . He personally chose the colour of the Air Force 's winter uniform , a shade " somewhere between royal and navy blue " , designed to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force shade . Unique at the time among Commonwealth forces , the uniform was changed to an all @-@ purpose middle blue suit in 1972 but following numerous complaints in the ensuing years reverted to Williams ' original colour and style in 2000 . 
 Memorials to Williams include Sir Richard Williams Avenue at Adelaide Airport , and RAAF Williams in Victoria , established in 1989 after the merger of Point Cook and Laverton bases . The Sir Richard Williams Trophy , inaugurated in 1974 , is presented to the RAAF 's " Fighter Pilot of the Year " . In 2005 , Williams ' Australian Flying Corps wings , usually on display at the RAAF Museum in Point Cook , were carried into space and back on a shuttle flight by Australian @-@ born astronaut Dr Andy Thomas . The Williams Foundation , named in his honour , was launched in February 2009 " to broaden public debate on issues relating to Australian defence and security " . 
 = HMS Hannibal ( 1896 ) = 
 HMS Hannibal was a Majestic @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy , and the sixth ship to bear the name HMS Hannibal . The ship was laid down at the Pembroke Dock in May 1894 , she was launched in April 1896 , and commissioned into the fleet in April 1898 . She was armed with a main battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns and a secondary battery of twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) guns . The ship had a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 Hannibal served with the Channel Fleet ( later reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet ) after commissioning in 1898 . In 1906 she underwent a refit , which included a conversion from a coal burner to using oil . She was placed in reserve from 1907 , only to be mobilised in July 1914 as a precautionary measure prior to the outbreak of World War I. From August 1914 to February 1915 Hannibal was a guard ship at Scapa Flow . Later that year , her main armament was removed and she was converted to a troopship , serving in this capacity during the Dardanelles campaign . From November 1915 to the end of the war , she served as a depot ship based in Alexandria , Egypt . She was disposed of in 1920 and scrapped later that year . 
 = = Design = = 
 Hannibal was 421 feet ( 128 m ) long overall and had a beam of 75 ft ( 23 m ) and a draft of 27 ft ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She displaced up to 16 @,@ 060 t ( 15 @,@ 810 long tons ; 17 @,@ 700 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines powered by eight coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . By 1907 – 08 , she was re @-@ boilered with oil @-@ fired models . Her engines provided a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) at 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers , although they suffered from high fuel consumption . She had a crew of 672 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with four BL 12 @-@ inch Mk VIII guns in twin turrets , one forward and one aft . The turrets were placed on pear @-@ shaped barbettes ; six of her sisters had the same arrangement , but her sisters Caesar and Illustrious and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes . Hannibal also carried twelve QF 6 @-@ inch / 40 guns . They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships . She also carried sixteen QF 12 @-@ pounder guns and twelve QF 2 @-@ pounder guns . She was also equipped with five 18 @-@ inch ( 450 @-@ mm ) torpedo tubes , four of which were submerged in the ship 's hull , with the last in a deck @-@ mounted launcher . Hannibal and the other ships of her class had 9 inches ( 229 mm ) of Harvey armour , which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour . This allowed Hannibal and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection . The barbettes for the main battery were protected with 14 in ( 360 mm ) of armour , and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides . The ship 's armoured deck was 2 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 in ( 64 to 114 mm ) thick . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The keel for HMS Hannibal was laid down at the Pembroke Dock on 1 May 1894 . Her completed hull was launched on 28 April 1896 . She went into the commissioned reserve upon completion in April 1898 . On 10 May 1898 she went into full commission to serve in the Portsmouth division of the Channel Fleet , under the command of Captain Sir Baldwin Wake Walker . She was part of a huge fleet of ships present in the Solent for the passage of the body of Queen Victoria from Cowes to Portsmouth on 2 February 1901 . Captain George Augustus Giffard was appointed in command on 10 May 1902 , and she was present at the Coronation Fleet Review for King Edward VII on 16 August 1902 . On 17 October 1903 she collided with and badly damaged her sister ship HMS Prince George off Ferrol , Spain . When a fleet reorganisation led to the Channel Fleet being redesignated the Atlantic Fleet on 1 January 1905 , Hannibal became an Atlantic Fleet unit . Hannibal transferred to the new Channel Fleet ( formerly the Home Fleet ) on 28 February 1905 . This service ended on 3 August 1905 , when she paid off into reserve at Devonport . 
 Hannibal underwent a refit in 1906 in which she was converted to burn oil fuel and received fire control for her main battery . She then recommissioned in reserve in October 1906 . In January 1907 , Hannibal went into full commission as a temporary replacement for battleship HMS Ocean in the Channel Fleet while Ocean was under refit . When Ocean returned to service , Hannibal remained in Channel Fleet service as a temporary replacement for battleship HMS Dominion while Dominion was undergoing refit . When Dominion returned to service in May 1907 , Hannibal went back into the commissioned reserve , becoming a part of the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet in July 1907 . While in commissioned reserve at Portsmouth , Hannibal suffered two significant mishaps . On 19 August 1909 she struck a reef in Babbacombe Bay , damaging her bottom . On 29 October 1909 she collided with torpedo boat HMS TB 105 , suffering no damage herself but badly damaging the torpedo boat . She underwent a refit at Devonport from November 1911 to March 1912 . 
 The Royal Navy began a precautionary mobilisation in July 1914 when war appeared increasingly likely . As part of this , Hannibal and her sister ships HMS Mars , HMS Magnificent , and HMS Victorious formed the 9th Battle Squadron on 27 July 1914 , stationed at the Humber to defend the British coast . Hannibal was serving as a guard ship on the Humber when World War I began in August 1914 . The 9th Battle Squadron was dissolved on 7 August 1914 , and Hannibal was transferred to Scapa Flow , where she served as a guard ship until relieved by the first @-@ class protected cruiser HMS Royal Arthur on 20 February 1915 . Hannibal then paid off at Dalmuir . 
 The Majestic @-@ class ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy . While inactive at Dalmuir , Hannibal was disarmed between March and April 1915 except for four 6 @-@ inch ( 152 @-@ mm ) guns and some lighter guns . Her 12 @-@ inch ( 305 @-@ mm ) guns were taken for use aboard the new Lord Clive @-@ class monitors HMS Prince Eugene and HMS Sir John Moore . After she was disarmed , she was laid up at Scapa Flow and Loch Goil until September 1915 . Hannibal recommissioned at Greenock on 9 September 1915 to serve as a troopship in the Dardanelles campaign . She arrived at Mudros in this capacity on 7 October 1915 . In November 1915 , Hannibal became a depot ship for auxiliary patrol craft at Alexandria , Egypt , supporting both forces operating from Egypt and those in the Red Sea until June 1919 , leaving Egypt for Malta on 9 September . Hannibal was paid off for disposal at Malta on 25 October 1919 , was sold for scrapping on the 28 January 1920 , and was broken up in Italy .

 = The Pine Bluff Variant = 
 " The Pine Bluff Variant " is the eighteenth episode of the fifth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It was written by John Shiban and directed by Rob Bowman . The episode aired in the United States on May 3 , 1998 on the Fox network . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology , or fictional history . " The Pine Bluff Variant " received a Nielsen household rating of 11 @.@ 4 and was watched by 18 @.@ 24 million viewers in its initial broadcast . It received largely positive reviews from television critics as well as fans on the internet . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Scully grows suspicious of Mulder when she thinks he may be helping a terrorist organization . Scully begins to wonder if he is now a traitor to the FBI . It is eventually revealed that Mulder is working as a mole in the group , and he is trying to stop them before they are able to use a biological weapon — that may have been created by members of the US government — which causes rapid degeneration of human flesh . 
 " The Pine Bluff Variant " was based on the idea of Mulder going undercover , a topic that Shiban had wanted to work on for a majority of the fifth season . Shiban argued that the conceit worked for the series because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season . The episode was indirectly influenced by the 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , written by John le Carré . The title is also a reference to the Pine Bluff Arsenal , a real United States military base with stockpiles of chemical weapons . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) , Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) , and several other FBI agents take part in an undercover operation in a Washington park to catch Jacob Haley ( Daniel von Bargen ) , the second @-@ in @-@ command of an anti @-@ government militia called the New Spartans . As Skinner and Scully monitor the operation from a van , Mulder and the other agents slowly close in on Haley . Haley hands an envelope to another man ( Armin <unk> ) before escaping . The agents discover that the man 's flesh has been eaten away by an unknown toxin . 
 Scully becomes concerned that Mulder let Haley get away , but he dodges her queries . Later , she informs a counter @-@ terrorism task force headed by Skinner and U.S. Attorney Leamus ( Sam Anderson ) that the man in the park was killed by a biological agent . Skinner explains that August Bremer ( Michael MacRae ) , the leader of the New Spartans , is involved in an internal power struggle with Haley . Scully follows Mulder and sees him meeting with Haley . When she tries to pursue them , she is surrounded by government agents and brought before Skinner and Leamus , who inform her that Mulder is infiltrating the group as an undercover agent . 
 Mulder is taken to a New Spartans ' secluded hideout , where Haley accuses him of spying for the government . Mulder is tortured by the Skin @-@ Head Man ( Douglas Arthurs ) — one of his fingers broken in the process — until he claims that the spy must be somewhere within the New Spartans . Meanwhile , Bremer tests the biological weapon in a movie theatre in <unk> , Ohio , killing fourteen people inside . Investigating the scene , Scully becomes confused as to how the contagion was spread , as it is not airborne . Mulder and Scully meet at his apartment , where she tends to his finger and discusses the operation . Bremer , however , is secretly recording their conversation . 
 Mulder meets with Skinner and Leamus , telling them that the New Spartans are planning to rob a bank and that Haley wants copies of surveillance files on the group , in an attempt to discover the spy 's identity . Leamus , expecting the request , hands over a redacted microfilm for Haley to see . Scully discovers that the biological weapon was engineered by the U.S. government , and concludes that someone purposely sent Mulder on a suicide mission . She realizes that the pathogen is spread through touch , and that New Spartans plan to spread it via the money in the bank . Meanwhile , Mulder joins the New Spartans as they infiltrate the bank and spray the money with the pathogen . 
 After the fake robbery , Bremer accuses Mulder of being the mole ; Haley , however , intercedes , and claims that Bremer is the real mole . To further his argument , Bremer plays back the tape of Mulder and Scully . The militia group turns against Haley . Bremer offers Haley a set of car keys and tells him he can leave the group unharmed . Haley agrees and drives off . Bremer , along with a thug from the group , marches Mulder into a desolate area and prepares to execute him . However , Bremer instead kills the thug and tells Mulder to run , lest they both be discovered . 
 Mulder rushes back to the bank to warn people about the contaminated money and finds that Scully has already had the bank quarantined and the money taken away . Scully confronts Leamus about this being a covert government weapons test . Leamus responds that it is their job to protect the public from the truth . Later , we see Haley slumped over in his getaway car , his face eaten away by the pathogen that was sprayed on the car keys .

 = = = Writing = = = 
 " The Pine Bluff Variant " was written by John Shiban . For much of the show 's fifth season , Shiban had an index card that simply read " Mulder Undercover " . He had long wanted to do a story like this , noting , " It always seemed to fit to me — putting Mulder in a situation [ where we ] don 't know his allegiance . " Shiban argued that the concept also worked because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season . Shiban petitioned Frank Spotnitz several times about the idea until " the right time and the right way " presented itself . 
 The episode was influenced by the 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , written by John le Carré . Both the book and author are favorites of Shiban . Because the Cold War had been over , he used the opportunity to introduce a new " bogeyman " , in this case domestic terrorism . The writing staff used then @-@ recent fears about Saddam Hussein 's alleged production of biological weapons to craft the basic premise of the script . The title is also a reference to the Pine Bluff Arsenal , a real military base with stockpiles of chemical weapons . Shiban also recalled that the 1995 action film Heat was an inspiration . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 To play the part of terrorists Jacob Haley and August Bremer , the production staff cast Daniel von Bargen and Michael MacRae , respectively . Von Bargen was chosen due to his experience in several films , whereas MacRae had previously been cast in the first season episode " The Jersey Devil " . Kate Braidwood , the woman who played the movie theater usherette , is the daughter of first assistant director Tom Braidwood , who portrayed Melvin Frohike in the series . The mother and child that are in the bank during the holdup scene were played by the wife and daughter of Todd <unk> . 
 Scenes at the movie theater were filmed in a recently closed theater in Dunbar – <unk> , British Columbia . The location featured the " architectural and design characteristics of a small @-@ town cinema situated within an appropriate neighbourhood " . The movie that is being shown in the Ohio theatre which is attacked is Die Hard with a Vengeance , whose storyline of a mission by terrorists involving American banks is broadly mirrored in this episode 's plot . The faux corpses were created by make @-@ up artist Toby Lindala ; when he brought them to the set , however , there was no room to store them , and so he kept them temporarily in the craft services room . A Canadian government money depository filled in for the First Sovereign Bank of Pennsylvania that is robbed in the episode . The production staff assembled more than 15 @,@ 000 dollar bills of various denominations — which valued somewhere near $ 40 @,@ 000 — for use during the scenes at said bank . Production initially had to stop due to the fact that , during the filming of the scene that involved the money , there was only one police guard on duty . Fearful that an actual armed robbery might have been attempted , back @-@ up was called in and filming continued as planned . 
 The scene in the teaser is supposed to be set in Folger Park , located in Washington , D.C. It was actually filmed in Vancouver , like the rest of the episode , and the Capitol building in the background was created via CGI . The scene with the <unk> melting a man 's face in the opening scene was also created with computers .

 " The Pine Bluff Variant " received largely positive reviews from critics .

Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote positively of the entry and awarded it an " A " . He called it " an excellent episode " that is " notable for its tension " and the fact that it " seemingly tells a story that has little to do with the X @-@ Files or Mulder and Scully 's search for the truth — right up until the final twist . " Furthermore , Handlen called Shiban 's script " by far his best " and noted that the melted corpses in the episode provided " a striking , deeply creepy visual " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five . The two called the entry " cleverer than most " latter season episodes that feature Mulder or Scully undergoing a psychotic break , due to its " straight @-@ forward thriller " sensibilities . Jonathan Dunn , writing for What Culture , highlighted " The Pine Bluff Variant " for its cinematic appeal and included it in the " 5 Episodes [ of The X @-@ Files ] That Could Be Made Into Movies " list . 
 Other reviews were more mixed . Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . Vitaris called the episode " an absorbing hour of entertainment . " She did , however , identify the red herring in which Scully suspects Mulder as the weakest part of the story , noting that Mulder " would [ never ] throw in with terrorists " . John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 6 out of 10 . He wrote that , while the episode " brings to light some interesting aspects of the latter half of the fifth season " the " internal logic of the story is often suspect . " He concluded that , despite " a number of scenes that presage the feature film and point out important character dynamics " , there are an equal number of " plot contrivances and conveniences " that bog the episode down .

 The idea for Noodles & Company was conceived by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy , after eating at Mamie 's Asian Noodle Shop in Greenwich Village , New York . He felt there were not enough restaurants that served noodle dishes , which are a staple for many international foods . Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother @-@ in @-@ law 's kitchen with the future COO , Joe Serafin , and head chef , Ross <unk> , in 1994 . 
 Kennedy raised $ 73 @,@ 000 ( $ 117 thousand in 2015 dollars ) in personal funds and $ 200 @,@ 000 ( $ 319 thousand in 2015 dollars ) in investments from 24 friends and family members .

He said Noodles & Company was " a killer idea " but " criticized nearly every dish he 'd tried . " The Denver Post and other newspapers had published similar reviews . In response , Kennedy started a " <unk> Noodles & Company " campaign " to redefine and refine nearly every aspect of the operation . " 
 In mid @-@ 1996 , the management team went to Chicago to observe other noodle restaurants and the night of their return , the basement flooded at the Madison location . The next day , Kennedy made a list of 15 areas for improvement . Rocky Mountain News said " the team completely revamped the Noodles concept , overhauling the menu , the prices , the decor and more . It worked . " The restaurant implemented a warmer color scheme . Steam tables to keep food warm were replaced with <unk> lines to cook each dish as it is ordered .

 Parables for Wooden Ears was the first studio album released by the Australian band Powderfinger . It was released on 18 July 1994 by Polydor Records , after recording at the Metropolis Studios in Melbourne during February 1994 . 
 The album was received poorly and failed to chart or improve Powderfinger 's platform despite the respectable success of its predecessor , Transfusion . Critics complained about its poor imitation of Americana and grunge , as well as its overuse of complex riffs . In a 2004 interview , Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning said , in reference to the album , " God knows what we were on then . " Three singles were released from the album , all of which failed to chart .

 In a 1996 interview , Fanning described Parables for Wooden Ears as " big and presumptuous " , and stated that it had " a pretty massive sort of sound " . He said that the band somewhat regretted this , and did not intend to do so again on future releases . 
 On Parables for Wooden Ears , Powderfinger worked with the producer Tony Cohen , whom Fanning described as having a huge reputation , and thus being expensive to work with . However , <unk> of the " lack of an obvious single " , the album sold poorly , despite the effort put into production . Parables for Wooden Ears contained references by Powderfinger to Aboriginal rights , with a song written by the drummer Jon Coghill discussing the idea that the band 's generation was the first to reach out to the concept of reconciliation . 
 In 1998 , the guitarist Ian Haug described Internationalist as a moderation between the band 's last two albums , calling Parables for Wooden Ears a " complicated beast " . In a 1999 interview , Fanning said that the band " were sorting out our sound " on the album , and that despite it not working well they still thought it was " a good record " . Juice commentator Simon Wooldridge noted in 2000 that Parables for Wooden Ears contained " million " s of riffs , and thus the band were not able to produce a simple sound on the album . 
 In a November 2004 interview with the Melbourne newspaper , The Age , Fanning recalled that the head of Polydor Records had described the album as " awful " and remarked that " God knows what we were on then " . He also said that in making Parables for Wooden Ears , Powderfinger " went through this weird stage of trying to be something [ they ] weren 't . " Fanning also told Australian Musician that the album , a " spectacular failure " , was a result of the band feeling " forced " to play like other bands that were popular in Brisbane at the time . 
 = = Release and response = = 
 Parables for Wooden Ears was released on 18 July 1994 on the Polydor Records label . Three singles were released from Parables for Wooden Ears : " Tail " , released on 14 June 1994 , " Grave Concern " , released on 22 August 1994 , and " Save Your Skin " , released on 22 July 1995 . Due to the minimal promotion and reputation of the band , the album and singles failed to chart . 
 Critics generally agreed with Powderfinger 's assessment of the album , with some describing it as " a thundering rock album " and noting the similarity to Americana . Fanning also noted that the album had a lot less " balance " than the album that followed it , Double Allergic . Other critics noted that Parables for Wooden Ears had a " dark , overly complex metal sound " and complained of the album 's " distorted guitars " , but put this down to the album being a learning experience for the band . 
 Parables for Wooden Ears received a moderate response from reviewers . Juice reviewer John <unk> enjoyed the rock elements of the album , drawing comparisons to Pearl Jam , Soundgarden and Alice In Chains . He thanked producer Tony Cohen for the " big sound " of the album , and said that the musicians on the album " not only know about power and restraint , but also play tastefully " . <unk> stated that Fanning " lays the emotion on thick and usually more than gets away with it . " The review was summarised by stating that the album may have been " a bit like the retro @-@ rock that the big corporations want you to buy " , but that nonetheless it was a good album . 
 Jackson G. Marx was similarly conflicted in Australian Rolling Stone , writing , " They create painstaking technical ' works ' of art . This is not necessarily a compliment . Sometimes it 's a certified jerk @-@ off . " Despite describing some songs as , " tragically clever , " and , " <unk> monstrosities , " he scored the album three stars from five , and wrote of the pleasure of repeated listens . " ' Tail ' , for example , is tangled and inert and teeters precariously on the brink of disappearing up its own arsehole , but a determined listener will find its hooks more infecting with each spin . " 
 Sputnikmusic contributor James Bishop gave the album a score of 2 @.@ 5 ( average ) , summarising his review with the statement " Get Double Allergic instead . " Bishop stated that the album contained too much imitation , and that the album is " pretty much forgotten by even the most <unk> of music fans " because of the poor imitation in it - described as " a simple case of " monkey see , monkey not do very well " . " Bishop praised some aspects of the album , stating that " <unk> Bloom " contained " a raw song @-@ writing ability " and that " Sink Low " was " a hidden gem " . However , he said that the majority of songs contained Powderfinger trying too hard with their riffs , noting " Bridle You " and " Father 's Pyramid " as specific examples . Bishop also criticised the lyrics in most songs , stating that " Walking Stick " contained " some horrendously bad lyrics " . The highlight of the album for Bishop was " Save Your Skin " , which he called " a gorgeous addition to their collection " , despite calling the overall album " a pretty dark and depressing experience " .

 = King Ottokar 's Sceptre = 
 King Ottokar 's Sceptre ( French : Le Sceptre d <unk> ) is the eighth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle for its children 's supplement Le Petit Vingtième , it was serialised weekly from August 1938 to August 1939 . Hergé intended the story as a satirical criticism of the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany , in particular the annexation of Austria in March 1938 ( the Anschluss ) . The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy , who travel to the fictional Balkan nation of Syldavia , where they combat a plot to overthrow the monarchy of King Muskar XII . 
 King Ottokar 's Sceptre was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion . Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Land of Black Gold until Le Vingtième Siècle 's forced closure in 1940 , while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition . In 1947 , Hergé coloured and redrew King Ottokar 's Sceptre in his distinctive ligne @-@ claire style with the aid of Edgar P. Jacobs for Casterman 's republication . King Ottokar 's Sceptre introduces the recurring character Bianca Castafiore , and introduced the fictional countries of Syldavia and Borduria , both of which reappear in later stories . The story was adapted for both the 1956 Belvision Studios animation Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin and for the 1991 Ellipse / Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Having discovered a lost briefcase in a park , Tintin returns it to its owner , the <unk> Professor Hector Alembick , who informs the reporter of his plans to travel to the Balkan nation of Syldavia . Tintin discovers secret agents spying on him and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant . An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin , but is found unconscious . Shortly after , the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target of a bomb attack ; but survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb . Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia , Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country . On the plane journey there , Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character , and suspects that an imposter has replaced him . Reading a brochure on Syldavian history , Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir 's Day , thus forcing him to abdicate . 
 <unk> ejected from his airplane by the pilot , Tintin informs local police of his fears regarding the plot ; but the police captain is part of the conspiracy , and organises an ambush . Tintin evades this , and escapes as a fellow @-@ passenger of the opera singer Bianca Castafiore . Leaving the car to evade Castafiore 's singing , Tintin is arrested again and survives another assassination attempt before arrival in Klow on foot . There , he meets the King 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp , Colonel Boris ; but Boris is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin . 
 The next morning , Tintin personally warns the King about the plot ; whereupon Tintin and Muskar rush to Kropow Castle , where the sceptre is kept , to find that the imposter Alembick has smuggled it out of the building to his accomplices . With the aid of Thomson and Thompson , who have recently arrived in Syldavia , Tintin pursues the thieves , and is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria . A letter obtained from one of the thieves , reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by Müsstler , a political agitator who means Borduria to annex the country . In Borduria , Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and flies to Klow , but the Syldavian military shoot him down . He continues to Klow on foot , and ( with the help of Snowy ) , restores the sceptre to the King . In thanks , the king makes Tintin a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican ; the first foreigner to receive the honour . Later , Tintin discovers that the imposter was Alembick 's twin brother , when the police arrest Müsstler and rescue Professor Alembick . Ultimately , he and the Thompsons return home by flying boat .

 Georges Remi — best known under the pen name Hergé — was employed as editor and illustrator of Le Petit Vingtième ( " The Little Twentieth " ) , a children 's supplement to Le Vingtième Siècle ( " The Twentieth Century " ) , a staunchly Roman Catholic , conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé 's native Brussels , formerly run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez , who had subsequently been removed from the paper 's editorship following a scandal . In 1929 , Hergé began The Adventures of Tintin comic strip for Le Petit Vingtième , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter Tintin . 
 This was not the first Tintin adventure to draw specifically on contemporary events ; Hergé had for instance previously made use of the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria as a political backdrop for the setting in The Blue Lotus . Hergé had closely observed the unfolding events surrounding the expansionist policies of Nazi Germany . In producing this story , he was particularly influenced by the Anschluss , the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in March 1938 . The Munich Agreement and the subsequent Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland followed in October 1938 . Three weeks after King Ottokar 's Sceptre finished serialisation , Germany invaded Poland . By this point , the threat to Belgian sovereignty posed by Nazi expansionism was becoming increasingly clear . 
 Hergé claimed that the basic idea behind the story had been given to him by a friend ; biographer Benoît Peeters suggested that the most likely candidate was school and scouting friend Philippe Gérard , who had warned of a second war with Germany for years . Tintin scholars have claimed Hergé did not develop the names Syldavia and Borduria himself ; instead , the country names had supposedly appeared in a paper included in a 1937 edition of the British Journal of Psychology , in which the author described a hypothetical conflict between a small kingdom and an annexing power . Reportedly , the paper , by Lewis Fry Richardson and entitled " General Foreign Policy " , explored the nature of inter @-@ state conflict in a mathematical way . Peeters attributed these claims to Georges <unk> , but said that " no researcher has confirmed this source " . Instead , a paper by Richardson entitled " Generalized Foreign Politics : A Story in Group Psychology " was published in The British Journal of Psychology Monograph Supplements in 1939 , but did not mention Syldavia or Borduria . In any case , given the publication date , it is unlikely that it was an influence on King Ottokar 's Sceptre . 
 Hergé designed Borduria as a satirical depiction of Nazi Germany . Hergé named the Bordurian political leader " Müsstler " from the surnames of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Italy 's National Fascist leader Benito Mussolini . The name also had similarities with the British Union of Fascists ' leader Oswald Mosley and the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands ' leader Anton Mussert . Hergé referred to Müsstler 's agents as the Iron Guard , thereby naming them after the real Iron Guard , a Romanian fascist group that sought to oust King Carol II and forge a Romanian @-@ German alliance . The Bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of the German SS , while the Bordurian planes are German in design ; in the original version Tintin escapes in a Heinkel He 112 , while in the revised version this is replaced by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 . Hergé adopted the basis of Borduria 's false flag operation to take over Syldavia from the plans outlined in Curzio <unk> 's <unk> del <unk> di Stato ( " The Technique of a Coup d 'Etat " ) . 
 Syldavia 's depiction was influenced by the costumes and cultures of the Balkan region , as well as those of neighbouring Romania and Albania . The mosques that appear in Hergé 's Syldavia are based on those found in the Balkans , while the appearance of the Syldavian village , featuring red @-@ tiled roofs and minarets , may have been specifically inspired by the Bosnian town of Mostar . The black pelican of Syldavia 's flag is similar to Albania 's black eagle . Romania is the only European country to which pelicans are native , and Syldavia 's mineral rich subsoil could be taken as a reference to the uranium deposits found under Romania 's Carpathian Mountains . The name Syldavia may be a composite of Transylvania and Moldavia , two regions with historical ties to Romania . Czech , Slovak , and Bohemian history influenced the Syldavian names , while several medieval Bohemian kings were the inspiration for the name " Ottokar " . The Polish language influenced Hergé 's inclusion of " <unk> " endings to Syldavian place names , while Polish history paralleled Hergé 's description of Syldavian history . The Syldavian language used in the book had French syntax but with <unk> vocabulary , a joke understood by the original Brussels @-@ based readership . 
 However , despite its Eastern European location , Syldavia itself was partly a metaphor for Belgium , with Syldavian King Muskar XII physically resembling King Leopold III of Belgium . Hergé 's decision to create a fictional East European kingdom might have been influenced by <unk> , the fictional country created by Anthony Hope for his novel The Prisoner of Zenda ( 1894 ) and which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in 1913 , 1915 , 1922 , and 1937 . Many places within Syldavia are visually based on pre @-@ existing European sites : the Diplodocus in the Klow Natural History Museum is based on the one in the Museum für Naturkunde , Berlin ; the Syldavian Royal Palace is based on both the Charlottenburg Palace , Berlin and the Royal Palace of Brussels ; and Kropow Castle is based on <unk> Castle , constructed in fifteenth century Savonia - a historical province of the Swedish Kingdom , located in modern @-@ day Finland . For the revised version , Kropow Castle was drawn with an additional tower , inspired by Vyborg Castle , Russia . The United Kingdom also bore at least one influence on Syldavia , as King Muskar XII 's carriage is based on the British Royal Family 's Gold State Coach . 
 = = = Original publication = = = 
 King Ottokar 's Sceptre was first serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 under the title Tintin En <unk> ( " Tintin in Syldavia " ) . It would prove to be the last Tintin adventure to be published in its entirety in Le Petit Vingtième . From 14 May 1939 , the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper , Cœurs Vaillants . In 1939 , Éditions Casterman collected the story together in a single hardcover volume ; Hergé insisted to his contact at Casterman , Charles Lesne , that they hurry up the process due to the changing political situation in Europe . The Nazi – Soviet Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact was signed the day Hergé delivered the book 's remaining drawings ; finishing touches included the book 's original front cover , the royal coat of arms for the title page , and the tapestry depicting the Syldavian 's 1127 victory over the Turks in " The Battle of <unk> " on page 20 . Hergé suggested that for this publication , the story 's title be changed to The Scepter of Ottokar IV ; Casterman changed this to King Ottokar 's Sceptre . 
 King Ottokar 's Sceptre introduced the recurring character of Bianca Castafiore to the series , who appears alongside her pianist Igor Wagner . It also witnessed the introduction of antagonist Colonel Jorgen , who reappears in the later Tintin adventures Destination Moon and its sequel Explorers on the Moon . The <unk> brothers ' inclusion echoes the Balthazar brothers ' inclusion in The Broken Ear . 
 After the conclusion of King Ottokar 's Sceptre , Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Land of Black Gold until Germany placed Belgium under occupation in 1940 and forced the closure of Le Vingtième Siècle . The adventure Land of Black Gold had to be abandoned . 
 = = = Second version , 1947 = = = 
 The story was redrawn and colourised in 1947 . For this edition , Hergé was assisted by Edgar Pierre Jacobs , an artist who worked as part of Studios Hergé . Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story ; in the 1938 version , the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British Beefeaters , while the 1947 version has them dressed in a <unk> uniform . Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and his wife in the Syldavian royal court , while in that same scene is a cameo of Hergé , his then @-@ wife Germaine , his brother Paul , and three of his friend 's - Édouard <unk> , Jacques Van Melkebeke , and Marcel <unk> . Hergé and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38 , where they appear as uniformed officers . While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version , this was changed to Hector for the second ; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of Nestor , the butler of Marlinspike Hall , whom Hergé had introduced in The Secret of the Unicorn . Editions Casterman published this second version in book form in 1947 .

 King Ottokar 's Sceptre became the first Tintin adventure to be published for a British audience when The Eagle serialised the comic in 1951 . Here , the names of Tintin and Milou were retained , although the characters of Dupond and Dupont were renamed Thomson and Thompson ; the latter two names would be adopted by translators Leslie Lonsdale @-@ Cooper and Michael Turner when they translated the series into English for Methuen Publishing in 1958 . 
 Casterman republished the original black @-@ and @-@ white version of the story in 1980 , as part of the fourth volume in their Archives Hergé collection . In 1988 , they then published a facsimile version of that first edition . 
 = = Critical analysis = = 
 Harry Thompson described King Ottokar 's Sceptre as a " biting political satire " and asserted that it was " courageous " of Hergé to have written it given that the threat of Nazi invasion was imminent . Describing it as a " classic locked room mystery " , he praised its " tightly constructed plot " . Ultimately , he deemed it one of the best three Tintin adventures written before World War II , alongside The Blue Lotus and The Black Island . He also thought it noteworthy that in 1976 , archaeologists discovered a sceptre belonging to a 13th @-@ century King Ottokar in St. Vitus Cathedral , Prague . Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline believed that the story had the atmosphere of Franz Lehár 's The Merry Widow , with " added touches " from the films of Erich von Stroheim and Ernst Lubitsch . Fellow biographer Benoît Peeters thought that it exhibited " a political maturity " and " originality " . Further , he felt that Hergé was able to break free from the " narrative limits [ of ] ... too much realism " by the use of Syldavia as a setting . 
 Jean @-@ Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier called King Ottokar 's Sceptre " a Hitchcockian thriller " which " recaptures the paranoid ambience " of Cigars of the Pharaoh . They compared the pace of the latter part of the story to that of Steven Spielberg 's Indiana Jones films before noting that despite the " horrors of the real world " that are present with Borduria 's inclusion , they do not interfere in " the pure escapist nature of the adventure " . Ultimately they awarded it three stars out of five . 
 Michael Farr opined that the adventure has " a convincingly authentic feel " due to the satirical portrayal to Nazi Germany , but that this was coupled with " sufficient scope for invention " with the creation of Syldavia . He compared it to Hitchcock 's The Lady Vanishes . Farr preferred the colour version assembled with E.P. Jacobs ' aid , however . Deeming it " particularly successful " , he thought that it was " one of the most polished and accomplished " adventures in the series , with a " perfectly paced and balanced " narrative that mixed drama and comedy successfully . 
 Literary critic Jean @-@ Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University asserted that the inclusion of the Iron Guard evoked Colonel François de La Rocque 's Croix @-@ de @-@ Feu . Noting that the figure of Müsstler was " the Evil One without a face " , he expressed disbelief regarding Hergé 's depiction of Syldavia , as there were no apparent economic problems or reasons why Müsstler 's anti @-@ monarchist conspiracy was so strong ; thus , " mass revolution remains schematic " . 
 Literary critic Tom McCarthy identified several instances in the story that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin . He identified a recurring host @-@ and @-@ guest theme in Alembick 's visit to Syldavia , and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick 's identity is stolen . Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy was that of the blurring between the sacred and the political ; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar 's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir 's Day , something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection . McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock , a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure , The Crab with the Golden Claws . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 King Ottokar 's Sceptre was the first of The Adventures of Tintin to be adapted for the animated series Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin . The series was created by Belgium 's Belvision Studios in 1957 , directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg . The studio divided King Ottokar 's Sceptre into six 5 @-@ minute black @-@ and @-@ white episodes that diverted from Hergé 's original plot in many ways . It was also adapted into a 1991 episode of The Adventures of Tintin television series by French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana . The episode was directed by Stéphane Bernasconi , and Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin . 
 Tintin fans adopted the Syldavian language that appears in the story and used it to construct grammars and dictionaries , akin to the fan following of Star Trek 's Klingon and J.R.R. Tolkien 's Elvish . 
 = United ( Star Trek : Enterprise ) = 
 " United " is the 13th episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise and the 89th episode overall . It was first broadcast on the UPN network on February 4 , 2005 . It is the second of a three @-@ part story which included the previous episode " Babel One " , and the following episode , " The Aenar " . " United " was written by Judith and Garfield Reeves @-@ Stevens from a story idea by show runner Manny Coto . It was directed by David Livingston , his third of the season . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . In this episode , two of the crew are trapped on the Romulan drone ship while Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula ) on the Enterprise attempts to gain the co @-@ operation of the Andorians and Tellarites in tracking down the drone . His plan is complicated when Commander Shran ( Jeffrey Combs ) challenges a Tellarite to a duel , causing Archer to step in . After he defeats Shran , the races work together and force the retreat of the Romulan vessel and the missing crewman are recovered . 
 The episode was filmed over seven days , utilising the standing sets and those created for the previous episode . The duel was choreographed by Vince Deadrick Jr . , and the Ushaan @-@ Tor weapon itself was created by Dan Curry . " United " was watched by 2 @.@ 81 million viewers on the first broadcast . Critics responded favourably to the episode , comparing it to the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Amok Time " and the Andorians ' actions to those of Klingons elsewhere in the franchise . 
 = = Plot = = 
 " United " continues from the events in " Babel One " . On Romulus , Admiral Valdore ( Brian Thompson ) , Romulan scientist Nijil ( J. Michael Flynn ) , and their pilot continue to control the mysterious " marauder " , cloaking it to look like Enterprise and then using it to destroy a Rigelian vessel . Despite this success , Senator Vrax ( Geno Silva ) chastises them for losing full control of their drone since Commander Charles " Trip " Tucker III ( Connor Trinneer ) and Lieutenant Malcolm Reed ( Dominic Keating ) are still on board . Valdore and Nijil then work to trap Tucker inside a service junction as he attempts to divert power . After incapacitating him with leaked radiation coolant , Valdore then orders Reed to re @-@ establish the damaged warp matrix on the drone or see his crewmate die . Reed complies in order to rescue Tucker . 
 Meanwhile , aboard Enterprise , Commander T 'Pol ( Jolene Blalock ) and Ensign Travis Mayweather ( Anthony Montgomery ) devise a surveillance grid that will require the coordinated effort of 128 space ships . After seeking help from Earth and Vulcan , Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula ) realizes that he will need to obtain Andorian and Tellarite support too . Archer 's attempt hits a snag when Lieutenant Talas dies from the phaser wound sustained earlier . A devastated Commander Shran ( Jeffrey Combs ) openly challenges <unk> ( Kevin Brief ) to a blood @-@ duel using Ushaan @-@ Tor , an Andorian ice @-@ miner 's tool . Realizing that a death will derail trade negotiations , Archer announces himself as the Tellarite 's substitute . The duel proceeds and Archer is fortunately able to win , and spares Shran 's life after severing an antenna . 
 With the duel completed , Shran promises continued Andorian support for the grid , and the Tellarite 's Ambassador Gral ( Lee Arenberg ) does the same . Enterprise , as a flagship , soon relocates and re @-@ engages the drone . Reed and Tucker , caught in the crossfire and unable to be transported out , narrowly escape death by ejecting themselves into open space . A mixed fleet of " allied " vessels then arrive , forcing Vrax and Valdore to recall the drone at warp speed to Romulan space . Archer then invites the Andorians and the Tellarites to begin their negotiations early and no @-@ one aboard suspects that the drone 's pilot is actually an Andorian albino .

 " United " forms the second of a three part story , beginning with " Babel One " and concluding in " The Aenar " . It was written by Judith and Garfield Reeves @-@ Stevens , who were newly hired writers for the fourth season of Enterprise . It was their third script after " The Forge " and " Observer Effect " . Manny Coto , the showrunner for the series , devised the story for " United " . David Livingston directed the episode , his third of the season after " Borderland " and " Kir 'Shara " . 
 Filming for the episode took seven days between November 11 and November 19 , 2003 , with half the shoot taking place on the standing ship sets representing the Enterprise itself , and the remainder on the Romulan drone and command center sets which had been created for " Babel One " . For " United " , the entire guest cast returned from the previous episode , as well as Geno Silva who played the Romulan senator Vrax and Scott Rinker as the albino Andorian revealed at the end of the episode . Neither actors had previously appeared in the franchise . The <unk> race made their debut in the episode , as they had only previously appeared in the film Star Trek : Nemesis . The prosthetics seen in " United " were reused from that film . 
 Stunt co @-@ ordinator Vince Deadrick Jr. choreographed the Ushaan fight scene between Shran and Archer , with stuntmen Gary <unk> and Kim <unk> doubling for Combs and Bakula in wide shots . The Ushaan @-@ Tor itself was created by Dan Curry , whose previous work had included a variety of Klingon weapons including the bat 'leth . The script had simply called for " a dangerous @-@ looking Andorian weapon " , with the design fully coming from Curry . To demonstrate the different physiology of the Andorians , the make @-@ up department created a quantity of blue blood for use in that scene . It was also seen in a intravenous therapy prop in sickbay and for an earlier scene where Shran pours a quantity of it onto a Tellarite to issue his challenge .

 Alasdair Wilkins described " United " as the containing the most pivotal moment in the series when writing for the A.V. Club . The moment where the founding races of the Federation worked together to defeat the Romulan plot . He also praised the work of Combs as Shran , adding that the duel between Shran and Archer was " the kind of larger @-@ than @-@ life presence the often staid Enterprise most benefits from " . Jamahl Epsicokhan , at his website Jammer 's Reviews , gave the episode three out of four stars . He compared the fight scene to the one from the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Amok Time " , and felt that it showed the Andorians as being similar to the Klingons seen elsewhere in the franchise . He felt that the main storyline wrapped up in " United " , despite the twist at the end . 
 Michelle Erica Green also compared " United " to " Amok Time " in her review for TrekNation , placing Archer in the same role as Captain James T. Kirk in that episode . She said that this made sense for the sake of entertainment , but questioned why one of the marines on board the ship couldn 't have fought Shran instead . Green felt that the Andorians finally showed a series of similarities to the Klingons and pondered why they hadn 't become allies due to their similarities . She liked the episode , and posed one last question ; " Where were these sort of episodes when Enterprise still had a chance ? " 
 " United " was released on home media in the United States on November 1 , 2005 , as part of the season four DVD box set of Enterprise . The Blu @-@ ray edition was released on April 1 , 2014 . 
 = Thames Valley Royals proposal = 
 Shortly before the end of the 1982 – 83 Football League season , Robert Maxwell , the then @-@ owner and chairman of Oxford United Football Club , announced that he had made a deal with the owners of nearby Reading to amalgamate the two teams to create a new club he proposed to name " Thames Valley Royals " . This appellation combined a loose term for the geographical region , " Thames Valley " , with the Reading team 's nickname , " the Royals " . With each team having financial problems , Maxwell claimed that both were on the verge of going out of business and that uniting them was necessary for the region to retain a Football League club . 
 Maxwell envisioned Thames Valley Royals ' future home as an unspecified location somewhere between Oxford and Reading where a new stadium would be built , perhaps Didcot ; home matches would alternate between Oxford and Reading in the meantime . Both sets of supporters promptly embarked on mass demonstrations against the merger , including protest marches and a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ man sit @-@ in on the pitch at Oxford before a match on 23 April . Maxwell pressed on with his plan regardless , insisting that " nothing short of the end of the Earth " would prevent its fruition . 
 The proposed amalgamation was stopped by the actions of one of Reading 's board directors , Roy Tranter , and Roger Smee , a businessman and former Reading player . Smee disputed the legitimacy of the controlling interest in Reading held by the faction of three Reading board members that backed the merger plan , including the chairman Frank Waller , and Tranter launched a legal challenge to the sale of certain shares on 22 April 1983 . Waller and his boardroom allies resigned under pressure from the rest of the Reading board on 12 May 1983 , and at an extraordinary shareholders ' meeting in July , Smee took over the club , ending the amalgamation plans . 
 = = Context = = 
 During the 1982 – 83 Football League season , both Oxford United and Reading competed in the Football League Third Division , then the third tier of English football — equivalent to today 's League One . Managed by Jim Smith , Oxford challenged for promotion throughout the season , while Maurice Evans ' Reading team languished near the relegation zone for much of the year , despite possessing one of the division 's top @-@ scoring forwards in Kerry Dixon . The colourful media mogul and former MP Robert Maxwell owned and chaired Oxford , having prevented the club 's bankruptcy by buying it in 1982 . One of the world 's oldest football teams ( established in 1871 ) , Reading were a public limited company , chaired by Frank Waller , a prominent local businessman ; while owning Oxford , Maxwell also held 19 % of Reading 's shares . The two clubs share a local rivalry . At the time , both were in financial difficulties , particularly Reading . Maxwell sought to build a new stadium for Oxford United ; he had negotiated with the council over potential locations since the time of his takeover , favouring a site in the northern suburb of Marston , but had yet to win council permission to buy the land . 
 = = Proposal = = 
 On 16 April 1983 , about a month before the end of the 1982 – 83 season , Maxwell told the BBC that he was close to acquiring a controlling interest in Reading , and that he was intent on merging that club with Oxford . The merged club would be called Thames Valley Royals , a combination of " Thames Valley " , a loose term for the geographical area , and the nickname of Reading Football Club , " the Royals " . " If we in Thames Valley are to retain a League club we 've got to unite Reading and Oxford , " he explained . " Everything in the world that cannot pay its way must go the way of merger to combine into stronger units . " 
 Maxwell made this announcement on a Saturday when most Football League clubs , including Oxford and Reading , were playing League fixtures . Oxford were playing away at Doncaster Rovers . Jim Smith learned of the announcement shortly before kick @-@ off at Doncaster 's Belle Vue ground from John Ley , a journalist with the Oxford Mail , who had heard the news from another newsman by telephone . Smith immediately called Maxwell to ask whether or not he would be retained to manage Thames Valley Royals , and was told that he would be . 
 Maxwell issued a statement announcing that Oxford United were poised to acquire Reading by purchasing all of that club 's issued share capital , comprising 73 @,@ 000 shares , at £ 3 per share ( a total cost of £ 219 @,@ 000 ) , and that Waller and a group of Reading board directors , holding a majority of the shares in Reading F.C. , had " irrevocably accepted " this offer . The two clubs would continue separately for the last few weeks of the 1982 – 83 campaign , and Thames Valley Royals would begin play at the start of the 1983 – 84 League season . Maxwell claimed to have support in principle for this from the Football League . He said that the amalgamated team would ultimately be based at a new stadium to be built somewhere between Oxford and Reading , and that in the meantime home games would alternate between the two old grounds , Elm Park in Reading and the Manor Ground in Oxford , both of which would eventually be sold . The general public learned of the proposed merger in the late afternoon on 16 April , when it was announced by David Coleman on the television show Grandstand following the report of the day 's football results . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 The majority of both teams ' supporters reacted negatively to the merger proposal . While many Oxford supporters acknowledged that Maxwell had been instrumental in saving the club the previous year , most perceived merging with another club as tantamount to killing both Oxford United and professional football in the city . A spokesman for the Oxford United Supporters Club called the idea " crazy and unworkable " . Most Reading fans likewise reacted to the scheme with revulsion ; Mike <unk> , chairman of the Reading Supporters Club , said " Our fans can 't stand Oxford fans and I can 't see them travelling to Oxford to watch the new team " . Supporters and pressmen alike ridiculed the " Thames Valley Royals " name , which the sports historian John Bale later described as " mid @-@ Atlantic " ; observers at the time variously perceived it as sounding more like an American football , ice hockey or speedway team than a football club . Some Oxford fans supported Maxwell 's proposal , saying that with a new stadium and the pooled financial resources of Oxford and Reading , an amalgamated team might be successful , but these were a minority . One angry fan wrote to the Oxford Mail that " I will not follow Thames Valley Royals or whatever their name is if they played at the end of my street " . 
 Players at both clubs received the news with apprehension . As Ley put it , " When you merge two clubs into one , you cannot have a squad of 45 . " The Oxford team learned of the impending merger and the new name from Smith in the dressing room at Belle Vue just before the match against Doncaster on 16 April . Mark Jones , one of the Oxford midfielders , recalled that the room " went totally quiet " , and that his first thought was that it might be hard to him to keep his place in the first team with Reading 's players also on the books . According to Jones , Smith attempted to assuage the Oxford players ' fears by telling them that " we 're only doing it so we can buy Kerry Dixon . All your places are safe " . Alan Judge , the Reading goalkeeper , reported his team reacting in a similar way — indeed , he described the Reading players as even more worried as Oxford had far outperformed them in the League that season . Ley , who accompanied the Oxford team on the bus ride home after the game , recalled that the players were almost silent , their victory over Doncaster overshadowed by " a feeling of incredulity , confusion , worry and fear " . 
 Oxford United 's board of directors unanimously supported Maxwell 's proposed amalgamation at a board meeting held on 20 April 1983 . Their only reservation was regarding the name ; they preferred " Thames Valley United " . The chairman of the Football League , Jack Dunnett , described Maxwell 's proposal as " a bold and imaginative move which I 'll be watching with interest " . Meanwhile , Maxwell re @-@ entered talks with Oxford City Council over local stadium sites , repeating his preference for the Marston location . The council again refused . The mayor of Didcot , a small town about halfway between Oxford and Reading , suggested that Thames Valley Royals could build a ground there , on a site that had already been picked out for non @-@ League amateurs Didcot Town . Wallingford , a similar proposition just east of Didcot , was also proposed . The residents of neither Didcot nor Wallingford showed much interest in hosting Thames Valley Royals home matches , partly because they were concerned about football hooliganism . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 Oxford and Reading supporters embarked on a series of demonstrations against Maxwell 's proposed merger . The Reading Evening Post set up a campaign called " Save Our Soccer " , while Oxford fans launched a similar initiative called " Save Oxford Soccer " . Before Oxford 's match against Wigan Athletic at the Manor Ground on 23 April 1983 , about 2 @,@ 000 fans sat in in the centre of the pitch , delaying the start of the game by half an hour . Maxwell , in the directors ' box , was jeered by supporters , some of whom spat at him , and was confronted by a number of banners around the stadium reading " Judas " . After the match ( which Oxford won 2 – 0 ) , Maxwell called the demonstration a " bloody disgrace " . He reaffirmed his commitment to the Thames Valley Royals project a few days later through a phone @-@ in on BBC Radio Oxford . " If they want to become supporters of someone else , they 're entirely welcome , " he said . " If the deal does not go through , both Reading and Oxford will be dead before the beginning of next season . Nothing short of the end of the Earth will prevent this from going through . " Steve Daniels , an Oxford fan opposed to a merger , called in and claimed that Maxwell 's amalgamation proposal was a ploy intended to alter the council 's line regarding a new stadium in Oxford . 
 Meanwhile , efforts to stop the merger were stepped up at Reading by Roger Smee , a former Reading player , born and raised in the town , who had become a millionaire in the construction industry . Smee , who strongly opposed the merger plan , had read the club 's accounts the previous year , and so was aware of how the team 's stock was allocated . He knew that Waller and his boardroom allies , Leslie Davies and John Briggs , had not held a controlling interest in the club in 1982 and that a large number of Reading shares had then been noted as unissued . His interest was therefore piqued when the Thames Valley Royals deal was declared " irrevocable " on the basis that Waller 's faction controlled the majority of the shares in Reading . " A year ago they didn 't have a majority , " Smee later said , " so how on earth have they issued these shares to themselves while Reading was a public company ? That would be against the law . " Smee contacted Roy Tranter , a director at Reading who opposed the merger , and Tranter 's legal team filed a complaint with the High Court objecting to the sale of the unissued shares . 
 On 22 April 1983 , just as Waller and Maxwell were about to officially announce the merger , Tranter 's solicitors handed Waller a High Court injunction temporarily blocking sale of the disputed stock . Three days later , the High Court imposed a further injunction preventing any dealing in Reading shares until a further hearing on 3 May . Maxwell insisted that there was no problem , calling the legal challenge a " side show " ; he made a fresh bid to all of Reading 's shareholders . On 1 May , the Oxford chairman told the press that he and his supporters at Reading controlled 40 % of the shares . Meanwhile , Oxford City Council offered Oxford United a new " £ 6 million sports complex " in the western suburb of Botley . Maxwell said that he was still pursuing the merger with Reading , but would look into the Botley proposal . 
 Reading supporters marched from the town centre to Elm Park in protest against the merger before the team 's match against Millwall on 30 April . Two days later , Oxford and Reading met at Manor Road in what the Glasgow Herald commented might be " the last Thames Valley derby " . Oxford fans held another protest march before the game , which Reading won 2 – 1 . At the High Court on 3 May , Mr Justice Harman sided with Tranter and Smee , and handed down a new injunction forbidding trading in Reading stock until 13 June 1983 . Following a Reading board meeting on 12 May , Waller , Davies and Briggs resigned their positions , and returned the disputed unissued shares to the club . The Reading Evening Post saw this as the end of the episode , and jubilantly bannered the news across its front page on 13 May : " We 've won ! Merger off " . The next day , Reading played Wrexham at home on the last day of the League season , needing to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division ; they won 1 – 0 , but still went down because of results elsewhere . The club held an extraordinary meeting of shareholders in July 1983 , at which a vote was taken to decide between Maxwell 's takeover bid and a rival offer from Smee , supported by Tranter . The latter proposition narrowly won , and Smee took over as chairman of Reading , putting an end to the planned merger . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Maxwell reluctantly dropped his amalgamation plans , but retained his 19 % stake in Reading . Under Smee 's chairmanship , the team won promotion back from the Fourth Division at the end of the 1983 – 84 season , and won the Third Division title two years later , taking it into the Second Division . Smee remained at the helm until 1990 , when amid a financial crisis at the club he sold it to John Madejski . Meanwhile , Maxwell made Oxford United profitable , and oversaw two successive promotions for the club during the 1983 – 84 and 1984 – 85 seasons . The team played in the First Division , then the top level of English football , for the first time during 1985 – 86 , and won its first major trophy , the League Cup , in April 1986 . Despite Maxwell 's reservations about the Manor Ground , the club remained there throughout this time . 
 Maxwell ended his chairmanship of Oxford in 1987 , when he took control of Derby County and became that club 's chairman ; still owning Oxford as well , he installed his son Kevin as chairman there . In late 1987 he attempted to buy Watford from Elton John , prompting the Football League to institute new regulations preventing the major shareholder of any member club from owning more than 2 % of another League team . While Maxwell was able to keep his stakes in Derby , Oxford and Reading under a grandfather clause , the new rules prevented him from adding Watford to his football empire . He grudgingly accepted this . He retained his football club shares until his mysterious death in November 1991 , when he apparently fell off his yacht near the Canary Islands . 
 = 1972 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1972 Atlantic hurricane season had only four fully tropical named storms – the fewest since 1930 . It officially began on June 1 , 1972 , and lasted until November 30 , 1972 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . The first storm , Subtropical Storm Alpha , developed on May 23 off the Southeast United States and struck Florida , causing minor damage and two fatalities . Although several other tropical depressions developed , only Tropical Depression Five is known to have affected land . 
 The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Agnes , which at the time was the costliest United States hurricane , until Frederic in 1979 . After brushing the western tip of Cuba , the hurricane made landfall on the Florida Panhandle . It caused at least $ 2 @.@ 1 billion ( 1972 USD ) in damage and 137 fatalities , mostly from inland flooding in Pennsylvania and New York . The strongest hurricane of the season was Betty , which reached peak winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) while west of the Azores . Tropical Storm Carrie passed just offshore of Massachusetts , causing heavy rainfall and resulting in four fatalities , but leaving only $ 1 @.@ 78 million in damage . 
 The remaining tropical systems – Dawn , Charlie , and Delta – caused no significant effects on land . A strong El Niño kept hurricane activity at a minimum , with only four tropical storms , three subtropical storms , and three hurricanes . It was also one of only five hurricane seasons since 1944 to have no major hurricanes – the other years being 1968 , the 1986 , 1994 , and 2013 . In addition , the season was the first to name subtropical storms , using the Phonetic Alphabet , rather than the standard naming list . Collectively , the storms of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season resulted in 137 deaths and over $ 2 @.@ 1 billion in damage . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 , 1972 . Although 19 tropical cyclones developed , only seven of them reach tropical storm intensity , below the 1950 @-@ 2000 average of 9 @.@ 6 named storms per season . Of the seven tropical or subtropical storms , three of them strengthened into a hurricane , which is also below average . None of the three hurricane became major hurricanes , which is Category 3 or greater on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Overall , the season was inactive , despite having a similar number of tropical waves as the previous season . The lack of activity was attributed to an El Niño – which causes below normal sea surface temperatures over the eastern Atlantic – and strong vertical wind shear . One subtropical storm and two hurricanes made landfall during the season and caused at least 137 fatalities and more than $ 2 @.@ 1 billion in damage . The last storm of the season , Subtropical Storm Delta , became extratropical on November 7 , about 23 days before the official end of hurricane season on November 30 . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis first occurred in the month of May , with the development of Subtropical Storm Alpha . The month of June featured three tropical cyclones , including Hurricane Agnes and two tropical depressions . Three more systems formed in July , though all of them failed to reach tropical storm status . August was the most active month of the season , with five systems , including Hurricane Betty , Tropical Storm Carrie , and three tropical depressions . September featured slightly less cyclogenesis , with Hurricane Dawn , Subtropical Storm Charlie , and two tropical depressions . An additional three tropical depressions formed in October . Subtropical Storm Delta was the sole system in November , lasting from November 1 to November 7 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy ( ACE ) rating of 36 , the lowest value since 1962 . Broadly speaking , ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed . Therefore , a storm with a longer duration , such as Betty , will have high values of ACE . It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) . Accordingly , tropical depressions are not included here . After the storm has dissipated , typically after the end of the season , the NHC reexamines the data , and produces a final report on each storm . These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the operational value .

 A subtropical depression developed from a cold @-@ core low pressure area southeast of the Carolinas on May 23 . After initially moving northeastward , it turned sharply southward on May 26 due to a building ridge of high pressure . Later that day , the system strengthened into Subtropical Storm Alpha and proceeded to move toward the coast of Georgia . After peaking with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , Alpha began weakening . Late on May 27 , the storm made landfall near Brunswick , Georgia , with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Alpha weakened to a subtropical depression and dissipated after entering the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on May 29 . 
 Rough seas generated by the storm resulted in two people drowning in Florida and halted work to deepen a harbor at the Mayport Naval Station in Jacksonville . Tides along the Georgia coast reached 2 to 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) above normal , which caused some flooding and beach erosion . Wind gusts reached 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) on Saint Simons Island . The winds knocked down trees and power lines , leaving some people without power in eastern Georgia . Damage was minor but widespread in the state , estimated at over $ 50 @,@ 000 . Moderate rains spread in coastal areas from South Carolina through southern Florida . Alpha was the first named subtropical storm . 
 = = = Hurricane Agnes = = = 
 A polar front and an upper trough over the Yucatán Peninsula spawned a tropical depression on June 14 . The storm emerged into the western Caribbean Sea on June 15 , and by the following day , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Agnes . The storm curved northward and brushed western Cuba on June 17 . Agnes continued to intensify , and on June 18 , it was upgraded to a hurricane . Minimal fluctuations in intensity occurred before the storm made landfall near Panama City , Florida , on June 19 . After moving inland , Agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered Georgia . Thereafter , weakening slowed as the storm crossed over Georgia and into South Carolina . However , while over eastern North Carolina on June 21 , Agnes re @-@ strengthened into a tropical storm , as a result of baroclinic activity . Early the following day , the storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean before re @-@ curving northwestward and making landfall near New York City as a strong tropical storm . Agnes quickly merged with a non @-@ tropical low pressure system on June 23 . 
 Heavy rainfall occurred in western Cuba , causing flooding that destroyed 97 houses , isolated a few cities , and flatted crops in low @-@ lying areas . The storm left seven fatalities . Agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak , with at least 26 confirmed twisters , 24 of them in Florida and the other two in Georgia . The tornadoes alone resulted in over $ 4 @.@ 5 million in damage and six fatalities . At least 2 @,@ 082 structures in Florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed . About 1 @,@ 355 other dwellings experienced minor losses . Though Agnes made landfall as a hurricane , no hurricane force winds were reported . Abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage , especially between Apalachicola and Cedar Key . The storm left nine deaths and approximately $ 40 million in damage in Florida . Generally minor effects were also recorded in the states of Alabama , Delaware , Georgia , Ohio , South Carolina , and Tennessee , as well as the New England region . However , one fatality was reported in Delaware and three were recorded in Georgia . 
 The most significant effects , by far , occurred in Pennsylvania , mostly due to severe flooding . Precipitation peaked at 18 in ( 460 mm ) in Schuylkill County , causing several creeks and rivers crest at record height , including the Delaware , Juniata , Lackawanna , Susquehanna , and West Branch Susquehanna rivers . More than 100 @,@ 000 people were forced to leave their homes due to flooding . In the state of Pennsylvania , more than 3 @,@ 000 businesses and 68 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed , leaving at least 220 @,@ 000 people homeless . Overall , Agnes is ranked as the worst natural disaster in Pennsylvania . New York also suffered severe damage . Similarly , rivers in the state crested high , including the Allegheny , Chemung , Genesee , Susquehanna , and Tioga rivers . Corning , Elmira , and Olean , as well as many other Southern Tier towns , were severely flooded . Throughout New York , 32 @,@ 8232 homes were damaged and 628 others were damaged . A total of 1 @,@ 547 small businesses were extensively damaged or demolished . In Canada , a mobile home was toppled , killing two people . Overall , Agnes caused 131 fatalities and over $ 2 @.@ 1 billion in damage .

 An area of disturbed weather appeared on satellite imagery while forming within an old frontal zone on August 21 . At 1200 UTC on the following day , a subtropical depression developed about 290 mi ( 470 km ) north @-@ northeast of Bermuda . The system strengthened slowly as it headed east @-@ northeastward or eastward and by August 24 , it became Subtropical Storm Bravo . During the next 24 hours , minimal intensification occurred . However , a deepening high @-@ level trough and a building ridge enhanced outflow and deep convection on August 25 . Additionally , reconnaissance aircraft flights began indicating a transition to a warm @-@ core . Unfavorable northwesterly winds briefly halted further development , though by late on August 26 , Bravo resumed acquiring tropical characteristics after another deepening trough accelerated the storm eastward . 
 After reconnaissance aircraft reported winds of 98 mph ( 158 km / h ) and satellite imagery indicated a storm with a classic cyclonic appearance , Bravo was reclassified as Hurricane Betty while located about 920 mi ( 1 @,@ 480 km ) west of the Azores on August 27 . After some further strengthening , Betty attained its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 976 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) early on August 28 . The hurricane then moved rapidly east @-@ northeastward before decelerating late on the following day . Around that time , northerly winds aloft caused Betty to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane . After briefly moving southward , the storm curved back to a general westward direction and fell to tropical storm intensity on August 31 . Later that day , Betty turned northward ahead of a trough and became extratropical about 565 mi ( 910 km ) northwest of Corvo Island in the Azores on September 1 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Carrie = = = 
 A complex system combining a tropical wave and an upper level low led to the formation of a tropical depression east of Florida on August 29 . It managed to become a tropical storm on August 31 and reached initial peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) later that day . However , upper @-@ level winds increased , causing Carrie to weaken to a minimal tropical storm by September 2 . Due to baroclinic processes , Carrie began to re @-@ intensify . As a result , Carrie attained its peak winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) just prior to transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 3 . The extratropical cyclone continued northeastward , and struck eastern Maine on September 4 . By the following day , the extratropical cyclone dissipated over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence . 
 Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England , limited to increased swells , gusty winds , and light rainfall . The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England , where wind gusts reached 84 mph ( 135 km / h ) and rainfall exceeded 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) . Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast . Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of Massachusetts after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of steamship service . Overall , damage was generally light , with total monetary losses valued at $ 1 @.@ 78 million . Four deaths were blamed on the storm . 
 = = = Hurricane Dawn = = = 
 A tropical wave , combined with an upper <unk> trough , resulted in the development of a tropical depression near Cay Sal Bank , Bahamas , on September 5 . Later that day , the depression struck Key Largo , Florida , before moving inland over the mainland of Florida . The storm brought very light rainfall to the state , peaking at 1 @.@ 19 in ( 30 mm ) in Tavernier . The system moved northeastward and soon re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic . While located north of Grand Bahama on September 6 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dawn . On September 7 , a cold low pressure developed near Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , which would influence much of Dawn 's movement . Around that time , the storm strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane . Dawn then curved west @-@ northwestward on September 8 and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) . 
 With Dawn appearing as a threat to the Mid @-@ Atlantic , storm and gale warnings were issued from Chincoteague Inlet , Virginia , to Cape May , New Jersey on September 8 . However , the hurricane veered southeastward on September 9 and weakened to a tropical storm . By late on September 10 , after the cold low pressure area relinquished influence over Dawn , the cyclone began moving westward , but continued to deteriorate . Dawn weakened to a tropical depression while well east of Georgia late on September 12 . The system approached the Sea Islands on September 13 , but curved northeastward and remained offshore . Dawn dissipated less than 15 mi ( 25 km ) east of Isle of Palms , South Carolina , on September 14 . The storm also produced very light rainfall in Georgia and South Carolina . 
 = = = Subtropical Storm Charlie = = = 
 A very small , circular subtropical depression developed about 460 mi ( 740 km ) northeast of Bermuda on September 19 . Initially , the storm moved north @-@ northeastward and strengthened into Subtropical Storm Charlie early the following day . It then moved quickly northeastward and continued to strengthen . Later on September 20 , Charlie peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . The system soon lost tropical characteristics and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 630 mi ( 1 @,@ 010 km ) east of Cape Race , Newfoundland , early on September 21 . However , the extratropical storm deepened significantly , reaching a barometric pressure of 944 mbar ( 27 @.@ 9 inHg ) , a reading typical of a strong Category 3 hurricane . Early on September 22 , the extratropical cyclone dissipated over the far north Atlantic .

Early on November 3 , Delta attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 001 mbar ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) . Around that time , the subtropical storm briefly moved southward , before beginning a general eastward movement on November 4 . Delta soon began to weaken and was reduced to a subtropical depression by the following day . It continued eastward until November 6 , at which time the storm decelerated and curved northward .

 In addition to the named storms , there were several weak depressions during the season . As Agnes was moving over the southeastern United States , a tropical depression formed approximately 400 mi ( 640 km ) southwest of Bermuda on June 19 . It moved northeastward and headed toward the island . The depression dissipated later the following day . The next system , numbered Tropical Depression Five , developed offshore North Florida on July 10 . Moving generally northward , Tropical Depression Five made landfall near Cape Fear in North Carolina on July 12 . The depression dissipated over Virginia about two days later . Generally light rainfall was reported in several states , though 8 in ( 200 mm ) of precipitation was recorded on Cedar Island , North Carolina . Another tropical depression originated about 430 mi ( 690 km ) southwest of Flores Island in the Azores on July 16 . It trekked slowly until July 19 , at which time the system curved northeastward . Late the following day , the depression dissipated about 225 mi ( 360 km ) west of Flores Island . On July 31 , a tropical depression formed about 515 mi ( 830 km ) southeast of Bermuda . The depression moved southwestward , toward the Bahamas and Lesser Antilles , but dissipated about 225 mi ( 360 km ) northeast of Turks and Caicos Islands on August 3 . 
 A tropical depression developed over Senegal on August 5 . Tracking westward , the depression passed south of Cape Verde before dissipating southwest of the islands on August 8 . Four days later , another tropical depression originated about 175 mi ( 280 km ) east @-@ southeast of Charleston , South Carolina . It moved slowly northeastward and intensified slightly , but dissipated about 210 mi ( 340 km ) southeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , on August 15 . The tenth tropical depression formed on August 16 while offshore Senegal . Moving generally westward , the cyclone crossed through Cape Verde and struck the islands of Fogo and Santiago . By August 18 , the depression dissipated . Another tropical depression developed about 800 mi ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) east @-@ southeast of Bermuda on September 3 . The system moved northeastward toward the Azores , but degenerated about 750 mi ( 1 @,@ 210 km ) southwest of Flores Island on September 5 . The next tropical depression formed on September 20 while located about 570 mi ( 920 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cape Verde . The storm tracked generally westward , but then began moving west @-@ northwestward on September 21 .

 Dimple <unk> Kapadia ( born 8 June 1957 ) is an Indian film actress . Kapadia made her acting debut at the age of 16 , playing the title role in Raj Kapoor 's teen romance Bobby ( 1973 ) . However , eight months before her debut film released , she married Indian actor Rajesh Khanna . She is the mother of Twinkle Khanna and Rinke Khanna , both former actresses . Kapadia returned to the film industry in 1984 after her separation from Khanna . One of her films of that period was the drama Saagar ( 1985 ) . Both Bobby and Saagar won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress . 
 Initially recognized as a national sex symbol , Kapadia was keen to avoid being stereotyped and expand her range of acting roles . She subsequently took on more serious parts in a range of film genres , from mainstream to parallel cinema , and received acclaim for her performances in such films as Kaash ( 1987 ) , Drishti ( 1990 ) , Lekin ... ( 1990 ) , and Rudaali ( 1993 ) , which earned her a National Film Award for Best Actress and a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress . She followed with supporting roles in Gardish ( 1993 ) and Krantiveer ( 1994 ) , the latter of which garnered her a fourth Filmfare Award . 
 Kapadia continued working infrequently through the 1990s and the 2000s . She played a minor part in Dil Chahta Hai ( 2001 ) and was noted for her portrayal of the title role in the American production Leela ( 2002 ) . Some of her later film credits include leading roles in Hum Kaun Hai ? ( 2004 ) , Pyaar Mein Twist ( 2005 ) , Phir Kabhi ( 2008 ) and Tum Milo Toh Sahi ( 2010 ) , and supporting roles in Being Cyrus ( 2005 ) , Luck by Chance ( 2009 ) , Dabangg ( 2010 ) , Cocktail ( 2012 ) and Finding Fanny ( 2014 ) .

 Kapadia is the eldest of the four children of Gujarati entrepreneur <unk> Kapadia and Betty , her younger siblings being late actress Simple Kapadia , a sister named Reem and a brother , Munna . The family resided on <unk> Road in Santa Cruz , Mumbai , and she studied at St. Joseph 's Convent High School . Due to her father 's wealth and business , she has described her upbringing as " different " . 
 Kapadia married actor Rajesh Khanna in March 1973 , eight months before her debut film Bobby released in November <unk> portions of the film Bobby was shot , only after their <unk> then retired from acting for twelve years to raise her two daughters , Twinkle ( b . 1974 ) and Rinke ( b . 1977 ) . About her marriage , she was quoted saying " “ I got married while I was just sixteen . I do not have any regrets for having left the stardom for the sake of my family life . I feel that was my best period . " Kapadia separated from Khanna in April 1982 , leaving the house with her two daughters back to her parents . She returned to acting two years later . In 2010 , reporter Dinesh Raheja stated that " the bitterness between Rajesh and Dimple washed away " , noting that they are seen together at parties and that Dimple campaigned for Khanna 's election in 1990 and also worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar . In an 2014 interview she stated " The biggest high for me was to marry Rajesh Khanna . That was a high and I don ’ t think my success was as much of a high as getting married to this superstar . I used to be a big fan of his , it was dream come true . But I can ’ t really say the same about my career because I didn ’ t meet people , So I never felt the impact . " In an interview in 2016 , she said " Lots of women marry young and become mothers at a young age . The only really special thing that happened to my life was that I married superstar Rajesh Khanna . " 
 Her daughters also became actresses and retired after settling down . Her elder daughter , Twinkle Khanna , is married to actor Akshay Kumar .

 Kapadia once said she had always had aspirations to become an actress when she was a child , calling herself " film @-@ crazy " . She was discovered at age 13 by Raj Kapoor , who later introduced her in his 1973 teen romance Bobby . While the film was to be Kapoor 's son Rishi Kapoor 's first leading role , Kapadia was given the title role of Bobby Braganza , a middle @-@ class Goan Christian girl . The story follows how Bobby falls in love with Raj ( Rishi ) , the son of a wealthy businessman , and how the two face the disapproval of their parents . Bobby was a major mainstream and critical success , and Kapadia was lauded for her performance , which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress ( tied with Jaya Bhaduri for <unk> ) . In later years Kapadia would credit Raj Kapoor for her development as an actress : " the sum total of me today as an actress , whatever I am , is Raj Kapoor . " Several of her lines in the film became popular , particularly , " Mujhse <unk> <unk> ? " ( " Will you be my friend ? " ) . In 2008 , Rediff.com ranked her performance in the film as the fourth @-@ best female debut of all @-@ time in Hindi cinema : " An elfin little girl with big , lovely eyes , nobody quite portrayed innocence as memorably as Dimple in her first outing . She was candid , striking , and a true natural ... here was a girl who would redefine glamour and grace , and make it look very , very easy indeed . " Following the success of the film , Kapadia 's modern wardrobe and hairstyle in Bobby , consisting of " knotted polka @-@ dotted blouse and earphone hairstyle " , made her a youth fashion icon of the times in India . Consequently polka @-@ dotted dresses were often referred to as ' Bobby Print ' . Bhawana Somaaya of The Hindu credits Kapadia as starting film memorabilia merchandising in India . Mukesh Khosla of The Tribune reported that Bobby established her as a " cult figure " as she led the fashion trends . Kapadia had married actor Rajesh Khanna in March 1973 at the age of 16 and eight months later her debut film released . She left the film industry to raise her children .

 After Kapadia 's separation from Khanna in 1982 , she was keen on returning to acting , which she ultimately did in 1984 . For the next decade , she would go on to become one of top five commercial actresses in Bollywood along with Sridevi , Madhuri Dixit , Meenakshi <unk> and Jaya Prada . Kapadia accredited the reason for her return was because of a personal need to prove to herself her own capabilities . The first film she worked on was Saagar , directed by Ramesh Sippy , after a mutual friend had notified Sippy about her willingness to return to acting . She first performed a screen test , which according to her was very unsuccessful as she was extremely nervous and " literally shivering " while making it . To her surprise , Sippy ultimately signed her on to play the lead part opposite her Bobby co @-@ star Rishi Kapoor . Scripted with her in mind , the film was intended to be her comeback vehicle , but its one @-@ year delay meant that several of her proceeding projects would be released before , the first of which was <unk> Sher ( 1984 ) . Saagar eventually premiered in August 1985 and was controversial for several scenes featuring Kapadia , including one scene in which she was seen topless for a split second . The film was a critical success and was eventually chosen as India 's official entry to the Oscars that year . Kapadia 's performance as Mona D 'Silva , a young woman from Goa who is torn between her friend ( Kamal Haasan ) and the man she loves ( Kapoor ) , won her a second Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards . A review by Asiaweek labelled her " a delight " . Rediff.com noted , " Dimple , caught between a friend and lover , performed solidly and memorably , grounding the two male leads and making the film work . " A 1993 issue of India Today wrote , " Saagar was in many ways a paean to her incredible beauty . She looked ravishing : auburn hair , classical face , deep eyes , an aura of sensuality . It was clear she was back . " 
 In 1984 she had a role opposite Sunny Deol in Manzil Manzil , a drama directed by Nasir Hussain . She later said making the film was " one big picnic " , though she expressed her lack of comfort performing the " routine song @-@ and @-@ dance " nature of the part . Kapadia 's first film of 1985 was Mukul Anand 's <unk> , a Hitchcockian thriller for which she received positive reviews . Speaking of her performance , she said that during shooting she was " a bag of nerves " , which eventually ended up working " to my advantage as it lent my performance the right shade of tautness , without my realising it . " Among other films released that year , Kapadia was paired up with Sunny Deol in Arjun , an action film directed by Rahul Rawail and scripted by Javed Akhtar . 
 Feroz Khan 's <unk> ( 1986 ) told the story of a man fighting the drug menace . The film became known for its steamy love scene involving Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor , in which the two also shared a full on kiss , something Hindi movie @-@ goers were not accustomed to in those days . In that same year she acted opposite Saagar co @-@ star Kamal Haasan in her first regional film , Vikram , a Tamil @-@ language sci @-@ fi feature . She played the minor part of <unk> , a young princess who falls for the title character , played by Haasan . At that time , she also worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from the South , including <unk> Bhairavi , which she detested . She has confessed to accepting these roles for financial gain rather than artistic merit during this period , noting , " I shudder even now when I think of those films . As an artiste I got totally corrupted . " 
 In 1987 , Kapadia starred in Mahesh Bhatt 's drama Kaash . Kapadia and Jackie Shroff starred as an estranged couple who , during a relentless legal battle over the custody of their only son , learn that the boy is suffering from leukaemia , which makes them reunite to spend together the last months of his life . Before shooting began , she called it " the most serious artistic challenge I have ever faced in my career . " Bhatt said he decided to cast her in the role because he was aware of her own marital experience , and he noted that during the making of the film she " came closer and closer to the naked truth , " so much that " after a certain point , mentally I couldn 't differentiate between Dimple and Pooja . She became the character . " Kapadia 's performance as Pooja was highly praised by critics . In an article discussing her career 's best roles , The Times of India wrote , " As ... [ a ] long @-@ suffering wife who tries making a living for herself and her young son by working odd jobs , Dimple showed immense strength as a performer . This has to be one of her best and most unrecognised performances . " Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com noted , " She rendered her Pooja with stoic determination and touching vulnerability making her character extremely believable and sympathetic at once . " 
 In 1988 , she played the main protagonist in <unk> Aurat , that of a female police officer who gets gang @-@ raped and , after the judicial system fails to convict the criminals , abandons the legal course and joins forces with other rape victims to get revenge by castrating the rapists . The Times of India labelled the film a " B @-@ grade movie " , but further noted that " Dimple nonetheless did a very convincing job of portraying her anguish and bitterness at being denied justice . " M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune , while documenting the famous Hindi films of 1988 , praised Kapadia for " proving her mettle as an actress of intensity and passion . " Subhash K. Jha , however , in an article discussing Indian actresses who have played policewomen , wrote that the film " turned into quite an embarrassment for its leading lady . " 
 The three final years of the decade saw the release of several other films featuring Kapadia , but few did well . In 1987 , she appeared in two action movies : Rajkumar Kohli 's <unk> Ke Dushman and Mukul Anand 's <unk> , in which she played a dual role of a dancer and a physician . She worked with Kohli in two more movies in 1988 , the horror film Bees Saal Baad and the action drama <unk> . In that same year Mahesh Bhatt cast her again in his action thriller <unk> , a critical failure . Ram <unk> ( 1989 ) , directed by Subhash Ghai , was a success with both critics and audiences , but Kapadia 's role was considered small with one critic saying it did not do " justice to her talent " and another reporting that she " pales into insignificance in the film . " Other films of this period include Babbar Subhash 's Pyar Ke Naam <unk> , opposite Mithun Chakraborty , and J.P. Dutta 's action picture <unk> , opposite Dharmendra and Vinod Khanna .

 In the 1990s , Kapadia started venturing more into arthouse films , later citing an " inner yearning to exhibit my best potential . " Those films include Drishti ( 1990 ) , Lekin ... ( 1990 ) , Rudaali ( 1993 ) and Antareen ( 1995 ) . Drishti , a marital drama directed by Govind Nihalani , starred Kapadia and Shekhar Kapur as a married urban couple from an intellectual milieu in Mumbai and followed their trials and tribulations , extramarital affairs , divorce , and ultimate reconciliation after years of separation . Kapadia 's part was that of career @-@ woman Sandhya , and for her portrayal she was named the Best Actress ( Hindi ) of the year by the Bengal Film Journalists ' Association . The film was acknowledged as the Best Hindi Film of that year at the annual National Film Awards . In 1993 . Frontline suggested that Kapadia 's performance in the film should have earned her the Best Actress award at the same function . In Gulzar 's Lekin ... , she played a restless sprite named Reva , a role she has often cited as a personal favourite and wished would have had more screen time in the film . Referring to it once as " the most fantastic " part of her career , she recalled the working relationship with Gulzar as " a wonderful experience " . To make her character more truthful , Gulzar did not let Kapadia blink even once during filming , trying to capture an " endless , fixed gaze " which would give her " a feeling of being surreal . " Lekin ... was popular with critics and Kapadia 's performance earned her a third Filmfare nomination . 
 In 1991 , she appeared in <unk> : The Final Attack , the first directorial venture of actor Nana Patekar , with whom she would collaborate in several other films . The film , co @-@ starring Patekar and Madhuri Dixit , received a welcome reception from critics . Kapadia was noted for her " <unk> role " , but most of the praise went to the performance of Patekar himself . Kapadia starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in Shashi Kapoor 's fantasy <unk> , an Indo @-@ Russian co @-@ production based on Arabian mythology and set in the Afghan kingdom of <unk> . She played <unk> , a young woman who comes from India to rescue her father , court magician Ameer Baba , from prison . The critical response to <unk> was mostly lukewarm . She played the protagonist in Haque ( 1991 ) , a political drama directed by Harish Bhosle and scripted by Mahesh Bhatt . Her role was that of Varsha B. Singh , a pregnant Orthodox woman married to an influential politician . Ram <unk> Agnihotri said of her performance , " Dimple <unk> , playing Varsha , very bravely , tries to make her role look convincing , and she succeeds to a great extent . It is a tribute to her as an actress " . 
 1992 saw the release of <unk> , her third appearance under Mahesh Bhatt 's direction . The film was delayed for several years . She played the role of a prostitute , working by choice . Bhatt called her performance " stunning " and reported that when shooting ended , she was " on the point of a breakdown " as she was " exhausted battling with the nitty @-@ gritty of a whore 's character " . She next played <unk> , a single woman who abandons her premarital daughter upon birth , in Hema Malini 's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai . In <unk> K. Nair 's <unk> , a crime drama based on the life of an underworld don , she played Mili , a homeless orphan collected by an unemployed man , played by Jackie Shroff . <unk> received positive reviews from critics , as did Kapadia 's performance , but it was financially unsuccessful , which Meena Iyer of The Times of India — who called it " one of the most engaging mafia films to have come out of Bollywood " — attributed to its dark proceedings . 
 In 1993 , she won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in Rudaali , a drama directed by Kalpana Lajmi . Kapadia played the central character of <unk> , a lonely and hardened Assamese village woman who , throughout a lifetime of misfortune , has never cried and is now challenged with a new job as a professional mourner . The citation for the award described her performance as a " compelling interpretation of the tribulations of a lonely woman ravaged by a cruel society " . Chandra Bhushan said of her character , " <unk> is dry like a desert but even she has a flavour , affection and audacity and courage to reject the enticement of <unk> ( the landlord ) . " Aside from her third Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the role , she won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress , and was acknowledged with Best Actress honours at the Asia Pacific Film Festival and the Damascus International Film Festival . In 2010 Filmfare magazine included her work in the film in their list of " 80 Iconic Performances " . Another Filmfare nomination for Kapadia came that year for her supporting role as Shanti , a street prostitute , in the Priyadarshan @-@ directed drama Gardish . An adaptation of the 1989 Malayalam film <unk> , the film starred , among others , Jackie Shroff and Amrish Puri . 
 In 1994 , Kapadia appeared in Mehul Kumar 's Krantiveer , alongside Nana Patekar . She played journalist Meghna Dixit , a past rape victim who now tries to persuade an alcoholic and unemployed village man to be a champion of justice for those around him . Kapadia later called the film " out and out a Nana Patekar vessel , " but asserted , " I had my share too , " crediting the part with allowing her " the freedom to perform " . The film became an economic success , emerging as India 's third @-@ highest grossing picture of the year . For her performance , Kapadia received her fourth Filmfare Award , this time in the Best Supporting Actress category . Mrinal Sen 's 1995 Bengali drama Antareen was the first non @-@ Hindi project Kapadia took part in since Vikram ( 1986 ) . She played a woman caught in a loveless marriage . Insisting on playing her part spontaneously , Kapadia refused to enrol in a crash @-@ course in Bengali as she wrongly felt that she would be able to speak it convincingly . Her voice was eventually dubbed by actor <unk> Chatterjee , something Kapadia was unhappy with . 
 Following Antareen , Kapadia , who was reportedly expected to work in more independent films , took a three @-@ year hiatus from acting , later explaining that she was " emotionally exhausted " . She returned to commercial cinema in 1996 , but the few films she did until the end of the decade met with neither mainstream nor critical success . Her first release in 1997 was the action film <unk> , which went unnoticed . She played Amitabh Bachchan 's wife in that same year 's <unk> , once again under Mehul Kumar 's direction . The film was a critical and commercial failure , with India Today panning its " comic book @-@ level storytelling " . Trade journal Film Information wrote Kapadia had " no role worth her " , and she herself shared similar sentiments . 
 She appeared in <unk> ( 1999 ) because she liked the subject and considered her role " substantial " , which Rediff.com , in turn , described as another preachy " woman of substance " , while criticising the film for its lack of originality : " working a worked @-@ to @-@ death formula , [ the film ] falls flat on its face . This was followed by the final feature she appeared in during the decade , Hum Tum Pe Marte Hain , in which she played the part of <unk> , the strict mother of a wealthy family . Subhash K. Jha called the film an " embarrassment " , critic <unk> Verma , in a scathing review , criticised Kapadia 's performance , noting that she " wears a permanent scowl " throughout the film , and Bella <unk> of The Indian Express , calling the film " inconsequential " , concluded her review writing that she wonders " what made Dimple Kapadia do this to herself " .

 She co @-@ starred in Farhan Akhtar 's directorial debut Dil Chahta Hai ( 2001 ) . Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth , it is set in modern @-@ day urban Mumbai and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends ( Aamir Khan , Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna ) . Kapadia played the role of Tara Jaiswal , a middle @-@ aged alcoholic woman , an interior designer by profession , and a divorcee who is not allowed to meet with her daughter . The film presents her story through the character of Siddharth ( Khanna ) , a much younger man whom she befriends and who ultimately falls deeply in love with her . She said making the picture was an " enriching " experience and called her part " a role to die for " . Critics lauded Dil Chahta Hai as a groundbreaking film for its realistic portrayal of Indian youth . The film performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas , which was attributed by critics to the urban @-@ oriented lifestyle depicted in the movie . Saibal Chatterjee , in a review for Hindustan Times , noted , " Dimple Kapadia , in a brief , somewhat underdeveloped role , presents a poignant study of loneliness . " 
 In 2002 , Kapadia portrayed the title role of Leela in Leela , an American production directed by Somnath Sen and co @-@ starring Deepti Naval , Vinod Khanna and Amol Mhatre . Kapadia 's part — written specially for her — is that of a forty @-@ year @-@ old married woman and a Mumbai University professor , who , after the death of her mother , loses her sense of happiness and takes a job as a visiting professor of South Asian studies in California . The story follows Leela 's acclimation to her new surroundings and particularly her relationship with one of her students there , Kris ( Mhatre ) , a young Indian @-@ American man . Kapadia noted about working in the film , " While in production , I 'm all tensed up , and that is what makes me take my acting to the next level . " Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide wrote , " Dimple Kapadia shines in this family melodrama ... [ her ] intelligent , nuanced performance is the film 's highlight . " Ziya Us Salam from The Hindu called her " a charmer all the way . <unk> is the air she breathes , bewitching is the glance she casts and enticingly vulnerable is her condition . " 
 In 2004 , she played the lead role of army wife Sandra Williams in Hum Kaun Hai ? , a supernatural thriller . The film opened to a mixed critical reception , but Kapadia 's performance received positive comments . Subhash K. Jha noted that she " carries the film beyond where it would have been otherwise " ; Rama Sharma of The Tribune wrote of her performance , " Dimple lends all her charisma to help the script sail through dead ends . Whether she is scared or scolding children , she has a powerful presence . " 2005 saw Kapadia and Rishi Kapoor reunite as a lead couple for the third time after Bobby ( 1973 ) and Saagar ( 1985 ) in Pyaar Mein Twist . They starred as two middle @-@ aged single parents who fall in love and later have to deal with the reaction of their children . The film generated mostly negative reviews , with several critics concurring that the chemistry between the lead pair is what makes the film watchable . In a two @-@ star review , Khalid Mohamed called Kapadia " a dream actress " , but ultimately concluded , " See this <unk> if you must , only for the undiminished Kapoor @-@ Kapadia chemistry . " Few people went to see the film ; within two weeks it was declared a flop . 
 In 2006 , she co @-@ starred with Saif Ali Khan and Naseeruddin Shah in the psychological drama Being Cyrus ( 2006 ) , an English @-@ language arthouse feature directed by Homi Adajania . Kapadia enacted the part of Katy , Shah 's neurotic and unfaithful wife who runs an affair with Cyrus , a young man who enters their house as an assistant . Her work received varied comments . According to BBC 's Poonam Joshi , " The descent into despair of Dimple Kapadia 's Katy is enthralling . " Derek Elley from Variety , however , panned her for " wildly overact [ ing ] " , with similar sentiments being shared by several critics , including <unk> Sukumaran from Mid Day , who labelled her performance " over @-@ the @-@ top and jerky " . In V. K. Prakash 's Phir Kabhi Kapadia and Mithun Chakraborty played ageing people who meet at a school reunion and rekindle their high @-@ school romance . At the request of her son @-@ in @-@ law Akshay Kumar , she voiced the character of Devi , the mother of the title character of an elephant ( voiced by Kumar ) in the animated movie Jumbo ( 2008 ) . 
 Kapadia was cast in Zoya Akhtar 's first directorial venture , Luck By Chance ( 2009 ) , a satirical take on the Hindi film industry . She played the part of Neena Walia , an erstwhile superstar — referred to in the film as " a crocodile in a chiffon saree " — who struggles to launch her young daughter in the movie business . Luck By Chance opened to a warm critical response , though its financial income was modest . Critics were appreciative of Kapadia 's performance , which earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare . Deepa <unk> from Screen characterised her as " gloriously bitchy " , while Sukanya Verma from Rediff hailed her as " stunning , striking , storming " .

 Kapadia played the small part of Salman Khan 's asthmatic mother in Dabangg ( 2010 ) . With revenues of ₹ 2 @.@ 13 billion worldwide , the film was a huge commercial success , emerging as the popular film of the year in India as well as the second @-@ highest grossing Hindi film of all @-@ time up to that point . Reviews for Kapadia were mixed , with Shubhra Gupta writing that she is " laughably wrong " . Tum Milo Toh Sahi , released the same year , was a mature love story , in which she starred as <unk> <unk> , a Parsi woman in charge of an Irani café , who falls in love with a man played by Nana Patekar . Kapadia employed a Parsi accent for the role and , while preparing for it , visited several Irani cafés in Mumbai to understand their cultural basics and get into the mood of the character . The film opened to average reviews , but her performance received generally positive feedback , with several critics noting her chemistry with Patekar . Anupama Chopra , in a negative review , criticised her character , claiming it " veers into caricature " , but wrote of Kapadia that she " plays her with affection and energy and at least has some fun doing it . " 
 Kapadia 's only film of 2011 was Nikhil Advani 's Patiala House , a sports film revolving around cricket in which she was cast as Rishi Kapoor 's wife and her son in @-@ law , Akshay Kumar 's mother . The role was small , with Times of India 's Nikhat Kazmi commenting that she " does end up a bit underutilised " . As of December 2011 , Kapadia is set to appear in her third non @-@ Hindi and first Malayalam @-@ language film , Bombay <unk> , for which she started learning the language . She plays the wife of a celebrated Ghazal singer , played by Amar Singh , on whose behest she was offered the part . Her starring film What the Fish was released on 13 December 2013 .

 When Kapadia made her comeback to movies , she faced constant comparison to her Bobby days . According to Jyotika Virdi , author of the book The Cinematic Imagination , Kapadia trajectory is " different from that of any female Hindi film star " , and she " turned every disadvantage to her advantage . " Virdi mentioned Kapadia 's forthright manner as having a major contribution to her career : " Speaking candidly to the press , she and the reporters plotted her life 's narrative from the innocent teenager snared into an impossible marriage to the emergence of a mature ' woman with experience . ' " Virdi also noted Kapadia for " fighting her way to the top , preferring to perform roles she described as serious and exacting rather than flippant and unchallenging , " calling her parts in <unk> ( 1985 ) , Kaash ( 1987 ) and Drishti ( 1990 ) as roles " where she drew from the well of her own experience . " 
 Kapadia is known for her assertive and moody nature ; during the making of <unk> ( 1986 ) , director Feroz Khan remarked , " No other girl has so much of pent @-@ up aggression . " Journalist Bhawana Somaaya , who conducted a series of interviews with her during the 1980s , stated , " She 's a strange bundle of contradictions . Her moods change in a jiffy . " According to some critics , this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities as " her unpredictable nature and moods have distanced many well wishers " . In reply to this , she said , " I am moody by nature . But I have never consciously hurt anyone . " According to Shobha Dé , Kapadia " hates being ' surveyed ' and she finds herself in that unenviable situation all the time . " 
 Mahesh Bhatt , with whom she first worked in Kaash ( 1987 ) , remarked that Kapadia " has gone through so much in her life that she need not read up the text books of method acting to play a real woman . " Speaking of her venture into art cinema years later , Bhatt commended her for not turning into " a victim of her own success " by refusing to become " a part of the money @-@ making machine " . Mrinal Sen , who directed her in Antareen ( 1994 ) , compared her to Sophia Loren and described her face as " a landscape of desolation " . According to Drishti ( 1990 ) director Govind Nihalani , Kapadia is " genuinely interested in doing serious work , something that challenges her talent . " Following her success with Rudaali , a 1993 edition of Asiaweek reported that by this time Kapadia had long been " a critic 's darling " . 
 Dinesh Raheja from Rediff stated that Kapadia 's involvement in art films happened at a time when she " exhausted her appetite for playing the pretty prop in hero @-@ oriented films " , arguing that they " honed Dimple 's talent for lending fine striations to complex emotions . " According to Raheja , Kapadia 's casting in Dil Chahta Hai and Leela , in which she played " an older woman who is the object of a younger man 's affection " served as " a kind of tribute to her eternal beauty . " M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune commented , " All those who have been following Dimple Kapadia 's career from Bobby , Lekin and Rudaali will assert that she is more talented than glamorous . " Ranjan Das Gupta calls her " an instinctive actress , spontaneous and intelligent " but he notes that her beauty is " her asset as well as limitation " . Kapadia describes herself as " a competent actress yet to deliver her best " .

 The Banditti of the Prairie also , known as " The Prairie Bandits , " " Pirates of the Prairie , " " Prairie Pirates , " or simply " The Banditti , " in the U.S. states of Illinois , Indiana , Ohio , and the territory of Iowa , were a group of loose @-@ knit , outlaw gangs , during the early @-@ mid @-@ 19th century ( 1800s ) . Though bands of roving criminals were common in many parts of Illinois , the counties of Lee , DeKalb , Ogle , and Winnebago were especially affected by them . In the year 1841 , the escalating pattern of house burglary , horse and cattle theft , stagecoach and highway robbery , counterfeiting , and murder associated with the Banditti had come to a head in Ogle County . As the crimes continued , local citizens formed bands of vigilantes known as Regulators . The clash , between the Banditti and the Regulators in Ogle County , resulted in the outlaws ' demise , near Oregon , Illinois , and decreased Banditti activity and violent crime , within the county . 
 Banditti and Regulator activity continued well after the lynching that took place in 1841 . Crimes continued , committed by both sides , across northern / central Illinois . The Banditti were involved in other notable events as well , including the 1845 torture @-@ murder of merchant , Colonel George Davenport , the namesake of Davenport , Iowa . Edward Bonney , an amateur detective who hunted down and brought to justice the killers , wrote of his exploits and alibi , which were recounted in his book , Banditti of the Prairies , or the Murderer 's Doom ! ! : A Tale of the Mississippi Valley , published in Chicago in 1850 . The outlaw gangs also , continued to be active in Lee and Winnebago counties following the events in Oregon .

 The " Prairie Bandits " were active , across northern Illinois , especially in Lee , Ogle , Winnebago , and DeKalb counties , from 1835 , until the events leading to their ultimate demise began on March 21 , 1841 . The Bandits wielded considerable influence in the area , collectively known as the Rock River Valley , following the influx of immigrants , after the Black Hawk War of 1832 , the last Indian war in Illinois . The Banditti posed a far greater threat , for a much longer period , than the exaggerated paranoia of the two month , Native American conflict . <unk> Illinois Governor Thomas Ford wrote in History of Illinois : 
 = = = = Banditti crimes in Lee and Ogle Counties = = = = 
 In Lee County , Illinois , the Banditti also , had enough power to get away , unnoticed . The group had enough allies that they were scattered throughout the county . The connections the Banditti had around the county made illegal activities such as counterfeiting and dealing in and concealing stolen property easy to perpetrate . It was reported , that , at one time , every township officer , in Lee County , was a member of the Banditti . Acts of theft were carried on in defiance of authority . Citizens were threatened when they tried to seek redress from the thieves . 
 In the end , the Prairie Bandits ' activity in Ogle and Lee County became more than area residents were willing to withstand . In Ogle County the crimes that occurred in March 1841 resulted in a kangaroo court which culminated with the lynching of two Banditti near Oregon , Illinois . In nearby Lee County , a Vigilance Committee was formed by men from throughout Lee County , and especially Lee Center Township took an active role in suppressing the Banditti activity . 
 Beginning with the events on March 21 , 1841 , violence and retribution escalated in , the area around the Ogle County seat , of Oregon . Illinois , still frontier in 1841 , was settled by large numbers of migrants after the Black Hawk War . The settlers were followed to the area by a criminal element . The Banditti of the Prairie were part of the crime problem that plagued much of northern Illinois . As such , the concerned citizens of Ogle County , organized and eventually took the law into their own hands .

 On March 21 , 1841 , six members of the Banditti were arrested on charges of counterfeiting . They were held at the Ogle County Jail in the city of Oregon . That night a fire broke out in the newly completed courthouse , which was to be used for the first time the next day . The fire , set by the Banditti , was meant as a diversion to facilitate the escape of the apprehended gang members . The diversion failed ; though the courthouse burned to the ground , the jail remained intact . The court records concerning the case had been safely concealed in the home of the court clerk . Ford , who sat as Ogle County Circuit Judge at the time , reconvened court at a new location and the trial for the accused counterfeiters went on as planned .

 The jury , as was common in Ogle County at the time , had been infiltrated by one of the Banditti , who subsequently refused to convict the accused . The other jurors persuaded the rogue juror to convict by threatening to lynch him in the jury room if he failed to agree with the majority opinion . The Banditti juror capitulated and three of the accused were convicted . The convicts , however , soon escaped and avoided their sentences .

 In April , 1841 , the community of Oregon and Ogle County in general had reached a boiling point . During that month , a group of citizens , possibly acting under direct counsel from Ford , met at a schoolhouse in White Rock Township and formed an organization aimed at driving the outlaws out of the county . Membership in the new group grew quickly , soon numbering in the hundreds , and copycat chapters sprang up all over the Rock River Valley . These bands of citizen vigilantes were most often known as " Regulators " . Other names included , " lynching clubs " , and in Lee County one group was known as the " Associations for the <unk> of the Cause of Justice " . 
 The Regulators in Ogle County began by whipping two horse thieves , one of whom joined the group after the incident . The first Ogle County Regulator captain , W.S. Wellington , stepped aside , after his grist mill was destroyed and his horse tortured and killed in April 1841 . The new captain , John Campbell , was a resident of White Rock Township . The local Banditti were the Driscoll family and members of the Driscoll Gang . At the head was John Driscoll , who had migrated from Ohio in 1835 with his four grown sons , William , David , Pierce and Taylor . The Driscoll 's lived on <unk> Creek in northeast Ogle County . Driscoll and his son Taylor had both been convicted of arson while they lived in Ohio . 
 Campbell 's ascension to the lead Regulator post was met with <unk> from the Driscoll camp . William Driscoll immediately sent Campbell a letter offering to kill him . Campbell responded in kind ; he assembled 200 Regulators , and marched to the Driscoll home . A small group of Banditti had gathered at the Driscoll homestead but seeing they were outnumbered they fled , only to return with the DeKalb County Sheriff and other authorities in tow . The Sheriff and his companions did not see the events as the outlaws had hoped ; they sided with the vigilantes , and the Driscolls promised to leave within twenty days . Instead of leaving , the Driscolls and the other Banditti held a meeting in which they determined that Campbell and his fellow Regulator , Phineas Chaney , had to be murdered . 
 = = = = Regulator trial and execution of Banditti by firing squad = = = = 
 Nearly three months later , on June 25 , 1841 , there was an attempt to kill Chaney . Two days passed , and on June 27 David Driscoll and his brother Taylor attacked Campbell at his farm . David fired the single , fatal shot . Campbell 's son , Martin , then 13 , fired at the Driscolls with a shotgun , but the weapon failed to go off . 
 The account that stated David and Taylor Driscoll were the gunmen came from Campbell 's wife . Despite this claim , hoofprints at the scene of the crime indicated that there had been an additional three horses there . It was these hoofprints that the Regulators followed back to the Driscoll home . Once there , accompanied by Ogle County Sheriff William T. Ward , the angry group confronted John Driscoll . After questioning by Ward and his accompanying mob , the sheriff was satisfied that John Driscoll was involved in Campbell 's murder and arrested him " on suspicion of being accessory to the murder " . While David and Taylor Driscoll , the gunmen , fled that fateful day , William and Pierce Driscoll were arrested by a group of Regulators from Rockford . 
 The regulator court was convened at " Stephenson 's Mill " in Washington Grove , Illinois , because of the courthouse fire in March , 1841 . The court was organized , witnesses gathered , and proceedings went forward . A crowd gathered at the mill , estimated to be as many as 500 . At this point , Ogle County Sheriff Ward appealed to have the Driscolls returned to his custody . E.S. Leland presided over the makeshift court as judge , a position he would later hold legitimately in Ottawa , Illinois . Leland directed those present who were Regulators to form a circle , 120 men initially stepped forward ; nine were dismissed as not being " real " Regulators . The 111 men remaining formed the " jury " . 
 On June 29 , 1841 , the vigilante trial began and William Driscoll admitted to telling his brother to kill Campbell , but only " in jest " . His father , John , denied vehemently that he had anything to do with the murder , though he did admit to stealing numerous horses . Pierce Driscoll was released from custody when no evidence was found linking him to the crime . At the trial 's end the guilty verdict was described as " almost unanimous " ; the Driscolls were immediately sentenced to be hanged on the spot . The Driscolls refused to be hanged and instead requested that they be shot . Before the execution was carried out , William Driscoll confessed to six murders ; John confessed to nothing . The Regulators then assembled a large firing squad and prepared to carry out the execution . The Regulators divided themselves into two separate squads , one for each man , of 55 and 56 riflemen . The line of 56 executioners shot first John Driscoll . William , by this time trembling , was gunned down next by the line of 55 Regulators . 
 The description in the 1909 Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois was somewhat more tame : 
 The lynching of the Driscolls did not spell the end of the Regulators , nor the Banditti , but it did serve to greatly decrease Banditti activity in Ogle County .

 Though the <unk> continued to plague areas of northern Illinois , they were largely eradicated from Ogle County , following the lynching of the Driscolls . However , both the Banditti and the Regulators continued to be active . In Winnebago County , in early July 1841 , the offices of the Rock River Express were ransacked , an early predecessor to the Rockford Register Star , the daily newspaper of Rockford , Illinois . The offices were likely trashed in response to a scathing editorial published by the Express speaking out against the vigilante action taken by the Regulators .

 Banditti crimes continued well into the 1840s . One of the most shocking incidents , outside of the murderous crimes of the Driscoll Gang , in Oregon , to be attributed to the Banditti , was the callous murder of Colonel George Davenport at his home on the grounds of Rock Island Arsenal . On July 4 , 1845 , Colonel Davenport was assaulted in his home by Banditti men who thought he had a fortune in his safe . Beaten and left for dead , he survived long enough to give a full description of the criminals before he died that night . Five men were charged with the murder of George Davenport , and all but one , who escaped before the trial , were hung for the murder . Three more men were charged with accessories to the murder . One man was sentenced to life in prison , but escaped and was killed three months later , one man served one year in prison , and the charges were dropped against the third man , who left the area . 
 = = = Lee County Banditti activity = = = 
 In Lee County , Illinois the Banditti were most active in the years 1843 @-@ 1850 , after the lynching in Oregon . During that period , crime and gang operations were rampant throughout the Mississippi Valley but Lee County , like its neighboring northern Illinois counties , saw consistent activity . Near the Lee County village of Franklin Grove , a brutal double @-@ murder was committed in 1848 . On May 20 , 1848 , area resident Joshua Wingert , while searching through the grove two miles ( 3 km ) west of town for his cattle , came upon a small log hut . Inside he discovered the bodies of two men , killed with their own axe . One of the men was nearly decapitated and the other had a large gash across his forehead . The assumed motive was robbery , as the hut was ransacked and bloody fingerprints were all about the small building . The Banditti perpetrator or perpetrators were never apprehended . 
 Also , in Lee County , the Banditti were active in and around Inlet Grove . In June 1844 the group carried out a daring robbery of a Mr. Haskell . Haskell 's residence was robbed by masked men in the midst of a summer thunderstorm . The perpetrators entered Haskell 's bedroom while he and his wife were asleep . The robbers dragged a trunk of money out from underneath the sleeping Haskell 's bed undetected , much of the noise they made probably drowned out by thunder . The <unk> did not discover they had been the victims of a robbery until the next morning .

 = New Jersey Route 23 = 
 Route 23 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States . The route runs 52 @.@ 63 mi ( 84 @.@ 70 km ) from County Route 506 ( Bloomfield Avenue ) and County Route 577 ( Prospect Avenue ) in Verona , Essex County northwest to the border with New York at Montague Township in Sussex County , where the road continues to Port Jervis , New York as Orange County Route 15 . Route 23 heads through Essex and Passaic Counties as a suburban arterial varying from two to four lanes and becomes a six @-@ lane freeway north of a complex interchange with U.S. Route 46 and Interstate 80 in Wayne . The freeway carries Route 23 north to a concurrency with U.S. Route 202 . Past the freeway portion , the route heads northwest along the border of Morris and Passaic Counties as a four- to six @-@ lane divided highway with a wide median at places , winding through mountainous areas and crossing Interstate 287 in Riverdale . The route continues northwest through Sussex County as a mostly two @-@ lane , undivided road that passes through farmland and woodland as well as the communities of Franklin , Hamburg , and Sussex before reaching the New York border just south of an interchange with Interstate 84 near High Point State Park . 
 Route 23 was established in 1927 to run from Verona to the New York border near Port Jervis , replacing pre @-@ 1927 Route 8 between Verona and Sussex . The route followed two turnpikes that were created in the early 19th century : the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike and the Paterson @-@ Hamburg Turnpike . In the mid @-@ 1950s , there were plans to build an Interstate Highway along Route 23 between Interstate 80 and Interstate 287 , but it was never built . In the 1960s , the route was planned to be upgraded to a freeway all the way up to Port Jervis and south to Piscataway , Middlesex County ; however , both freeway proposals were cancelled in the early 1970s . In the mid @-@ 1980s , the portion of Route 23 from north of U.S. Route 46 in Wayne to Interstate 287 in Riverdale was improved , with the road upgraded to a six @-@ lane freeway south of the Alps Road intersection and to a six @-@ lane surface road north of Alps Road .

 = = = Essex County = = = 
 Route 23 begins at an intersection with County Route 506 ( Bloomfield Avenue ) and County Route 577 ( Prospect Avenue ) in Verona , heading to the north through residences and some businesses along four @-@ lane , undivided Pompton Avenue . After a short distance , the road forms the border between Cedar Grove to the west and Verona to the east before fully enters Cedar Grove . In Cedar Grove , the route narrows to two lanes at the County Route 640 before widening to four lanes again at the County Route 639 intersection . Shortly before leaving Cedar Grove , Route 23 crosses County Route 604 ( Lindsley Road ) , which also heads to the west as County Route 527 . 
 = = = Passaic and Morris Counties = = = 
 The road crosses into Little Falls , Passaic County , where it narrows to two lanes and becomes the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike . In Little Falls , Route 23 heads through the central part of the community before crossing the Passaic River into Wayne where the road leaves the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike briefly and widens to a four lane divided highway . Route 23 passes two shopping malls , Willowbrook Mall and Wayne Towne Center , and enters the " Spaghetti Bowl " interchange with U.S. Route 46 and Interstate 80 . 
 North of Interstate 80 , the road rejoins the route of the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike and becomes a six @-@ lane freeway , featuring a cloverleaf interchange with West Belt Road that provides access to the Wayne Route 23 Transit Center . Route 23 continues north with frontage roads serving businesses , coming to an interchange with U.S. Route 202 and County Route 511 Alternate , forming a concurrency with U.S. Route 202 . The road interchanges with County Route 670 ( Alps Road ) and then with County Route 683 , where the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike again leaves Route 23 and U.S. Route 202 , which continue north from this point as a surface road through commercial areas . At a U @-@ turn ramp , the eastbound direction of County Route 504 follows both directions of the road , having to use the ramp in order to continue across the road . Northbound U.S. Route 202 splits from Route 23 , where the cut @-@ off intersection with County Route 504 is located . At this point , the westbound direction of County Route 504 and the southbound direction of U.S. Route 202 follow southbound Route 23 until an intersection . 
 Route 23 crosses into Pequannock Township in Morris County and passes over the Pompton River . In Pequannock , the road is a six @-@ lane divided highway with at @-@ grade intersections , some controlled by jughandles , that heads through a mix of businesses and woodland . At the north end of Pequannock , it intersects County Route 660 , where the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike rejoins Route 23 . The route intersects County Route 511 Alternate ( Boulevard ) and crosses into Riverdale , with County Route 511 Alternate following Route 23 until it heads to the north on the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike . Route 23 interchanges with Interstate 287 and climbs a hill past the interchange , heading to the west . The route runs through Kinnelon before entering Butler . In Butler , Route 23 passes through commercial areas , crossing County Route 511 ( Boonton Avenue ) before heading northwest . The road drops to four lanes , still divided by a Jersey barrier . It heads under Maple Lake Road before passing through Kinnelon again . Upon leaving Kinnelon , the route enters West Milford in Passaic County at the crossing of the Pequannock River . At this point , the route enters a more wooded , mountainous setting , following the Pequannock River . 
 Route 23 joins the Hamburg Turnpike and the road splits , with the southbound lanes crossing over the Pequannock River into Kinnelon for a time . The route passes by the <unk> Reservoir , a reservoir for the Newark public water supply , and has a rest area in the northbound direction . Route 23 intersects County Route 513 ( Union Valley Road ) , running concurrent with that route . The southbound lanes cross the Pequannock River into Jefferson Township , Morris County and County Route 513 splits from Route 23 by heading south on Green Pond Road . The southbound lanes cross back into West Milford , where the two separate roads rejoin . The infamous Clinton Road leaves at a traffic light from the northbound lanes and the route passes by some residences past Clinton Road . Route 23 continues northwest through forested areas , passing by the Oak Ridge Reservoir , another reservoir that provides water for Newark . The route crosses the Pequannock River three times , running within Jefferson Township between the first two crossings and past the third crossing . 
 = = = Sussex County = = = 
 Route 23 enters Hardyston Township , Sussex County and comes to an intersection with County Route 515 ( Stockholm @-@ Vernon Road ) . Past this intersection , the divided Hamburg Turnpike highway ends and Route 23 becomes a two @-@ lane , undivided road . The road heads to the northwest through wooded mountains and turns west on a winding road with a wide painted median , crossing into Franklin and meeting County Route 517 ( <unk> Road ) . County Route 517 heads north along with Route 23 , with the wide median ending , and the road continues through residential and commercial areas of Franklin with a brief wide painted median near the County Route 631 ( Franklin Avenue ) intersection . The road crosses a stream , Mill Brook , into Hamburg , where County Route 517 splits from Route 23 by heading east on Quarry Road . Route 23 continues north through wooded residential areas of Hamburg , crossing Route 94 . The route crosses back into Hardyston Township , heading north through a mix of farms and forests . 
 Route 23 crosses the Wallkill River into Wantage Township and continues north to an intersection with County Route 565 ( Glenwood Road ) , running concurrent with that route and gaining a wide painted median past that intersection which eventually turns into a center left @-@ turn lane . The road passes some businesses and becomes a two @-@ lane divided highway before County Route 565 departs from Route 23 by heading west on Lewisburg Road . Route 23 crosses into Sussex , where the route becomes Hamburg Avenue and turns into an undivided highway again , passing by residences . The route intersects Route 284 ( E. Main Street ) before turning left onto Loomis Avenue , where County Route 643 continues north on Main Street . Immediately after turning onto Loomis Avenue , County Route 639 continues west on Loomis Avenue and Route 23 heads north on Mill Street . The route becomes Clove Avenue before crossing back into Wantage Township . 
 In Wantage Township , Route 23 continues north through farmland and woodland , eventually turning west . It comes to an intersection with County Route 519 ( Colesville @-@ <unk> Road ) and turns north , running concurrent with that route through forested areas until County Route 519 heads north on Greenville Road . Route 23 continues northwest and heads across Kittatinny Mountain , crossing the Appalachian Trail and entering Montague Township , Here , the road heads into heavily forested High Point State Park , which is home to the highest elevation in New Jersey . The route descends through Montague Township along a winding road , passing by some businesses immediately before heading to the New York state line . Route 23 officially ends at the state line and the road continues into Orange County , New York as County Route 15 ( <unk> Road ) for less than one @-@ half mile . A few feet after the state line , County Route 15 comes to an interchange with Interstate 84 before it ends at an intersection with U.S. Route 6 in Port Jervis . Although Interstate 84 does not enter New Jersey , missing it by only a few feet , the signs on it for the interchange with County Route 15 refer to Route 23 , even though some signs erroneously refer to it as New York State Route 23 . 
 = = History = = 
 Route 23 uses part of two 19th @-@ century roads , the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike , which was built between 1806 and 1811 , and the Paterson @-@ Hamburg Turnpike , which was incorporated in 1806 . Due to realignments , the current alignment of Route 23 bypasses the intersection of these two turnpikes . In the original system of New Jersey highways , the Newark @-@ Pompton Turnpike and Paterson @-@ Hamburg Turnpike were combined to form pre @-@ 1927 Route 8 , which ran from Montclair to the New York border near Unionville , New York , running along the alignment of current Route 23 north to Sussex and following present @-@ day Route 284 north of Sussex . In the 1927 New Jersey State Highway renumbering , Route 23 was designated to run from Route 9 ( now County Route 506 ) in Verona north to the New York border near Port Jervis , replacing pre @-@ 1927 Route 8 from Verona to Sussex . 
 In the 1955 plan for the Interstate Highway System , an Interstate Highway was planned along the Route 23 corridor between Interstate 80 in Wayne and Interstate 287 in Pompton Plains , also connecting to a proposed Interstate along the Route 3 corridor . However , this proposed Interstate was never built . Plans were made in the early 1960s for a Route 23 freeway running from Interstate 80 north to Interstate 84 in Port Jervis , New York , providing improved freeway access to northwestern New Jersey . This proposed freeway , which was to cost $ 120 million , was cancelled in the early 1970s due to financial troubles and feared environmental issues . A 1966 proposal called for Route 23 to be extended south as a freeway to Interstate 287 in Piscataway in Middlesex County , running parallel to the Garden State Parkway . This $ 300 million freeway was added to planning maps in 1969 as Route 807 but was also cancelled in the early 1970s . 
 In the late 1970s , the New Jersey Department of Transportation made plans to rebuild the section of Route 23 , at the time a four @-@ lane undivided road , between Interstate 80 and Interstate 287 to a six @-@ lane freeway between Interstate 80 and Alps Road and a six @-@ lane surface road north of Alps Road . Construction on these improvements began in 1983 and were completed in 1986 . With these improvements to the route , many traffic circles were removed , including one at U.S. Route 46 that was replaced with a complex interchange . In 2008 , the " Spaghetti Bowl " interchange with Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 46 was improved , costing $ 70 million . 
 In 2010 , the New Jersey Department of Transportation began plans to move Route 23 to a new alignment through Sussex . With this project , the current bridge over the Papakating Creek is to be replaced and a new road for the southbound lanes is planned to be built , while the current Route 23 will become northbound only . The project is planned to last from July 2012 to November 2014 .

 In the opening scene , young children tell their versions of the invasion . They draw pictures of their families , kids with harnesses and the alien airships . Tom Mason 's ( Noah Wyle ) son , Matt , tells Anne Glass ( Moon Bloodgood ) that his mother died during the attacks and his older brother , Ben , was kidnapped . He then shows her a picture of his father and oldest brother , Hal ( Drew Roy ) . Matt informs Anne that they are fighting . In a dark street , Tom and Hal look for food . They grab a food kart , but are ambushed by robotic aliens , known as " Mechs " , which destroy the food . As Tom and Hal run away , soldiers fire guns at the aliens behind barricades . The aliens destroy the barricade and kill the soldiers . Tom and Hal hide in an empty store . They exit , finding Captain Weaver ( Will Patton ) and other soldiers armed with guns . An airship flies overhead and fires , causing a bright light to consume the atmosphere around them . The group runs away back to their base . 
 Upon arrival , Tom sees his son Matt asleep and picks him up . He talks to his friend , Anne who tells him about his son 's drawings . Tom is then called by Col. Porter ( Dale Dye ) for a meeting . There , Porter discusses his plan to leave the city and break off into groups . The alien air ships can detect groups of humans over 600 persons so he splits his brigade into smaller groups consisting of 100 fighters and 200 civilians . He puts Weaver in charge of the 2nd Mass and Tom as his second @-@ in @-@ command . 
 The following day , the fighters and civilians begin to move . They search for food in stores but find none . Weaver tells Tom that they can 't go back looking for more food as the numbers are too large . Tom volunteers to go back . Weaver gives him six fighters and a pickup truck . Hal , Karen , Dai , Anthony , Click and Jimmy join Tom in the hunt for food . Hal and Karen leave the group to search for aliens . Hal sees Mechs and harnessed kids with them . It is there that he sees his brother , Ben . He immediately returns to tell his father . They are both overjoyed , yet Tom insists that they stick with the mission at hand . Hal disagrees and tries to go and find his brother . Tom wrestles him to the ground and convinces him to do the job the " right way " . 
 The group finds a supply store with food and scout the area for aliens . Finding none , they load the food into the truck . Hal is attacked by a Skitter . Tom fires at it and his son runs away . A Mech is alerted and comes after Tom . Hal stops it by firing at it . It then runs after Hal . Tom puts C @-@ 4 in a shopping cart and wheels it next to the Mech , killing it . The Skitter comes after Tom , but Dai shoots it . The alien dies slowly after its gun wound and the group observes it before it dies . 
 The six fighters return and Tom informs Weaver of their success . He then tells Weaver that he and Hal must go looking for Ben . Weaver declines and says they must raid the armory for weapons . Tom tells him after that , they will go and find him . Before the 2nd Mass leave the city , Hal gives his brother his birthday gift . The children of the 2nd Mass play with it as the adults watch . Weaver tells Tom it is time to leave and they all move out on foot .

 Development officially began in 2009 , when TNT announced that it had ordered to pilot an untitled alien invasion project . Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat , who is best known for writing the Oscar @-@ winning film Saving Private Ryan , which was directed by Steven Spielberg . Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co @-@ conceived by Spielberg . Originally , Falling Skies was called Concord , referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason 's profession as a former History Professor . Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies . " I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [ spin on the ] spirit of ' 76 . I came up — out of the blue one day — with the name Falling Skies , which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion . What is unique about this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world , " he stated . Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival . " I 've always been interested in how we survive and how resourceful we are as Americans . How would the survivors feed the children ? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost ? " he added . Like much of Spielberg 's work , such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra @-@ Terrestrial , Falling Skies ' running theme is family and brotherhood . He explained , " It 's a theme I harken back to a lot because it 's something I believe in . It 's something I have the closest experience with . [ Laughs ] They say write what you know , and with seven children and three sisters ... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories . " 
 While writing the pilot , Rodat dedicated a five @-@ page montage to the alien invasion , but decided not to go through with it as it had been done before in films such as War of the Worlds . " I wrote a few drafts of it and I looked at and say , ' Ay @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , I ’ ve seen this before . There ’ s no emotion to this . It feels like one of those montages , ' " he said . Rodat came up with the idea of having the children in the series " harnessed by aliens " . " When we were working out the initial stuff , the thing that excited [ Spielberg ] was the idea that adults are killed if they ’ re a threat , and kids are captured for whatever reason and changed or altered . The harness was a logical outgrowth of that . Then what we ’ ll explore is what the harnessing does to the kid over the course of the show but that also is something that ’ s going to have to unveil itself gradually , " he stated . Spielberg previously explored the idea of enslaved children in the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom . 
 Series lead Noah Wyle emphasized Spielberg 's presence on set by stating " Anytime he gives an anointment to a project , it steps up the pedigree . " Colin Cunningham , who plays outlaw John Pope , exclaimed " You ’ d show up and think , ‘ This is not a TV show ; this is something else that we ’ re doing , ’ " he said , noting that Spielberg was very hands @-@ on for the pilot . " Its scope is massive . Anytime you hear the word Spielberg , you know it ’ s not going to be crap ; you know it ’ ll be quality and there will be some money behind it . " Mark Verheiden , who was the showrunner for the first season , stated " It ’ s great to know you have a world @-@ class filmmaker backing up what you ’ re trying to do who is supportive and helping design the great stuff . " 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 Casting announcements began in June 2009 when Noah Wyle was announced as the lead . Wyle , who worked with TNT on the The Librarian films , was sent scripts for various shows on their network . He said part of the reason he chose the part was to gain credibility from his children . " With the birth of my kids , I started to really look at my career through their eyes more than my own , so that does dictate choice , steering me toward certain things and away from other things , " he said . He also decided to do it as he could relate with his character , stating " I identified with Tom 's devotion to his sons , and admired his sense of social duty . " Spielberg wanted Wyle for the role because he knew him from his previous series ER , which Spielberg 's company produced . He had wanted Wyle to appear in his 1998 film Saving Private Ryan but due to scheduling conflicts , he was unable to star . Spielberg stated that he was determined to work with him again . In July 2009 , Moon Bloodgood , Jessy Schram , Seychelle Gabriel and Maxim Knight were cast as Anne Glass , Karen Nadler , Lourdes and Matt Mason , respectively . Bloodgood , the female lead , did not have to audition for the role . She received the script and was offered the role . Bloodgood was drawn to the role because of Spielberg and Rodat 's involvement . She stated : " Well certainly when you get handed a script and they tell you it ’ s Bob Rodat and Steven Spielberg , you ’ re immediately drawn to it . It ’ s got your attention . I was a little cautious about wanting to do science fiction again . But it was more of a drama story , more of a family story . I liked that and I wanted to work with Spielberg .

 = Pickett 's Charge = 
 Pickett 's Charge was an infantry assault ordered by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee against Maj. Gen. George G. Meade 's Union positions on Cemetery Ridge on July 3 , 1863 , the last day of the Battle of Gettysburg in the state of Pennsylvania during the American Civil War . Its futility was predicted by the charge 's commander , Lt. Gen. James Longstreet , and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the Southern war effort never fully recovered militarily or psychologically . The farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the high @-@ water mark of the Confederacy . 
 The charge is named after Maj. Gen. George Pickett , one of three Confederate generals who led the assault under Longstreet . 
 After Confederate attacks on both Union flanks had failed the day and night before , Lee was determined to strike the Union center on the third day . On the night of July 2 , Meade correctly predicted at a council of war that Lee would try an attack on his lines in the center the following morning . 
 The infantry assault was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment that was meant to soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery , but was largely ineffective . Approximately 12 @,@ 500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three @-@ quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire . Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders , they could not maintain their hold and were repulsed with over 50 % casualties , a decisive defeat that ended the three @-@ day battle and Lee 's campaign into Pennsylvania . Years later , when asked why his charge at Gettysburg failed , Pickett replied : " I 've always thought the Yankees had something to do with it . "

 Pickett 's charge was planned for three Confederate divisions , commanded by Maj. Gen. George Pickett , Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew , and Maj. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble , consisting of troops from Lt. Gen. James Longstreet 's First Corps and Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill 's Third Corps . Pettigrew commanded brigades from Maj. Gen. Henry Heth 's old division , under Col. Birkett D. Fry ( Archer 's Brigade ) , Col. James K. Marshall ( Pettigrew 's Brigade ) , Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Davis , and Col. John M. Brockenbrough . Trimble , commanding Maj. Gen. Dorsey Pender 's division , had the brigades of Brig. Gens . Alfred M. Scales ( temporarily commanded by Col. William Lee J. Lowrance ) and James H. Lane . Two brigades from Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson 's division ( Hill 's Corps ) were to support the attack on the right flank : Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox and Col. David Lang ( Perry 's brigade ) . 
 The target of the Confederate assault was the center of the Union Army of the Potomac 's II Corps , commanded by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock . Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon with the brigades of Brig. Gen. William Harrow , Col. Norman J. Hall , and Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb . ( On the night of July 2 , Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a council of war that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon 's sector the following morning . ) To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. Alexander Hays , and to the south was Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday 's division of the I Corps , including the 2nd Vermont Brigade of Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard and the 121st Pennsylvania under the command of Col. Chapman Biddle . Meade 's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line , in the small house owned by the widow Lydia <unk> . 
 The specific objective of the assault has been the source of historical controversy . Traditionally , the " copse of trees " on Cemetery Ridge has been cited as the visual landmark for the attacking force . Historical treatments such as the 1993 film Gettysburg continue to popularize this view , which originated in the work of Gettysburg Battlefield historian John B. Bachelder in the 1880s . However , recent scholarship , including published works by some Gettysburg National Military Park historians , has suggested that Lee 's goal was actually Ziegler 's Grove on Cemetery Hill , a more prominent and highly visible grouping of trees about 300 yards ( 274 m ) north of the copse . The much @-@ debated theory suggests that Lee 's general plan for the second @-@ day attacks ( the seizure of Cemetery Hill ) had not changed on the third day , and the attacks on July 3 were also aimed at securing the hill and the network of roads it commanded . The copse of trees , currently a prominent landmark , was under ten feet ( 3 m ) high in 1863 , only visible to a portion of the attacking columns from certain parts of the battlefield . 
 From the beginning of the planning , things went awry for the Confederates . While Pickett 's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg , A.P. Hill 's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge . Some of Hill 's corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2 . However , troops that had done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge . 
 Although the assault is known to popular history as Pickett 's Charge , overall command was given to James Longstreet , and Pickett was one of his divisional commanders . Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett 's fresh division should lead the assault , so the name is appropriate , although some recent historians have used the name Pickett @-@ Pettigrew @-@ Trimble Assault ( or , less frequently , Longstreet 's Assault ) to more fairly distribute the credit ( or blame ) . With Hill sidelined , Pettigrew 's and Trimble 's divisions were delegated to Longstreet 's authority as well . Thus , Pickett 's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout . Pickett 's men were almost exclusively from Virginia , with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina , Mississippi , Alabama , and Tennessee . The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida . 
 In conjunction with the infantry assault , Lee planned a cavalry action in the Union rear . Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart led his cavalry division to the east , prepared to exploit Lee 's hoped @-@ for breakthrough by attacking the Union rear and disrupting its line of communications ( and retreat ) along the Baltimore Pike . 
 Despite Lee 's hope for an early start , it took all morning to arrange the infantry assault force . Neither Lee 's nor Longstreet 's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight . Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet , describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee 's verbal order or a mistake . Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet 's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee 's plan for the battle . 
 Meanwhile , on the far right end of the Union line , a seven @-@ hour battle raged for the control of Culp 's Hill . Lee 's intent was to synchronize his offensive across the battlefield , keeping Meade from concentrating his numerically superior force , but the assaults were poorly coordinated and Maj. Gen. Edward " Allegheny " Johnson 's attacks against Culp 's Hill petered out just as Longstreet 's cannonade began . 
 = = Artillery barrage = = 
 The infantry charge was preceded by what Lee hoped would be a powerful and well @-@ concentrated cannonade of the Union center , destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry . But a combination of inept artillery leadership and defective equipment doomed the barrage from the beginning . Longstreet 's corps artillery chief , Col. Edward Porter Alexander , had effective command of the field ; Lee 's artillery chief , Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton , played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps . Despite Alexander 's efforts , then , there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective . 
 The July 3 bombardment was likely the largest of the war , with hundreds of cannons from both sides firing along the lines for one to two hours , starting around 1 p.m. Confederate guns numbered between 150 and 170 and fired from a line over two miles ( 3 km ) long , starting in the south at the Peach Orchard and running roughly parallel to the Emmitsburg Road . Confederate Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law wrote , " The cannonade in the center ... presented one of the most magnificent battle @-@ scenes witnessed during the war . Looking up the valley towards Gettysburg , the hills on either side were capped with crowns of flame and smoke , as 300 guns , about equally divided between the two ridges , vomited their iron hail upon each other . " 
 Despite its ferocity , the fire was mostly ineffectual . Confederate shells often overshot the infantry front lines — in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation — and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners . Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter @-@ battery fire ; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement . He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition , but to fool Alexander , Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly to create the illusion that they were being destroyed one by one . By the time all of Hunt 's cannons ceased fire , and still blinded by the smoke from battle , Alexander fell for Hunt 's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed . Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock , who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander 's bombardment . Even Meade was affected by the artillery — the <unk> house was a victim of frequent <unk> , and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill . 
 The day was hot , 87 ° F ( 31 ° C ) by one account and humid , and the Confederates suffered under the hot sun and from the Union counter @-@ battery fire as they awaited the order to advance . When Union cannoneers overshot their targets , they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of Seminary Ridge or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander 's guns , causing significant casualties before the charge began . 
 Longstreet had opposed the charge from the beginning , convinced the charge would fail ( which ultimately proved true ) , and had his own plan that he would have preferred for a strategic movement around the Union left flank . He claimed to have told Lee : 
 General , I have been a soldier all my life . I have been with soldiers engaged in fights by couples , by squads , companies , regiments , divisions , and armies , and should know , as well as any one , what soldiers can do . It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever arrayed for battle can take that position . 
 Longstreet wanted to avoid personally ordering the charge by attempting to pass the mantle onto young Colonel Alexander , telling him that he should inform Pickett at the optimum time to begin the advance , based on his assessment that the Union artillery had been effectively silenced . Although he had insufficient information to accomplish this , Alexander eventually notified Pickett that he was running dangerously short of ammunition , sending the message " If you are coming at all , come at once , or I cannot give you proper support , but the enemy 's fire has not slackened at all . At least eighteen guns are still firing from the cemetery itself . " Pickett asked Longstreet , " General , shall I advance ? " Longstreet 's memoir recalled " The effort to speak the order failed , and I could only indicate it by an affirmative bow . " 
 Longstreet made one final attempt to call off the assault . After his encounter with Pickett , he discussed the artillery situation with Porter and was informed that Porter did not have full confidence that all the enemy 's guns were silenced and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted . Longstreet ordered Porter to stop Pickett , but the young colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear would take over an hour , and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them . The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned . 
 = = Infantry assault = = 
 The entire force that stepped off toward the Union positions at about 2 p.m. consisted of about 12 @,@ 500 men . Although the attack is popularly called a " charge " , the men marched deliberately in line , to speed up and then charge only when they were within a few hundred yards of the enemy . The line consisted of Pettigrew and Trimble on the left , and Pickett to the right . The nine brigades of men stretched over a mile @-@ long ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) front . The Confederates encountered heavy artillery fire while advancing nearly three quarters of a mile across open fields to reach the Union line and were slowed by fences in their path . Initially sloping down , the terrain changed to a gentle upward incline approximately midway between the lines . These obstacles played a large role in the increasing number of casualties the advancing Confederates faced . The ground between Seminary Ridge and Cemetery Ridge is slightly undulating , and the advancing troops periodically disappeared from the view of the Union cannoneers . As the three Confederate divisions advanced , awaiting Union soldiers began shouting " Fredericksburg ! Fredericksburg ! Fredericksburg ! " in reference to the disastrous Union advance on the Confederate line during the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg . Fire from Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery 's concealed artillery positions north of Little Round Top raked the Confederate right flank , while the artillery fire from Cemetery Hill hit the left . Shell and solid shot in the beginning turned to canister and musket fire as the Confederates came within 400 yards of the Union line . The mile @-@ long front shrank to less than half a mile ( 800 m ) as the men filled in gaps that appeared throughout the line and followed the natural tendency to move away from the flanking fire . 
 On the left flank of the attack , Brockenbrough 's brigade was devastated by artillery fire from Cemetery Hill . They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the 8th Ohio Infantry regiment . The 160 Ohioans , firing from a single line , so surprised Brockenbrough 's Virginians — already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire — that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge , crashing through Trimble 's division and causing many of his men to bolt as well . The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis 's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians , which was now the left flank of Pettigrew 's division . The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill . More than 1 @,@ 600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew 's men during the assault . This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road . By this time , the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays ' division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall , with every rifleman of the division lined up as many as four deep , exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload . 
 Trimble 's division of two brigades followed Pettigrew 's , but made poor progress . Confusing orders from Trimble caused Lane to send only 3 ½ of his North Carolina regiments forward . Renewed fire from the 8th Ohio and the onslaught of Hays 's riflemen prevented most of these men from getting past the Emmitsburg Road . Scales 's North Carolina brigade , led by Col. William L. J. Lowrance , started with a heavier disadvantage — they had lost almost two @-@ thirds of their men on July 1 . They were also driven back and Lowrance was wounded . The Union defenders also took casualties , but Hays encouraged his men by riding back and forth just behind the battle line , shouting " Hurrah ! Boys , we 're giving them hell ! " . Two horses were shot out from under him . Historian Stephen W. Sears calls Hays 's performance " inspiring " . 
 On the right flank , Pickett 's Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg road and wheeled partially to their left to face northeast . They marched in two lines , led by the brigades of Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper on the right and Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett on the left ; Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead 's brigade followed closely behind . As the division wheeled to the left , its right flank was exposed to McGilvery 's guns and the front of Doubleday 's Union division on Cemetery Ridge . Stannard 's Vermont Brigade marched forward , faced north , and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper 's brigade . At about this time , Hancock , who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment , was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle , entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail . He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled . 
 As Pickett 's men advanced , they withstood the defensive fire of first Stannard 's brigade , then Harrow 's , and then Hall 's , before approaching a minor salient in the Union center , a low stone wall taking an 80 @-@ yard right @-@ angle turn known afterward as " The Angle . " It was defended by Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb 's Philadelphia Brigade . Webb placed the two remaining guns of ( the severely wounded ) Lt. Alonzo Cushing 's Battery A , 4th U.S. Artillery , at the front of his line at the stone fence , with the 69th and 71st Pennsylvania regiments of his brigade to defend the fence and the guns . The two guns and 940 men could not match the massive firepower that Hays 's division , to their right , had been able to unleash . 
 Two gaps opened up in the Union line : the commander of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle ; south of the copse of trees , the men of the 59th New York ( Hall 's brigade ) inexplicably bolted for the rear . In the latter case , this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent Artillery Battery to face the oncoming infantry . Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt , Cowan ordered five guns to fire double canister simultaneously . The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared . The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania , however , was more serious , leaving only a handful of the 71st , 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania , and Cushing 's two 3 @-@ inch rifled guns to receive the 2 @,@ 500 to 3 @,@ 000 men of Garnett 's and Armistead 's brigades as they began to cross the stone fence . The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a melee of rifle fire , bayonets , and fists . Webb , mortified that the 71st had retreated , attempted to bring the 72nd Pennsylvania ( a Zouave regiment ) forward , but for some reason they did not obey the order , so he had to bring other regiments in to help fill the gap . During the fight , Lt. Cushing was killed as he shouted to his men , three bullets striking him , the third in his mouth . The Confederates seized his two guns and turned them to face the Union troops , but they had no ammunition to fire . As more Union reinforcements arrived and charged into the breach , the defensive line became impregnable and the Confederates began to slip away individually , with no senior officers remaining to call a formal retreat . 
 The infantry assault lasted less than an hour . The supporting attack by Wilcox and Lang on Pickett 's right was never a factor ; they did not approach the Union line until after Pickett was defeated , and their advance was quickly broken up by McGilvery 's guns and by the Vermont Brigade . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While the Union lost about 1 @,@ 500 killed and wounded , the Confederate casualty rate was over 50 % . Pickett 's division suffered 2 @,@ 655 casualties ( 498 killed , 643 wounded , 833 wounded and captured , and 681 captured , unwounded ) . Pettigrew 's losses are estimated to be about 2 @,@ 700 ( 470 killed , 1 @,@ 893 wounded , 337 captured ) . Trimble 's two brigades lost 885 ( 155 killed , 650 wounded , and 80 captured ) . Wilcox 's brigade reported losses of 200 , Lang 's about 400 . Thus , total losses during the attack were 6 @,@ 555 , of which at least 1 @,@ 123 Confederates were killed on the battlefield , 4 @,@ 019 were wounded , and a good number of the injured were also captured . Confederate prisoner totals are difficult to estimate from their reports ; Union reports indicated that 3 @,@ 750 men were captured . 
 The casualties were also high among the commanders of the charge . Trimble and Pettigrew were the most senior casualties of the day ; Trimble lost a leg , and Pettigrew received a minor wound to the hand ( only to die from a bullet to the abdomen suffered in a minor skirmish during the retreat to Virginia ) . In Pickett 's division , 26 of the 40 field grade officers ( majors , lieutenant colonels , and colonels ) were casualties — 12 killed or mortally wounded , nine wounded , four wounded and captured , and one captured . All of his brigade commanders fell : Kemper was wounded seriously , captured by Union soldiers , rescued , and then captured again during the retreat to Virginia ; Garnett and Armistead were killed . Garnett had a previous leg injury and rode his horse during the charge , despite knowing that conspicuously riding a horse into heavy enemy fire would mean almost certain death . Armistead , known for leading his brigade with his cap on the tip of his sword , made the farthest progress through the Union lines . He was mortally wounded , falling near " The Angle " at what is now called the High Water Mark of the Confederacy . Ironically , the Union troops that fatally wounded Armistead were under the command of his old friend , Winfield S. Hancock , who was himself severely wounded in the battle . Per his dying wishes , Longstreet delivered Armistead 's Bible and other personal effects to Hancock 's wife , Almira . Of the 15 regimental commanders in Pickett 's division , the Virginia Military Institute produced 11 and all were casualties — six killed , five wounded . 
 Stuart 's cavalry action in indirect support of the infantry assault was unsuccessful . He was met and stopped by Union cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. David McM . Gregg about three miles ( 5 km ) to the east , in East Cavalry Field . 
 As soldiers straggled back to the Confederate lines along Seminary Ridge , Lee feared a Union counteroffensive and tried to rally his center , telling returning soldiers and Wilcox that the failure was " all my fault . " Pickett was inconsolable for the rest of the day and never forgave Lee for ordering the charge . When Lee told Pickett to rally his division for the defense , Pickett allegedly replied , " General , I have no division . " 
 The Union counteroffensive never came ; the Army of the Potomac was exhausted and nearly as damaged at the end of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia . Meade was content to hold the field . On July 4 , the armies observed an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded . Meanwhile , Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of the Vicksburg garrison along the Mississippi River , splitting the Confederacy in two . These two Union victories are generally considered the turning point of the Civil War . 
 History may never know the true story of Lee 's intentions at Gettysburg . He never published memoirs , and his after @-@ action report from the battle was cursory . Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports . Pickett 's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it , and no copy has been found . 
 The controversy over Lee 's plans and his officers ' implementation of them have led historians to question whether the charge could have succeeded if done differently . One study used a Lanchester model to examine several alternative scenarios and their outcomes . The results suggest that Lee could have captured a foothold on Cemetery Ridge if he had committed several more infantry brigades to the charge ; but this likely would have left him with insufficient reserves to hold or exploit the position . 
 Virginian newspapers praised Pickett 's Virginia division as making the most progress during the charge , and the papers used Pickett 's comparative success as a means of criticizing the actions of the other states ' troops during the charge . It was this publicity that played a significant factor in selecting the name Pickett 's Charge . Pickett 's military career was never the same after the charge , and he was displeased about having his name attached to the repulsed charge . In particular North Carolinians have long taken exception to the characterizations and point to the poor performance of Brockenbrough 's Virginians in the advance as a major causative factor of failure . Some historians have questioned the primacy of Pickett 's role in the battle . W. R. Bond wrote in 1888 , " No body of troops during the last war made as much reputation on so little fighting . " 
 Additional controversy developed after the battle about Pickett 's personal location during the charge . The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and , by implication , his personal courage . The 1993 film Gettysburg depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road , but there is no historical evidence to confirm this . It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would " lead from the rear " , while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front , and while this was often violated , there was nothing for Pickett to be ashamed of if he coordinated his forces from behind . 
 Pickett 's Charge became one of the iconic symbols of the literary and cultural movement known as the Lost Cause . William Faulkner , the quintessential Southern novelist , summed up the picture in Southern memory of this gallant but futile episode : 
 For every Southern boy fourteen years old , not once but whenever he wants it , there is the instant when it 's still not yet two o 'clock on that July afternoon in 1863 , the brigades are in position behind the rail fence , the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreet to give the word and it 's all in the balance , it hasn 't happened yet , it hasn 't even begun yet , it not only hasn 't begun yet but there is still time for it not to begin against that position and those circumstances which made more men than Garnett and Kemper and Armistead and Wilcox look grave yet it 's going to begin , we all know that , we have come too far with too much at stake and that moment doesn 't need even a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old boy to think This time . Maybe this time with all this much to lose than all this much to gain : Pennsylvania , Maryland , the world , the golden dome of Washington itself to crown with desperate and unbelievable victory the desperate gamble , the cast made two years ago .

 The site of Pickett 's Charge is one of the best @-@ maintained portions of the Gettysburg Battlefield . Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park , very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett 's division . The National Park Service maintains a neat , mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue ( Seminary Ridge ) due east to the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of the Copse of Trees . Pickett 's division , however , started considerably south of that point , near the Spangler farm , and wheeled to the north after crossing the road . In fact , the Park Service pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet 's assault — Trimble 's division advanced north of the current path , while Pickett 's division moved from farther south . 
 A cyclorama painting by the French artist Paul Philippoteaux entitled The Battle of Gettysburg , also known as the Gettysburg Cyclorama , depicts Pickett 's Charge from the vantage point of the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge . Completed and first exhibited in 1883 , it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States . It was restored and relocated to the new National Park Service Visitor Center in September 2008 . 
 = Folk metal = 
 Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s . It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and , to a lesser extent , traditional singing styles ( for example , Dutch Heidevolk , Danish <unk> and Spanish Stone of <unk> ) . It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock . 
 The earliest folk metal bands were Skyclad from England and Cruachan from Ireland . Skyclad 's debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was released in 1991 and would be considered a thrash metal album with some folk influences , unlike Cruachan ’ s early work which embraced the folk element as a defining part of their sound . It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe as well as in Israel . Among these early groups , the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal . Despite their contributions , folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s . It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence , particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll , Ensiferum , Korpiklaani , Turisas , and Moonsorrow . 
 The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music . A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line @-@ ups . A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments . Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with fantasy , mythology , paganism , history and nature .

 The English band Skyclad was formed in 1990 after vocalist Martin Walkyier left his previous band , Sabbat . Skyclad began as a thrash metal band but added violins from session musician Mike Evans on several tracks from their debut album , The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth , an effort described by Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic as " ambitious " and " groundbreaking . " The song " The <unk> Jig " from the debut album has been acclaimed as " particularly significant " and " a certain first in the realms of Metal " . With a full time fiddle player in their lineup , the band 's second album feature a " now legendary folky jig style " and " more prominent inclusion of the fiddle playing lead lines and melodies normally associated with the lead guitar parts of most other rock bands . " 
 Even with the departure of Martin Walkyier in 2001 , Skyclad remains an active folk metal group today after nearly two decades since their formation . In contrast , the Portuguese band Moonspell had a brief tenure in the genre . Their first release was the 1994 Under the Moonspell EP with music that featured folk and Middle Eastern influences . With the release of their debut album <unk> in the following year , the band made a transition into gothic metal and within a matter of years " quickly evolved into one of the major players of the European goth @-@ metal scene . " 
 Cruachan were formed in 1992 in Dublin , Ireland . From the outset their intention was to mix the native Irish folk music of their home country with the more extreme side of metal music . Their debut album Tuatha Na Gael was released in 1995 and was a full folk metal album from start to finish . In the Italian book “ <unk> METAL , Dalle <unk> Al Ragnarok ” , a comprehensive history of the genre , Author Fabrizio <unk> credits Cruachan as being the very first real Folk Metal band . He acknowledges that Skyclad did have some folk parts in some songs before Cruachan however he goes on to say Cruachan used folk music as much as they used heavy metal music . Cruachan also used arrangements of known folk songs and melodies , Skyclad wrote folk " sounding " parts . 
 Another early contributor to folk metal is the Finnish group <unk> . They formed in 1990 with their debut album , The Karelian Isthmus , following two years later . Their sophomore effort Tales from the Thousand Lakes was released in 1994 with " plenty of fascinating melodies and song structures that drew heavily from the traditional folk music of their native country . " The album received a favorable reception from fans with " its content quickly being exalted across the Metal underground as perhaps the very pinnacle of atmospheric Death Metal achievement . "

 The German band Subway to Sally was formed in 1992 as a folk rock band , singing in English and incorporating Irish and Scottish influences in their music . With their second album <unk> released in 1995 , the band adopted a " more traditional approach " and started singing in German . Taking Skyclad as an influence , Subway to Sally performs a blend of hard rock and heavy metal " enriched with medieval melodies enmeshed in the songs via bagpipes , hurdy @-@ gurdy , lute , <unk> , <unk> [ sic ] , fiddle and flute " and combined with " romantic @-@ symbolic German @-@ speaking poetry " in their lyrics . With chart success in their native Germany , they have since been credited as the band " that set off the wave of what is known as medieval rock . " 
 This distinctly German phenomenon has been continued and expanded further by subsequent bands . Formed in 1996 , the Berlin based In <unk> has also found chart success with their " medieval style stage garb and unashamed usage of such bizarre , sometimes hand made , instruments as the Scottish bagpipes . " Another band that has experienced commercial success in Germany is the Bavarian outfit Schandmaul . Describing themselves as the " minstrels of today , " the band employs a musical arsenal that includes the bagpipes , barrel organ , shawm , violin and mandolin .

 The Irish band Cruachan was formed in 1992 by guitarist Keith Fay with their first demo recording distributed in 1993 . Drawing inspiration from Skyclad 's first album , Fay set out to combine black metal with the folk music of Ireland . Their debut album Tuatha Na Gael was released in 1995 and the band has since been acclaimed as having " gone the greatest lengths of anyone in their attempts to expand " the genre of folk metal . Cruachan combination of Celtic music and heavy metal is known today as Celtic metal . 
 Parallel to Cruachan , the black metal act Primordial also released a demo recording in 1993 and " found themselves heralded as frontrunners in the burgeoning second @-@ wave black metal movement . " Irish music plays " a very big role " in Primordial but in " a dark and subtle way " through the chords and timings . The band has since " established themselves as one of the most unique sounding bands in the folk @-@ meets @-@ black metal field . " Other early representatives of Celtic metal include the bands <unk> , Mägo de Oz and Waylander with both groups releasing a demo recording in 1995 . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 From the middle of the 1990s , other bands gradually emerged to combine heavy metal with folk music . Storm was a short lived Norwegian supergroup with Fenriz , Satyr and Kari <unk> from the black metal groups Darkthrone , Satyricon and the doom metal band The 3rd and the Mortal respectively . Their only album <unk> was released in 1995 with the use of keyboards to imitate the sound of folk instruments . The Germans <unk> also relied on synthesizers and guitars to deliver their " dark folklore " black metal music with the release of their 1996 debut album A <unk> ... 
 The year 1996 also saw the debut album of the " one @-@ man black metal project of multi @-@ instrumentalist <unk> <unk> " from Germany known as Falkenbach . Even though Falkenbach was formed as early as 1989 , the band didn 't get much attention until the debut , that includes epic music that is " rife with keyboards , Viking themes , and folk music tendencies , " Falkenbach was effectively a merge of Viking metal with folk metal . They were joined in the next two years by other bands combining the two genres including Windir , Månegarm and Thyrfing . 
 Predating most folk metal groups , the Spanish band Mägo de Oz was formed as far back as 1989 with a self @-@ titled debut album , released in 1994 . With nine members in their lineup , including a violinist and flutist , the band has evolved over the years into a combination of power metal and Celtic flavored folk metal . They have experienced strong chart success in their native Spain as well as in South America and Mexico . 
 The Lord Weird Slough Feg from Pennsylvania , United States also had an early formation dating back to 1990 . Their self @-@ titled debut album was released in 1996 and the band has pursued a " unique style of combining traditional / power metal with folk metal . " 
 The Czech band Silent Stream of Godless Elegy had formed in 1995 as a doom metal band " laced with Pagan imagery and adventurous enough to include violins and cellos alongside the expected modern day arsenal . " With the release of their second album Behind the Shadows in 1998 , the band began to use " folklore influences " in their music . 
 = = = Explosion = = = 
 The folk metal genre has dramatically expanded with the turn of the new millennium . At the forefront of this explosion , with a " revolutionary clash of tradition and amplification that set them apart " , is a group from Finland known as Finntroll . The band was formed in 1997 with a demo recorded the following year and a debut album <unk> <unk> released in 1999 . They have since developed a reputation for being " obsessed with all things <unk> . " Their lyrics are sung exclusively in Swedish instead of the Finnish language " apparently because this language was better to evoke the <unk> spirit " , even though the real reason for this lies in the band 's original vocalist belonging to the Swedish @-@ speaking minority . The music of Finntroll features a " real innovation " in the marriage of black metal music with a style of Finnish polka called humppa . Specifically , the band took from humppa " the alternate picking bass lines accompanied with the drumbeat , and the use of accordion . " This unlikely mix of polka and extreme metal has received a mixed reception from critics . Andy Hinds of Allmusic laments the polka influence as undermining " the intended threat of a death metal band " while his colleague Alex Henderson praises the band for their " solid , consistently likable effort , " declaring that Finntroll has set themselves apart from their peers " because of their emphasis on Finnish humppa " and " the humor and irony they bring to the table . " 
 Finntroll 's second album <unk> tid was released in 2001 and became a chart success in their native Finland . Some of the songs on the album feature vocals performed by Jonne Järvelä of Korpiklaani , another band from Finland . While other folk metal bands began with metal before adding folk music , Korpiklaani started with folk music before turning metal . The roots of Korpiklaani can be traced back to a Sami folk music group under the name of <unk> Duo , an " in house restaurant band " created in 1993 . An album of folk music was released under this name before Jonne Järvelä relocated and formed a new band Shaman . The folk metal act Shaman was based on the folk music of <unk> Duo . Two albums were released in 1999 and 2001 before Shaman changed their name to Korpiklaani . The change in name was accompanied by a change in the music . The traditional <unk> vocals and the use of the Sámi language were dropped while the synthesizer was replaced with real folk instruments . Jonne Järvelä credits his work with Finntroll as the catalyst for the shift in emphasis from folk to metal . 
 While Korpiklaani used an assortment of traditional instruments to deliver their folk metal , Finntroll relies on keyboards for Finnish folk melodies played in the humppa style . The keyboards in Finntroll are performed by Henri Sorvali who also performs in Moonsorrow , another folk metal band from Finland that he formed with his cousin Ville Sorvali in 1995 . They released two demos , the first in 1997 and another in 1999 , before the 2001 debut album <unk> Uni . Moonsorrow blends folk metal with Viking metal by incorporating " Finland 's traditional folk music forms into elaborate symphonic arrangements typical of Viking metal outfits such as Bathory and Enslaved . " The adoption of folk elements was " becoming all the rage " in Finland by this point and other folk metal bands from Finland that began to emerge in the early 2000s included Cadacross , Ensiferum and later on Turisas and Wintersun . Ensiferum notably found themselves at the top of the Finnish charts with their 2007 single " One More Magic Potion " . Finntroll , Korpiklaani , Moonsorrow and Turisas have all experienced chart success in their native Finland as well . 
 There are also folk metal acts from the other Scandinavian countries . The Norwegian act Glittertind was A @-@ listed and played with the highest playing frequency on Norway 's most popular radio channel NRK P1 with the song " <unk> " ( eng . Restless ) " and performed the song on <unk> , the Norwegian answer to Oprah Winfrey show when they released their first full @-@ length as a full band . Other Norwegian acts include the aforementioned Storm and Windir as well as more recent groups such as <unk> , Lumsk , <unk> and <unk> . Bands from Sweden include the aforementioned Thyrfing and Månegarm along with other acts such as <unk> and <unk> . Folk metal bands from Denmark include Wuthering Heights , <unk> , <unk> and the Faroe Islanders Týr . 
 Outside Scandinavia , other European nations have contributed to the growing genre . Groups from the Baltic states of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania includes Metsatöll , <unk> @-@ Ants , and Skyforger while representatives from Russia include <unk> , Arkona and Butterfly Temple . More isolated examples across Europe include <unk> <unk> ( wild strawberries ) from Bosnia , <unk> Argus and <unk> from Bulgaria , Dalriada from Hungary , Elvenking from Italy and Eluveitie from Switzerland . Folkearth is an international folk metal project with members from several different European countries . At its inception , the project consisted of 14 musicians from separate backgrounds in folk and metal music . With their second album By the Sword of My Father released in 2006 , the project boasted the participation of 31 musicians . 
 Beyond the European continent , folk metal is relatively rare with only a few known acts including the aforementioned The Lord Weird Slough Feg and their fellow Americans Agalloch . The latter 's music " made for a stark geographical anomaly , since its eclectic , avant @-@ garde folk @-@ metal was the sort of thing one would expect to emerge from Scandinavia -- not Portland , Oregon . " Tuatha de Danann is another geographical anomaly with their Celtic metal from Brazil .

 = = = Music = = = 
 The music of folk metal is a diverse collection with bands pursuing different subgenres of heavy metal music . While bands like Primordial and Finntroll perform black metal , other groups such as The Lord Weird Slough Feg ply their trade with a more traditional or power metal base . The German @-@ Norwegian group Midnattsol blends the genre with gothic metal . Progressive tendencies can be found among some bands including Elvenking , Lumsk and Týr . Some bands are known to adopt more than one different styles of heavy metal . Orphaned Land combines folk metal with progressive and doom / death metal . The band formed in 1991 , also combining Jewish , Arabic , and other West Asian influences while Ensiferum mix folk music on top of a power and death metal hybrid . A few groups are also known to incorporate the styles of other music genres outside of heavy metal . Examples include the punk rock in the music of Glittertind and the <unk> and post @-@ rock tendencies of Agalloch . 
 The folk elements in the genre often reflect the ethnic background of the musicians as is the case for the Scandinavian folk music in Finntroll and Korpiklaani , the Baltic folk music in Metsatöll and Skyforger or the Middle Eastern background of Orphaned Land . 
 Celtic music can be found among such Irish groups as Cruachan and Waylander as well as bands outside Ireland like Eluveitie ( although Switzerland can be considered a country with a Celtic history ) , and Tuatha de Danann ( from Brazil , a country that has no cultural ties with the Celts whatsoever , despite the similarity of the country 's name to an island in Irish myth ) . Folk music from multiple regions are employed by some groups like Elvenking and Ensiferum . Other <unk> acts , such as Sepultura and Overdose ( from Belo Horizonte ) , mixed thrash with tribal sounds , ethnic voices and amazonian instruments . Max Cavalera of Sepultura formed Soulfly which later incorporated this " tribal metal " and latin metal sounds in nu metal and groove metal , inspiring acts like Ill Niño , Puya or Tren Loco . 
 The genre also offers a variety of atmosphere and moods . A fun and cheerful nature is characteristic of groups like Finntroll and Korpiklaani . Both bands are also noted for playing music that one can dance to . In contrast , other acts such as Thyrfing and Primordial are known for their contemplative atmosphere . Lumsk offers a more mellow style while Agalloch are known for their " depressive ambient " sound . 
 An epic atmosphere is characteristic of some folk metal bands like Primordial , Moonsorrow , Turisas and the music project Folkearth . Groups like Ensiferum and Wintersun are known to have a melodious side while bands that favor a more blistering or brutal approach can be found in groups like Finntroll and Månegarm . 
 = = = Instruments = = = 
 Folk metal feature the same typical instruments found in heavy metal music : guitars , bass , drums and vocalist . While a few folk metal groups like <unk> discard " any notion of utilising folk instrumentation " and " rely solely on traditional metal instruments , " bands in the genre generally rely on folk instruments that range from the common to the exotic . Numerous folk metal acts include a dedicated violinist in their line up . This includes Skyclad , Subway to Sally , Schandmaul , Mägo de Oz , Silent Stream of Godless Elegy , Korpiklaani , Lumsk , Elvenking , Eluveitie and Tuatha de Danann . The tin whistle and flute can be found in such Celtic metal bands as Cruachan , Waylander and Eluveitie . The flute can also be found in other bands such as Metsatöll , Schandmaul and Morgenstern . Some bands are also known to highlight more exotic instruments from their ethnic background or country , including Skyforger 's use of the Latvian <unk> , Metsatöll 's use of the Estonian <unk> , Korpiklaani 's use of the Finnish kantele , Eluveitie 's use of the hurdy @-@ gurdy , and Orphaned Land 's use of the oud and saz . 
 In the absence of folk instruments , other bands in the genre resort to using keyboards to replicate the sound of folk instruments . This includes the aforementioned Storm , <unk> and Finntroll as well as other acts like Midnattsol . Bands that supplement a folk instrument like the violin with keyboards include Skyclad , Mägo de Oz , and Tuatha de Danann . 
 The large number of instruments that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances . While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel , they have to rely on a computer to replicate the roles of the guest musicians for concerts elsewhere . Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts . This includes Folkearth , Falkenbach and Summoning . Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently , it is not uncommon to find bands in the genre featuring six or more members in their line @-@ up . Some of the <unk> in the genre are Schandmaul , Cruachan , Korpiklaani , Turisas , and Midnattsol , while <unk> include Subway to Sally , In <unk> , and Lumsk . Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of Mägo de Oz totals nine performers . Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments , they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound . As an example , Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band 's seven members on their debut album Åsmund <unk> . At times , guest musicians are known to become full @-@ fledged members of the band , as was the case in Skyforger and Turisas . 
 = = = Vocals = = = 
 The diverse range of music styles and instruments is matched by a variety of vocal styles in the genre . From the " spine @-@ chilling death shrieks " in Finntroll to the black metal rasps of Skyforger or Moonsorrow , there is no shortage of extreme vocals in folk metal . Other bands to feature extreme vocals include Cadacross , Ensiferum and Equilibrium . In contrast , bands like Mägo de Oz and Metsatöll are known to feature " clean " singing in line with their more traditional metal approach . Numerous other bands in the genre are known to feature both extreme vocals and clean singing . This includes Primordial , Turisas , Windir and Wintersun . 
 Traditional folk singing can also be found among some folk metal bands . The <unk> vocals of Jonne Järvelä have been featured in varying degrees in the music of Shaman , Finntroll and Korpiklaani . Folk singing or folk @-@ inspired singing can also be heard in the music of Equilibrium , Metsatöll , Skyforger and Orphaned Land . The music of Orphaned Land also features the use of chants and choirs , commonly encountered in the genre of folk metal . Bands that are known to use a choir include Arkona , Turisas , Lumsk and Eluveitie , while chants can be found in the music of Týr and Windir . Some bands like Falconer and Thyrfing are also known to feature " yo @-@ ho @-@ ho folk melodies " in their vocals to suit their Viking metal style . 
 Orphaned Land mostly uses English lyrics , but they are known to feature other languages as they " go well with the music and also sound more exotic and unique . " Týr has also been known to use multiple languages in their music . Other bands in the genre are known to sing exclusively or almost entirely in their native language , including Mägo de Oz in Spanish , Moonsorrow in Finnish , Metsatöll in Estonian and Lumsk in Norwegian . Bands in the medieval metal subgenre also tend to sing largely or entirely in their German language , including Subway to Sally , Morgenstern and <unk> <unk> . 
 Lead female singers are not uncommon in the genre and can be found in Cruachan , <unk> , Lumsk , Arkona and Midnattsol . Other groups like Orphaned Land and Elvenking have employed guest female vocalists in their music . 
 = = = Lyrics = = = 
 Popular subjects in folk metal include paganism , nature , fantasy , mythology and history . 
 Folk metal has been associated with paganism ever since its inception , when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad , in part because the band " wasn 't going to go far enough down the pagan , British way that we wanted to do it . " Consequently , the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters . The band Cruachan was also founded by a self @-@ described pagan , Keith Fay . For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow , the label " pagan metal " is preferred " because that describes the ideological points in the music , but doesn ’ t say anything about the music itself . " Other bands that also prefer to use the term " pagan metal " as a self @-@ description include Cruachan , Eluveitie , <unk> and Skyforger . In contrast to bands with pagan themes , some folk metal bands such as Orphaned Land have themes of Abrahamic religion . 
 Nature is a strong influence to many folk metal bands . Groups such as Korpiklaani , Elvenking , Midnattsol and <unk> have all based lyrics on the subject . For the band Agalloch , nature is an embraced theme " because we are siding with what is essentially the victim in a relationship where humankind is a disease . " All the members of Skyclad are supporters of " organisations like Greenpeace and others , for those are the ones who stand up and take on the battle " between " people who want to save the planet , and people who want to destroy it . " 
 The pioneers of the genre Skyclad avoided fantasy lyrics because " there was already enough fantasy in the world , told to us by our politicians every day . " Nonetheless , other folk metal bands have been known to feature fantasy themes in their lyrics including Ensiferum , Midnattsol and Cruachan . For Elvenking , fantasy themes are used " as a metaphor to cover deeper meanings . " Similarly , the fantasy themes in Turisas belie the coverage of issues " that are deeper and have greater significance . " 
 The Celtic metal subgenre is known to feature lyrics based on Celtic mythology . The history of the Celts is another popular source for the lyrics of Celtic metal bands like Cruachan , Eluveitie , Primordial and Mael <unk> . Norse mythology can be found in the lyrics of such Scandinavian bands as Falkenbach , Týr , Finntroll and <unk> . Skyforger is known for featuring lyrics based on both the history and mythology of their Latvian culture . Other bands that have treated history to song include Falconer and Slechtvalk . 
 A few National Socialist black metal ( NSBM ) bands like the <unk> <unk> , or Russia 's <unk> and Kroda have been known to cross over into folk metal , a circumstance that Ciaran O 'Hagan , the vocalist of Waylander , views as " an insult to people like myself who don ’ t hold with fascist ideals at all . " He further suggests that the NSBM bands are playing folk metal " for all the wrong reasons . " Due to the misappropriation of pagan symbols by Neo @-@ Nazism , several folk metal bands have also been mistaken for being part of the NSBM scene . Consequently , such bands as Cruachan , Skyforger , Moonsorrow , Månegarm and Týr have had to disassociate themselves with Nazism , fascism or racism . Skyforger went as far as to add the words ' No Nazi Stuff Here ! ' on the back of their album covers . Richard Lederer of Summoning has also publicly denounced National Socialism in a self @-@ penned essay on his band 's website . In April 2008 , performers on the folk metal festival <unk> were subject to accusations of being Nazis , racists and fascists from the German <unk> . Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow and <unk> Joensen of Týr issued a joint video statement to refute these accusations , noting that " one of the biggest issues seems to be that we use ancient Scandinavian symbols in our imagery like the S in the Moonsorrow logo and the T in the Týr logo [ even though ] that is how the S and the T runes have been written for thousands of years . " Moonsorrow has also issued a written statement in response to the controversy while Týr notes on their official website that they " got the idea for the rune logo " from the Black Sabbath album of the same name . On the other side of the political landscape , some folk metal bands have uttered explicit socialist sentiments . For example the aforementioned Glittertind made a leftist statement against neoliberalism in their album booklet when re @-@ releasing the record Til Dovre <unk> on Napalm Records in May 2009 . 
 The original folk metal band Skyclad was also known to deal with serious political subjects but through lyrics that were littered with puns and humor . Other bands have continued to feature fun and humorous lyrics . This includes Finntroll with their obsession on trolls . The lyrics of Korpiklaani also " focused on having a good time , drinking [ and ] partying . " In a review of Turisas ' The Varangian Way album , James Christopher Monger of Allmusic commented that some listeners might be put off by " the concept of grown men in pelts " singing such lyrics as " come with us to the south , write your name on our roll . " <unk> Joensen of Týr contends that a listener needs to be confident in his masculinity to listen to such traditional <unk> lyrics as his own " young lads , happy lads , step upon the floor , dance merrily . "

The show had Cyrus performing first under character , as Hannah Montana . She then performed a duet with the opening act , which continued performing an interlude of songs . For the latter half of the duet , a body double was used to facilitate the transition from Hannah Montana to herself . Videos online caused many fans to become outraged and question whether Cyrus lip @-@ synched on the tour . Her representatives later issued a statement that denied the allegations and stated the reasons for the body double 's usage . The fast @-@ paced concert had six segments , divided equally between each persona . 
 The tour received generally positive responses from critics , some who complimented Cyrus ' vocal skills and onstage presence and preferred the Hannah Montana set over Cyrus ' . The tour was commercially successful , grossing over $ 54 million . At the 2008 Billboard Touring Awards , it won the " Breakthrough Artist " award . Furthermore , tickets sold extremely quickly and were found in secondary markets . Ticket scalping became so extensive it garnered much media attention and lawsuits were filed against MileyWorld , Cyrus ' official fan club , and ticket brokers .

 Cyrus is a singer @-@ songwriter and actress who starred on the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana as Miley Stewart , a girl with a secret double life as the popstar Hannah Montana . Through the television series , Cyrus rose to fame as a teen idol and released music credited to Hannah Montana . In 2006 , Cyrus served as opening act on twenty dates of The Cheetah Girls ' concert tour The Party 's Just Begun Tour , performing solely as Hannah Montana . In June 2007 , the singer released the double @-@ disc album Hannah Montana 2 : Meet Miley Cyrus . The first disc , Hannah Montana 2 , of the album was Hannah Montana 's second season soundtrack , while the second disc , Meet Miley Cyrus , was Cyrus ' debut studio album . In order to promote the album , Cyrus decided to embark on her first headlining concert tour , the Best of Both Worlds Tour , where she performed both under character , as Hannah Montana , and as herself for the first time . 
 The concert tour was being discussed by executives as early as January 2007 . It was announced on August 8 , 2007 via press release . It was confirmed that the tour would be promoted by AEG Live and Buena Vista Concerts , a division of The Walt Disney Company . It also featured American band and labelmates the Jonas Brothers as opening act . The tour would expand throughout North America , from October 18 , 2007 in St. Louis , Missouri to January 9 , 2008 in Albany , New York , with a total of fifty @-@ four dates ; fifty @-@ three of which were in the United States and one which was in Canada .

 The tour was titled Best of Both Worlds Tour after the song of the same name , which was the theme to Hannah Montana and was released on the series ' first soundtrack . The title was chosen because of how the concert alternates between Cyrus performing as Hannah Montana and herself . She described the tour to differentiate the two according to their respective styles and depict how one girl was able to have two sides to her . She said the most notable difference between the two characters was the style of music , rather than physical appearance . According to her , Hannah Montana was direct pop music , while her own style was more rock music @-@ oriented and included real @-@ life scenarios set to tunes . Cyrus rehearsed for the tour simultaneous to filming the final episodes for the second season of Hannah Montana from September to October 2007 . 
 Kenny Ortega , a common collaborator with The Walt Disney Company at the time , was hired as the tour 's director and main choreographer . Ortega , along with set designer Michael Cotten , assembled an experienced personnel and developed the show , which was made fairly simple because Cyrus did not feel confident enough as a vocalist to perform stunts and use props while singing . Therefore , fixation was turned to video . Cotten envisioned the set to be " an interactive mobile kaleidoscope of flash and style " , a conceptualization that involved a massive amount of video . Nineteen individual LED video screens were located throughout the stage . Four high definition V9 LED video screens served as walls surrounding the main stage . Five Barco <unk> cubes , which consisted of three LED panels that faced towards the audience and one supporting panel that faced the stage , were suspended by rigs throughout the stage . Nocturne Productions partnered with equipment supplier Video Equipment Rentals ( <unk> ) to accomplish the design . The lightweight and adaptability of the V9 LED screens allowed for designers to add more lighting elements than in most shows at the time . 
 Video content director George <unk> and video engineer Steven Davis controlled the video surfaces using a Pinnacle <unk> switcher and an expanded Vista Systems Spyder system . Graphics on the LED walls were fed from a custom video playback system that incorporated three Green Hippo media servers ; some of the video content was filmed during rehearsals and were meant for Cyrus to interact with onstage . Visual magnification was executed through the usage of Ikegami <unk> HL @-@ 45 cameras and multiple strategically located point @-@ of @-@ view cameras , in order to cover the show from every angle . Extensive amounts of teamwork was necessitated to set up the complex video system at each venue , particularly for weekend daytime performances , as they had less time . Mark Woody , Steve " Bone " Gray , Justin McLean , and Dane <unk> set up the video structures , while Evan Huff and crew chief Eric Geiger built the video thrust into the audience and installed the live cameras . " Thanks to these talented designers a show commensurate with Hannah 's popularity has been created " , said Paul Becher , co @-@ CEO of Nocturne Productions . For audio , Cyrus used Sennheiser 's MD 5235 dynamic capsule atop the SKM 5200 wireless handheld transmitter nightly . Sixteen channels of Sennheiser G2 wireless monitors were programmed to ensure that performers could hear what was being played amidst massive , and fervid screams from the audience . Sennheiser 500 series wireless guitar and bass systems were also used .

 The main show started with Cyrus descending onto the stage in a neon pink cube that bore a digital image of her silhouette , as pink fireworks were fired behind her . Donning a long , sequined , cheetah and black @-@ striped tank top and cardigan , sparkling black tights , black boots , and the blonde Hannah Montana wig , she began to perform the concert 's opening number , " Rock Star " . In continuation , Cyrus was joined by multiple backup dancers to perform dance routines for " Life 's What You Make It " . Removing the cardigan , she concluded the segment with " Just Like You " . Still costumed as Hannah Montana , Cyrus reappeared from the back of the stage , wearing sparkly blue denim jeans , a white tank top , a blue denim vest , and shiny silver tie ; she performed " Old Blue Jeans " among female backup dancers and " Nobody 's Perfect " roaming the stage alone . The next segment began with the performance of " Pumpin ' Up the Party " , where Cyrus dressed with a pink and purple sequined mini @-@ dress , fuchsia ad violet tights and maroon boots and dancers wore 1960s @-@ inspired attires while performing calisthenics . The segment continued with " I Got Nerve " , which required participation and elaborate routines on behalf of the dancers , and a duet with the opening act . While they served as opening act , " We Got the Party " was performed as a duet with the Jonas Brothers . She annexed a pink and purple trench coat to her attire and performed with the Jonas Brothers , who also played electric guitars . At one point of the performance , Cyrus disappeared to be replaced by a body double who completed the performance . While Aly & A.J. and Everlife served as opening acts , a postmodern cover of Kiss ' " Rock and Roll All Nite " ( 1975 ) was performed by them and Cyrus wore a geometric @-@ patterned cocktail dress . Afterwards , the opening act performed an interlude of several songs .

 Chris William of Entertainment Weekly graded the show a B + and commented that , despite her age ( at the time fourteen ) , Cyrus was a determined and likable performer who was able to command the stage the entire show . He continued to compare her to Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne stylistically and musically , respectively . Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel believed the Best of Both Worlds Tour was as entertaining as concerts performed by Spears or the Backstreet Boys , adding that the show 's quality made past Hilary Duff concerts " look like something in a mall food court . " However , Abbott also stated that Cyrus was unable to duplicate the energy of Hannah Montana . Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times expected to be let down by the concert after the commotion and hype built for it , but was not . She said , " The show was terrific : a two @-@ hour sugar rush and one long challenge to fans , who had to keep up with Ms. Cyrus 's hectic pace . " Regarding Cyrus , Sanneh stated she was a likable singer , being able to emphasize on certain words and that her demeanor on stage portrayed her as a " hard @-@ working , sweet @-@ natured troublemaker . There 's something slightly disruptive about her bright smile [ ... ] And she brings a welcome hint of chaos to everything she does . " J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the concert as " a nearly 90 @-@ minute blast of pop in which the charismatic Cyrus – who complained that she wasn 't feeling well – commanded the stage with confidence , performing with a particular swagger . " Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times described the show to be operated at a " frenzied fever pitch " and be only appealing to children , confusing adults with its presentation . 
 J. <unk> Keyes of Newsday said that producers were able to deliver a concert " that was the visual and sonic equivalent of washing down a pound of sugar with 27 cans of soda . " Keyes added that , despite Cyrus ' charisma , it was evident the show and the dual @-@ persona arrangement ( considering that there were no major divergences between them ) was an evident strategy to extend marketing and receive more profits . Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle believed Cyrus was a fair singer and commented , " It was relatively wholesome , musically tolerable and certainly had plenty of production value . Some adults may have walked away wondering what the big fuss was about , but none of the kids looked the least bit disappointed . " Jane Stevenson of the Canadian Online Explorer noted the differences between Hannah Montana and Cyrus , stating that Cyrus was the " marginally tougher cookie of the two singers " and that audiences received two concerts for the price of one . An uncredited review from The Palm Beach Post stated , " Both halves [ of the concert ] were enjoyable and lively , set apart by Cyrus ’ preternaturally assured stage presence , in and out of the wig . " It also stated that the Hannah Montana set was more satisfying due to the quality of the songs and more energy . Geoff <unk> of The Boston Globe wrote , " Of course , most of the mainly tweener fans in the arena weren 't splitting [ ... ] musical hairs . They ate up the spectacle of the show , with its costume changes , giant video screens , and sparklers . "
