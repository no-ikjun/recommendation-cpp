 The majority of this episode takes place in the Torchwood Institute , which is seen on screen for the first time . The phrase " Torchwood " originated from an anagram of Doctor Who used to conceal the " rushes " tapes during the filming of the first series . It was an arc word used through the majority of the second series , starting with the series one episode " Bad Wolf " . 
 The episode 's secondary plot device is the Cybermen , from the parallel universe featured in " The Age of Steel " and " Rise of the Cybermen " . The Cybermen breaking through plastic sheets is a recurring theme throughout Cybermen appearances , in particular , The Tomb of the Cybermen , The Invasion and <unk> . The concept of a <unk> , mentioned by Mickey , would eventually come to pass in " The Next Doctor " . 
 The episode is also the first in which Freema Agyeman appears , although she is not playing the role of Martha Jones , which she would play in series 3 , but a minor character named <unk> ( who is later revealed to be Martha 's cousin ) . Russell T Davies admired Agyeman 's performance as <unk> and called her back to fill the role of companion that Piper had chosen to leave . 
 Although Cybermen and Daleks previously appeared together in The Wheel in Space , The War Games , The Mind of Evil , Logopolis , The Five Doctors , and " Dalek " , this two @-@ part episode ( including the next episode " Doomsday " ) is the first time that both the Cybermen and Daleks play a major role . 
 = = Production = = 
 The two @-@ part finale comprising " Army of Ghosts " and " Doomsday " was originally going to take place in Cardiff on the time rift which was the focus of the episodes " The Unquiet Dead " and " Boom Town " . With the commission of the Torchwood series in 2005 , Davies decided to base the spin @-@ off in Cardiff and relocate " Army of Ghosts " and " Doomsday " to Canary Wharf in London . 
 To ensure that Noel Clarke and Shaun Dingwall ( Mickey Smith and Pete Tyler , respectively ) were available for filming , the story was filmed in the season 's third production block along with " Rise of the Cybermen " and " The Age of Steel " . Filming for the story started on 2 November 2005 on location in Kennington , but this story did not become the primary focus of the production crew until 29 November , when filming began on the scenes in and around the sphere chamber . Scenes in the lever room , the main setting for the story , were filmed between 12 December and 15 December , and 3 January and 5 January 2006 . 
 The episode also features references to other programmes by the BBC . The most notable of these is the cameo of Barbara Windsor as Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders , where she bars a ghost whom she presumes to be Den Watts from The Queen Victoria . Watts , presumed killed in 1989 , returned to the soap in 2003 , before being killed a second time in 2005 after being written out of the show . Other British TV personalities appearing in the episode are Trisha Goddard , Alistair Appleton and Derek <unk> , appearing as themselves . Additionally , the shot of One Canada Square is taken from the opening credits of The Apprentice . A programme with the same name as a controversial broadcast in 1992 by the BBC , <unk> , also appears in the show . 
 Location shooting took place at the Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square , Cardiff Bay . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 To keep the appearance of the Daleks secret , the final scene was removed from all preview tapes and replaced with a title card reading " final scene withheld until transmission " , including the copy given to the Doctor Who microsite 's " fear forecast " team . 
 The episode was watched by 8 @.@ 19 million viewers , and was the seventh most watched programme of the week , behind four World Cup games and two episodes of Coronation Street . The Companion episode of Doctor Who Confidential gained 570 @,@ 000 viewers . The episode 's Appreciation Index was 86 , above the average baseline of 77 for drama series . 
 The episode was generally well reviewed by critics . The Stage commented that the episode was " a tense contest , full of drama , tears , adversity and two powerful forces coming face to face in the ultimate battle " while mockingly downplaying the England football team 's defeat earlier that evening . The author of the review then stated that the cliffhanger increased his affection of the show . The Guardian commented that the episode was " Who back at its best " while The People complimented the humour of the scene of the Doctor channel surfing . Jacob Clifton of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- rating . Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode 9 @.@ 8 out of 10 ( Incredible ) , and complimented the pacing of the episode and the revelation of both the Cybermen and the Daleks , concluding that " you couldn 't ask for a better cliffhanger " . 
 After its initial airing , the episode was released on DVD with " Fear Her " and " Doomsday " on 25 September 2006 . The story ( " Army of Ghosts " / " Doomsday " ) was nominated for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form .

 = New York State Route 318 = 
 New York State Route 318 ( NY 318 ) is an east – west state highway in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States . The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 14 at New York State Thruway ( Interstate 90 or I @-@ 90 ) exit 42 in the town of Phelps . The eastern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) and NY 5 northeast of the hamlet of Seneca Falls . All but 0 @.@ 70 miles ( 1 @.@ 13 km ) of the 10 @.@ 90 @-@ mile ( 17 @.@ 54 km ) route is located in Seneca County . 
 The origins of NY 318 date back to the 19th century when the highway was part of a road connecting the village of Phelps to a bridge over the Seneca River near Cayuga Lake . It was mostly designated as Route 6 @-@ a , an unsigned legislative route , by the New York State Legislature in 1911 . The section of Route 6 @-@ a from West Junius to Halsey Corners was designated as New York State Route 291 ( west of Magee ) and part of NY 89 ( east of Magee ) as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 291 was removed in the 1940s . 
 The alignments of NY 89 and NY 414 north of Seneca Falls were largely flipped in the 1950s , placing both highways on their modern alignments . Part of NY 89 's former routing became a short @-@ lived extension of New York State Route 390 . All of NY 89 's former routing from Magee to Halsey Corners was designated as NY 318 c . 1963 . NY 318 was extended west to NY 14 in the 1970s over former NY 291 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 318 begins at an intersection with NY 14 in an area of the Ontario County town of Phelps known as West Junius . West of the intersection , the right @-@ of @-@ way for NY 318 leads to the toll barrier for New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) exit 42 . The route heads eastward , crossing the Norfolk Southern Railway Corning Secondary line before passing into Seneca County a mere 0 @.@ 70 miles ( 1 @.@ 13 km ) from NY 14 . 
 Now in the town of Junius , the route follows an alignment parallel to that of the Thruway as it passes south of a large housing development and by a series of small lakes collectively known as Junius Ponds . NY 318 continues on , passing through a mixture of forested areas and cultivated fields as it heads eastward through the town . Just past an intersection with Nine Foot Road ( County Route 108 or CR 108 ) , NY 318 serves the Waterloo Premium Outlets , a large collection of outlet stores situated between NY 318 and the Thruway . Past the outlet mall , the route continues through largely rural surroundings to the community of Stone Church Corner , where it briefly curves to the northeast before veering back to the east as it enters the town of Tyre . 
 Roughly 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) from the town line , NY 318 enters the hamlet of Magee , a small community centered around NY 318 's junction with NY 414 ( Ridge Road ) . East of Magee , NY 318 turns to the southeast and begins to separate from the Thruway as it passes through vast , open fields . At the community of Nichols Corners , located at the intersection of NY 318 and Gravel Road ( CR 101 ) , the route curves back to the east and begins to straddle the Tyre – Seneca Falls town line . NY 318 ends 1 @.@ 35 miles ( 2 @.@ 17 km ) later at an intersection with US 20 and NY 5 . The junction is only 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 0 @.@ 16 km ) west of where US 20 and NY 5 meet NY 89 at Halsey Corners , a point just west of the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge and northwest of Cayuga Lake . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 On April 16 , 1825 , the New York State Legislature passed an act permitting the construction of a " free bridge " over the Seneca River . The bridge was ultimately constructed just north of Cayuga Lake near the site of the modern US 20 and NY 5 river crossing . A road was later built to connect the bridge to the village of Phelps by way of West Junius and Magee . The highway became known as the " free bridge state road " . In 1908 , the portion of the road from the free bridge to Halsey Corners was included as part of Route 6 , an unsigned legislative route defined by the New York State Legislature as beginning in Buffalo and ending in Albany . The remainder of the old free bridge highway was designated as Route 6 @-@ a in 1911 . 
 When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , the portion of Route 6 @-@ a from Phelps to West Junius was incorporated into NY 15 ( modern NY 96 ) , a route extending from Owego to Rochester . Farther east , the Route 6 segment of the old free bridge road was co @-@ designated as part of NY 5 and NY 5A ( now US 20 and NY 5 ) , two cross @-@ state highways linking Western New York to the Capital District . The remainder of the old highway — namely Route 6 @-@ a from West Junius to Halsey Corners — did not initially receive a designation . 
 = = = Designations = = = 
 The entirety of old Route 6 @-@ a between West Junius and Halsey Corners was assigned a designation as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . From West Junius to Magee , the highway was designated as NY 291 ; meanwhile , the section from Magee to Halsey Corners became part of NY 89 , which originally continued north from Magee to North Rose on what is now NY 414 . At the same time , Black Brook Road , a connector between the village of Seneca Falls and NY 89 east of Magee , was assigned NY 390 . In the mid @-@ 1930s , the portion of Gravel Road between US 20 and NY 5 and NY 89 was designated as NY 390A . The route was a spur route of NY 390 in name only as NY 390A never connected to NY 390 . The NY 291 designation was deleted in the early 1940s . 
 The alignments of NY 89 and NY 414 north of US 20 and NY 5 were mostly swapped in the late 1950s ; however , NY 414 continued south of Magee along its current alignment instead . At the same time , NY 390 was extended westward to Magee along the former routing of NY 89 while the NY 390A designation was deleted . The entirety of NY 89 's former routing from Magee to Halsey Corners was redesignated as NY 318 c . 1963 , resulting in the truncation of NY 390 back to its previous northern terminus before being removed altogether in the mid @-@ 1960s . NY 318 was extended west to its current terminus at NY 14 in West Junius in the mid @-@ 1970s . The former routings of NY 390 and NY 390A between NY 318 and the former Seneca Falls village line are now maintained by Seneca County as CR 102 ( Black Brook Road ) and part of CR 101 ( Gravel Road ) , respectively .

 = Ben Crosby = 
 Benjamin Lewis Crosby , Jr . ( March 22 , 1868 – December 29 , 1892 ) was an American football player , coach , and law student . Born in Halcott Centre , New York , Crosby attended Yale University beginning in 1889 ; while there , he was a popular student and sportsman . A member of both Delta Kappa Epsilon and Skull and Bones , Crosby was a two @-@ year starter on the football team and a backup on the crew team . During his junior year , Crosby was replaced on the football team by freshman Frank Hinkey and never returned to a starting position . The remainder of Crosby 's time at Yale was successful and he enrolled at the New York Law School after graduation . 
 Crosby was invited in 1892 to serve as head coach of the United States Naval Academy football program . He accepted the position , and , using a rigorous practicing regime , led his team to a 5 – 2 record , which included a victory over rival Army in the Army – Navy Game . Crosby was repeatedly in the news for his coaching decisions leading up to the game , which he was then commended for following the upset victory . At the end of the season , Crosby returned to New York to continue his studies , but he was hospitalized after a cold he caught while coaching worsened shortly after his arrival . He died from typhoid fever in late December , at the age of 24 .

 = = = Early life and college = = = 
 Crosby was born on March 22 , 1868 in Halcott Centre , Greene County , New York , son of David J. Crosby . As a child , Crosby attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven , Connecticut , the second person in his family to do so . He graduated from the school in 1888 , and the following year , Crosby began classes at Yale University . Crosby was very popular while at Yale , and was a member of both Delta Kappa Epsilon and the secret undergraduate society Skull and Bones . In his sophomore year , Crosby was the starting right end of the Bulldogs football team ; the squad finished the season with a thirteen @-@ and @-@ one record , with the sole loss coming to national champion Harvard . In his following year , Crosby joined the university 's crew team as a substitute , and was described by classmates as being " quite prominent in athletics " . 
 However , Crosby 's football season turned out to be a disappointment . Early in the season , both he and John A. Hartwell , the other starting end , who would later follow Crosby as Navy football coach , were injured in a game . While observing a team practice , Hartwell noticed the play of backup end Frank Hinkey . After the two watched Hinkey for a brief time , Hartwell decided that he needed to return to practicing or he would lose his starting position . Crosby did not share his view . By the next game , Hinkey had replaced Crosby as the starting end and Crosby did not regain his position . Despite this , Crosby remained popular through his senior year at the university , and he was one of three graduates presented with a class award . Upon graduation from the school , Crosby enrolled in New York Law School and joined a law office in New York City . 
 = = = Coaching career = = = 
 In October 1892 , shortly after he began attending New York Law School , Crosby was invited by former Yale coach Walter Camp to live in Annapolis , Maryland and serve as the coach for the United States Naval Academy football team . The program requested that Camp serve as coach in response to Army 's hiring of Crosby 's former teammate , Henry L. Williams , but Camp suggested that Crosby would be a better fit for the job . Crosby accepted the invitation , and became the second head coach in Navy history and the first that had been independent of the program . The prior coach , Vaulx Carter , had been a student at the academy and was responsible for the revival of the program . Crosby 's strategy for practices was one of the most intensive used at the academy during its early years ; after classes every day , the team would play two forty @-@ five minute games against a team of twenty @-@ two backup players , followed immediately by a long swimming session in a cold pool . Shortly before the season began , he hired former St. John 's College , Johns Hopkins , and Lehigh player Paul Dashiell to serve as his assistant coach . 
 The 1892 season commenced on October 12 with a 16 – 0 shutout loss against the Penn Quakers in Annapolis . The Quakers would finish the season with a 15 – 1 record , losing only to national champion Yale . Crosby 's team played their next game just three days later , against the Princeton Tigers . Navy lost the game in another shutout , by the score of 28 – 0 . These losses continued a losing streak that dated back to November 21 of the previous year . The following week , on October 22 , Crosby received his first coaching win after Navy defeated the Lafayette Leopards 22 – 4 . This was followed by a victory the next week over the small Franklin & Marshall College ; Navy won in a 24 – 0 shutout , their largest shutout win since the 1890 Army – Navy Game . They continued the winning streak into November with a 48 – 12 blowout of Rutgers , the biggest win for Navy since the beginning of the 1890 season . After a week 's break , Crosby received his fourth win , a forty @-@ point shutout of nearby Georgetown . 
 The final game of the season was the annual Army – Navy Game against Navy 's biggest rivals , the Army Cadets . Navy had been upset by the Cadets in the previous year 's game , and came into the 1892 game as an underdog against the unbeaten Army . Despite this , Crosby expected a victory , even telling reporters that he was " of the opinion that they [ Navy ] will certainly win " . Crosby also caught the attention of the press with his scheduling of constant practices leading up to the game , including organizing night practices on a lighted field . He also closed all press and fan access to the practices , an unusual action at the time , because Navy officials claimed that Army had learned their plays the prior year by observing the practices . Crosby 's actions proved successful as , on November 26 at West Point , Navy led Army for the entire game and won easily , 12 – 4 . About a month after the game , in appreciation for his coaching Navy to the win , the team presented Crosby an eight @-@ inch high sterling silver loving cup , produced by the Gorham Manufacturing Company , which was inscribed with the simple message : " Benjamin L. Crosby . Jr . – From the officers and cadets of the United States Naval Academy , Nov. 26 , 1892 " . 
 = = = Death and legacy = = = 
 Following the conclusion of the season , Crosby returned to New York City to continue his studies at the New York Law School . However , he only attended classes for a brief time . Crosby had , reportedly , contracted a " severe cold " during his time as a head coach , which continued to affect him after the season . On December 19 , while attending one of his law classes , his illness intensified and he apparently " succumbed to an attack of typhoid fever " . Crosby was taken to St. Luke 's Hospital , where his condition progressively worsened over the following ten days . Crosby finally succumbed to the effects of typhoid fever on December 29 at the age of 24 . In his one season as a head coach , Crosby amassed a record of 5 – 2 and his team outscored their opponents 146 – 64 . The five wins are tied for the seventh @-@ fewest of any Navy coach , but third @-@ most of single @-@ season coaches . Crosby also has the third @-@ fewest losses among Navy coaches . His .714 win percentage is tied for the tenth @-@ highest of any Navy coach . Crosby 's coaching position was filled by Yale teammate John A. Hartwell , who was subsequently replaced by another Yale teammate , William Wurtenburg . Crosby has been largely forgotten outside of Navy football history . One event from his life that was remembered was his replacement as Yale end by Frank Hinkey , which was discussed in magazines until at least the 1920s . The most significant impact that Crosby had was through his hiring of Dashiell . The latter would serve as assistant under the following eight Navy coaches , until 1903 ; as head coach from 1904 to 1906 , Dashiell brought Navy to national prominence and won 25 games . He later became one of the longest @-@ serving members of the college football Rules Committee , helping to legalize the forward pass and ban the flying wedge , among other things .

 = Fiji parrotfinch = 
 The Fiji parrotfinch ( Erythrura <unk> ) is a species of estrildid finch endemic to Fiji that was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the red @-@ headed parrotfinch . This parrotfinch is a small , mainly green bird with a red head and tail and a stubby dark grey bill . It is found in both forested and open habitats , and has adapted well to man @-@ made environments such as grasslands , pasture and gardens . Pairs have a courtship display in which they fly above the trees in an undulating flight , calling constantly . Breeding birds build a domed grass nest with a side entrance , and lay a clutch normally of four white eggs . Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink , with blue balls at the upper and lower corners of the gape , and black markings inside the mouth ; older fledglings resemble the adults , but lack the red head colouring . The Fiji parrotfinch eats seeds , especially of grasses , and also readily feeds on insects and nectar . It forms small flocks of up to six birds after the breeding season . 
 <unk> may be preyed upon by indigenous birds of prey such as the endemic Fiji goshawk , or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose , rats , and mice , and they may be susceptible to disease . The Fiji species , despite being both uncommon and endemic to one island group , appears to be stable in numbers . It is therefore classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List , and it is protected under Fijian law . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The parrotfinches are a genus of estrildid finches found in Southeast Asia and Australasia . They are small birds with short rounded wings and tails . Most species have green bodies , and all but one have the red tail that gives the genus its scientific name Erythrura , which is derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> <unk> , " red " , and ουρά oura , " tail " . The English name of Fijian Fire @-@ tail Finch was used in early writings . 
 The Fiji parrotfinch was initially described by American naturalist and entomologist Titian Peale . As chief naturalist for the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838 – 1842 led by Charles Wilkes , Peale collected and preserved many specimens , including the red @-@ throated parrotfinch from Samoa and the Fiji parrotfinch from Vanua Levu . Peale named the latter species as <unk> <unk> . Peale 's birds were reviewed by German physician and ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub . Hartlaub moved the Fiji species to the genus Erythrura , and then had to change the specific name , since another bird , the pin @-@ tailed parrotfinch already had the binomial E. <unk> . He renamed the Fiji bird as E. <unk> in honour of its finder . The Fijian common names <unk> and <unk> are derived from " kula " , red . 
 The Fiji parrotfinch and the royal parrotfinch of northern Vanuatu are now again usually considered to be distinct species , but they were formerly frequently treated as subspecies of the Samoan red @-@ headed parrotfinch , E. <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Fiji parrotfinch is a small finch , 10 cm ( 4 in ) in length . The adult male has a bright green body and wings , red head , and scarlet rump and tail . The blackish feathering of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before fading into the green of the underparts . The stubby bill is blackish @-@ grey , the eyes are reddish @-@ brown and the legs and feet are pinkish @-@ brown . The female is very similar to the male , but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks . Young birds have a dark @-@ tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red , but the rest of the plumage is like the adult . Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months . Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue , apparently due to a natural mutation . 
 The flight of the Fiji parrotfinch is fast and undulating with rapid wingbeats , and frequent calling . It tends to fly fairly high , landing in the tree tops , then descending to seek food . Its call is a high , thin seep or peep , similar to those of other parrotfinches such as blue @-@ faced and red @-@ throated , and is often repeated in bursts of varying length . The song is a long whistled double note similar to , but less urgent , than that of the orange @-@ breasted myzomela , a Fijian endemic honeyeater . 
 Fiji has another Erythrura species , the rare and endangered pink @-@ billed parrotfinch . This is a larger bird with a green head , blue crown and black face , and a very large pink bill . The Fiji parrotfinch resembles the closely related royal and red @-@ headed parrotfinches , and the rare blue @-@ headed variant is very like the blue @-@ faced parrotfinch , but these three species do not occur in Fiji . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Fiji parrotfinch is endemic to Fiji , where it is found on the four largest islands ( Viti Levu , Vanua Levu , Taveuni and Kadavu ) and also in the smaller western islands of the Mamanuca and the Yasawa groups . It is uncommon but widespread , found in both forested and open habitats , from sea level to at least 1 @,@ 200 m ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) on Viti Levu . It appears to be less common on Taveuni than the larger islands . It has adapted well to man @-@ made habitats , and is seen in grasslands , pasture , rice paddies , parks and gardens . Many parrotfinch species are mainly forest birds , but American ornithologist Jared Diamond has suggested that in the central Pacific , where there are no seed @-@ eating munias occupying the open habitats , species such as Vanuatu 's blue @-@ faced parrotfinch and its Fijian relative have expanded into grassy areas of their islands to exploit the supply of seeds . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 This species has a courtship flight conducted above the trees . The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending while the other is descending , both calling constantly . After display , the birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills , followed by the female hanging upside @-@ down for a variable period of time , and then copulation while the male holds the female 's neck . The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three @-@ coloured and red @-@ throated parrotfinches , and may be typical for the genus . The nest is built with fresh grass blades , and is domed with a side entrance . It is always hidden in thick foliage , but can be at any height from the ground . The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs . Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin ; the distinctive gape has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at the upper and lower corners , and the yellow palate has a ring of five black spots . Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against the side , but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent . This behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings . 
 When not breeding , the Fiji parrotfinch is gregarious , and is usually found in small flocks of up to six birds . It feeds on seeds , usually at the " milk " ( watery ripe ) stage . A favourite is the Guinea grass , <unk> maximus . The finch will also take seed from rice ears , and its spread into gardens has been aided by another preferred food plant , carpet grass , <unk> compressus , which is a common lawn grass in Fiji . This finch readily takes insects , often extracted from under loose bark or tree crevices . It also feeds on nectar and small berries . In some areas , this finch 's diet may bring it into conflict with rice growers , but there is no evidence that this protected species is seen as a serious agricultural threat either in Fiji , or in Australia , where it is kept in captivity in small numbers . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 The common endemic Fiji goshawk is a specialist predator of small and medium @-@ sized birds , and the swamp harrier is also a widespread predator , often taking fledglings . The local subspecies of the peregrine falcon , Falco peregrinus nesiotes will hunt finches , but is itself rare and declining . Barn owls eat mainly rats , but sometimes take small birds . Rats and mice use Fiji parrotfinch nests , and may be significant predators of the species , and the small Asian mongoose will prey on birds feeding on the ground . The fan @-@ tailed cuckoo , which has an endemic Fijian subspecies , is a brood parasite , but the parrotfinch does not appear to be a host of this large cuckoo . 
 No specific parasites of Fiji parrotfinch have been recorded , but <unk> and avian malaria , both spread by parasites , have been found in captive populations of other parrotfinch species . 
 = = Status = = 
 The Fijian parrotfinch is endemic to a single country ; although its population is unknown , it is described as uncommon or locally common . In the absence of evidence for any decline in numbers , its population is believed to be stable , and it is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji 's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002 , which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction , but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated . In the early 20th century , Europeans in Fiji kept these finches as cagebirds , calling them croton finches because of their liking for the croton bush , but the pet trade appears not to be a significant factor at present . 
 Fiji 's native birdlife has been badly affected by agriculture , deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses . Although Important Bird Areas have been established on Taveuni and the forest east of Vanua Levu , conservation problems persist . The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man @-@ made landscapes ; it is neither a ground nor hole nester , so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas . Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity . The potential introduction of other species , such as snakes , or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species . 
 = South Carolina @-@ class battleship = 
 The South Carolina @-@ class battleships , also known as the Michigan @-@ class , were built during the first decade of the twentieth century for the United States Navy . Named South Carolina and Michigan , they were the first American dreadnoughts — powerful warships whose capabilities far outstripped those of the world 's older battleships . 
 In the opening years of the twentieth century , the prevailing theory of naval combat was that battles would continue to be fought at relatively close range using many small , fast @-@ firing guns . As such , each of the ships in the United States ' previous battleship class ( the Connecticut class ) had many medium @-@ sized weapons alongside four large guns . This paradigm , however , was soon to be subverted , as American naval theorists proposed that a ship mounting a homogeneous battery of large guns would be more effective in battle . 
 As their ideas began to enjoy wider acceptance , the US Congress authorized the country 's Navy to construct two small 16 @,@ 000 long tons ( 16 @,@ 257 t ) battleships . This displacement was roughly the same size as the Connecticut class and at least 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 032 t ) smaller than the foreign standard . A solution was found in an ambitious design drawn up by Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps , the chief of the navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair , which featured heavy armament and relatively thick armor , both favored by naval theorists . However , in balancing the congressionally mandated limits to displacement and the inherent design trade @-@ offs between armament , armor , and propulsion , the South Carolina class ' speed was severely limited — an ultimately fatal disadvantage that severely limited their utility in a conflict . 
 With their superfiring main armament , press accounts billed South Carolina and Michigan , alongside the British HMS Dreadnought , as heralding a new epoch in warship design . Both , however , were soon surpassed by ever @-@ larger and stronger super @-@ dreadnoughts . The class ' low top speed of about 18 @.@ 5 kn ( 21 mph ; 34 km / h ) , as compared to the 21 kn ( 24 mph ; 39 km / h ) standard of later American battleships , relegated them to serving with older , obsolete battleships during the First World War . Thereafter , both South Carolinas were scrapped with the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1901 , the US Navy 's battleship designs reflected the prevailing theory of naval combat — that battles would initially be fought at some distance , but the ships would then approach to close range for the final blows , when shorter @-@ range , faster @-@ firing guns would prove most useful . The premier battleship class then under construction carried four large 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) , eight 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) , and twelve 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) guns , a striking power slightly heavier than typical foreign battleships of the time . 
 The Naval Institute 's Proceedings magazine devoted space in two of its 1902 issues to possible improvements in battleship design . The first article was authored by Lieutenant Matt H. Signor , who argued for a ship with 13 @-@ inch ( 330 mm ) and 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) / 40 caliber guns in four triple turrets . The secondary battery would be composed of 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 60 guns . This paper provoked enough thought that Proceedings published comments on the story from Captain William M. Folger , Professor P.R. Alger and naval constructor David W. Taylor — an up @-@ and @-@ coming officer and future head of the Bureau of Construction and Repair ( C & R ) . These comments expressed doubt that the proposed vessel could be modified into a feasible design , but they praised his thoughts as a step in the right direction . Alger believed that Signor was on the right track in suggesting larger armament , though he thought that triple turrets would be unworkable and eight 12 @-@ inch guns in four twin turrets would be a much more realistic arrangement . Naval historian Norman Friedman believes that this was one of the " earliest serious proposals for a homogeneous big @-@ gun battery . " 
 The suggestion leading directly to the South Carolina class came from Homer Poundstone , a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy , who became the principal proponent of an American all @-@ big @-@ gun design . In a December 1902 paper written for President Theodore Roosevelt , he argued for greatly increasing the size of current battleships , although he also supported retaining mixed main batteries . However , by the March and June 1903 editions of Proceedings , Poundstone began advocating for an all @-@ big @-@ gun arrangement , featuring twelve 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) guns mounted on a 19 @,@ 330 long tons ( 19 @,@ 640 t ) ship . In October of the same year , the Italian naval architect Vittorio Cuniberti presented a similar idea in an article for Jane 's Fighting Ships entitled " An Ideal Battleship for the British Navy " . He argued in favor of a ship with twelve 12 @-@ inch guns on a slightly larger displacement than the battleships in service at the time , 17 @,@ 000 long tons ( 17 @,@ 273 t ) . He believed that the higher weight would allow 12 inches of armor and machinery capable of propelling the ship at 24 kn ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . Poundstone used what he believed to be the great popularity for this idea among Europeans to justify the all @-@ big @-@ gun design . 
 In 1903 , Poundstone 's designs began receiving attention from American naval authorities . After being refined by Washington Irving Chambers , Poundstone 's work was brought to the Naval War College , where it was tested in war games during the 1903 Newport Conference . The results indicated that a theoretical battleship that dispensed with the intermediate 8- and 7 @-@ inch armament and was armed with only twelve 11- or 12 @-@ inch guns , all able to fire on a single broadside , was worth three of the battleships then in service . According to the men who conducted the tests , the main reasoning for the finding was that the measure of effective gun ranges was directly related to the maximum length of an enemy 's torpedo range . At this time , the latter was roughly 3 @,@ 000 yd ( 2 @,@ 743 m ) ; at that distance , the 7- and 8 @-@ inch guns common to American intermediate batteries would not be able to penetrate the armor of enemy battleships . Worse still , it was certain that — as the United States was developing a 4 @,@ 000 yd ( 3 @,@ 658 m ) torpedo — gun range would have to rise in the near future , making the intermediate guns even less useful . However , a homogeneous main battery of 11- or 12 @-@ inch guns would be able to penetrate the armor and have sufficient explosive power to disable an enemy capital ship , and adding as many 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) guns as possible would provide a strong defense against torpedo @-@ carrying but unarmored destroyers .

 Faced with this evidence , the General Board sent a formal request in October 1903 to C & R , asking it to draw up plans for a battleship including these characteristics . No progress had been made by 26 January 1904 , when the General Board asked C & R for a design including four 12 @-@ inch guns , eight 10 @-@ inch or larger guns , and no intermediate armament beyond 3 @-@ inch anti @-@ destroyer guns . The move to only 10 @-@ inch weaponry was the result of doubt among naval authorities that heavier guns could physically be mounted on a ship 's broadside . No action was taken on this request until September , when C & R began planning a ship with four 12 @-@ inch guns in dual turrets along with eight dual 10 @-@ inch or four single 12 @-@ inch guns . 
 Meanwhile , the Naval War College played three battleship designs against each other at its 1904 Newport Conference : the ships that were built following the 1903 conference ; the new C & R design from September ; and the latest battleships under construction , the Connecticut class . The 7- and 8 @-@ inch guns , and even the 10 @-@ inch guns , were demonstrated again to be unsatisfactory ; even when hitting a battleship at the ideal angle of 90 ° to its belt , they failed to pierce beyond 12 inches of Krupp armor — not enough to counter enemy capital ships . Speed calculations were also performed which demonstrated that even a 3 kn ( 6 km / h ; 3 mph ) advantage over an enemy fleet would be inconsequential in the final outcome of almost all naval battles because the slower ships could stay within range by turning on a tighter radius . 
 Within the naval bureaus , however , there was still much resistance . In mid @-@ to @-@ late 1904 , Poundstone continued to lobby the General Board while C & R protested that the final determinant in a naval battle would be the light guns — and in any case such a large uniform battery was not feasible . Poundstone replied with a design of his own creation , which he called USS Possible and fit twelve 11 @-@ inch guns on a ship that displaced 19 @,@ 330 long tons . With support from Lieutenant Commander William Sims , who was able to cite the increasingly accurate long @-@ gunnery of the Navy , and interest shown in the project by President Roosevelt , the bureaucratic stalling ended . 
 On 3 March 1905 , Congress passed a bill that authorized the Navy to construct two new battleships to be named after the states of South Carolina and Michigan . The maximum tonnage limit was set at 16000 long tons , the same weight as the mixed @-@ battery Connecticut class of two years prior , in an attempt to stem the rising displacement — and accompanying costs — of the Navy 's new capital ships . The provision was met with a mixed reception from naval designers . Some , including retired Admiral of the Navy George Dewey , thought the limit should have been set at the minimum standard of foreign battleships , or around 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ 289 t ) . Others believed adding a significant amount of speed or firepower — something one would expect with an increase in tonnage — would require much more than 18 @,@ 000 tons , and argued that the increase in size would buy nothing more than an increased target profile . 
 The Constructor of the Navy , Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps , devised an ambitious design that packed powerful armament and thick armor onto the small hull . He believed that future naval battles would involve fleets rather than single @-@ ship actions , and so while the wing turrets so common in European designs were useful in the latter role for putting a maximum amount of firepower in any given direction , they were less so when operating as part of a line of battle . From this , Capps theorized that the principal concern of battleships was how much shell weight they could fire per broadside . The arrangement of superfiring turrets placed on the centerline would allow the hull to be as short as possible while still having the most powerful broadside possible . A ship with its main battery placed along the center of the ship can focus the same amount of fire to port or starboard during a broadside . This is juxtaposed against wing turrets , which had significant shortcomings : their location on the left or right of a ship 's superstructure led to smaller possible broadsides , and the extreme weight placed on the sides of the ships led to torsional stress and rolling inertia . 
 As the additional main battery turrets with their associated magazines used a great amount of space within each already @-@ limited ship , Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit . Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines , both of which were larger than usual . Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection . The biggest drawback was in propulsion : there was no room for engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships . Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one @-@ third to make room ; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion , for which he would have needed extra room . All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads . 
 The designers were running into the problem that Friedman calls the " squeeze " : the essential elements of a battleship ( armament , propulsion machinery , and armor ) typically added up to about sixty percent of their design displacement ; favoring one of these factors , the " three primary military qualities " , would mean accepting compromises in one or both of the others . 
 In the end , the choice of armament and armor meant that the South Carolinas top speed was lower than HMS Dreadnought , the namesake British ship built shortly before the South Carolinas , and all future US battleships . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 At a design displacement of 16 @,@ 000 long tons , the South Carolina class dreadnoughts were the same size as their Connecticut @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought predecessors . In service , they could actually be lighter : Louisiana had a standard displacement of 15 @,@ 272 long tons ( 15 @,@ 517 t ) , while Michigan was only 14 @,@ 891 long tons ( 15 @,@ 130 t ) by the same measurement . The ship 's hull size was also comparable to the Connecticuts , with a length of 452 ft 9 in ( 138 m ) overall , 450 ft ( 137 m ) between perpendiculars , and the same at the waterline . The class ' beam was 80 ft 2 @.@ 5 in ( 24 m ) , draft was 24 ft 6 in ( 7 m ) , and metacentric height was 6 @.@ 9 ft ( 2 m ) normally , coming in slightly lower at 6 @.@ 3 ft ( 2 m ) when at full load . They were designed to carry about 869 men . 
 The South Carolinas had a propulsion system consisting of two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines driving two 3 @-@ bladed screws . These were in turn powered by twelve coal @-@ fired superheating Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers located in three watertight compartments . Together , they weighed 1 @,@ 555 long tons ( 1 @,@ 580 t ) , which was just over the specified contract limit . Traditional triple @-@ expansion engines were installed rather than the steam turbines used in the British Dreadnought . The actual coal capacity of the ships was 2 @,@ 374 long tons ( 2 @,@ 412 t ) at full load , slightly more than the designed maximum of 2 @,@ 200 long tons ( 2 @,@ 235 t ) , allowing for an endurance of 6 @,@ 950 nmi ( 12 @,@ 871 km ; 7 @,@ 998 mi ) at 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . While both ships surpassed 20 kn ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) in idealized trial conditions , the navy expected that the normal top speed would be around 18 @.@ 5 kn ( 34 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 The class ' main battery consisted of eight 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) / 45 caliber Mark 5 guns in four turrets , one pair fore and one aft , with 100 rounds for each gun . The guns were placed in an innovative superfiring arrangement , where one turret was mounted slightly behind and above the other . The anti @-@ torpedo @-@ boat secondary armament of twenty @-@ two 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) guns was mounted in casemates , and the two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes were placed beneath the waterline , one on each side of the ship . 
 Armor on the South Carolina class was described by naval author Siegfried Breyer as " remarkably progressive " , despite deficiencies in horizontal and underwater protection . The belt was thicker over the magazines , 12 to 10 inches ( 305 to 254 mm ) , than over the propulsion , 11 to 9 inches ( 279 to 229 mm ) , and in front of the forward magazines , 10 to 8 inches ( 254 to 203 mm ) . The casemates were also protected with 10 to 8 inches of armor , while the deck armor varied from 2 @.@ 5 to 1 inch ( 64 to 25 mm ) . The turrets and conning tower had the heaviest armor , with 12 – 8 – 2 @.@ 5 inches ( face / side / roof ; 305 – 203 – 63 @.@ 5 mm ) and 12 to 2 inches ( 305 to 51 mm ) , respectively . The barbettes were protected with 10 to 8 inches of armor . The total weight of the armor amounted to 31 @.@ 4 % of the design displacement , slightly more than the next three battleship classes .

 The contracts for the class were awarded on 20 and 21 July , respectively . Without armor or armament , South Carolina would cost $ 3 @,@ 540 @,@ 000 , while Michigan would come in at $ 3 @,@ 585 @,@ 000 . With armor and armament , the ships cost about $ 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 each . 
 Michigan 's keel was laid down on 17 December 1906 , one day before South Carolina 's . After the initial construction periods , the ships were launched on 26 May and 11 July 1908 ( respectively ) . Michigan was slightly more than half complete when launched , and the ship was christened by Carol Newberry , the daughter of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Truman Handy Newberry . The warship was billed as epoch @-@ making , and the spectacle drew many prominent individuals , including the governor and lieutenant @-@ governor of Michigan , the governor of New Jersey , the mayor of Detroit , and the secretary of the Interior Department , along with many naval admirals and constructors . Like its sister ship , South Carolina was just over halfway completed when it was launched . The accompanying ceremony took place just after noon and was attended by many notable residents of the state of South Carolina , including Governor Martin Frederick Ansel . His daughter Frederica christened the ship . 
 After their fitting @-@ out stage , the two ships were put through sea trials to ensure they met their contracted specifications . The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy 's traditional testing grounds off Rockland , Maine beginning on 9 June 1909 . Although the ship completed its standardization run , other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar . Although Michigan was pulled off without incident , the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair , delaying the completion of the trials until 20 – 24 June . The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910 — making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission , behind the United Kingdom and Germany , but just ahead of Brazil 's Minas Geraes class — and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June . 
 South Carolina 's trials were conducted off the Delaware Capes beginning on 24 August 1909 , and its standardization runs were slightly faster than Michigan 's . After final modifications at William Cramp , South Carolina was commissioned on 1 March 1910 and departed for a shakedown cruise six days later . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After being commissioned , both ships were assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet . The two operated up and down the American east coast from July until November . On 2 November , as part of the Second Battleship Division , the ships left the Boston Navy Yard for a training voyage to Europe , where they visited the Isle of Portland in the United Kingdom and Cherbourg in France . In January 1911 , they returned to the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba before continuing to another base in Norfolk . After further maneuvers , the two ships split up ; Michigan remained on the east coast , while South Carolina embarked on another trip to Europe . The ship visited Copenhagen ( Denmark ) , Stockholm ( Sweden ) , Kronstadt ( Russia ) , and Kiel ( Germany ) — the last during Kieler Woche , a large sailing event — before returning in July 1911 . 
 South Carolina next took part in the 1911 naval review in New York , before several months of traveling to ports on the east coast and welcoming a visiting German naval squadron including the battlecruiser SMS Moltke and two light cruisers . After a three @-@ month overhaul in Norfolk , South Carolina joined Michigan on a cruise to Pensacola , New Orleans , Galveston , and Veracruz in Mexico , as part of the Special Service Squadron . South Carolina later visited Colon , Panama in January 1913 . Both ships continued their previous service of visiting east coast ports before unrest in Mexico and the Caribbean caused the American government to order them away . South Carolina landed marines on Haiti on 28 January to protect the American delegation there . They returned to the ship when Oreste <unk> took power , but continued disorder later led the United States to occupy Haiti . South Carolina then joined Michigan at Vera Cruz while the United States occupied that city . 
 At the beginning of the First World War , both of the South Carolina @-@ class battleships were grouped with two older pre @-@ dreadnoughts ( Vermont and Connecticut due to their top speeds , which were lower than all subsequent US battleships . South Carolina was refitted in Philadelphia between 14 October and 20 February 1915 , and both ships were kept on neutrality patrols on the American side of the Atlantic , even after the US entered the war on 6 April 1917 . In January 1918 , Michigan was training with the main fleet when it traveled through a strong storm . The high winds and waves caused its forward cage mast to collapse , killing six and injuring thirteen . 
 On 6 September 1918 , South Carolina escorted a fast convoy partway across the Atlantic , becoming one of the first American battleships ( alongside New Hampshire and Kansas ) to do so . When returning to the United States , South Carolina lost its starboard propeller . When continuing with the port propeller , a valve in its engine malfunctioned ; continuing with an auxiliary valve caused a large amount of vibration , so the ship was stopped just hours later for temporary repairs on the main valve before continuing to the Philadelphia Naval Yard for repairs . Michigan had the same problem when escorting a convoy in the next month ; the ship lost its port propeller on 8 October , but managed to return home on 11 October without further incident . After the war 's end on 11 November 1918 , both South Carolina @-@ class battleships were used to repatriate American soldiers that had been fighting in the war . 
 In the years after the war , the two battleships were used for training cruises . The terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty , which limited naval construction to avert a vastly expensive naval arms race , also called for disposing of dozens of older battleships in the signatories ' navies . South Carolina was decommissioned on 15 December 1921 , shortly before the end of the conference , and its sister followed on 11 February 1922 , days after the treaty was signed . Both were stricken from the navy listing on 10 November 1923 and scrapped during 1924 in the Philadelphia Naval Yard .

 Sandra Cisneros ( born December 20 , 1954 ) is an American writer best known for her acclaimed first novel The House on Mango Street ( 1984 ) and her subsequent short story collection Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories ( 1991 ) . Her work experiments with literary forms and investigates emerging subject positions , which Cisneros herself attributes to growing up in a context of cultural hybridity and economic inequality that endowed her with unique stories to tell . She is the recipient of numerous awards including a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship , and is regarded as a key figure in Chicana literature . 
 Cisneros 's early life provided many experiences she would later draw on as a writer : she grew up as the only daughter in a family of six brothers , which often made her feel isolated , and the constant migration of her family between Mexico and the United States instilled in her the sense of " always straddling two countries ... but not belonging to either culture . " Cisneros 's work deals with the formation of Chicana identity , exploring the challenges of being caught between Mexican and Anglo @-@ American cultures , facing the misogynist attitudes present in both these cultures , and experiencing poverty . For her insightful social critique and powerful prose style , Cisneros has achieved recognition far beyond Chicano and Latino communities , to the extent that The House on Mango Street has been translated worldwide and is taught in American classrooms as a coming @-@ of @-@ age novel . 
 Cisneros has held a variety of professional positions , working as a teacher , a counselor , a college recruiter , a poet @-@ in @-@ the @-@ schools , and an arts administrator , and has maintained a strong commitment to community and literary causes . In 1998 she established the Macondo Writers Workshop , which provides socially conscious workshops for writers , and in 2000 she founded the Alfredo Cisneros Del Moral Foundation , which awards talented writers connected to Texas . Cisneros currently resides in San Antonio , Texas . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Cisneros was born in Chicago , Illinois on December 20 , 1954 , the third of seven children . The only surviving daughter , she considered herself the " odd number in a set of men " . Cisneros 's great @-@ grandfather had played the piano for the Mexican president and was from a wealthy background , but he gambled away his family 's fortune . Her paternal grandfather was a veteran of the Mexican Revolution , and he used what money he had saved to give her father , Alfredo Cisneros de Moral , the opportunity to go to college . However , after failing classes due to what Cisneros called his " lack of interest " in studying , Alfredo ran away to the United States to escape his father 's anger . While roaming the southern United States with his brother , Alfredo visited Chicago where he met Elvira Cordero Anguiano . After getting married , the pair settled in one of Chicago 's poorest neighborhoods . Cisneros 's biographer Robin Ganz writes that she acknowledges her mother 's family name came from a very humble background , tracing its roots back to Guanajuato , Mexico , while her father 's was much more " admirable " . 
 Taking work as an upholsterer to support his family , Cisneros 's father began " a compulsive circular migration between Chicago and Mexico City that became the dominating pattern of Cisneros 's childhood . " Their family was constantly moving between the two countries , which necessitated their finding new places to live as well as schools for the children . Eventually the instability caused Cisneros 's six brothers to pair off in twos , leaving her to define herself as the isolated one . Her feelings of exclusion from the family were exacerbated by her father , who referred to his " <unk> hijos y una <unk> " ( " six sons and one daughter " ) rather than his " <unk> hijos " ( " seven children " ) . Ganz notes that Cisneros 's childhood loneliness was instrumental in shaping her later passion for writing . Cisneros ’ s one strong female influence was her mother , Elvira , who was a voracious reader and more enlightened and socially conscious than her father . According to Ganz , although Elvira was too dependent on her husband and too restricted in her opportunities to fulfill her own potential , she ensured her daughter would not suffer from the same disadvantages as she did . 
 Her family made a down @-@ payment on their own home in Humboldt Park , a predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago 's West Side when she was eleven years old . This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros 's novel The House on Mango Street . For high school , Cisneros attended <unk> Academy , a small Catholic all @-@ girls school . Here she found an ally in a high @-@ school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War . Although , Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten , with her teacher 's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high @-@ school years . In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor , but , according to herself , she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974 . After that it took a while to find her own voice . She explains , " I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets I admired in books : big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke , all wrong for me . " 
 Cisneros was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976 , and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Iowa Writers ' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978 . It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential . She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences between her and her classmates : " It wasn 't as if I didn 't know who I was . I knew I was a Mexican woman . But , I didn 't think it had anything to do with why I felt so much imbalance in my life , whereas it had everything to do with it ! My race , my gender , and my class ! And it didn 't make sense until that moment , sitting in that seminar . That 's when I decided I would write about something my classmates couldn 't write about . " She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates , realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of , her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration . From then on , she would write of her " neighbors , the people [ she ] saw , the poverty that the women had gone through . " 
 Cisneros says of this moment : 
 So to me it began there , and that 's when I intentionally started writing about all the things in my culture that were different from them — the poems that are these city voices — the first part of Wicked Wicked Ways — and the stories in House on Mango Street . I think it 's ironic that at the moment when I was practically leaving an institution of learning , I began realizing in which ways institutions had failed me . 
 Drawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets , Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with . Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros 's passion for hearing the personal stories that people tell and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work , such as the " thousands of silent women " whose struggles are portrayed in The House on Mango Street . 
 Five years after receiving her MFA , she returned to Loyola University Chicago , where she had previously earned a BA in English , to work as an administrative assistant . Prior to this job , she worked in the Chicano barrio in Chicago teaching to high school dropouts at Latino Youth High School . Through these jobs , she gained more experience with the problems of young Latino Americans .

 In addition to being an author and poet , Cisneros has held various academic and teaching positions . In 1978 , after finishing her MFA degree , she taught former high @-@ school dropouts at the Latino Youth High School in Chicago . The 1984 publication of The House on Mango Street secured her a succession of Writer @-@ in @-@ Residence posts at universities in the United States , teaching creative writing at institutions such as the University of California , Berkeley and the University of Michigan . She was subsequently a Writer @-@ in @-@ Residence at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio , Texas . Cisneros has also worked as a college recruiter and an arts administrator . 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Cisneros currently resides in San Miguel de Allende , a city in central Mexico , but for years she lived and wrote in San Antonio , Texas , in her briefly controversial " Mexican @-@ pink " home with " many creatures little and large . " In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family , " I 've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone , " Cisneros replied . " My writing is my child and I don 't want anything to come between us . " She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write . In the introduction to the third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa 's Borderlands / La Frontera : The New <unk> , Cisneros wrote : " It 's why I moved from Illinois to Texas . So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself . To reinvent myself if I had to . As Latinas , we have to ... Because writing is like putting your head underwater . " 
 = = = Writing process = = = 
 Cisneros 's writing is often influenced by her personal experiences and by observations of the people in her community . She once confided to other writers at a conference in Santa Fe that she writes down " snippets of dialogue or monologue — records of conversations she hears wherever she goes . " These snippets are then mixed and matched to create her stories . Names for her characters often come from the San Antonio phone book ; " she leafs through the listings for a last name then repeats the process for a first name . " By mixing and matching she is assured that she is not appropriating anyone 's real name or real story , but at the same time her versions of characters and stories are believable . 
 Cisneros once found herself so immersed in the characters of her book Woman Hollering Creek that they began to infiltrate her subconscious mind . Once while she was writing the story " Eyes of Zapata , " she awoke " in the middle of the night , convinced for the moment that she was Ines , the young bride of the Mexican revolutionary . Her dream conversation with Zapata then became those characters 's dialogue in her story . " 
 Her <unk> and bilingualism are also very important aspects of her writing . Cisneros was quoted by Robin Ganz as saying that she is grateful to have " twice as many words to pick from ... two ways of looking at the world , " and Ganz referred to her " wide range of experience " as a " double @-@ edged sword . " Cisneros 's ability to speak two languages and to write about her two cultures gives her a unique position from where she is able to tell not just her story , but also the stories of those around her . 
 = = = Community legacy = = = 
 Cisneros has been instrumental in building a strong community in San Antonio among other artists and writers through her work with the Macondo Foundation and the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation . The Macondo Foundation , which is named after the town in Gabriel García Márquez 's book One Hundred Years of Solitude , " works with dedicated and compassionate writers who view their work and talents as part of a larger task of community @-@ building and non @-@ violent social change . " Officially incorporated in 2006 , the foundation began in 1998 as a small workshop that took place in Cisneros 's kitchen . The Macondo Writers Workshop , which has since become an annual event , brings together writers " working on geographic , cultural , economic , social and spiritual borders " and has grown from 15 participants to over 120 participants in the first 9 years . Currently working out of Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio , the Macondo Foundation makes awards such as the Gloria E. Anzaldúa Milagro Award honoring the memory of Anzaldúa , a fellow Chicana writer who died in 2004 , by providing Chicano writers with support when they are in need of some time to heal their " body , heart or spirit " and the Elvira Cordero Cisneros Award which was created in memory of Sandra Cisneros 's mother . Macondo offers services to member writers such as health insurance and the opportunity to participate in the Casa Azul Residency Program . The Residency Program provides writers with a furnished room and office in the Casa Azul , a blue house across the street from where Cisneros lives in San Antonio , which is also the headquarters of the Macondo Foundation . In creating this program , Cisneros " imagined the Casa as a space where <unk> could retreat from the distractions of everyday life , and have a room of his / her own for the process of emotional , intellectual and spiritual introspection . " 
 Cisneros founded the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral Foundation in 2000 . Named in the memory of her father , the foundation " has awarded over $ 75 @,@ 500 to writers born in Texas , writing about Texas , or living in Texas since 2007 " . Its intention is to honour Cisneros 's father 's memory by showcasing writers who are as proud of their craft as Alfredo was of his craft as an upholsterer . 
 = = = Chicano literary movement = = = 
 Literary critic Claudia Sadowski @-@ Smith has called Cisneros " perhaps the most famous Chicana writer " , and she has been acknowledged as a pioneer in her literary field as the first female Mexican @-@ American writer to have her work published by a mainstream publisher . In 1989 , The House on Mango Street , which was originally published by the small Hispanic publishing company Arte Público Press , was reissued in a second edition by Vintage Press ; and in 1991 Woman Hollering Creek was published by Random House . As Ganz observes , previously only male Chicano authors had successfully made the crossover from smaller publishers . That Cisneros had garnered enough attention to be taken on by Vintage Press said a lot about the possibility for Chicano literature to become more widely recognized . Cisneros spoke of her success and what it meant for Chicana literature in an interview on National Public Radio on 19 September 1991 : 
 I think I can 't be happy if I 'm the only one that 's getting published by Random House when I know there are such magnificent writers — both Latinos and Latinas , both Chicanos and Chicanas — in the U.S. whose books are not published by mainstream presses or whom the mainstream isn 't even aware of . And , you know , if my success means that other presses will take a second look at these writers ... and publish them in larger numbers then our ship will come in . 
 As a pioneer Chicana author , Cisneros filled a void by bringing to the fore a genre that had previously been at the margins of mainstream literature . With her first novel , The House on Mango Street , she moved away from the poetic style that was common in Chicana literature at the time and began to define a " distinctive Chicana literary space " , challenging familiar literary forms and addressing subjects such as gender inequality and the marginalization of cultural minorities . According to literary critic <unk> E Quintana , The House on Mango Street is a book that has reached beyond the Chicano and Latino literary communities , and is now read by people of all ethnicities . Quintana states that Cisneros 's writing is accessible for both <unk> and Mexican @-@ Americans alike since it is free from anger or accusation , presenting the issues ( such as Chicana identity and gender inequalities ) in an approachable way . Cisneros ’ s writing has been influential in shaping both Chicana and feminist literature . Quintana sees her fiction as a form of social commentary , contributing to a literary tradition that resembles the work of contemporary cultural anthropologists in its attempt to authentically represent the cultural experience of a group of people , and acknowledges Cisneros 's contribution to Chicana feminist aesthetics by bringing women to the center as empowered protagonists in much of her work . 
 = = Writing style = = 
 = = = Bilingualism = = = 
 Cisneros often incorporates Spanish into her English writing , substituting Spanish words for English ones where she feels that Spanish better conveys the meaning or improves the rhythm of the passage . However , where possible she constructs sentences so that non @-@ Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context . In Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories Cisneros writes : " La <unk> . Such a funny name for such a lovely arroyo . But that 's what they called the creek that ran behind the house . " Even if the English @-@ speaking reader does not initially know that arroyo means creek , Cisneros soon translates it in a way that does not interrupt the flow of the text . She enjoys manipulating the two languages , creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases . In the same book Cisneros writes : " And at the next full moon , I gave light , <unk> Chucha holding up our handsome , strong @-@ lunged boy . " Previous sentences inform the reader that a baby is being born , but only a Spanish speaker will notice that " I gave light " is a literal translation of the Spanish " <unk> a <unk> " which means " I gave birth . " Cisneros joins other Hispanic @-@ American US writers such as Gloria Anzaldúa , Piri Thomas , Giannina Braschi , and Junot Díaz who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English . Cisneros noted on this process : " All of a sudden something happens to the English , something really new is happening , a new spice is added to the English language . " Spanish always has a role in Cisneros 's work , even when she writes in English . As she discovered , after writing The House on Mango Street primarily in English , " the syntax , the sensibility , the diminutives , the way of looking at inanimate objects " were all characteristic of Spanish . For Cisneros , Spanish brings to her work not only colourful expressions , but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude . 
 = = = Narrative modes , diction , and apparent simplicity = = = 
 Cisneros 's fiction comes in various forms — as novels , poems , and short stories — by which she challenges both social conventions , with her " celebratory breaking of sexual taboos and trespassing across the restrictions that limit the lives and experiences of Chicanas " , and literary ones , with her " bold experimentation with literary voice and her development of a hybrid form that weaves poetry into prose " . Published in 1991 , Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories is a collection of twenty @-@ two short stories that form a collage of narrative techniques , each serving to engage and affect the reader in a different way . Cisneros alternates between first person , third person , and stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness narrative modes , and ranges from brief impressionistic vignettes to longer event @-@ driven stories , and from highly poetic language to brutally frank realist language . Some stories lack a narrator to mediate between the characters and the reader ; they are instead composed of textual fragments or conversations " overheard " by the reader . For example , " Little Miracles , Kept Promises " is composed of fictional notes asking for the blessings of patron saints , and " The Marlboro Man " transcribes a gossiping telephone conversation between two female characters . 
 Works by Cisneros can appear simple at first reading , but this is deceptive . She invites the reader to move beyond the text by recognizing larger social processes within the microcosm of everyday life : the phone conversation in " The Marlboro Man " is not merely idle gossip , but a text that allows the reader to dig into the characters ' psyches and analyze their cultural influences . Literary critics have noted how Cisneros tackles complex theoretical and social issues through the vehicle of apparently simple characters and situations . For example , Ramón Saldívar observes that The House on Mango Street " represents from the simplicity of childhood vision the enormously complex process of the construction of the gendered subject " . In the same vein , Felicia J. Cruz describes how each individual will interact differently with Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories , thus eliciting such varied reader responses as " it is about growing up " , to " it 's about a Chicana 's growing up " , to " it is a critique of patriarchal structures and exclusionary practices " . Cisneros ’ s writing is rich not only for its symbolism and imagery , deemed by critic Deborah L Madsen to be " both technically and aesthetically accomplished " , but also for its social commentary and power to " evoke highly personal responses " . this helped her achieve the way she taught . 
 = = Literary themes = = 
 = = = Place = = = 
 When Cisneros describes the aspirations and struggles of Chicanas , the theme of place often emerges . Place refers not only to her novels ' geographic locations , but also to the positions her characters hold within their social context . Chicanas frequently occupy Anglo @-@ dominated and male @-@ dominated places where they are subject to a variety of oppressive and prejudicial behaviors ; one of these places that is of particular interest to Cisneros is the home . As literary critics Deborah L. Madsen and Ramón Saldívar have described , the home can be an oppressive place for Chicanas where they are subjugated to the will of male heads @-@ of @-@ household , or in the case of their own home , it can be an empowering place where they can act autonomously and express themselves creatively . In The House on Mango Street the young protagonist , Esperanza , longs to have her own house : " Not a flat . Not an apartment in back . Not a man 's house . Not a daddy 's . A house all my own . With my porch and my pillow , my pretty purple petunias . My books and my stories . My two shoes waiting beside the bed . Nobody to shake a stick at . Nobody 's garbage to pick up after . " An aspiring writer , Esperanza yearns for " a space for myself to go , clean as paper before the poem . " She feels discontented and trapped in her family home , and witnesses other women in the same position . According to Saldívar , Cisneros communicates through this character that a woman needs her own place in order to realize her full potential — a home which is not a site of patriarchal violence , but instead " a site of poetic self @-@ creation . " One source of conflict and grief for Cisneros 's Chicana characters is that the male @-@ dominated society in which they live denies them this place . Critics such as Jacqueline Doyle and Felicia J. Cruz have compared this theme in Cisneros 's work to one of the key concepts in Virginia Woolf 's famous essay " A Room of One 's Own " , that " a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction , " or put another way , " economic security " and personal liberty are necessary for " artistic production . " 
 Cisneros explores the issue of place in relation not only to gender but also to class . As Saldívar has noted , " Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman 's space , Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well . " He refers to Esperanza 's determination not to forget her working @-@ class roots once she obtains her dream house , and to open her doors to those who are less fortunate . Esperanza says " Passing bums will ask , Can I come in ? I 'll offer them the attic , ask them to stay , because I know how it is to be without a house . " According to Saldívar , this statement of Esperanza 's alludes to " the necessity for a decent living space " that is fundamental to all people , despite the different oppressions they face . 
 = = = Construction of femininity and female sexuality = = = 
 As Madsen has described , Cisneros 's " effort to negotiate a cross @-@ cultural identity is complicated by the need to challenge the deeply rooted patriarchal values of both Mexican and American cultures . " The lives of all Cisneros ’ s female characters are affected by how femininity and female sexuality are defined within this patriarchal value system and they must struggle to rework these definitions . As Cisneros has said : " There 's always this balancing act , we 've got to define what we think is fine for ourselves instead of what our culture says . " 
 Cisneros shows how Chicanas , like women of many other ethnicities , internalize these norms starting at a young age , through informal education by family members and popular culture . In The House on Mango Street , for example , a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman ’ s hips have : " They ’ re good for holding a baby when you ’ re cooking , Rachel says ... You need them to dance , says Lucy ... You gotta know how to walk with hips , practice you know . " Traditional female roles , such as childrearing , cooking , and attracting male attention , are understood by Cisneros 's characters to be their biological destiny . However , when they reach adolescence and womanhood , they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment , confusion and anguish . Esperanza describes her " sexual initiation " — an assault by a group of Anglo @-@ American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground . She feels stricken and powerless after this , but above all betrayed ; not only by Sally , who was not there for her , but " by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex " . Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology , fueled by popular culture , is often at odds with reality in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories , where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face in their own lives . 
 When Cisneros addresses the subject of female sexuality , she often portrays negative scenarios in which men exert control over women through control over their sexuality , and explores the gap she perceives between the real sexual experiences of women and their idealized representation in popular culture . However , Cisneros also describes female sexuality in extremely positive terms , especially in her poetry . This is true , for example , of her 1987 volume of poetry My Wicked , Wicked Ways . According to Madsen , Cisneros refers to herself as " wicked " for having " reappropriated , taken control of , her own sexuality and the articulation of it – a power forbidden to women under patriarchy " . Through these poems she aims to represent " the reality of female sexuality " so that women readers will recognize the " divisive effects " of the stereotypes that they are expected to conform to , and " discover the potential for joy in their bodies that is denied them " . 
 Cisneros breaks the boundary between what is a socially acceptable way for women to act and speak and what is not , using language and imagery that have a " boisterous humor " and " extrovert energy " and are even at times " deliberately shocking " . Not all readers appreciate this " shocking " quality of some of Cisneros ’ s work . Both female and male readers have criticized Cisneros for the ways she celebrates her sexuality , such as the suggestive photograph of herself on the My Wicked , Wicked Ways cover ( 3rd Woman Press , 1987 ) . Cisneros says of this photo : " The cover is of a woman appropriating her own sexuality . In some ways , that ’ s also why it ’ s wicked : the scene is trespassing that boundary by saying ' I defy you . I 'm going to tell my own story . ' " Some readers " failed to perceive the transgressive meaning of the gesture " , thinking that she was merely being lewd for shock value , and questioned her legitimacy as a feminist . Cisneros ’ s initial response to this was dismay , but then she reports thinking " Wait a second , where ’ s your sense of humor ? And why can ’ t a feminist be sexy ? " 
 = = = Construction of Chicana identity = = = 
 The challenges faced by Cisneros ’ s characters on account of their gender cannot be understood in isolation from their culture , for the norms that dictate how women and men ought to think and behave are culturally determined and thus distinct for different cultural groups . Through her works , Cisneros conveys the experiences of Chicanas confronting the " deeply rooted patriarchal values " of Mexican culture through interactions not only with Mexican fathers , but the broader community which exerts pressure upon them to conform to a narrow definition of womanhood and a subservient position to men . 
 A recurrent theme in Cisneros ’ s work is the triad of figures that writer and theorist Gloria Anzaldúa has referred to as " Our Mothers " : the Virgen de Guadalupe , La Malinche and La Llorona . These symbolic figures are of great importance to identity politics and popular culture in Mexico and the southwest United States , and have been used , argues theorist Norma Alarcón , as reference points " for controlling , interpreting , or visualizing women " in Mexican @-@ American culture . 
 Many theorists , including Jacqueline Doyle , Jean Wyatt , Emma Perez and Cordelia Candelaria , have argued that the gender identity of Mexican and Chicana women is complexly constructed in reference to these three figures . La Virgen de Guadalupe , a Catholic icon of the manifestation of the Virgin Mary in the Americas , is revered in Mexico as a " nurturing and inspiring mother and maiden " . La Malinche , the indigenous mistress and intermediary of conquistador Hernán Cortés , has according to Wyatt " become the representative of a female sexuality at once passive , " <unk> , " and always already guilty of betrayal " . Cisneros describes the problematic dichotomy of the virgin and the whore presented by these two figures : " We ’ re raised in a Mexican culture that has two role models : La Malinche and la Virgen de Guadalupe . And you know that ’ s a hard route to go , one or the other , there ’ s no in @-@ betweens . " Madsen has noted that these ' good ' and ' bad ' archetypes are further complicated by the perception , held by many Chicana feminists , that they would be guilty of betraying their people , like La Malinche , if they attempt to define their femininity in more " Anglo " terms . Through her work , Cisneros critiques the pressures Chicanas face to suppress their sexuality or channel it into socially acceptable forms so as to not be labeled " <unk> [ s ] ... corrupted by <unk> influences which threaten to splinter [ their ] people " . 
 The third figure , La Llorona , who derives from a centuries @-@ old Mexican / Southwestern folktale , is " a proud young girl [ who ] marries above her station and is so enraged when her husband takes a mistress of his own class that she drowns their children in the river " . She dies grief @-@ stricken by the edge of the river after she is unable to retrieve her children and it is claimed that she can be heard wailing for them in the sound of the wind and water . These entities , from the gentle and pure Virgen de Guadalupe , to the violated and treacherous la Malinche , to the eternally grieving la Llorona give rise to a " fragmentary subjectivity " often experienced by Chicanas , and their need to come to terms with them , renegotiate them on their own terms , or reject them altogether . 
 The three " Mothers " come out most clearly in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories . In the stories " Never Marry a Mexican " and " Woman Hollering Creek " , the female protagonists grapple with these " Mexican icons of sexuality and motherhood that , internalized , seem to impose on them a limited and even negative definition of their own identities as women " . The protagonist in " Never Marry a Mexican " is haunted by the myth of la Malinche , who is considered a whore and a traitor , and defies la Malinche 's passive sexuality with her own aggressive one . In " Woman Hollering Creek " the protagonist reinvents the la Llorona myth when she decides to take charge of her own future , and that of her children , and discovers that the <unk> of the myth , which is the Spanish word for the sound made by la Llorona , can be interpreted as a " joyous holler " rather than a grieving wail . It is the borderland , that symbolic middle ground between two cultures , which " offers a space where such a negotiation with fixed gender ideals is at least possible " . 
 = = = Borderland = = = 
 Even though that Cisneros does not explicitly locate her stories and novels on the Mexico @-@ U.S. border , Sadowski @-@ Smith identifies the concept as perhaps Cisneros 's most salient theme due to the constant border crossings , both real and metaphorical , of characters in all of her works . The House on Mango Street takes place in Chicago where the narrator lives , and in Mexico City where she visits extended family . Caramelo primarily takes place in those settings as well , but part of the book details the narrator 's experiences as a teenager in San Antonio , TX . Various characters in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories also make trips to Mexico to reunite with family members . However , to quote literary critics Jesús Benito and Ana María <unk> , the " image of the border has become fully meaningful not only when we consider it as a physical line but when we <unk> it and liberate it from the notion of space to encompass notions of sex , class , gender , ethnicity , identity , and community . " Cisneros frequently divorces the border from its strictly geographic meaning , using it metaphorically to explore how Chicana identity is an amalgamation of both Mexican and Anglo @-@ American cultures . The border represents the everyday experiences of people who are neither fully from one place nor the other ; at times the border is fluid and two cultures can coexist harmoniously within a single person , but at other times it is rigid and there is an acute tension between them . Literary critic Katherine <unk> has analyzed the border metaphor in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories , which manifests in references to the Chicana / o characters ' Mexican roots and the ( im ) migration between the two countries , the recurrence of overlapping pre @-@ Columbian , mestizo and Southwestern Chicano myths , and the portrayal of Chicanas / os as " straddling two or three cultures . " <unk> makes use of Gloria Anzaldúa 's concept of living " on the borderlands " to describe the experience of Cisneros 's Chicana characters who , in addition to their struggle to overcome patriarchal constructs of their gender and sexual identity , must negotiate linguistic and cultural boundaries .

 Dragon Challenge ( known as Dueling Dragons from 1999 to 2010 ) is a pair of intertwined inverted roller coasters in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter area of Universal Studios ' Islands of Adventure in Orlando , Florida , U.S .. The ride is themed to two chasing dragons , one side being Chinese Fireball and the other Hungarian Horntail . It features a layout in which the two trains share adjacent lift hills but then traverse two unique courses . The ride was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard of Switzerland . The Chinese Fireball dragon reaches a top speed of 60 mph , and the Hungarian Horntail dragon reaches a top speed of 55 mph . Both versions feature five inversions . The total ride time is about two minutes and 25 seconds . 
 When Islands of Adventure opened on May 28 , 1999 , the ride was called Dueling Dragons and was located in The Lost Continent area with the two sides named Fire and Ice . During much of the ride 's history , the trains were dispatched simultaneously , providing three near @-@ miss encounters along the courses . However , after two injuries related to loose objects hitting riders on the other coaster , the roller coasters are now dispatched separately . After a renovation period , the attraction reopened in mid @-@ March 2010 , and was officially renamed as Dragon Challenge with The Wizarding World of Harry Potter grand opening on June 18 , 2010 .

 Dueling Dragons was one of Islands of Adventure 's original attractions , opening with the theme park on May 28 , 1999 , in the park 's The Lost Continent area . At the time , it was the only fully inverted dueling roller coaster in the world . The ride was themed to two dueling dragons , with one track named Ice and the other named Fire . 
 During construction , Superior Rigging & Erection was responsible for erecting the supports and track of the two roller coasters . 
 = = = Dragon Challenge ( 2010 – present ) = = = 
 In May 2007 , Universal announced plans to construct The Wizarding World of Harry Potter , a new section devoted to the popular Harry Potter book and film series . Dueling Dragons , as well as the adjacent Flight of the Hippogriff roller coaster , were shown to be included in the new section . Universal later announced that the attraction would be renamed Dragon Challenge upon the re @-@ opening of the attraction and that the two roller coasters would be renamed as Hungarian Horntail and Chinese Fireball . 
 Construction on re @-@ theming the queue began in the third quarter of 2009 . In the first quarter of 2010 , the ride closed in order to refurbish the attraction to incorporate the Harry Potter theme . In mid @-@ March 2010 , the roller coasters reopened to the public . On June 18 , 2010 , with the opening of the entire The Wizarding World of Harry Potter section , the ride officially became Dragon Challenge . 
 During the summer of 2011 , there were two accidents ( one serious ) caused by what is believed to be loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster . The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the amount of damage . On the same day that the man got hit , Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed . For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid @-@ October 2011 , Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries . No injuries have been reported since .

 When first entering the queue , guests are taken past a number of banners for the Triwizard Tournament showing support for the four contestants . After passing the Weasleys ' crashed flying Ford Anglia , they enter the Champions ' Tent . From there guests pass a large pedestal with the Triwizard Cup glowing at the top , and several dark " tunnels " which lead to both coaster 's stations . Just before entering the station guests must choose which coaster they want to ride : Chinese Fireball to the left or Hungarian Horntail to the right . Once in the station , on the ceiling , there is a projection of the dragons . 
 The queue before the Harry Potter refurbishment was set as a ruined castle where the Fire and Ice dragons lived . The queue passed through dungeons and included human skeletons , torches , and cobwebs . Just like the present queue , to ride Fire , guests would go left while riders wanting to ride Ice would go right at the intersection point . 
 In April 2015 , metal detectors were installed as a permanent fixture to the entrance . The attraction now officially has metal detectors , security with metal detecting wands , and a zero tolerance policy for cell phones , wallets , coins , watches , cameras , anything that can be placed in one 's pockets ; all pockets must be absolutely empty prior to boarding . Persons in violation will be sent to the lockers or possibly ejected from the park without a refund .

 Dragon Challenge operates with several steel and fiberglass trains . Each train has eight cars with four seats for a total of 32 riders per train . All the Hungarian Horntail trains resemble a blue ice dragon while all the Chinese Fireball trains resemble a red fire dragon . 
 When the coaster cars duelled , in order to make the trains meet at each of the three near @-@ miss points along the layout , the trains would be weighed once they were loaded at the station to adjust the dispatch times . For example , if the Chinese Fireball train weighed more than the Hungarian Horntail train , the Fireball would be dispatched after the Horntail .

 Dragon Challenge has generally been well received , with most riders preferring the Chinese Fireball track . 
 In the annual Amusement Today Golden Ticket Awards for the Top Steel Roller Coasters , Dragon Challenge ranked in the top 50 every year between 2000 and 2012 . It peaked at position 11 in 2002 . 
 In Mitch Hawker 's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll , the two tracks are ranked separately . In every year that the steel roller coaster poll has been held , Chinese Fireball has ranked higher than the Hungarian Horntail . In 1999 , Chinese Fireball and Hungarian Horntail peaked at positions 9 and 18 , respectively . 
 These poll results are supported by a review by Jeremy Thompson of Roller Coaster Philosophy . Thompson ranks the Chinese Fireball a B- and the Hungarian Horntail a C + ; only The Incredible Hulk and Jurassic Park River Adventure are ranked higher . Thompson also made comparisons between the ride in its generic @-@ themed state versus the Harry Potter theme added in 2010 stating the " roller coaster has also lost a certain poetic quality that made the original so pleasurable " . The loss of the dueling function also contributed to the lower ranking .

 Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta ( Polish : Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta na <unk> <unk> w roku 1521 w <unk> , English : The Hanging of the Sigismund bell at the Cathedral Tower in 1521 in Kraków ) is a painting by Jan Matejko finished in 1874 . It depicts the installation of the Sigismund Bell in the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków in 1521 . The bell was installed in the Sigismund Tower and rung for the first time on 13 July 1521 . The bell is considered to be one of the national symbols of Poland . This painting is one of a number of historical paintings by Matejko . It shows a crowd of people , with a number of identifiable figures of historical importance . It conveys the Golden Era of the Polish Renaissance , and the power of the Kingdom of Poland . 
 There are several alternative names for the painting . They include The consecrating of the Sigismund bell ... ( <unk> dzwonu Zygmunta ... ) , as proposed by Mieczysław <unk> , The raising of the Sigismund bell ... , King Sigismund 's Bell , or just Sigismund Bell ( <unk> Zygmunta ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The Sigismund Bell painting was created in 1874 . During his work , Matejko commissioned craftsmen to create a replica of a scaffolding that was used to move the bell , and he identified its likely original location , in order for it to be portrayed realistically . 
 There are numerous anecdotes associated with this painting . Matejko used his family for models , and likely the painting contains nearly all the members of his family . The painting was well received by contemporaries , and Stanisław Tarnowski published an extensive and positive review in 1875 in Przegląd Polski . The work was displayed in Paris in 1875 , and probably contributed to Matejko 's recognition by the Académie française ; three years later it was displayed there again , during the Exposition Universelle ( 1878 ) , and ( together with two other paintings – the Unia <unk> ( Union of Lublin ) and Wacław Wilczek ) yielded him an honorary golden medal . 
 The painting is in the collection of the National Museum , Warsaw . 
 = = Composition and significance = = 
 Matejko was deeply interested in the era of the Renaissance in Poland , and this painting is one of a number of historical paintings that he set in that period . The composition is very colorful , yet realistic . It conveys the Golden Era of Polish Renaissance , and the power of the contemporary Kingdom of Poland , both its elites and the common people . The left side of the painting is focused on the richness and glory of the era , while the right notes the hard work of ordinary people that made this greatness possible . Although the painting is usually known as the The hanging of the Sigismund bell .. , in fact it shows not the moment of hanging but the moment of the bell 's emergence from the mold in which it was cast . 
 The painting shows a crowd , with a number of identifiable figures of historical importance . On the left , there is the royal court , but only the king , Sigismund I , his family ( including queen Bona Sforza ) , and the court jester , Stańczyk , can be identified . Sigismund , the patron of the Sigismund Bell , and his son Sigismund August , were Polish kings that inspired other works of Matejko , including The Babin Republic ( 1881 ) and The Founding of the <unk> Academy in Poznań ( 1886 ) . Sigismund I 's portrayal on the Hanging ... painting is the one where Matejko shows him with pride and respect . Other figures in the court include banker Jan Boner , merchant and official Seweryn <unk> , and castellan and voivode Stanisław <unk> . Bishop Jan <unk> is also shown on the painting , consecrating the bell , with canon Grzegorz <unk> nearby . 
 Outside the court , master bell @-@ founder Hans <unk> is seen above the bell . Between him and the court there are two dark @-@ clad figures . These are the Wawel architect Bartolommeo Berrecci , and a musician , Valentin <unk> , who according to a legend threw a string from his instrument into the melted bronze ( in fact , he arrived in Poland two decades after the bell was cast ) . In the background , Wawel Castle can be seen . 
 As he would often do , Matejko included people whom he considered significant for the era , but who could not be present in the scene , like Sigismund I 's son , Sigismund II August , who would have been only one year old . In 1885 Matejko would paint a sequel @-@ like picture , Zygmunt I <unk> <unk> Zygmunta ( Sigismund I listening to the Sigismund Bell ) , showing an older Sigismund and Stańczyk , contemplating the passing of their era .

 The Kirtlandian is a North American land @-@ vertebrate faunal age of the Cretaceous period , following the Judithian and succeeded by the Edmontonian . It lasted about 2 million years , ca 74 @.@ 8 to 72 @.@ 8 Mya and is characterized by the ceratopsian Pentaceratops sternbergii , which lived throughout the Kirtlandian . It was first named by R.M. Sullivan and S.G. Lucas in 2003 as a faunal age for the Kirtland and Fruitland formations . Previously , only five land @-@ vertebrate ages were identified from the Late <unk> as identified by Loris S. Russell in 1975 , they include the Paluxian , Aquilan , Judithian , Edmontonian , and the Lancian . Before the naming of the Kirtlandian , three gaps , between the Paluxian and Aquilan , the Aquilan and the Judithian , and the Judithian and Edmontonian , were identified but not named . 
 The Fruitland Formation measures 97 to 107 metres ( 318 to 351 ft ) thick , and with the 594 metres ( 1 @,@ 949 ft ) of the Kirtland Formation , the Kirtlandian consists of 701 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) of sediments . The rock types within the formations are primarily coal beds , but also include sandstone , siltstone , mudstone , and shale . Within the sediments with a Kirtlandian age , two local faunas , the Hunter Wash local fauna , and the Willow Wash local fauna , have been identified . The currently accepted date of the Kirtlandian is 74 @.@ 8 to 72 @.@ 8 million years ago .

 The Kirtlandian is an age of fauna that lasted for 2 million years . It is Campanian in age , and is placed between the Judithian age , which is characterized by older taxa , and the Edmontonian faunal age , characterized by the appearance of Edmontosaurus regalis and Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis . The geological formations found to date or persist from the Kirtlandian are the Bearpaw , the upper Kaiparowits Formation , the Kirtland , Fruitland , Williams Fork , Fort Crittenden , Ringbone , Corral de <unk> , Packard , and El Gallo formations , and possibly the lower part of the Cerro del Pueblo Formation and upper region of the Aguja Formation . These formations are exposed in Alberta and Montana , Utah , New Mexico , New Mexico , Colorado , Arizona , New Mexico , Sonora , Baja California , Baja California , and possibly Coahuila , and Texas , respectively .

 The stratigraphy of the Kirtlandian was studied by Robert M. Sullivan and Spencer G. Lucas in 2003 , Sullivan in <unk> , Lucas and Sullivan in <unk> , and Nicholas R. Longrich in 2010 . 
 = = = = Local faunas = = = = 
 Two local faunas are known from the Kirtlandian faunal age . They include the Hunter Wash local fauna and the Willow Wash local fauna . The Hunter Wash local fauna was defined as the vertebrates " obtained from the upper 40 feet of the Fruitland Formation and the lower 55 feet of the lower shale of the Kirtland Shale ( now a formation ) in Hunter Wash ( member ) . " The Hunter Wash fauna therefore includes all taxa from the Bisti region of the Bisti / De @-@ Na @-@ Zin Wilderness , and the animals from the Fossil Forest and Ah @-@ shi @-@ <unk> @-@ pah Wash . The Willow Wash fauna was named for all the fauna of the De @-@ na @-@ zin Member of the Kirtland Formation . The majority of the fauna from the Willow Wash were originally thought to belong to the Alamo Wash local fauna of the Ojo Alamo Formation , until it was found that the entire fauna was in fact from the older Kirtland Formation . 
 = = = = Thickness = = = = 
 The Kirtland and Fruitland formations both consist of the major formations in the Kirtlandian age . The Fruitland Formation was measured in 2003 to be between 97 and 107 metres ( 318 and 351 ft ) thick , and the Kirtland was measured at 594 metres ( 1 @,@ 949 ft ) thick . Together they measured 691 to 701 metres ( 2 @,@ 267 to 2 @,@ 300 ft ) . Later in 2010 , a different study found more precise measurements . It found the Fruitland Formation to be 100 metres ( 330 ft ) thick , and the Kirtland Formation to be around 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) thick . These thicknesses combine to give the formation a height of 700 m ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 The lithology of the Kirtlandian formations are made up of mostly a combination of coal beds . The Fruitland Formation consists entirely of them , and one fifth of all rocks of the Kirtland Formation are a coal . The other common rocks found in the Kirtland Formation are siltstone , mudstone , shale and most commonly , sandstone . The Bisti Bed of the Hunter Wash Member is made up completely of sandstone , which marks the border between the Kirtland and Fruitland formations .

 The Kirtlandian faunal age was named by Lucas and Sullivan in 2003 , and found by their original study to date from 74 @.@ 9 to 72 million years ago . In 2006 , Sullivan and Lucas refined their estimate , stating that the Kirtlandian ranged from 75 to 72 @.@ 8 million years ago . Later that year , Sullivan changed the time range again , finding that the faunal age lasted only 2 million years , from 74 @.@ 8 to 72 @.@ 8 million years ago . He said that the later part of the Kirtlandian , from the De @-@ na @-@ zin Member of the Kirtland Formation , dated to 73 million years ago , on the basis of ash layers dating to 73 @.@ 04 and 73 @.@ 37 million years ago . This observation was based on findings by Sullivan and Lucas , who dated the two ash layers from 73 @.@ 04 ± 0 @.@ 25 and 73 @.@ 37 ± 0 @.@ 28 million years ago . They also dated the earlier ashes from the Fruitland Formation , which dated to 75 @.@ 56 ± 0 @.@ 41 , 74 @.@ 55 ± 0 @.@ 29 , and 74 @.@ 11 ± 0 @.@ 62 million years ago . The first ash , called by them the Dog Eye Pond , was found slightly higher than the start of the Fruitland Formation , which meant that the start of the Fruitland Formation was older than 75 @.@ 5 million years ago . More precise dating in 2010 by Longrich found that the second youngest ash can actually be dated more precisely than thought by Sullivan ( 2006 ) , only having an error range of 0 @.@ 18 million years . Longrich also dated the two older ashes , finding a date the same as that of Sullivan in 2006 . These ash datings are what Sullivan used to find the precise age of the Kirtlandian age .

 Fossil turtles were very abundant in the Kirtlandian , and in the Campanian in general . Over 200 specimens and 15 species of turtle have been found from the Fruitland / Kirtland Formations . Among the turtles are the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; the <unk> <unk> sp . ; the <unk> Denazinemys nodosa and <unk> ornata ( previously Denazinemys ornata ) ; the non @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> baueri , Thescelus <unk> , and Thescelus <unk> ; the <unk> Adocus <unk> and Adocus <unk> ; the <unk> Basilemys <unk> and possibly Basilemys nobilis ; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> robustus ; and two indeterminate turtles , one a <unk> , and one assigned to <unk> .

 Few fossils have been found in the Ringbone Formation , the only significant one being a specimen that is either Albertosaurus sp. or Daspletosaurus sp . , known from a tooth and vertebrae .

 The two main formations of the Kirtlandian , the Fruitland and Kirtland , were originally included in the older Judithian age , an interpretation superseded with the naming of the Kirtlandian . In 1975 , Russell identified five Late Cretaceous land @-@ vertebrate ages , the Paluxian , Aquilan , Judithian , Edmontonian , and Lancian , based on mammal assemblages . Three previously unnamed faunal ages were given names and term " Kirtlandian " was chosen for the gap between the Judithian and Edmontonian . Pentaceratops is distributed throughout all of the San Juan Basin . Outside of the basin , Pentaceratops is well @-@ known , and known with certainty , from the Williams Fork Formation . This means that the formation , along with the Cretaceous formations of the basin , are inside the Kirtlandian .

 The Kirtlandian is characterized by a single vertebrate association . The association was identified by Lehman in 2001 and termed the " Kritosaurus - Parasaurolophus association " .

At Royal Rumble , on January 31 , Maryse teamed up with Katie Lea Burchill , Jillian Hall , Alicia Fox , and Natalya in a untelevised match in a losing effort to Gail Kim , Kelly Kelly , Eve Torres , and The Bella Twins ( Nikki and Brie ) . The tournament 's finals were originally scheduled for Elimination Chamber on February 21 ; instead , the match was changed by the SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero to a interbrand tag team match , where Maryse teamed with her scheduled opponent Gail Kim against LayCool ( Michelle McCool and Layla ) , which was won by LayCool as a result of Maryse abandoning Kim during the match . The following night on Raw , Maryse defeated Kim in the finals to win the championship , becoming the first Diva to have held it twice . 
 At WrestleMania XXVI , on March 28 , she was part of the winning team of a 10 @-@ Diva tag team match with LayCool , Alicia Fox and Vickie Guerrero against Beth Phoenix , Mickie James , Gail Kim , Eve Torres and Kelly Kelly , but the following night on Raw , she was pinned by Torres in a rematch .

At Fatal 4 @-@ Way on June 20 , Maryse failed to regain the title in a Fatal Four @-@ Way match that also involved then @-@ champion Eve , Gail Kim , and Alicia Fox , which Fox would win pinning her to become the champion .

 Age of Empires II : The Age of Kings is a real @-@ time strategy ( RTS ) video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft . Released in 1999 for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh operating systems , it was the second game in the Age of Empires series . An expansion , The Conquerors , was released in 2000 . A PlayStation 2 version was released by Konami in 2001 , and a Nintendo DS spinoff , Age of Empires : The Age of Kings was developed by Backbone Entertainment in 2006 . A Dreamcast port , by Konami , was canceled . 
 The Age of Kings is set in the Middle Ages and contains thirteen playable civilizations . Players aim to gather resources , which they use to build towns , create armies , and defeat their enemies . There are five historically based campaigns , which constrict the player to specialized and story @-@ backed conditions . There are three additional single @-@ player game modes , and multiplayer is supported . Despite using the same game engine and similar code to its predecessor , development of The Age of Kings took a year longer than expected , forcing Ensemble Studios to release Age of Empires : The Rise of Rome in 1998 instead . The design team focused on resolving significant issues in Age of Empires , but noted on release that some problems remained . 
 Reception of The Age of Kings was highly positive . The significant number of new features was praised , as were the gameplay improvements . Some reviewers , however , were critical of the presentation of units — they were seen as bland and uninteresting — while others considered The Age of Kings to be too similar to its predecessor , Age of Empires . Three months after its release , two million copies of The Age of Kings had been shipped , and it topped sales charts in seven countries . The game won multiple awards and is today considered a classic of its type , having had a significant impact on future games in its genre . Both the original Age of Empires II and the expansion pack were later released as " the Gold Edition " . 
 In April 2013 , Age of Empires II : HD Edition was released on the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows operating systems . The HD Edition includes both the original game and the expansion The Conquerors , as well as updated graphics for high @-@ resolution displays . It also supports user @-@ generated content through the Steam Workshop and multiplayer games provided through the Steam servers . On August 16 , 2013 , Microsoft announced The Forgotten , the first new expansion in nearly 13 years and exclusive to the HD Edition . On November 5 , 2015 , Microsoft released another new expansion to Age of Empires II : HD Edition , The African Kingdoms . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The Age of Kings focuses on building towns , gathering resources , creating armies and ultimately conquering opponents by destroying their units and buildings . Players conquer rival towns and empires as they advance one of 13 civilizations through four " Ages " : the Dark Age , the Feudal Age , the Castle Age ( being the High Middle Ages ) , and the Imperial Age , reminiscent of the Renaissance — a 1000 @-@ year timeframe . Advancing to a new Age unlocks new units , structures , and technologies , but players must first build certain buildings from their current age and then pay a sum of resources ( typically food and gold ) . 
 Civilian units , called " villagers " , are used to gather resources ; they are either male or female – gender does not affect their abilities . Resources can be used to train units , construct buildings , and research technologies , among other things ; for example , players can research better armour for infantry units . The game offers four types of resources : food , wood , gold , and stone . Food is obtained by hunting animals , gathering berries , harvesting livestock , farming , and shore fishing and fishing from boats . Wood is gathered by chopping down trees . Gold is obtained from either gold mines , trade or collecting relics in a monastery , and stone is collected from stone mines . Villagers require checkpoints , typically depository buildings ( town center , mining camp , mill , and lumber yard ) , where they can store gathered resources . Each civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources . Players can construct a market for trade ; players can trade wood , stone , and food for gold , and use gold to buy other resources . Market prices fluctuate with every transaction . Furthermore , markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports ; once they return to the player 's market / dock , gold is added to the stockpile . The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market ; more gold is earned on longer trips . It is possible to trade with enemies ' markets or docks , but the player 's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process . Players do not need to keep trading manually , as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade . 
 There are five campaigns in The Age of Kings , containing historically based scenarios such as Genghis Khan 's invasion of Eurasia , Barbarossa 's Crusade , or Saladin 's defence of the Holy Land . In the Joan of Arc and William Wallace campaigns , the player can control a unit based on its namesake ; in others , players take orders from guiding spirits representative of the army 's commander . 
 Additional game modes are available to the player in The Age of Kings . One mode , random map , generates a map from one of several randomly chose map generating scripts , with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center , three villagers ( or more depending on civilization ) , and a scout unit . The game can be won through military conquest , by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for a certain amount of time , or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time . Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources , creating a focus on military dominance , while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit , winning by killing all of the other monarchs . 
 = = = Units and civilizations = = = 
 Every player has a limit to the number of units they can create — a population limit — but may not immediately use the entire potential population . The population capacity , which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25 , is based on the number of houses , Castles , or Town Centers — the main building in a player 's town — which have been built . The Age of Kings introduced two significant new features for unit management : the idle villager button , which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task , and the town bell , which sends all a player 's villagers into their Town Center , Castle , or tower for safety ; units garrisoned within these three buildings , especially archers , increase the building 's firepower ( towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside ) including the town center , which can not fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there . 
 The Age of Kings also includes five types of military units : infantry , archers , cavalry , siege weaponry , and naval units . Certain types of infantry , archers , and cavalry are " counter units " with special defenses against other types of unit . The three human classes of military generally follow a rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors model . For example , infantry are generally powerful against buildings but weak against cavalry , thus the infantry counter units — spearmen and pikemen — have attack bonuses against cavalry . Each Civilization in The Age of Kings has one or two special units that are exclusive to that Civilization . For instance , the Britons have access to <unk> , an archery unit with increased range . These Civilization @-@ specific units are generally more powerful , but still follow the basic rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors model . The monk is a special kind of military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player 's civilization , and to heal allied units . Monks are also used to collect relics ; relics accumulate gold once held in the player 's monastery — the more relics are captured , the faster the gold is accumulated . Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game , depending on the victory setting . Once a player has all in their monasteries , a timer is shown to all players . If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time , then that player wins . 
 Players choose to play as one of 13 civilizations split into four architectural styles — Western European , Eastern European , Middle Eastern , and East Asian — that determine building appearance in @-@ game . The civilizations have varying strengths and weaknesses with regards to economics , technology , and battle , and each has access to a different , very powerful " Unique Unit " . Additionally , each civilization provides an individual team bonus in team games . To add variety , each civilization has a set of sound bites in its native language that are uttered by units when selected or instructed to perform a task . 
 = = = Buildings = = = 
 The buildings in The Age of Kings are split into the economic and military buildings categories . Buildings can research technologies and upgrades that increase economic , military or unit @-@ based efficiency , as well as provide resources for the player . 
 The most important economic building is the Town Center , where villagers are created , all types of resources can be stored , some technologies are researched , and the player can advance to the next Age . The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack . Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources , farms , docks ( the dock may also produce several military ships ) , and houses to support a higher population . 
 Military buildings include unit @-@ producing buildings such as barracks , archery ranges , stables , and castles , as well as defensive buildings such as walls and towers . Military buildings can perform research to improve the abilities of military units , increasing their strength , defensive capabilities , or other attributes . The castle is a military building which can build trebuchets , train the civilization 's " unique unit / s " , and fire arrows at enemy units within range , with garrisoned units firing extra arrows . It can only be built after a player has reached the Castle Age , although in some game options , players can begin with an already @-@ built castle as early as the Dark Age . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 The Age of Kings supports multiplayer over the Internet , or via a local area network ( LAN ) . Up to eight players can take part in one game , with all of the single player game modes available . The MSN Gaming Zone supported the game until the service closed on June 19 , 2006 .

 Prior to the completion of Age of Empires , Ensemble Studios had signed a contract with Microsoft for a sequel . The design team chose to set The Age of Kings in the Middle Ages as a logical progression from the ancient era setting of Age of Empires . The design team was conscious of attempting to capture the broad appeal of the first game without making the game 's design too similar . Nonetheless , they attempted to appeal to the vast demographic who played Age of Empires . The Age of Kings 's design team intended to complete the game within a year by using code from the original and reusing the Genie game engine . Several months into the process they found they would not be able to complete a game of the quality they sought in that time . Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created Age of Empires : The Rise of Rome , an easily developed expansion pack of Age of Empires , as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998 . To help meet the next year 's deadline , additional programmers , artists , and designers were employed . To overcome another significant objection to Age of Empires — that of path finding — the team completely redesigned the game engine 's movement system . 
 The original Age of Empires had been criticized for its artificial intelligence ( AI ) . Because the original AI did not " cheat " by attributing itself extra resources or using other techniques the human player could not , it was easier to defeat than in many other real @-@ time strategy games . For The Age of Kings , Ensemble Studios attempted to develop a more powerful AI system that did not compromise by cheating . Industry veteran Mario Grimani led Ensemble Studios in the creation of the new system . The Age of Kings saw the introduction of a triggers system for its scenario editor . The triggers allow messages to be displayed , or actions to take place , based on pre @-@ set criteria or " events " . The scenario editor was also improved by the new AI system . The AI and trigger systems interacted regularly in the single player campaigns . 
 The team was less successful in resolving other issues ; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following the release of Age of Empires that there was still no process by which patches could be issued . Extensive cheating in multiplayer games of Age of Empires came as a result of several bugs in the game , which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for The Age of Kings . On release , there were several bugs that needed immediate attention , but the patch process was not yet ready . The first patch was released 11 months later . 
 Ensemble Studios developed a new terrain system for The Age of Kings , with 3D presentation capabilities that were vastly superior to those of Age of Empires . Pritchard noted an improvement in the team 's artistic abilities following their work on the past two games , and he is noted as saying that " <unk> became a showcase for their improved talent " . However , he complained about the lack of an art asset management tool , while other departments gained new tools and automated procedures to assist in design and play testing . 
 The soundtrack for The Age of Kings was directed by Stephen Rippy , who has since taken that role for all games in the Age of Empires series . Music for the game was split into two categories . For " in game " music , Rippy 's team took musical elements from a variety of cultures and combined them to create a mixed sound . " Pre @-@ game " music was designed to be unique to the civilization in question . Campaigns based on historical figures would include " a theme that will at least be rooted in [ the character 's ] culture " . 
 A demo of The Age of Kings was released on October 16 , 1999 . It featured the learning campaign , a sample of a random map game , and the ability to play via the MSN Gaming Zone . Much to Ensemble Studios ' disappointment , numerous incomplete versions of the game were leaked . These were picked up by warez sites , and sold illegally throughout the Pacific Rim ; warez versions of the game were even sold outside Microsoft 's offices in South Korea .

 In 2012 , Hidden Path Entertainment began working on a high @-@ definition remake of Age of Empires II , an effort spearheaded by Matt Pritchard , an original Ensemble lead programmer . On March 7 , 2013 , its release was announced , branded as Age of Empires II : HD Edition . It has improved graphics , widescreen support and new multiplayer options through Steam . It was released on April 9 , 2013 , and there was a pre @-@ order available on April 5 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Age of Kings received " universal acclaim " , according to video game review aggregator Metacritic . 
 According to Eurogamer 's Geoff Richards , " the list of new features and improvements over the original game is over a page long " . GamePro 's review similarly focused on " new additions to the genre itself " which it argued made The Age of Kings outstanding . These included the idle unit button and town bell . GameSpy 's Carlos Salgado was appreciative of other features ; he praised the ability to create individual profiles for different players and to customize hotkeys . Meanwhile , IGN appreciated the new abilities given to the villager unit — the review stated villagers " now play an important role not only in the collection of resources , but also in town defense and even in combat . " 
 AllGame 's Michael L. House enjoyed the use of sound bites in civilizations ' native languages , which he said was " very influential in developing an era @-@ enhancing atmosphere " . Eurogamer said this feature " gives [ villagers ] a personality , rather than the standard ' Acknowledged ' grunt of military RTS games " , also stating that the use of female villagers provided a good variety . Game Revolution 's review explained that by being set in a more recent epoch of human history , The Age of Kings was able to " add character to an otherwise impersonal style of gameplay " . Computer and Video Games approved of The Age of Kings ' use of shorter , more focused campaigns , compared to its predecessor , while Game Revolution noted that even in slower sections of the campaign , the historical narrative helped maintain player interest . GameSpot said that with the screen full of units , " you can begin to imagine how their historical equivalents once prospered " , while GameSpy said The Age of Kings presents " realism rarely seen in the RTS genre " . IGN staff argued that while the strengths and weaknesses attributed to different civilizations made the game more realistic , the fact that they were still mostly the same prevented The Age of Kings from " delivering the same battlefield impact of StarCraft or Tiberian Sun " . 
 House also praised the gameplay interface , which he said " couldn 't be simpler " , as well as the advanced grouping and path @-@ finding systems . Nash Werner of GamePro said that the formation tools were wonderful , and complained only that they could not be assigned to naval units . Computer and Video Games generally agreed , stating that " the controls are very user @-@ friendly and well explained " . GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin wrote that despite the game 's improved graphics , " there 's nothing foreign about its appearance " and that most game features will be " immediately recognizable if you 've played a real @-@ time strategy game before " . PC Zone agreed , but in a negative sense — it argued that The Age of Kings " is essentially an update of a two @-@ year @-@ old game " . 
 Richards was surprised by the quality of The Age of Kings ' graphics , considering they were all bitmapped . However , AllGame complained that units were sometimes difficult to tell apart , a point numerous reviewers agreed on . It also called the sound of The Age of Kings as a negative , but not something significant enough to draw players away from the game 's overall quality . IGN stated that cutscenes were somewhat bland , but that overall the graphics added " an amazing amount of detail to the actual game " . IGN 's main criticism was for the in @-@ game speech used in campaigns ; it rhetorically asked " why can 't they just find a Frenchman to do a French accent ? " Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games rated the graphics highly , saying that some in @-@ game buildings are " so grand you 'll even feel guilty about burning them to the ground " . Werner agreed ; " the most noticeable graphical advancements " , he wrote , were " the sheer size and scale of things " . Game Revolution stated " <unk> is the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now " . 
 In January 2000 , three months after its release , Microsoft announced that they had shipped two million copies of The Age of Kings . The game topped sales charts in the United States , Japan , the United Kingdom , Germany , France , Australia , and South Korea . It would spend the next two and a half years on top 20 sales lists . The Age of Kings was top selling game in October 1999 , and the fourth highest selling game in 1999 . 
 The Age of Kings won GameSpot 's Strategy Game of the Year in 1999 , and was a nominee for Game of the Year . GamePower also named it Strategy Game of the Year , while PC Gamer and Computer Gaming World gave it Editor 's Choice awards . The Age of Kings won Strategy Game of the Year and Computer Game of the Year at the 2000 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awards . It was also nominated for Game of the Year , Outstanding Achievement in Animation , Outstanding Achievement in Game Design , and Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering . IGN ranked The Age of Kings the 53rd best game of all time in 2005 , and the 10th best PC game of all time in 2007 . GameFAQs users placed it 56th in a poll of the best games ever . 
 The Age of Kings was highly influential on its genre . Star Wars : Galactic Battlegrounds , a 2001 game by LucasArts , shared The Age of Kings ' game engine , and was heavily influenced by its mechanics . Empire Earth 's design was also similar to that of The Age of Kings ; GameSpot said it " borrows most of that game 's controls , interface features , and even some of its keyboard shortcuts " . Rick Goodman , designer of Age of Empires and The Rise of Rome , designed Empire Earth . GameSpot 's Scott Osborne argued that the gameplay of Cossacks : European Wars was heavily based on The Age of Kings . 
 = = = HD Edition = = = 
 Age of Empires II : HD Edition received mixed reviews with aggregate review website Metacritic assigning a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics . Critics agreed that the HD Edition changed very little from the original game . Daniel Starkey of Destructoid added that the reluctance to change the game features encourages " a much more aggressive , and obsessive style of play " . He highlights the fact that many of the problems of trying to run the original game on a modern computer are gone , and calls its compatibility with Steam 's Workshop " an amazing bonus " . 
 Paul Dean of Eurogamer was less forgiving ; although he agreed that the Workshop compatibility was a good addition and praised the players in the online community as " remarkably calm and friendly " , he thought that the game should have been updated more , citing its " boring campaign " and poorly @-@ aged gameplay mechanics : " It just doesn 't play very well , and its flaws are more blatant than ever before " . <unk> his criticisms of the lack of significant changes to the game , he described it as " a mouldy time @-@ capsule that will likely mar your memories of the original " . 
 = = Sequels = = 
 An expansion for The Age of Kings , The Conquerors , was released in 2000 . It introduced numerous new game features , including five new civilizations . Two of these , the Aztecs and the Mayans , represent the New World and have new distinctive architectural style . Other new civilizations are the Spanish , Huns , and Koreans . As well as three campaigns similar in concept to those in The Age of Kings , The Conquerors included a " Battles of the Conquerors " campaign which contained several unrelated battles such as those of Agincourt and Hastings . Age of Mythology , released in 2002 , broke away from the historical trend and instead focused on Greek , Egyptian , and Norse mythology . It shared many gameplay elements with The Age of Kings and was considered a spin @-@ off of the main Age of Empires series . 
 The third historical game in the Age of Empires series , Age of Empires III , was released in 2005 . The game portrayed the European colonization of the Americas . Aside from one significant feature , the home city , the game 's design was similar to that of its predecessor . 
 In 2012 , a free @-@ to @-@ play title was released in the series , called Age of Empires Online . While the game was freely accessible , it featured premium content which could either be earned through gameplay or purchased , enabling the player to use higher @-@ tier equipment and new game modes . Active development of the game ended on January 1 , 2014 , when executive producer Kevin Perry stated that adding new content was " no longer cost effective , " and announced that the game would be moving from " development phase " to its " support phase " . The game servers were subsequently shut down on July 1 , 2014 .

 Dwarka is believed to have been the first capital of Gujarat . The city 's name literally means the " gateway to heaven " in Sanskrit , as <unk> means " gate " and ka references " Brahma " . Dwarka has also been referred to throughout its history as " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " <unk> " . It is mentioned in the ancient prehistoric epic period of the Mahabharata . According to legend , Krishna settled here after he defeated and killed his uncle Kansa at Mathura . This mythological account of Krishna 's migration to Dwarka from Mathura is closely associated with the culture of Gujarat . Krishna is also said to have reclaimed 12 yojanas or 96 square kilometres ( 37 sq mi ) of land from the sea to create Dwarka . 
 It has been argued that Dwarka was established as the capital in Saurashtra by the Aryans during the <unk> . The Yadavas , who had migrated from Mathura , established their kingdom here when the city was known as " <unk> " . It was during this period that the city underwent rebuilding and was named Dwarka .

The settlements are in the form of exterior and interior walls , and fort bastions . From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India .

 Complete & Unbelievable : The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul , or simply Dictionary of Soul , is the fifth studio album by American soul singer @-@ songwriter Otis Redding and his last solo studio album released before his death . The successful Otis Blue and the following performance at Whisky a Go Go led to his rising fame across the United States . The album has two sides : the first mainly contains cover versions , and the second songs mainly written by Redding . 
 The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul was released on October 15 , 1966 on the Stax label and peaked at number 73 and at number 5 on the Billboard 200 and the R & B LP charts respectively . The album produced two singles , " Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa ( Sad Song ) " and " Try a Little Tenderness " . In 2016 , the album was ranked number 254 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time .

 The success of Redding 's third album , Otis Blue , saw a rearrangement of the Stax company . Producer and co @-@ founder of the American label Stax Records , Phil Walden , signed musicians including Percy Sledge , Johnnie Taylor , Clarence Carter and Eddie Floyd , and together with Redding they founded the production companies " <unk> Records " ( derived from Joe Galkin and Otis ) , on which only four recordings were released , two by Arthur Conley and one by Billy Young and Loretta Williams , and <unk> Music ( derived from Redding and Walden ) . 
 Redding decided to perform at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip in front of a predominantly white audience , becoming one of the first soul artists to play in the western United States . His performance received critical acclaim by the press , and musician Bob Dylan offered an alternative track of his hit song " Just Like a Woman " to him , but he declined his proposal . After his performance there he went back to the Stax studios to continue recording new songs . This would be his final solo studio album . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Dictionary of Soul features the Booker T. & the M.G. ' s — organist Booker T. Jones , pianist / guitarist Steve Cropper , bassist Donald " Duck " Dunn , drummer Al Jackson , Jr . — pianist Isaac Hayes , and the Memphis Horns , consisting of tenor saxophonist Joe Arnold , trumpeter Wayne Jackson , tenor saxophonist Andrew Love and baritone saxophonist Floyd Newman . 
 The album opens with " Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa ( Sad Song ) " . Derived from the theme of The $ 64 @,@ 000 Question , the song was written by Redding and Cropper and its lyrics are about Redding 's habit to hum or sing the horn lines . David Porter served as the background singer , singing the " fa @-@ fa @-@ fa @-@ fa @-@ fa " part alongside Redding . 
 The second single on this album , " Try a Little Tenderness " , was written by English songwriter duo Jimmy Campbell , Reg Connelly and American Tin Pan Alley songwriter Harry M. Woods in the early 30s , but it was not until February 1933 when bandleader and clarinetist Ted Lewis ' version became a hit . The first version by a black artist was by Aretha Franklin , who recorded it in 1962 for her The Tender , the Moving , the Swinging Aretha Franklin . Two years later , Sam Cooke recorded it as a part of a medley alongside Tin Pan Alley standard " For Sentimental Reasons " and " You Send Me " on his At The Copa . According to Cropper , Redding listened to the latter two songs , but rearranged it with the help of pianist Hayes . Examples of what the latter arranged and introduced was the tree @-@ part , contrapuntal horn line in the first seconds , which was inspired by Cooke 's " A Change is Gonna Come " strings , and the cymbal break in the peak , which Hayes later featured on his " Theme from Shaft " . The song was recorded on September 13 and released on November 14 , 1966 , charting at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number 4 on the Hot R & B chart . Side one features mainly cover versions , including country standard " Tennessee Waltz " and The Beatles ' " Day Tripper " , the latter of which was praised for turning " into a swaggering stomper " as opposed to the original . Parts of the song were later mixed in the Grammy Award @-@ winning " Otis " by hip @-@ hop artists Jay @-@ Z and Kanye West . 
 Side two is mainly composed of Redding songs , the exception being Chuck Willis ' " You 're Still My Baby " and " Love Have Mercy " , co @-@ written by David Porter and Hayes .

" He liked " My Lover 's Prayer " and " Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa @-@ Fa ( Sad Song ) " , asserting that they were worthy of an Academy Award . The backing bands were for him " thoroughly distinctive and remarkably adaptable , fitting to the nooks and crannies of Redding 's voice with their supple but muscular performances . " Magazine Rolling Stone rated the album 4 out of 5 stars , stating that Redding " delivers one of his most mature performances , smoky and at times almost <unk> " in " Try a Little Tenderness " , and the second single is " hard and precise but swinging . " In 2009 , Daryl Easlea of BBC music gave the album a positive review and stated that Redding was at the " peak of his powers " when he recorded it . One song from the album , " Try a Little Tenderness " , was said by Easlea to be Redding 's most remembered song after only " ( Sittin ' on ) The Dock of the Bay " , which was released posthumously shortly after his death . The album was ranked at number 251 on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .

 National Weather Service Lincoln , Illinois also known as National Weather Service Central Illinois is a weather forecast office responsible for monitoring weather conditions for 35 counties in Central and Southeastern Illinois . The Central Illinois office initially consisted of two forecast offices in Peoria and Springfield until the current location in Lincoln became the sole local forecast office in 1995 . Federal meteorology offices and stations in the region date back to the 19th century when the Army Signal Service began taking weather observations using weather equipment at the Springer Building in Springfield . Since that time the presence of the National Weather Service greatly increased with the <unk> of new weather radars , stations and forecast offices . The current office in Lincoln maintains a WSR @-@ 88D ( NEXRAD ) radar system , and Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System ( AWIPS ) that greatly improve forecasting in the region . Lincoln is in charge of weather forecasts , warnings and local statements as well as aviation weather .

 On July 1 , 1879 the Army Signal Service began taking weather observations using weather equipment at the Springer Building in Springfield becoming the first federal weather station in the region . Eleven years later the U.S. Weather Bureau was founded and the equipment in Springfield was transferred from the Signal Service to the Weather Bureau . In 1898 Springfield became the site of a new weather station that used kites to measure data in the atmosphere using tethered instruments . In 1905 Peoria became the site of a new U.S. Weather Bureau , constructed at the cost of $ 7 @,@ 969 the station measured temperatures , wind speeds , precipitation , snowfall , and barometric pressure . A year later at the Peoria Station a telegraph was installed to help better transmit weather data and observations . In Springfield the Weather Bureau was officially moved from its original location to a new building at 7th and Monroe . In 1928 the Springfield Weather Bureau moved temporarily to the Abe Lincoln Hotel and the old office was subsequently destroyed for construction of a new federal courthouse . Finally in 1930 the Springfield office was moved to its new location at the Springfield federal building .

As the aviation industry grew a Weather Bureau Airport Station ( <unk> ) was opened at the Peoria Municipal Airport , initial observations included temperature , wind and rain readings . Only a couple of months later another <unk> station was opened at a small airport in Springfield . In 1943 weather bureau operations at the original Peoria office merged with the airport station and in 1944 the original station closed permanently . In 1947 the airport weather station in Springfield was moved to the new Lincoln Capital Airport . In 1954 the Springfield Weather Bureau was closed and the airport station picked up the responsibilities of the old office .

In 1965 the weather bureau becomes part of the Environmental Science Services Administration ( ESSA ) and only a few years later it became the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and the Weather Bureau became the National Weather Service ( NWS ) . The Peoria and Springfield offices become known as " Weather Service Offices " under the new agency . In 1974 another radar ( WSR @-@ <unk> ) was installed in Marseilles greatly improving the radar coverage in Central Illinois . A new radar , WSR @-@ 74C , was installed in Moline and helped the Peoria NWS issue severe weather warnings for the region . In 1980 the Springfield office received a WSR @-@ 74C radar system to use for local warning operations . In 1992 Automated Surface Observing Systems ( ASOS ) were installed at both the Peoria and Springfield airports .

 In 1993 construction began on a new NWS Weather Forecast Office at the Logan County Airport in Lincoln . The new office would be part of a modernization plan that relocate all operation to Lincoln and close the Peoria and Springfield offices . In 1994 the new Lincoln office was officially accepted by the federal government but did not have any operational responsibilities to begin with . The following year the upper air equipment from the National Weather Service Paducah was moved to the new Lincoln location , the only function the new office had at the time was to take observations using this equipment . In the spring of 1995 construction began on a new WSR @-@ 88D radar system in Lincoln . The first five meteorologists reported to the Lincoln location , but forecasting responsibilities remained at the Peoria and Springfield offices . By September 1995 the Lincoln office began full @-@ time operations sand picks up the counties from the Peoria and Springfield offices as well as a few from the Saint Louis and Evansville offices . On October 1 , 1995 the National Weather Service offices in Peoria and Springfield were officially closed after serving Central Illinois since the early 20th century . 
 In 1996 the WSR @-@ 88D radar was completed and joins a network of other " NEXRAD " radars throughout the country , while the WSR @-@ 74C in Springfield was officially decommissioned . In 1998 an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System ( AWIPS ) is installed at the office and helps forecasters make more accurate weather forecasts in the region . By the early 21st century the weather radio network in the region was greatly expanding and Lincoln could transmit warnings and general forecasts via such stations .

 Lincoln is equipped with a WSR @-@ 88D ( NEXRAD ) radar , one of 159 high @-@ resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service . The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System ( AWIPS ) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather , satellite , and computer model data by forecasters . In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems ( ASOS ) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport . NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties . The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook , river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops . The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future , coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog . There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities , staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons , river stage observations , operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network . During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its covered area into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation of his or her own sector . Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings . Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks , coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters .

The Weather Bureau used many rain gauges across the region to measure the impacts of the storm . The National Weather Service in Lincoln has covered many significant weather events in its history . Early in the Lincoln office 's history , an F3 tornado that was part of the May 1995 Tornado Outbreak Sequence passed within two miles of the new office . During the North American blizzard of 1999 several Lincoln forecasters were forced to spend 1 @-@ 2 consecutive days at the office when their replacements could not get to them . During the May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence the office used new high resolution warning products consisting of suite of three applications ; Base <unk> ( DZ ) , Base Velocity ( DV ) , and Storm Relative Mean Radial Velocity Map ( <unk> ) .

 Melbourne Castle was a medieval castle in Melbourne , Derbyshire . It was built on the site of an earlier royal manor house that had provided accommodation for noblemen hunting in a nearby royal park in the reign of King John . Construction of the castle was started in 1311 by Thomas , 2nd Earl of Lancaster , and continued until 1322 , shortly before his execution , but the work was never fully completed . 
 From the early fourteenth century , Melbourne Castle was mainly in the possession of the Earls and Dukes of Lancaster or the crown . Improvements and repairs were made , notably by John of Gaunt , and the building was in generally good condition throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries . John I , Duke of Bourbon , was kept at Melbourne for 19 years after his capture at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 , and the castle was considered as a possible prison for Mary Queen of Scots , although events led to her incarceration elsewhere . 
 The castle was in decline by the end of the reign of Elizabeth I. Although the stonework was sound , minimal maintenance had led to significant deterioration of other parts of the structure . The manor was purchased in 1604 by Henry Hastings , 5th Earl of Huntingdon , who had his own castle in nearby Ashby @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Zouch . The Melbourne property was then demolished and used as a source for building materials . All that remains of Melbourne Castle today is a section of wall about 15 m ( 50 ft ) long and 4 m ( 13 ft ) high and some foundations ; nothing is known of the internal layout of the former building . The ruins are grade II listed and the site is a scheduled monument . There is no public access to the site .

 Melbourne is a town in South Derbyshire close to the River Trent , which may have originated as buildings associated with the royal manor to the south of the nearby settlement at Kings Newton . Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier manor house of unknown date ; there is an old tradition that the manor was originally established in about the year 900 , during the reign of Alfred the Great , but there is no evidence for this . As recorded in the Domesday Book , the manor of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King Edward the Confessor prior to the Norman Conquest . The property then passed into the hands of William I of England . After creating the Diocese of Carlisle in 1133 , Henry I gave the manor for life to Æthelwold , the first bishop . Some time later , the diocese built a palace nearby on the site of what is now Melbourne Hall . When Bishop Æthelwold died in about 1156 , the manor reverted to the crown . 
 A royal hunting park close to Melbourne was probably created by King John around 1200 , and the King is known to have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions . John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp , although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown , being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter <unk> of Carlisle in about 1230 . The estate returned to the crown on the bishop 's death in 1248 , and Henry granted the land to his son , Edmund Crouchback , 1st Earl of Lancaster in 1265 . At some later date , the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc , before passing to Thomas , 2nd Earl of Lancaster , the King 's son . This was in 1298 when he came of age , his father having died two years earlier . Early references to the house itself are rare , but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King 's Chamber in 1248 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The castle was built to the east of the fourteenth @-@ century town on a slightly raised location . The area enclosed within the castle 's outer walls was about 2 @.@ 8 ha ( 7 acres ) , but with outbuildings , other ancillary constructions and orchards , the total area has been estimated to be at least 8 ha ( 20 acres ) . The walls were constructed with rubble faced with ashlar , and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3 m ( 10 ft ) thick . 
 All that is known of the appearance of the castle is from contemporary drawings . Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes , there are better preserved sites which share some features . Tutbury and Pontefract castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels , and Tutbury 's motte and Pontefract 's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations . Sandal Castle has a multi @-@ angular tower like those depicted , and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain . 
 A bakehouse , kitchen and chapel are recorded , as well as the hall , great chamber , and drawbridge , but the details of the internal layout for the castle are unknown .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Earl Thomas granted the manor to his steward , Robert de Holland , in February 1308 . In 1311 , Robert obtained a licence to crenellate from Edward II in order to fortify the manor house , and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322 . Local tradition says that the stone was obtained from a quarry on the site of what is now Melbourne Pool . The records show £ 1 @,@ 313 was spent on the project in the year 1313 – 14 , of which £ 548 was paid to masons for dressing stone . Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at Ravenstone in 1315 . The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local bedrock , Millstone Grit . This is a coarsely grained sandstone which can be worked to produce good @-@ quality ashlar . The village was centred around the church , castle and High Street until the late eighteenth century . 
 Earl Thomas , with other barons , captured King Edward 's favourite , Piers Gaveston , and killed him in 1312 . Nevertheless , the King stayed at Melbourne in 1314 . For a time , after Edward 's defeat at Bannockburn , the earl , a friend of the Scots , controlled most of England , but by 1321 , Edward had raised an army and driven Thomas from the Midlands . The Lancastrian castles at Melbourne and Tutbury were left deserted and looted by the local populace . Earl Thomas was finally defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322 . He was swiftly executed , and Robert de Holland was beheaded in 1328 . The King sent a garrison to Melbourne and appointed a steward , Ralph Basset , to replace the incumbent , John de <unk> . In March , those who had stolen from the castle were arrested , and by April Edward had withdrawn his troops . He appointed Robert <unk> and Roger de <unk> in 1323 to help administer his possessions in Melbourne using money obtained from confiscations of rebel property in Staffordshire . Edward stayed at Melbourne again in 1325 , and while there he issued a right to collect tolls to the men of nearby <unk> to repair the bridge over the Trent . 
 = = = Lancastrian improvements = = = 
 The castle , still unfinished at the time of Thomas ' execution , and its lands , remained as crown property until it was bestowed on Henry , 3rd Earl of Lancaster , Earl Thomas ' brother , in 1327 . In turn , it passed to Henry 's son , the fourth earl , who became the first Duke of Lancaster . At the time of the duke 's death in 1361 , his constable was Ingram Fauconer , who received an annual life stipend of £ 10 , a further £ 5 going to his wife . Henry 's heiress was Blanche , wife of John of Gaunt . Duke John confirmed Fauconer 's pension when he came into possession of the Lancastrian lands . 
 Peter Melbourne was made keeper of the Melbourne estate in 1377 with an annual income of £ 10 . He was granted another 66s 8d in 1386 , and 10 marks ( £ 6 13s 4d ) in 1395 . The last award was conditional on his not meddling with the offices of constable and keeper of the parks , which had passed on to his son , also called Peter . The younger Peter Melbourne was involved in the upbringing of the future Henry IV during the reign of Richard II . He was again appointed constable and steward of the Derbyshire manor in March 1399 , although he gave up his office in April in return for an annuity from King Richard , who had confiscated the Lancastrian estates when John of Gaunt died earlier that year . Upon Henry 's seizure of the throne , Peter was confirmed as constable and in October 1399 , his annuity was increased from £ 10 to 100 marks ( £ 66 8s ) ; in the following year he was awarded land in Derbyshire confiscated from Thomas Merke , Bishop of Carlisle , co @-@ leader of plot against the King . 
 The Duchy of Lancaster continued to improve and expand the property through the 14th and 15th centuries . John of Gaunt had windows glazed in the Communal Hall and the Great Chamber in 1392 / 3 , along with other works . He repaired a drawbridge in 1393 / 4 and made plumbing improvements in 1399 / 1400 , using lead acquired as a forfeit two years earlier . 
 For 19 years , the castle served as a prison for John I , Duke of Bourbon after he was taken at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 . His custodian was a Nicholas Montgomery the Younger . Nineteenth @-@ century local historian John Joseph Briggs claimed that during the Wars of the Roses , the castle was partially dismantled by the Lancastrian forces of Margaret of Anjou , but since her campaign was along the line of the Great North Road , it was Melbourne , Cambridgeshire she sacked , not its Derbyshire namesake . 
 In 1545 , antiquarian John Leland reported to Henry VIII the property was in good enough shape that it was described as " <unk> and yn <unk> good reparation " perhaps following repairs in the reign of Edward IV , when Sir Ralph Shirley , a commander at Agincourt , was governor of the castle . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 When Elizabeth I became queen , she ordered a survey of her castles . A 1562 report told her that only ten castles in the north of her realm were worth keeping ; Melbourne was not one of these . A further survey in 1576 reported that , although the stonework was in good condition apart from one chimney and window , the timbers were perished , the lead roof was full of holes , one kitchen was on the verge of collapse , and another needed its floor replacing . In the same year , George Talbot , 6th Earl of Shrewsbury wrote to the queen to assure her that the castle was in good condition , worth £ 1 @,@ 000 , and could be repaired for £ 100 . Since he was responsible for keeping the imprisoned Mary , Queen of Scots and her 140 retainers , he hoped to get her moved to Melbourne . In 1583 , the castle was inspected again to see if it was suitable to house the captive queen . Although the rooms were sufficient in number and quality , the unfinished building was deemed " imperfect at every corner " . The large rooms would need subdividing , the floors were earth and plaster , and there was no paved courtyard " so as being out of <unk> you are in the <unk> , for it is verie <unk> and <unk> to walk round about the said house " . In 1584 , Queen Elizabeth finally decided to move Mary to Melbourne , only for the plan to be abandoned following the Babington Plot to assassinate the English queen and place her Scottish cousin on the throne . 
 In 1597 , the castle was being used as a cattle pound , although a survey in 1602 assured Elizabeth that it was a " faire and <unk> castle " , in the charge of Gilbert , Earl of <unk> . The constable 's annual fee of £ 10 was the same as that paid to Ingram Fauconer 140 years earlier . 
 The castle and lands were bought for £ 4 @,@ 700 in 1604 , by Henry Hastings , 5th Earl of Huntingdon , whose family seat at Ashby de la Zouch Castle was just 11 km ( 7 mi ) away . Melbourne Castle was destroyed between 1610 and 1637 so that its materials could be used in other construction . By 1629 , it is likely that all the worked stone above ground level had been removed ; Sir John Coke of Melbourne Hall obtained permission from the Bishop of Carlisle in that year to quarry stone from the castle foundations . Some of the facing stones were used to repair the weir at King 's Mill , seen by some at the time to fulfil the words of a local prophet that " the waters of the Trent should overflow the towers of Melbourne castle " . The Hastings estate was gradually sold off , and the castle site was sold by Earl Moira in 1811 . 
 = = Ruins and archaeology = = 
 A section of rubble wall about 15 m ( 50 ft ) long and 4 m ( 13 ft ) high remains , incorporated into outbuilding of the adjacent farm on its north side . The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly grade II listed and the castle remains are designated as a scheduled monument . The area to the south of the wall has been excavated to reveal the ashlar bases of two polygonal towers . The site is on the east side of Castle Street in a private garden to which there is no public access . 
 Some of the stone taken from the castle was used to construct the mid @-@ eighteenth @-@ century grade II @-@ listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street , and other buildings known to have used the stone , but no longer extant , include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory . The mill , now demolished , was said to have been built on castle foundations up to 4 m ( 12 ft ) thick ; 15 Castle Street also rests on the old foundation wall . It is likely that the former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material . 
 An early nineteenth @-@ century excavation found underground apartments " of considerable extent and superior workmanship " , and excavations in the latter part of the same century found considerable foundations in the gardens of Castle Farm . Castle Mills housing estate contains a now @-@ covered well 2 m ( 6 ft ) in width and 15 m ( 50 ft ) deep , and work in 1961 uncovered massive 5 m ( 16 ft ) foundations east of the old mill and on the same alignment as the existing wall . Excavations in 1969 – 1971 found an extensive network of walls faced with ashlar , a door post , the base of a spiral staircase and evidence of an outer courtyard . Many stones had mason 's marks . During construction works in 1988 , masonry including the rubble centres of two large east – west walls was found in test trenches . Apart from the area of the turret bases next to the standing wall , none of the archaeology is now visible . 
 = Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock = 
 Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock , 187 U.S. 553 ( 1903 ) was a United States Supreme Court case brought against the US government by the Kiowa chief Lone Wolf , who charged that Native American tribes under the Medicine Lodge Treaty had been defrauded of land by Congressional actions in violation of the treaty . 
 The Court declared that the " plenary power " of the United States Congress gave it authority to unilaterally abrogate treaty obligations between the United States and Native American tribes . The decision marked a departure from the holdings of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia , 30 U.S. 1 ( 1831 ) , and Worcester v. Georgia , 31 U.S. 515 ( 1832 ) , which had shown greater respect for the autonomy of Native American tribes . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Tribes = = = 
 The Kiowa tribe is a Native American tribe that has historically inhabited the southern Great Plains what is now present @-@ day Oklahoma , Texas , Kansas , and New Mexico . Originally from the northern great plains along the Platte River , and under pressure from other tribes , they eventually moved and settled south of the Arkansas River primarily in present @-@ day Oklahoma . The Kiowa had a long history of close association and alliance with the Kiowa @-@ Apache or Plains Apache . Around 1790 , the Kiowa also formed an alliance with the Comanche and formed a barrier to European @-@ American incursions into their territories . This alliance made travel on the Santa Fe Trail hazardous , with attacks on wagon trains beginning in 1828 and continuing thereafter . 
 = = = Treaties = = = 
 In 1837 at Fort Gibson , leaders of the Kiowa tribe signed their first treaty with the United States . By 1854 , the need for another treaty became apparent , and the United States entered into a treaty with the Kiowa , Comanche , and Kiowa @-@ Apache ( KCA ) at Fort <unk> , Indian Territory . The treaty did not specifically designate a reservation , but was , for the most part , an extension of the 1837 treaty . There was an attempt to place some of the tribes on a reservation on the Brazos River in Texas near Fort Belknap , under Indian Agent Robert S. Neighbors . By 1858 , Neighbors resolved to move the reservation into Indian Territory . By August 1859 , Neighbors had moved the Indians from the Brazos Reservation to Indian Territory , south of the Washita River near Fort Cobb . In 1865 , near present @-@ day Wichita , Kansas , the three tribes signed another treaty that provided for the reservation in present @-@ day Oklahoma and Texas . Finally , in 1867 , the tribes agreed to the Medicine Lodge Treaty . This treaty provided for a much smaller reservation , and stipulated that whites were not allowed to encroach on the reservation . Also , to further reduce the reserve 's land would require the approval of three @-@ fourths of the tribal members . 
 = = = Assimilation period = = = 
 Within one year , the United States breached the treaty when General William T. Sherman ordered all the tribes to Fort Cobb , withheld the treaty payments to them , and requested an order declaring that all hunting rights be forfeited . At the same time , Indian agents were trying to undermine tribal authority as the buffalo herds were being eliminated by white hunting . Two new leaders emerged during this time period , Quanah Parker and Lone Wolf ( the younger ) Following his defeat at the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon , Parker settled down and began to adopt white ways . Lone Wolf and his followers continued to resist assimilation policies . Many of the old tribal leaders had been arrested and imprisoned when they left the reservation to hunt , and war leaders such as Lone Wolf ( the elder ) started to pass away from old age and disease . 
 During this same period , as the tribes had been unsuccessful at farming it , the KCA found a way to make the land pay by leasing it to cattlemen for grazing . By 1885 , about 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 acres ( 610 @,@ 000 ha ) were being used to graze about 75 @,@ 000 cattle , with an annual payment to the tribes of $ 55 @,@ 000 . At the same time , whites living just outside the reservation boundary were coming onto it to take timber and other goods , resulting in the tribes forming a police force to protect their property from white theft . 
 = = = The Jerome Commission = = = 
 In 1892 , the United States sent the Jerome Commission , consisting of David H. Jerome , Alfred M. Wilson , and Warren G. Sayre , to meet with the Kiowa to convince them to turn over most of their reserve for white settlement in return for $ 2 million . Lone Wolf spoke out in opposition to the allotment , saying : 
 Now we have several good schools on the reservation , and to them we intend to send our children , where they will be taught the arts of manual labor . There they will learn to live like white people , and soon then they will be civilized . We advised our people to build houses , and quite a number of them today are living in houses . Some are building and still others are contemplating building . For that reason , because we are making such rapid progress , we ask the commission not to push us ahead too fast on the road we are to take . This morning in council the Comanches decided not to sell the country , and the Kiowas decided not to sell the country , and the Apaches decided not to sell the country . And I do not wish the commission to force us . That is all . 
 After over a week of negotiations , terms were set so that each member would receive 160 acres . The tribes would receive $ 2 million of which $ 250 @,@ 000 would be paid to members , with the remaining money to be held in trust for the tribes at 5 % interest . The commission immediately began to collect signatures and , just as quickly , allegations of fraud arose . Joshua Givens , an interpreter , was widely suspected of being dishonest . He was accused of forcing some members to sign and tricking others into thinking they were signing a document opposing the agreement . By now , the tribes were almost unanimous in their opposition to the agreement , asked to see the document , and requested that their signatures be removed . Lone Wolf later stated that this was refused and that they were threatened with violence . Jerome left the reservation with what the government claimed was the approval of three @-@ quarters of the tribe . 
 = = = Congress = = = 
 With the validity of the agreement in question , the tribes , joined by the Indian Rights Association ( IRA ) and local ranchers , lobbied against its ratification by Congress . The IRA wrote letters to Senators , stating that the agreement was : " utterly destructive of that honor and good faith which should characterize our dealings with any people , and especially with one too weak to enforce their rights as against us by any other mean as than an appeal to our sense of justice . " The Secretary of the Interior informed Congress that the allotment would be devastating to the tribes , as the land was not suited to farming , and the amount of land allotted would not allow them sufficient land to graze cattle . A bill was introduced in 1892 to ratify the agreement , but failed to receive the necessary votes . It was reintroduced every year until it passed in 1900 , eight years later . The agreement finally passed when the Rock Island Railroad agree to set aside an additional 480 @,@ 000 acres of pastureland for the tribes to hold in common . 
 = = = Lower courts = = = 
 At the ratification of the agreement , a delegation of tribal leaders traveled to Washington , D.C. and requested a meeting with President William McKinley . McKinley 's position was that the tribes must conform to the decision of Congress . Parker and the other principal chiefs accepted that the fight against allotment was over but Lone Wolf continued to argue against accepting allotment . In 1901 , Lone Wolf and others hired William M. Springer , a former federal judge and congressman . 
 = = = = Supreme Court of the District of Columbia = = = = 
 On June 6 , 1901 , Springer filed suit in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia , which is a different court than the United States Supreme Court . The plaintiffs asked for an injunction to stop the opening of KCA lands to settlement and the allotment of the land . Springer argued that the Jerome agreement deprived the tribes of their lands without due process and in violation of the Constitution by breaking the treaty with the tribes . Springer alleged that the KCA were duped into signing the agreement and that it was not signed by three @-@ quarters of the members as required by the treaty , that the KCA had protested the agreement from the beginning , and that the version which Congress ratified was different from the version signed by the KCA . While the suit was being heard , on August 6 , 1901 , the government began to sell off the tribes ' surplus land . Judge A.C. Bradley ruled against Lone Wolf , holding that Congress had the authority to allot the land , citing United States v. Kagama . 
 = = = = Circuit Court of Appeals = = = = 
 Springer then appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals . By the time that court heard the appeal , the reservation land had been allotted and excess land sold . The D.C. Circuit ruled that the question was not justiciable , rather it was a political question which had to be decided by Congress . The Court held that an act of Congress must prevail over any specific article in a treaty with an Indian tribe . The court further held that , in any event , the land did not belong to the tribe . It was controlled by the United States , with Indians as mere occupants . The Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the lower court .

 = = = Arguments = = = 
 At this point , the IRA hired another attorney , Hampton L. Carson , to take the lead from Springer . The arguments remained the same as they had in the lower courts : that the tribes were being deprived of their land without due process . The attorneys noted that the United States had never deprived a tribe of its land without some form of consent by the tribe . Carson and Springer highlighted Worcester v. Georgia and the Indian canon of construction in their arguments . 
 Willis Van Devanter argued the case for the United States , taking the position that Congress had the power to abrogate the treaty at will . Devanter cited Kagama as authority for Congress having plenary power over Indian matters . 
 = = = Opinion of the court = = = 
 Justice Edward White delivered the opinion of the unanimous court . The Court held that Congress had the authority to void treaty obligations with Native American tribes because it had an inherent plenary power , noting : 
 " Authority over the tribal relations of the Indians has been exercised by Congress from the beginning , and the power has always been deemed a political one , not subject to be controlled by the judicial department of the government . " 
 The decision was based , among other things , on a paternalistic view of the United States ' relationship with the tribes : 
 " These Indian tribes are the wards of the nation . They are communities dependent on the United States . Dependent largely for their daily food . Dependent for their political rights . They own no allegiance to the states , and receive from them no protection . Because of the local ill feeling , the people of the states where they are found are often their deadliest enemies . From their very weakness and helplessness , so largely due to the course of dealing of the Federal government with them and the treaties in which it has been promised , there arises the duty of protection , and with it the power . This has always been recognized by the executive and by Congress , and by this court , whenever the question has arisen . " 
 The decision presented American Indians as inferior in race , culture , and religion : 
 " It is to be presumed that in this matter the United States would be governed by such considerations of justice as would control a Christian people in their treatment of an ignorant and dependent race . Be that is it may , the propriety or justice of their action towards the Indians with respect to their lands is a question of governmental policy , and is not a matter open to discussion in a controversy between third parties , neither of whom derives title from the Indians . " 
 White held that requiring tribal consent would actually hurt the tribes , and that the tribes should presume that Congress would act in good faith to protect tribal needs . 
 Justice John Marshall Harlan concurred in the judgment , but did not author a separate opinion . 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 This was one of the first cases where an Indian tribe went to court rather than resort to warfare to resolve an issue . It was also a major defeat for the tribes . Reports show that ninety percent of the land allotted to tribal members was lost by them to settlers . By the 1920s , the KCA tribes were impoverished , with an unemployment rate of sixty percent . 
 By 1934 , approximately 90 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 36 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ha ) , which was two @-@ thirds of Indian lands , had been transferred to settlers . Until the Meriam Report was published showing the destructive effects of the policy , the allotment process continued unchecked . By the time Congress ended allotment , the KCA land went from 2 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 ha ) to about 3 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 ha ) . Also , the Court 's ruling meant that the only recourse left for Indian tribes to use to resolve land disputes was Congress . Indians were not eligible to bring a case in the United States Court of Claims under the Tucker Act , and were limited to actions in often hostile state courts . 
 Legally , scholars have compared Lone Wolf to the infamous Dred Scott case , and universally condemned the decision .

 Carla Cohen , after losing her job with the Carter administration , decided to create an independent bookstore in Washington , D.C. , despite having no previous experience with running a business . She partnered with Barbara Meade , whom she found through the classifieds , and who , with her previous experience of managing a bookstore , became a co @-@ owner early on . Cohen decided to name the store Politics and Prose because it was " Washington @-@ sounding " and not pretentious , and the two co @-@ owners founded the store in 1984 . Meade worried that the name was a put @-@ off , and the store struggled at first to attract authors to speak at its events and relied on local journalists to publicize the location . The store 's original location in the Forest Hills neighborhood was across the street from its current spot , and in 1989 , Politics and Prose moved to their present larger location after finding success . Politics and Prose has over the years expanded their sections and collections . The store merged with a nearby children 's bookstore , the Cheshire Cat , and incorporated its staff in 1990 . 
 = = = Failed sale attempt = = = 
 Business continued to be successful during the late 1990s as other independent bookstores fell by the wayside and companies like Barnes & Noble expanded . Cohen and Meade decided to sell the store to Danny Gainsburg , who was selling his T @-@ shirt business so he would be able to afford the cost of the store . The co @-@ owners made an agreement with Gainsburg that he would gain control of the store if he was able to function amicably with the rest of the staff . Cohen and Meade set him up in a part @-@ time position to see how he would interact with the employees and sold him an equity stake in the business without informing the other staff members . After a number of other incidents , Gainsburg was pressured to leave by the staff after he kissed an employee on her birthday . The three co @-@ owners agreed that Gainsburg should resign , and Gainsburg received back his initial investment plus a premium . Gainsburg said to the Wall Street Journal , " We all started with good motives , but there was lots of naiveté on all sides . " In 2006 , a year after the botched sale attempt , Cohen and Meade both decided to hold onto the store as sole co @-@ owners for at least three to five more years and met with an outside consultant to devise an eventual exit strategy .

 In June 2010 , Cohen and Meade announced their intention to sell the store ; Cohen also became seriously ill around this time , and it contributed to the timing of their decision to sell . Jim Lehrer wrote of the impending sale , " ... putting Politics and Prose up for sale is like putting the Washington Monument up for sale . " There was considerable speculation in the media about possible buyers for the store . There were reportedly over 50 inquiries by October into the possible purchase of the store from Meade and Cohen 's husband , David , who inherited her stake in the store after her death from cancer . 
 It was announced on March 28 , 2011 that two former employees of The Washington Post , Bradley Graham , and his wife , Lissa Muscatine , had purchased the store from Meade and David Cohen . The store was reportedly sold for $ 2 million , although price was not the main factor in the selection of new owners . Meade fully retired from work in the store on December 31 , 2012 . 
 Graham and Muscatine have added literary classes and trips since purchasing the store . The co @-@ owners are also considering an expansion of the store into a Georgetown location . 
 = = Services and reputation = = 
 Politics and Prose has a reputation for staff who are able to recommend books to customers . The 14 @,@ 000 square foot space contains an Espresso Book Machine for on demand printing of self @-@ published and out of print books , a cafe on the first floor of the building called " Modern Times " , and a number of different book genres . A Washington Post review of the cafe in 2006 reacted favorably to changes to the menu . 
 The store is famous for its author events , in which writers usually read an excerpt from their book and take questions from the audience . The Washington Post notes that as the talks gained prominence and the store grew more popular , Cohen and Meade , the original co @-@ owners , " became known as literary tastemakers " . C @-@ SPAN broadcasts around five of the talks a month , and the store has gained a reputation for having astute and smart audiences present at readings . Famous readers at its author events have included politicians such as Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama , and former Senator Edward Brooke , authors J.K. Rowling , Salman Rushdie , and Amy Chua , photographer Annie Leibovitz , and investigative reporter David Halberstam . Cohen in the past refused to allow some prominent writers to appear in the store , such as Matt Drudge , ostensibly because of their conservative leanings . 
 Politics and Prose is often seen to be an important stop for authors publicizing their work and is regarded as being a significant part of DC culture . New owners Bradley Graham and Lissa Muscatine were ranked # 50 on GQ 's " The 50 Most Powerful People in Washington " because of their purchase of Politics and Prose , describing the store as " ... liberal Washington 's most sacred space . " The New Yorker 's Hendrik Hertzberg commented on the unusually intelligent questions from the audience at readings , and Slate 's editor in 2007 , said : " If there 's one bookstore in the city you want to read in , it 's obviously the place .

 The Peace Candle is a tower @-@ like structure erected every Christmas season in Easton , Pennsylvania . The approximately 106 @-@ foot ( 32 m ) tall structure , which resembles a giant candle , is assembled each year over the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument , a Civil War memorial located in the city 's Centre Square . It is typically assembled in mid November and lighted over Thanksgiving weekend and disassembled in early February each year . 
 The Peace Candle was first erected in 1951 , and has been put up almost every year since then . Due to damage or disrepair , the Peace Candle has been replaced with new candle structures twice since the original construction . The first candle lasted until 1968 , the second candle from 1969 to 1989 , and the current candle was built in 1990 and is expected to last until around 2014 . The structure is dedicated to the Easton area men and women who have served or are serving in the United States armed forces . 
 It has been said to be the largest non @-@ wax Christmas candle in the country . Although conceived with the hopes of restoring Easton 's pre @-@ 20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations , city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations . Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument , the candle has been the site of several anti @-@ war protests over the decades . Some have criticized the Peace Candle , calling it a symbol of the over @-@ commercialization of Christmas , and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument .

 The Peace Candle has undergone several changes and variations over the last 58 years . The current candle was built in 1990 , and is expected to last until about 2014 , after which time Easton officials expect to build a new one . As of 2009 , the central main candle stands 94 @-@ foot ( 29 m ) , and the base brings it to about 106 @-@ foot ( 32 m ) . It reaches a height of about 118 @-@ foot ( 36 m ) above ground level when factoring the monument it rests atop . When the candle is assembled , several 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) by 8 @-@ foot by 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) box pieces are placed around the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument , a Civil War memorial in Centre Square , the town square of Easton 's Downtown neighborhood . Made from marine @-@ grade plywood and galvanized steel , the box pieces are stacked vertically until the structure is assembled , and then bolted together using about 500 bolts inside the Peace Candle . The flame placed atop the candle is about 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high and illuminated with 31 bulbs . The entire structure weighs between eight and 10 tons . The main candle is surrounded by four , 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high side candles , and a fountain that surrounds the Peace Candle 's base is filled with a ring of Christmas trees . 
 The Peace Candle is believed to be the largest non @-@ wax Christmas candle in the United States . Since it was first erected in 1951 , Easton city officials have at various times declared it the largest candle in the world . In 1972 , city council president Henry Schultz declared , " We claim , and no one has ever argued with us , that this is the largest candle in the world . " However , the Schlitz Christmas Candle , a non @-@ wax candle @-@ like structure in Schlitz , a small town in Hesse , Germany , is larger at 138 @-@ foot ( 42 m ) tall . The current Peace Candle is taller than the Guinness World Record @-@ holder for tallest candle , which belongs to an 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) tall , 8 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) wide candle exhibited at the General Art and Industrial Exhibition of Stockholm in 1897 . However , only wax candles are eligible for the record , and there is no Guinness World Record for largest non @-@ wax candle . When the third incarnation of the Peace Candle was built in 1990 , Easton officials tried unsuccessful to seek a Guinness record for it .

 Easton , the county seat of Northampton County in Pennsylvania , was considered one of the earliest cities to feature elaborate Christmas decoration displays on its city streets , with brightly colored lights and ornamental displays adorning its homes , businesses and residences long before they appeared in other American cities . Easton is also believed to be the home of America 's first Christmas tree , as German immigrants who settled in Easton brought the symbol with them in 1816 . By the mid @-@ 20th century , however , the predominance of Christmas decorations began to diminish in Easton , and support among city officials and residents began to wane as interest in the tradition dropped . Bethlehem , another Northampton County city , came better known for its elaborate Christmas decorations , although it has been suggested it followed the example first set by Easton . In 1951 , Mrs. Hutton Hughes wrote a letter in the city 's newspaper , The Easton Express , urging that a new holiday program of Christmas lighting be established in the city . On June 13 , 1951 , the Merchants Association of the Easton Chamber of Commerce responded to the letter by forming the Easton Area Christmas Committee , which set a goal of restoring the prestige of Easton 's old Yuletide decorations . Several suggestions were made for a Christmas centerpiece in Centre Square , the town square of Easton 's downtown neighborhood , to serve as the focal point of the Christmas program and promote downtown shopping . One of the suggestions was to pile evergreen trees around the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument , a Civil War memorial located in Centre Square , but it was deemed too expensive to pursue . Another suggestion was to attach a giant candy cane atop the monument , but it was dismissed as too secular . During one of the committee meetings , Easton resident Virginia Purdy suggested the idea of assembling a large candle in Centre Square , " because it would have no commercial aspect and it would serve to further good will in the community " . The proposal was accepted . 
 Easton Councilman Frank Bechtel was named chairman of the Easton Area Christmas Committee , and W. Nilan Jones was appointed chairman of the construction subcommittee . Jones , with the help of committee member and architect William Tydeman , studied the engineering angles involved in building a wooden candle structure that could be assembled over the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument . After determining such a project would be feasible , Jones drafted plans for a 96 @-@ foot ( 29 m ) candle @-@ shaped tower . The committee sought $ 4 @,@ 000 for the Christmas display , and asked about 1 @,@ 200 businesspeople were asked to make donations . Volunteers from the community , as well as members of the Local 239 United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America , dedicated time , money and materials to the project , and Theodore Bean , proprietor of the local contractor company Bean , Inc . , arranged for the use of his equipment and services to erect the candle . 
 However , four days before it was scheduled to be built , Tydeman determined the structure design was too high to withstand the winds , and that there was a risk that it could topple along with the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument . Tydeman resigned from the project to protect his company from possibly liability , but helped the committee come up with a new , safer design . The committee considered piercing the plywood panels to allow wind to travel through , but Jones said " some of the wood could have splintered apart and taken someone 's head off " . Jones called A.P. Heller , the Reading @-@ based company that built the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument , and sought advice from the son of the man who owned the firm when the work was done . The son suggested shortening the candle would allow it to withstand the wind , but also delivered a message from his father : " He wants to know why you want to cover up his work ? " The candle proposal was completely redesigned and cut to 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) . 
 The planned structure was referred to as the Christmas Candle , which it was called every year until 1967 . Construction began on December 8 , 1951 . Using a crane with a 95 @-@ foot ( 29 m ) berm , as well as electrical equipment and other tools , 20 workmen placed the heavy plywood sheathing sections along all four sides of the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument . The structure was red with speckles of gold and silver , and green fir foliage around the base . It was assembled in four sections , which each ranged between 300 pounds ( 140 kg ) and 750 pounds ( 340 kg ) in weight . Once the tower was complete , it was topped off by an electric neon " flame " . Since the Christmas Candle design was cut to 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) , the top of the candle reached the base of a bugler statue at the top of the memorial . The flame consisted a cage @-@ like frame of curved steel bars covered with yellow neon lights . The flame was placed over the bugler , and a yellow cotton sack was placed atop the statue to further create the image of a flame , and so the bugler would not be visible atop the candle . Plastic wax drippings were designed to extend downward from the top of the candle beneath the flame . Construction of the Christmas Candle progressed slower than expected because Bean Inc. contractors had trouble attaching the base sections . The work was not finished until December 9 . The original Christmas Candle display cost $ 3 @,@ 390 @.@ 92 , all of which was offset by donations from about 271 donors amounting to $ 4 @,@ 055 @.@ 35 in total .
