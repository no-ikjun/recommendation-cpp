 Following 9 / 11 , Cheney was instrumental in providing a primary justification for a renewed war against Iraq . Cheney helped shape Bush 's approach to the " War on Terror " , making numerous public statements alleging Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction , and making several personal visits to CIA headquarters , where he questioned mid @-@ level agency analysts on their conclusions . Cheney continued to allege links between Saddam Hussein and al @-@ Qaeda , even though President Bush received a classified President 's Daily Brief on September 21 , 2001 indicating the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11 attacks and that " there was scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda " . Furthermore , in 2004 , the 9 / 11 Commission concluded that there was no " collaborative relationship " between Iraq and al Qaeda . 
 Following the US invasion of Iraq , Cheney remained steadfast in his support of the war , stating that it would be an " enormous success story " , and made many visits to the country . He often criticized war critics , calling them " opportunists " who were peddling " cynical and pernicious falsehoods " to gain political advantage while US soldiers died in Iraq . In response , Senator John Kerry asserted , " It is hard to name a government official with less credibility on Iraq [ than Cheney ] . " 
 In a March 24 , 2008 extended interview conducted in Ankara , Turkey with ABC News correspondent Martha <unk> on the fifth anniversary of the original U.S. military assault on Iraq , Cheney responded to a question about public opinion polls showing that Americans had lost confidence in the war by simply replying " So ? " video This remark prompted widespread criticism , including from former Oklahoma Republican Congressman Mickey Edwards , a long @-@ time personal friend of Cheney . 
 = = = Second term = = = 
 Bush and Cheney were re @-@ elected in the 2004 presidential election , running against John Kerry and his running mate , John Edwards . During the election , the pregnancy of his daughter Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney in light of the same @-@ sex marriage debate . Cheney has stated that he is in favor of gay marriages personally , but that each individual U.S. state should decide whether to permit it or not . 
 Cheney 's former chief legal counsel , David Addington , became his chief of staff and remained in that office until Cheney 's departure from office . John P. Hannah served as Cheney 's national security adviser . Until his indictment and resignation in 2005 , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Jr. served in both roles . 
 On the morning of July 21 , 2007 , Cheney once again served as acting president , from 7 : 16 am to 9 : 21 am . Bush transferred the power of the presidency prior to undergoing a medical procedure , requiring sedation , and later resumed his powers and duties that same day . 
 After his term began in 2001 , Cheney was occasionally asked if he was interested in the Republican nomination for the 2008 elections . However , he always maintained that he wished to retire upon the expiration of his term and he did not run in the 2008 presidential primaries . The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator John McCain . 
 = = = = Disclosure of documents = = = = 
 Cheney was a prominent member of the National Energy Policy Development Group ( <unk> ) , commonly known as the Energy task force , which comprised energy industry representatives , including several Enron executives . After the Enron scandal , the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties . In July 2003 , the Supreme Court ruled that the US Department of Commerce must disclose <unk> documents , containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq 's petroleum . 
 Beginning in 2003 , Cheney 's staff opted not to file required reports with the National Archives and Records Administration office charged with assuring that the executive branch protects classified information , nor did it allow inspection of its record keeping . Cheney refused to release the documents , citing his executive privilege to deny congressional information requests . Media outlets such as Time magazine and CBS News questioned whether Cheney had created a " fourth branch of government " that was not subject to any laws . A group of historians and open @-@ government advocates filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia , asking the court to declare that Cheney 's vice @-@ presidential records are covered by the Presidential Records Act of 1978 and cannot be destroyed , taken or withheld from the public without proper review .

 On October 18 , 2005 , The Washington Post reported that the vice president 's office was central to the investigation of the Valerie Plame CIA leak scandal , for Cheney 's former chief of staff , Lewis " Scooter " Libby , was one of the figures under investigation . 
 Following an indictment , Libby resigned his positions as Cheney 's chief of staff and assistant on national security affairs . 
 On September 8 , 2006 , Richard Armitage , former Deputy Secretary of State , publicly announced that he was the source of the revelation of Plame 's status . Armitage said he was not a part of a conspiracy to reveal Plame 's identity and did not know whether one existed . 
 In February 2006 , The National Journal reported that Libby had stated before a grand jury that his superiors , including Cheney , had authorized him to disclose classified information to the press regarding intelligence on Iraq 's weapons . 
 On March 6 , 2007 , Libby was convicted on four felony counts for obstruction of justice , perjury , and making false statements to federal investigators . In his closing arguments , independent prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said that there was " a cloud over the vice president " , an apparent reference to Cheney 's interview with FBI agents investigating the case , which was made public in 2009 . Cheney lobbied President George W. Bush vigorously and unsuccessfully to grant Libby a full Presidential pardon up to the day of Barack Obama 's inauguration , likening Libby to a " soldier on the battlefield " .

 On February 27 , 2007 , at about 10 am , a suicide bomber killed 23 people and wounded 20 more outside Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a visit by Cheney . The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that Cheney was its intended target . They also claimed that Osama Bin Laden supervised the operation . The bomb went off outside the front gate while Cheney was inside the base and half a mile away . He reported hearing the blast , saying " I heard a loud boom ... The Secret Service came in and told me there had been an attack on the main gate . " The purpose of Cheney 's visit to the region had been to press Pakistan for a united front against the Taliban . 
 = = = = Policy formulation = = = = 
 Cheney has been characterized as the most powerful and influential Vice President in history . Both supporters and critics of Cheney regard him as a shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and intricacies of the federal government . A sign of Cheney 's active policy @-@ making role was then @-@ House Speaker Dennis Hastert 's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney in addition to his office in the West Wing , his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building , and his Senate offices ( one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate ) . 
 Cheney has actively promoted an expansion of the powers of the presidency , saying that the Bush administration 's challenges to the laws which Congress passed after Vietnam and Watergate to contain and oversee the executive branch — the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the Presidential Records Act , the Freedom of Information Act and the War Powers Resolution — are , in Cheney 's words , " a restoration , if you will , of the power and authority of the president " . 
 In June 2007 , the Washington Post summarized Cheney 's vice presidency in a Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning four @-@ part series , based in part on interviews with former administration officials . The articles characterized Cheney not as a " shadow " president , but as someone who usually has the last words of counsel to the president on policies , which in many cases would reshape the powers of the presidency . When former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested to Cheney that the office was largely ceremonial , Cheney reportedly replied , " I have a different understanding with the president . " The articles described Cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government , indicated by the use of his own security classification and three man @-@ sized safes in his offices . 
 The articles described Cheney 's influence on decisions pertaining to detention of suspected terrorists and the legal limits that apply to their questioning , especially what constitutes torture . U.S. Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson , who served as Colin Powell 's chief of staff when he was both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the same time Cheney was Secretary of Defense , and then later when Powell was Secretary of State , stated in an in @-@ depth interview that Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld established an alternative program to interrogate post @-@ 9 / 11 detainees because of their mutual distrust of CIA . 
 The Washington Post articles , principally written by Barton Gellman , further characterized Cheney as having the strongest influence within the administration in shaping budget and tax policy in a manner that assures " conservative orthodoxy . " They also highlighted Cheney 's behind @-@ the @-@ scenes influence on the administration 's environmental policy to ease pollution controls for power plants , facilitate the disposal of nuclear waste , open access to federal timber resources , and avoid federal constraints on greenhouse gas emissions , among other issues . The articles characterized his approach to policy formulation as favoring business over the environment . 
 In June 2008 , Cheney allegedly attempted to block efforts by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to strike a controversial US compromise deal with North Korea over the communist state 's nuclear program . 
 In July 2008 , a former Environmental Protection Agency official stated publicly that Cheney 's office had pushed significantly for large @-@ scale deletions from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on the health effects of global warming " fearing the presentation by a leading health official might make it harder to avoid regulating greenhouse gases . " In October , when the report appeared with six pages cut from the testimony , The White House stated that the changes were made due to concerns regarding the accuracy of the science . However , according to the former senior adviser on climate change to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Stephen Johnson , Cheney 's office was directly responsible for nearly half of the original testimony being deleted . 
 In his role as President of the U.S. Senate , Cheney broke with the Bush Administration Department of Justice , and signed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in the case of Heller v. District of Columbia that successfully challenged gun laws in the nation 's capitol on Second Amendment grounds . 
 On February 14 , 2010 , in an appearance on ABC 's This Week , Cheney reiterated his support of waterboarding and for the torture of captured terrorist suspects , saying , " I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program . "

 The Washington Post reported in 2008 that Cheney purchased a home in McLean , Virginia ( Washington suburbs ) , which he was to tear down for a replacement structure . He also maintains homes in Wyoming and on Maryland 's Eastern Shore . 
 = = = Political activity = = = 
 In July 2012 , Cheney used his Wyoming home to host a private fund @-@ raiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , which netted over $ 4 million in contributions from attendees for Romney 's campaign . 
 Cheney is the subject of a documentary film " The World According to Dick Cheney " premiering March 15 , 2013 on the Showtime television channel . Cheney was also reported to be the subject of an HBO television mini @-@ series based on Barton Gellman 's 2008 book Angler and the 2006 documentary The Dark Side , produced by the Public Broadcasting Service . 
 Cheney maintained a visible public profile after leaving office , being especially critical of Obama administration policies on national security . In May 2009 , Cheney spoke of his support for same @-@ sex marriage , becoming one of the most prominent Republican politicians to do so . Speaking to the National Press Club , Cheney stated , " People ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish , any kind of arrangement they wish . I do believe , historically , the way marriage has been regulated is at a state level . It 's always been a state issue , and I think that 's the way it ought to be handled today . " In 2012 , Cheney reportedly encouraged several Maryland state legislators to vote to legalize same @-@ sex marriage in that state . 
 Although , by custom , a former vice president unofficially receives six months of protection from the United States Secret Service , President Obama reportedly extended the protection period for Cheney . 
 On July 11 , 2009 , CIA Director Leon Panetta told the Senate and House intelligence committees that the CIA withheld information about a secret counter @-@ terrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from Cheney . Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the CIA interrogation program and did not involve domestic intelligence activities . They have said the program was started by the counter @-@ terrorism center at the CIA shortly after the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , but never became fully operational , involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year . The Wall Street Journal reported , citing former intelligence officials familiar with the matter , that the program was an attempt to carry out a 2001 presidential authorization to capture or kill al Qaeda operatives . 
 Cheney has said that the Tea Party Movement is a " positive influence on the Republican Party " and that " I think it 's much better to have that kind of turmoil and change in the Republican Party than it would be to have it outside . " 
 = = = Views on President Obama = = = 
 Cheney has publicly criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election . On December 29 , 2009 , four days after the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from Netherlands to United States , Cheney criticized Obama : " [ We ] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren 't , it makes us less safe . [ ... ] Why doesn 't he want to admit we 're at war ? It doesn 't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office . It doesn 't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency — social transformation — the restructuring of American society . " In response , White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day , " [ I ] t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers . Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay , instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer . " 
 During a February 14 , 2010 appearance on ABC 's This Week , Cheney reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration 's policies for handling suspected terrorists , criticizing the " mindset " of treating " terror attacks against the United States as criminal acts as opposed to acts of war " . 
 In a May 2 , 2011 , interview with ABC News , Cheney praised the Obama administration for the operation that resulted in the killing of Osama bin Laden . 
 In 2014 while being a guest on Sean Hannity show he called Barack Obama a " weak President " amid the Ukrainian unrest .

 In August 2011 , Cheney published his memoir , In My Time : A Personal and Political Memoir , written with Liz Cheney . The book outlines Cheney 's recollections of 9 / 11 , the War on Terrorism , the 2001 War in Afghanistan , the run @-@ up to the 2003 Iraq war , so @-@ called " enhanced interrogation techniques " and other events . According to Barton Gellman , the author of Angler : The Cheney Vice Presidency , Cheney 's book differs from publicly available records on details surrounding the NSA surveillance program .

 In 2015 , Cheney published another book , Exceptional : Why the World Needs a Powerful America , again co @-@ authored with his daughter Liz . The book traces the history of U.S. foreign policy and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt 's administration through the Obama administration . The authors tell the story of what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II . Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism , the co @-@ authors criticize Barack Obama 's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's foreign policies , and offer what they see as the solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom . 
 = = Public perception = = 
 Cheney 's early public opinion polls were more favorable than unfavorable , reaching his peak approval rating in the wake of the September 11 attacks at 68 percent . However , polling numbers for both him and the president gradually declined in their second terms , with Cheney reaching his lowest point shortly before leaving office at 13 percent . Cheney 's Gallup poll figures are mostly consistent with those from other polls : 
 April 2001 – 63 % approval , 21 % disapproval 
 January 2002 – 68 % approval , 18 % disapproval 
 January 2004 – 56 % approval , 36 % disapproval 
 January 2005 – 50 % approval , 40 % disapproval 
 January 2006 – 41 % approval , 46 % disapproval 
 July 2007 – 30 % approval , 60 % disapproval 
 March 2009 – 30 % approval , 63 % disapproval 
 In April 2007 , Cheney was awarded an honorary doctorate of public service by Brigham Young University , where he delivered the commencement address . His selection as commencement speaker was controversial . The college board of trustees issued a statement explaining that the invitation should be viewed " as one extended to someone holding the high office of vice president of the United States rather than to a partisan political figure " . BYU permitted a protest to occur so long as it did not " make personal attacks against Cheney , attack ( the ) BYU administration , the church or the First Presidency " . 
 Cheney has been compared to Darth Vader , a characterization originated by his critics , but which was later adopted humorously by Cheney himself as well as by members of his family and staff . 
 As a result of Cheney having admitted that he ' signed off ' on the so @-@ called " enhanced interrogation techniques " program , some public officials , as well as several media outlets and advocacy groups , have called for his prosecution under various anti @-@ torture and war crimes statutes . 
 In former president George H. W. Bush 's book Destiny and Power : The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush , published in November 2015 , the 41st president , although also laudatory of Cheney , is in part critical of the former vice president , whom Bush describes as " having his own empire " and " very hard @-@ line .

 = = = Health problems = = = 
 Cheney 's long histories of cardiovascular disease and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions of whether he was medically fit to serve in public office . Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years , Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978 , at age 37 . Subsequent attacks in 1984 , 1988 , 2000 , and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle . He underwent four @-@ vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988 , coronary artery stenting in November 2000 , urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001 , and the implantation of an implantable <unk> @-@ defibrillator in June , 2001 . 
 On September 24 , 2005 , Cheney underwent a six @-@ hour endo @-@ vascular procedure to repair popliteal artery aneurysms bilaterally , a catheter treatment technique used in the artery behind each knee . The condition was discovered at a regular physical in July , and was not life @-@ threatening . Cheney was hospitalized for tests after experiencing shortness of breath five months later . In late April 2006 , an ultrasound revealed that the clot was smaller . 
 On March 5 , 2007 , Cheney was treated for deep @-@ vein thrombosis in his left leg at George Washington University Hospital after experiencing pain in his left calf . Doctors prescribed blood @-@ thinning medication and allowed him to return to work . CBS News reported that during the morning of November 26 , 2007 , Cheney was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and underwent treatment that afternoon . 
 On July 12 , 2008 , Cheney underwent a <unk> exam ; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67 @-@ year @-@ old man with a history of heart problems . As part of his annual checkup , he was administered an electrocardiogram and radiological imaging of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005 . Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia . On October 15 , 2008 , Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity . 
 On January 19 , 2009 , Cheney strained his back " while moving boxes into his new house " . As a consequence , he was in a wheelchair for two days , including his attendance at the 2009 United States presidential inauguration . 
 On February 22 , 2010 , Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after experiencing chest pains . A spokesperson later said Cheney had experienced a mild heart attack after doctors had run tests . On June 25 , 2010 , Cheney was admitted to George Washington University Hospital after reporting discomfort . 
 In early July 2010 , Cheney was outfitted with a left @-@ ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) at Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute to compensate for worsening congestive heart failure . The device pumped blood continuously through his body . He was released from Inova on August 9 , 2010 , and had to decide whether to seek a full heart transplant . This pump was centrifugal and as a result he remained alive without a pulse for nearly fifteen months . 
 On March 24 , 2012 , Cheney underwent a seven @-@ hour heart transplant procedure at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church , Virginia , at the age of 71 . He had been on a waiting list for more than 20 months before receiving the heart from an anonymous donor . Cheney 's principal cardiologist , Dr. Jonathan Reiner , advised his patient that " it would not be unreasonable for an otherwise healthy 71 @-@ year @-@ old man to expect to live another 10 years " with a transplant , saying in a family @-@ authorized interview that he considered Cheney to be otherwise healthy . 
 = = = Hunting incident = = = 
 On February 11 , 2006 , Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington , a 78 @-@ year @-@ old Texas attorney , while participating in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County , Texas . Secret Service agents and medical aides , who were traveling with Cheney , came to Whittington 's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek , neck , and chest . An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital . On February 14 , 2006 , Whittington had a non @-@ fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead @-@ shot pellet lodged in or near his heart . Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets , doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them . 
 The Secret Service stated that they notified the Sheriff about one hour after the shooting . Kenedy County Sheriff Ramone Salinas III stated that he first heard of the shooting at about 5 : 30 PM . The next day , ranch owner Katharine Armstrong informed the Corpus Christi Caller @-@ Times of the shooting . Cheney had a televised interview with MSNBC News about the shooting on February 15 . Both Cheney and Whittington have called the incident an accident . Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor . Whittington has since told the Washington Post that he and Cheney were not close friends but acquaintances . When asked if Cheney had apologized , Whittington declined to answer . 
 The sheriff 's office released a report on the shooting on February 16 , 2006 and witness statements on February 22 , indicating that the shooting occurred on a clear sunny day , and Whittington was shot from 30 or 40 yards ( 40 m ) away while searching for a downed bird . Armstrong , the ranch owner , claimed that all in the hunting party were wearing blaze @-@ orange safety gear and none had been drinking . However , Cheney has acknowledged that he had one beer four or five hours prior to the shooting . Although Kenedy County Sheriff 's Office documents support the official story by Cheney and his party , re @-@ creations of the incident produced by George <unk> and John Metz of the Corpus Christi Caller @-@ Times indicated that the actual shooting distance was closer than the 30 yards claimed . 
 The incident hurt Cheney 's popularity standing in the polls . According to polls on February 27 , 2006 , two weeks after the accident , Dick Cheney 's approval rating had dropped 5 percentage points to 18 % . The incident became the subject of a number of jokes and satire .

 Basehead , also known as dc Basehead and Basehead 2 @.@ 0 , is an American alternative hip hop group formed by Michael Ivey in 1992 . Ivey serves as the group 's songwriter and leader , performing vocals and various instruments . Basehead 's 1992 debut album , Play with Toys , was recorded at Ivey 's home with various studio musicians . Ivey formed a touring band for live performances , which contributed to Basehead 's second album , Not in Kansas Anymore . The group 's current lineup consists of Ivey , drummer Aaron Burroughs and bassist Brendan <unk> . 
 Basehead has received praise for its distinctive sound and lyrics . The group 's music incorporates elements of various genres , including blues , funk , hip hop and rock . The lyrics of Play with Toys and Not in Kansas Anymore focus on subjects such as alcohol and cannabis use , depression , philosophy , politics and relationships . Beginning with the 1996 release of Faith , the group 's lyrics have focused primarily on Christian themes , which carried over to its albums In the Name of Jesus , dc Basehead and Rockalyptic Music . 
 = = History = = 
 Basehead released its debut album , Play with Toys in 1992 on the small independent label <unk> . Vocalist Michael Ivey recorded much of the album at his home on a four @-@ track with various friends . The album received favorable reviews and frequent airplay on college radio . Rolling Stone reviewer Kevin Powell wrote that " Without being preachy , Basehead 's unconventional style challenges listeners to get beyond their basic instincts and open their minds , search their souls . " Assembling a five @-@ member touring band , Ivey toured the United States and Europe , opening for the Beastie Boys , Stone Temple Pilots , and Ween . After College Music Journal featured Basehead on its cover , the group received attention from major labels , and signed with Imago Records , a former subsidiary of BMG the following year , releasing its second studio album , Not in Kansas Anymore . Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith called the album " an alternative to the benign bullshit music that floods the chain stores and commercial radio waves . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that " Although it retains many of the same qualities of their critically acclaimed debut [ ... ] there 's nothing that has the same sense of discovery that made Play with Toys an interesting record . " 
 In April 1994 , Basehead recorded its third studio album , Faith , which retained the musical elements of previous albums , but featured lyrics focusing on religious themes . During this period , Ivey also formed a side project , Bastard Youth of Basehead , also known as <unk> , and founded <unk> , an imprint of Rykodisc Records focusing on alternative music aimed at and produced by African American musicians . In December 1994 , Imago separated from BMG , and Faith was not released until two years later . The album 's release problems resulted in the cancellation of a planned tour between Basehead and <unk> Although some band members felt that they had not been given proper financial compensation for their work , Ivey stated that he took a smaller percentage of the songwriting credits than he was legally entitled to , and that the group 's underpaid work would have " laid the groundwork " for future success if Faith did not have release problems . 
 In 1998 , Basehead released its fourth studio album , In the Name of Jesus on the label Union of Vineyard Workers . In 2002 the group changed its name to dc Basehead , releasing their self @-@ titled fifth album on November 19 . Hamlin wrote that " the mastermind 's [ ... ] effective use of subtly shifting patterns inside a repeating framework , and his talented co @-@ conspirators lift DC into distinction . " Reforming as Basehead 2 @.@ 0 , the group released its sixth studio album , Rockalyptic Music in 2007 . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Basehead 's musical style , which fuses elements of blues , funk , hip hop , pop , psychedelic , reggae , rock and rhythm and blues , is often regarded as alternative hip hop and alternative rock . David Jeffries from Allmusic described Play with Toys as " slacker rap " . According to Michael Ivey , " There are hip @-@ hop elements in there , but if a hardcore hip @-@ hop fan bought it , they might be disappointed " . Ivey also stated that Basehead 's music " doesn 't have the expected samples and sounds . " The lyrical themes of Play with Toys and Not in Kansas Anymore focus on diverse subjects , including alcohol and marijuana use , depression , philosophy , politics , racism , and relationship breakups . Francis Davis wrote that Ivey 's lyrics " [ subvert ] both rock and gangsta @-@ rap conventions . " Basehead 's albums and performances feature live instrumentation , which differentiates the group 's sound from that of mainstream hip hop artists who rely solely on sampled instrumentation . On the group 's albums , vocals and instruments are altered with studio techniques for effect . Ivey 's vocals mix singing and rapping . According to Ivey , Basehead 's former DJ , Citizen Cope , " doesn 't play music . He makes sounds — [ he 's ] an instrument in his own self . He might scratch certain words for a special effect . " 
 In 1994 , the group 's lyrics shifted to Christian themes , starting with the album Faith . Andrew Hamlin describes the lyrics of Faith as having " caught Ivey mid @-@ capitulation . He wanted Jesus in his life but he also wanted his beer , his pot , his television , and his lust . " During the release of Faith , Ivey stated that Basehead 's fourth studio album , In the Name of Jesus , would feature even more Christian @-@ oriented lyrics than Faith . Regarding the lyrics of In the Name of Jesus , Hamlin writes that " chanting praises leaves the Basehead mastermind without his characteristic wit , and he lacks the energetic exhortations that often lift gospel performers above sameness in material . " Regarding dc Basehead , Hamlin wrote that the album 's lyrics were " miles in some direction or other from any stereotyped Christian rock bin . " 
 During a performance in which the group received a request for early material , Ivey stated " I 'm still trying to work it out — how to follow God and still give you the old shit " and introduced the group 's Christian songs with self @-@ deprecation , referring to the songs as " the new , reborn , love @-@ God Basehead stuff . " In a 1998 interview , Ivey stated " I 'm kind of wary of the Church . I know there 's this whole Christian music market , but I don 't think , theology @-@ wise , I 'm in agreement with a whole lot of Christians . [ ... ] In fact , I don 't know whether I like even being called a Christian . "

 Stephen Robert Sutton , MBE ( 16 December 1994 – 14 May 2014 ) , was an English blogger and charity activist known for his blog Stephen 's Story and his fundraising efforts for the Teenage Cancer Trust charity for the aid of teenagers with cancer . By the second anniversary of his death , £ 5 @.@ 5 million had been raised in his memory . 
 Born in Burntwood , Staffordshire , Sutton performed well at school , but withdrew his applications to university in 2012 after his terminal prognosis for colorectal cancer . His father had fought the disease twice , and both were predisposed to it through Lynch syndrome . Sutton had struggled to get a diagnosis as doctors did not believe that colorectal cancer could occur in a teenager . 
 Sutton made a " bucket list " of things to do in his final months , successfully achieving many of them including becoming a Guinness World Records holder . He began fundraising for the Teenage Cancer Trust , receiving support from celebrities and politicians . In 2013 , he met filmmaker <unk> Richters , who recorded him for a documentary . Sutton died in hospital , at age 19 . A memorial service to him at Lichfield Cathedral was attended by over 10 @,@ 000 mourners . After his death , Sutton was posthumously recognised for his activism with awards including an MBE and an honorary doctorate from Coventry University .

 Sutton was born on 16 December 1994 , and attended primary and secondary school in his home town of Burntwood , Staffordshire . During his youth , Sutton was a very active child , participating in sports and athletics , particularly long @-@ distance running and football ; he was at one point a trialist at Walsall F.C. , and set a record in under @-@ 15 400 m at his school . 
 Sutton received straight A grades from Chase Terrace Technology College in August 2012 , and had interviews at Cambridge University to study medicine , as well as universities in Leicester and Leeds . He later withdrew his applications before getting a verdict , after his cancer was determined to be incurable . 
 Sutton , like his father Andy , had Lynch syndrome , a genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer . The elder Sutton had surgery to remove part of his intestine after a cancer diagnosis in 1989 . Twenty years later , he had another tumour removed , and a second course of chemotherapy , receiving an all @-@ clear only months before Stephen was first diagnosed . Doctors initially diagnosed Stephen with constipation and prescribed laxatives , despite Andy 's insistence that there was a risk of colorectal cancer in the family ; he was repeatedly told that teenagers were too young to have the illness . In his final interview , published in the Daily Mail on 11 May 2014 , Sutton confessed that he had a degree of " anger " towards the amount of time taken for his cancer diagnosis , but would not lament it . 
 = = Illness and activism = = 
 Sutton was diagnosed with stage 3B colorectal cancer at the age of 15 , and subsequently went through aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments . He was declared cancer @-@ free , but a tumour returned behind his knee , which was treated by further chemotherapy . Doctors considered an amputation of Sutton 's left leg , but the tumour had already spread to other parts of his lower body . In December 2012 , two years after the initial diagnosis , the cancer was deemed incurable after spreading to the lungs and liver . Sutton did not ask how long he was expected to survive , choosing to measure his life in the difference he could make , rather than in time . On 24 January 2014 , in a speech at London 's O2 Arena , he called his first diagnosis " a good thing . It was a huge kick up the backside , it taught me to take nothing for granted , and gave me a lot of motivation for life " . 
 After his diagnosis , Sutton began participating in charity events with the Teenage Cancer Trust , and later started his own website and blog in January 2013 . At the same time , he began fundraising for the trust , with an initial goal of £ 10 @,@ 000 . Following unexpected support , the goal was raised to £ 100 @,@ 000 and £ 500 @,@ 000 the same year , before being raised to £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in March 2014 and went over the £ 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 mark by the end of May 2014 . During his fundraising campaign , Sutton was supported by several celebrities , most notably Jimmy Carr , Jonathan Ross and Jason Manford . Manford donated £ 10 @,@ 000 and gave all the turnover from his own comedy clubs for the entire month of May to the charity . Following Sutton 's hospitalisation in April 2014 , Manford became the unofficial spokesperson for the charity , appearing in interviews promoting the cause . He also launched the campaign " # <unk> " , asking people to share selfies of themselves promoting the campaign . 
 Sutton 's goal of £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 was reached on 23 April 2014 , and on 2 May , he was discharged from the hospital following an improvement in his condition . Later that same day he also met with prime minister David Cameron , who voiced his support for the campaign . On 4 May , Sutton helped break the Guinness World Record for ' The most number of people making heart @-@ shaped hand gestures ' , with 554 people at Chase Terrace Technology College . 
 In September 2014 , £ 2 @.@ 9 million of the £ 4 @.@ 96 million raised was invested in specialist cancer units for young people at seven British hospitals . A further £ 1 @.@ 2 million was put towards 50 care scholarships at Coventry University , and £ 700 @,@ 000 invested in improving cancer awareness information and helping patients attend the charity 's annual weekend conference . On 14 May 2016 , the second anniversary of Sutton 's death , £ 5 @.@ 5 million had been raised . 
 Skydiving and entering the Guinness Book of Records were two goals which Sutton achieved before his death . On 10 July 2015 at <unk> Airfield in Lincolnshire , 402 people made 403 tandem jumps of at least 10 @,@ 000 feet in 24 hours for the Teenage Cancer Trust in his honour , breaking the previous record of 286 . His mother , an official ambassador for the trust , also ran a marathon and plans to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in her son 's memory . 
 = = Documentary = = 
 In April 2013 , Sutton met Kevin Spacey 's filmmaker @-@ in @-@ residence <unk> Richters while rehearsing as part of the drummer group for the opening ceremony of the 2013 UEFA Champions League final at Wembley Stadium . They quickly became friends . Richters and his team began following him around for several months , filming Sutton at home with his family and at several fundraisers . In the summer of 2013 Sutton went on holiday to Ibiza ( his last travel ) with his close friends . Richters equipped him with several <unk> cameras . The documentary is in development , as of 2016 , and will be made into a feature @-@ length film . 
 Richters said : 
 " Two days before Stephen passed we talked about his legacy . He wanted to make sure that we remember him as the positive person he was and not as a cancer sufferer " . 
 Besides making the documentary for Sutton , Richters and his team were tasked to rebrand his Facebook page and have been managing most of his media and backend . 
 The opening ceremony , titled " The Battle of Kings " was directed by Spacey 's executive Assistant and Prince 's Trust ambassador Hamish Jenkinson and his business partner Jonny Grant who had previously directed the opening ceremony at the same venue for the 2011 final . It was produced by Films United and directed and produced by Richters and his producing partner Alex <unk> . Both were the former filmmakers @-@ in @-@ residence of Spacey and Jenkinson at The Old Vic Theatre in London . The film focused around the story of Sutton who was part of the group of performers . 
 Ceremonies Manager Julien <unk> spoke about Sutton after his death : 
 " I met with Stephen a year ago at Wembley , I couldn 't believe how committed he was to following his dream – being part of the 400 drummers we had last year for the opening ceremony . I remember on the eve of the ceremony , his knee was hurting him so bad that he couldn 't walk without crutches . He was watching the dress rehearsal from the stands with a constant smile on his face and told me : ' Don 't worry Julien , tomorrow I 'll be there whatever it takes ! ' Indeed , he took a double dose of painkillers and performed with all his passion for our ceremony . Stephen inspired me . I 'm so proud to have met you and to have been even just a small part of your story " . 
 = = Death and reaction = = 
 Following a lung collapse on 22 April 2014 , Sutton was put on life @-@ support but in a stable condition . He died of colorectal cancer in his sleep at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham in the early hours of 14 May 2014 , at age 19 . His death was announced on his Facebook page by his mother . His elder brother Chris wrote on Twitter that 
 " I could sit here all day typing words like inspirational , proud , but frankly his life and what he achieved speaks for itself , it doesn 't need a rambling eulogy from me . He 'll still always be a bit of tw * t to me , hey he was my younger brother , it ’ s in the contract , but I was blessed to grow up with the best little tw * t you could have " . 
 By the time of his death , he had raised over £ 3 @.@ 2 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust . David Cameron praised Sutton for his " spirit and bravery " while Opposition Leader Ed Miliband said Sutton was an " inspiration " . Manford said : 
 " Stephen Sutton was the most inspiring person I 've ever met and touched more lives than he will ever know . He was an incredibly positive young man and a credit to his family , to Burntwood and to humanity itself . The reason we took to him so passionately was because he was better than us , he did something that none of us could even imagine doing . In his darkest hour he selflessly dedicated his final moments to raising millions of pounds for teenagers with cancer . Some of Stephen 's words will stay with me and others forever and they are words to live by – ' life isn 't measured in time , it 's measured in achievements ' " . 
 On 21 May , Lichfield Cathedral announced that they would hold a public vigil for Sutton on 29 May , before a private family funeral the following day . In accordance with Sutton 's wishes , those in attendance were told to wear bright colours and have fun ; yellow , the colour of the summer , was advised . Around 11 @,@ 000 people attended his vigil , with the Cathedral 's Dean telling the BBC that the degree of public grief was akin to that of the death of Princess Diana . He was buried the next day .

 Sutton was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) in the 2014 Birthday Honours " for services to Teenage Cancer Trust Charity " ; the award was dated 14 May . His mother , Jane , said that " though Stephen continually told all of us that he didn 't do charity work for recognition , even he acknowledged that to be appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire was awesome " . Jane received the MBE from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in November 2014 . 
 On 7 October 2014 , Sutton was recognised at the Pride of Britain Awards with the award for " Special Recognition " . It was presented to his family by Jason Manford and Roger Daltrey . 
 On the 11 November 2014 Coventry University announced that it would posthumously award an Honorary Doctorate of Science , in recognition of his outstanding contribution to highlighting the unique needs of teenagers and young adults with cancer . His mother collected it on his behalf later that month . 
 Burntwood 's Christmas tree for 2014 was dedicated to Sutton , and decorated with the yellow ribbons . In September 2015 , Virgin Trains renamed Pendolino 390 002 in his honour . In June 2014 , an elephant at the West Midlands Safari Park was named Sutton by public vote ; he had previously met the animal 's mother as part of a wish to hug an animal larger than himself .

 The Neon Brotherhood recorded a single titled " Hope Ain 't a Bad Thing " as a fundraiser for Teenage Cancer Trust in memory of Sutton . Jane Sutton announced the release of the single on 2 June and within 24 hours the song reached No. 2 on UK iTunes Charts . It peaked in the Official UK charts at No. 16 . 
 After working with Sutton , local community organisation Gig Caritas announced that they would hold a concert in memory of him in Dudley , featuring West End stars Kieran Brown , Sabrina <unk> and Katie Bernstein accompanied by a professional orchestra and choir made up of members from In Sound Company and Brierley Hill Musical Theatre Company . 
 From 2014 , the Download Festival has paid tribute to Sutton , and its main stage has been named after him . He attended the festival in 2013 as part of his " bucket list " . 
 = Washington State Route 513 = 
 State Route 513 ( SR 513 ) is a 3 @.@ 35 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 5 @.@ 39 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Washington , located entirely within the city of Seattle in King County . The highway travels north as Montlake Boulevard from an interchange with SR 520 and over the Montlake Bridge to the University of Washington campus in the University District . SR 513 continues past University Village before it turns northeast onto Sand Point Way and ends at the entrance to Magnuson Park in the Sand Point neighborhood . 
 SR 513 was created during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to Secondary State Highway 1J ( SSH 1J ) , itself created in 1937 and traveling from Downtown Seattle to Lake City . Sections of SSH 1J , including Madison Street from Downtown to Capitol Hill , date as far back as 1854 . Most sections of the highway were built in the 1890s and 1900s in preparation for the Alaska – Yukon – Pacific Exposition , which took place on the University of Washington campus in 1909 . SR 513 was shortened in 1971 to its present southern terminus , the interchange with SR 520 in Montlake , and to an interchange with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) on the Seattle – Shoreline city border . In 1991 , the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus at Magnuson Park , eliminating its route through Lake City and much of North Seattle . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 513 begins at the intersection of Montlake Boulevard and Lake Washington Boulevard in the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle , part of a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 520 . The highway travels north on Montlake Boulevard and crosses the Montlake Cut section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal on the 320 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 98 m ) Montlake Bridge . The bascule drawbridge is designated as a city landmark and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982 . SR 513 continues north through the University of Washington campus within the University District and passes Husky Stadium and the Hec <unk> Pavilion before it becomes parallel to the Burke @-@ Gilman Trail . The highway turns east onto 45th Street and Sand Point Way at the University Village shopping mall and enters the Sand Point neighborhood near Seattle Children 's Hospital . SR 513 continues northeast along the Burke @-@ Gilman Trail past the Seattle branch of the National Archives before the highway ends at an intersection with 65th Street west of Magnuson Park . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 513 was within the University of Washington campus , serving 41 @,@ 000 vehicles , while the least busiest section was its northern terminus at Magnuson Park , serving 14 @,@ 000 vehicles . The entire route of SR 513 is part of the National Highway System , identifying it as important to the national economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 SSH 1J , the predecessor to SR 513 , was added to the state highway system in 1937 and traveled 13 @.@ 40 miles ( 21 @.@ 57 km ) within the city of Seattle on streets that have existed since the 19th century . Madison Street , which carries SSH 1J from its southern terminus at U.S. Route 99 in Downtown to Capitol Hill was built in 1864 by local judge John J. <unk> to connect his homestead at Madison Park to downtown . Other streets carrying SSH 1J , including 23rd and 24th Avenues towards Montlake , Montlake Boulevard through the University District , and Sand Point Way towards Sand Point were built during the early 1890s as the city of Seattle expanded . The rest of SSH 1J , traveling northwest from Naval Station Puget Sound at Sand Point through Lake City to US 99 on the border between Seattle and Shoreline via Roosevelt Way and 145th Street was constructed by the late 1900s to serve the University of Washington campus , site of the Alaska – Yukon – Pacific Exposition in 1909 . 
 SSH 1J was replaced by SR 513 during the 1964 state highway renumbering and codified in 1970 on its original route , connecting Downtown Seattle to Montlake and Lake City . In 1971 , SR 513 was shortened to 9 @.@ 22 miles ( 14 @.@ 84 km ) by moving its southern terminus to an interchange with SR 520 in Montlake and its northern terminus to an interchange with I @-@ 5 at 145th Street . The highway was further shortened , to its present length of 3 @.@ 35 miles ( 5 @.@ 39 km ) , in 1991 by moving its northern terminus from I @-@ 5 to Magnuson Park at the site of the former Naval Station Puget Sound .

 Alexander <unk> Lukashenko ( Belarusian : <unk> ́ ндр <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , Russian : Алекса ́ ндр <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> ; born 30 August 1954 ) is the President of Belarus , in office since 20 July 1994 . Before his career as a politician , Lukashenko worked as director of a state @-@ owned agricultural farm and spent time with the Soviet Border Troops and the Soviet Army . He was the only deputy to vote against the independence of Belarus from the Soviet Union . 
 Lukashenko opposed Western @-@ backed " shock therapy " during the post @-@ Soviet transition . He has retained Soviet @-@ era policies , such as continued state ownership of key industries , despite objections from Western governments . Observers also contend that Lukashenko presides over a regime steeped in Soviet nostalgia . Belarus has been labeled " Europe 's last dictatorship " by some Western journalists , on account of Lukashenko 's self @-@ described authoritarian style of government . Lukashenko and other Belarusian officials are also the subject of sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States for alleged human rights violations off and on since 2006 . 
 = = Early life and career ( 1954 – 94 ) = = 
 Lukashenko was born on 30 August 1954 , in the settlement of <unk> in the Vitebsk <unk> of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic . His grandfather , <unk> Lukashenko , had been born in the <unk> Oblast of Ukraine near <unk> ( today village of <unk> ) . Lukashenko grew up without a father in his childhood , leading him to be taunted by his schoolmates for having an unmarried mother . 
 Lukashenko graduated from the Mogilev Pedagogical Institute ( now Mogilev State A. <unk> University ) in 1975 and the Belarusian Agricultural Academy in 1985 . He served in the Border Guard ( frontier troops ) from 1975 to 1977 and in the Soviet Army from 1980 to 1982 . In addition , he led an All @-@ Union Leninist Young Communist League ( Komsomol ) chapter in Mogilev from 1977 to 1978 . While in the Soviet Army , Lukashenko was an officer of the 120th Guards Motor Rifle Division , which was based in Minsk . After leaving the military , he became the deputy chairman of a collective farm in 1982 and in 1985 . He was promoted to the post of director of the <unk> state farm and construction materials plant in the Shklov district . 
 In 1990 , Lukashenko was elected Deputy to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus . He was the only deputy of the Belarusian parliament who voted against ratification of the December 1991 agreement that dissolved the Soviet Union and set up the Commonwealth of Independent States . Having acquired a reputation as an eloquent opponent of corruption , Lukashenko was elected in 1993 to serve as the chairman of the anti @-@ corruption committee of the Belarusian parliament . In late 1993 he accused 70 senior government officials , including the Supreme Soviet chairman Stanislav Shushkevich and prime minister Vyacheslav Kebich , of corruption including stealing state funds for personal purposes . While the charges were never fully proven against him , Shushkevich resigned his chairmanship due to the embarrassment of the series of events and losing a vote of no @-@ confidence . 
 A new Belarusian constitution enacted in early 1994 paved the way for the <unk> to date , <unk> presidential election on 23 June and 10 July . Six candidates stood in the first round , including Lukashenko , who campaigned as an independent on a populist platform of " defeat the mafia against the Conspiracy of New World Order and Zionism " . Shushkevich and Kebich also ran , with the latter regarded as the clear favorite . Lukashenko won 45 @.@ 1 % of the vote while Kebich received 17 @.@ 4 % , <unk> <unk> received 12 @.@ 9 % and Shushkevich , along with two other candidates , received less than 10 % of votes . Lukashenko won the second round of the election on 10 July with 80 @.@ 1 % of the vote . Shortly after his election , he addressed the State Duma of the Russian Federation in Moscow proposing a new Union of Slavic states , which would culminate in the creation of the Union State in 1999 .

 In May 1995 , Belarus held a referendum on changing its national symbols ; the referendum also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian , and forged closer economic ties to Russia . Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband the Supreme Soviet by decree . In the summer of 1996 , deputies of the 199 @-@ member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution . Shortly after that , a referendum was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered by a group of Parliament members . The questions ranged from social issues ( changing independence day to 3 July , abolition of the death penalty ) to the national constitution . As a result of the referendum , the constitution that was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by the Supreme Soviet was voided . The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko 's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship . His decrees now had the force of law , and he also acquired near @-@ total control over government spending . On 25 November , it was announced that 70 @.@ 5 % of voters , of an 84 % turnout , had approved the amended constitution . The US and the EU , however , refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum . 
 After the referendum , Lukashenko convened a new parliamentary assembly from those members of the parliament who were loyal to him . After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition , only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko . Nevertheless , international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given the way it was formed . At the start of 1998 , the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble , which led to a collapse in the value of the currency . Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus , sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency . 
 Lukashenko blamed foreign governments for conspiring against him and , in April 1998 , expelled ambassadors from the <unk> complex near Minsk and moved them to another building . The <unk> conflict caused an international outcry and resulted in a travel ban on Lukashenko from the EU and the US . Although the ambassadors eventually returned after the controversy died down , Lukashenko stepped up his rhetorical attacks against the West . He stated that Western governments were trying to undermine Belarus at all levels , even sports , during the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano , Japan . 
 Upon the outbreak of the Kosovo War in 1999 , Lukashenko suggested to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević that Yugoslavia join the Union of Russia and Belarus .

 Belarus held another presidential election on 9 September 2001 . Under the original constitution , this election should have been held in 1999 , but the 1996 referendum extended Lukashenko 's term for an additional two years . Lukashenko faced Vladimir <unk> and Sergei <unk> in the election . During the campaign , Lukashenko promised to raise the standards of farming , social benefits and increase industrial output of Belarus . Lukashenko won in the first round with 75 @.@ 65 % of the vote . The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) said the process " failed to meet international standards " . Jane 's Intelligence Digest surmised that the price of Russian support for Lukashenko ahead of the 2001 presidential elections was the surrender of Minsk 's control over its section of the Yamal @-@ Europe gas pipeline . After the results were announced declaring Lukashenko the winner , Russia publicly welcomed Lukashenko 's re @-@ election ; the Russian President , Vladimir Putin , telephoned Lukashenko and offered a message of congratulations and support . 
 Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq , American intelligence agencies reported that aides of Saddam Hussein managed to acquire Belarusian passports while in Syria , but that it was unlikely that Belarus would offer a safe haven for Saddam and his two sons . This action , along with arms deals with Iraq and Iran , prompted Western governments to take a tougher stance against Lukashenko . The US was particularly angered by the arms sales , and American political leaders increasingly began to refer to Belarus as " Europe 's last dictatorship " . The EU was concerned for the security of its gas supplies from Russia , which are piped through Belarus , and took an active interest in Belarusian affairs . With the accession of Poland , Latvia and Lithuania , the EU 's border with Belarus has grown to more than 1000 kilometers . 
 During a televised address to the nation on 7 September 2004 , Lukashenko announced plans for a referendum to eliminate presidential term limits . This was held on 17 October 2004 , the same day as parliamentary elections , and , according to official results , was approved by 79 @.@ 42 % of voters . Previously , Lukashenko had been limited to two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required to step down after the presidential elections in 2006 . Opposition groups , the OSCE , the European Union , and the US State Department stated that the vote fell short of international standards . An example of the failure , cited by the OSCE , was the pre @-@ marking of ballots . Belarus grew economically under Lukashenko , but much of this growth was due to Russian crude oil which was imported at below @-@ market prices , refined , and sold to other European countries at a profit . 
 = = = 2006 presidential election = = = 
 After Lukashenko confirmed he was running for re @-@ election in 2005 , opposition groups began to seek a single candidate . On 16 October 2005 , on the Day of Solidarity With Belarus , the political groups <unk> and Third Way Belarus encouraged all opposition parties to rally behind one candidate to oppose Lukashenko in the 2006 election . Their chosen candidate was Alexander Milinkevich . Lukashenko reacted by saying that anyone going to opposition protests would have their necks wrung " as one might a duck " . On 19 March 2006 , exit polls showed Lukashenko winning a third term in a landslide , amid opposition reports of vote @-@ rigging and fear of violence . The <unk> organisation gave Lukashenko 84 @.@ 2 % of the vote and Milinkevich just 2 % , while the Belarusian Republican Youth Union gave Lukashenko 84 @.@ 2 % and Milinkevich 3 @.@ 1 % . The Gallup Organisation noted that <unk> and the Belarusian Republican Youth Union are government @-@ controlled and both released their exit poll results before noon on election day even though voting stations did not close until 8 pm . 
 Belarusian authorities vowed to prevent any large @-@ scale demonstrations following the election ( such as those that marked the Orange Revolution in Ukraine ) . Despite their efforts , the opposition had the largest number of demonstrators in years , with nightly protests in Minsk continuing for a number days after the election . The largest protest occurred on election night ; reporters for the Associated Press estimated that approximately 10 @,@ 000 people turned out . Election observers from the Russia @-@ led Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) differed on the Belarusian election . The OSCE declared on 20 March 2006 that the " presidential election failed to meet OSCE commitments for democratic elections . " Lukashenko " permitted State authority to be used in a manner which did not allow citizens to freely and fairly express their will at the ballot box ... a pattern of intimidation and the suppression of independent voices ... was evident throughout the campaign . " The heads of all 25 EU countries declared that the election was " fundamentally flawed " . In contrast , the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs declared , " Long before the elections , the OSCE 's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights had declared that they [ the elections ] would be illegitimate and it was pretty biased in its commentaries on their progress and results , thus playing an instigating role . " Lukashenko later stated that he had rigged the election results , but against himself , in order to obtain a majority more typical of European countries . Although he had won 93 @.@ 5 % of the vote , he said , he had directed the government to announce a result of 86 % . 
 Some Russian nationalists , such as Dmitry Rogozin and the Movement Against Illegal Immigration , stated that they would like to see Lukashenko become President of Russia in 2008 . Lukashenko responded that he would not run for the Russian presidency , but that if his health was still good , he might run for reelection in 2011 .

 In September 2008 , parliamentary elections were held . Lukashenko had allowed some opposition candidates to stand , though in the official results , opposition members failed to get a seat out of the available 110 . OSCE observers described the vote as " flawed " , including " several cases of deliberate falsification of results " . Opposition members and supporters demonstrated in protest . According to the Nizhny Novgorod @-@ based CIS election observation mission , the findings of which are often dismissed by the West , the elections in Belarus conformed to international standards . Lukashenko later commented that the opposition in Belarus was financed by foreign countries and was not needed . 
 In April 2009 , he held talks with Pope Benedict XVI in the Vatican , Lukashenko 's first visit to Western Europe after a travel ban on him a decade earlier . 
 = = = 2010 presidential election = = = 
 Lukashenko was one of ten candidates registered for the presidential election held in Belarus on 19 December 2010 . Though originally envisaged for 2011 , an earlier date was approved " to ensure the maximum participation of citizens in the electoral campaign and to set most convenient time for the voters " . The run @-@ up to the campaign was marked by a series of Russian media attacks on Lukashenko . The Central Election Committee said that all nine opposition figures were likely to get less than half the vote total that Lukashenko would get . Though opposition figures alleged intimidation and that " dirty tricks " were being played , the election was seen as comparatively open as a result of desire to improve relations with both Europe and the US . 
 On election day , two presidential candidates were seriously beaten by police in different opposition rallies . On the night of the election , opposition protesters chanting " Out ! , " " Long live Belarus ! " and other similar slogans attempted to storm the building of the government of Belarus , smashing windows and doors before riot police were able to push them back . The number of protesters was reported by major news media as being around or above 10 @,@ 000 people . At least seven of the opposition presidential candidates were arrested . 
 Several of the opposition candidates , along with their supporters and members of the media , were arrested . Many were sent to prison , often on charges of organizing a mass disturbance . Examples include Andrei Sannikov , Alexander <unk> , Ales <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Uladzimir <unk> . Sannikov 's wife , journalist Irina <unk> , was put under house arrest . <unk> <unk> 's party leader , Anatoly <unk> , was also arrested . 
 The CEC said that Lukashenko won 79 @.@ 65 % of the vote ( he gained 5 @,@ 130 @,@ 557 votes ) with 90 @.@ 65 % of the electorate voting . The OSCE categorized the elections as " flawed " while the CIS mission observers praised them as " free and transparent " . However , the OSCE also stated that some improvements were made in the run @-@ up to the election , including the candidates ' use of television debates and ability to deliver their messages unhindered . Several European foreign ministers issued a joint statement calling the election and its aftermath an " unfortunate step backwards in the development of democratic governance and respect for human rights in Belarus . " 
 Lukashenko 's inauguration ceremony of 22 January 2011 was boycotted by EU ambassadors , and only thirty @-@ two foreign diplomats attended . During this ceremony , Lukashenko defended the legitimacy of his re @-@ election and vowed that Belarus would never have its own version of the Orange Revolution or Georgia 's 2003 Rose Revolution . Effective 31 January 2011 , the EU renewed a travel ban , prohibiting Lukashenko and 156 of his associates from traveling to EU member countries , as a result of the crackdown on opposition supporters .

 Lukashenko promotes himself as a " man of the people . " Due to his style of rule , he is often informally referred to as <unk> ( bats 'ka , " daddy " ) . He was elected chairman of the Belarusian Olympic Committee in 1997 . Lukashenko wanted to rebuild Belarus when he took office ; the economy was in freefall , due to declining industry and lack of demand for Belarusian goods . Lukashenko kept many industries under the control of the government , and privatization was slowed . In 2001 , he stated his intention to improve the social welfare of his citizens and to make Belarus " powerful and prosperous . " 
 The economy of Belarus has been in a state of flux since Lukashenko 's election in 1994 . His economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other former Soviet states , such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment . The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0 @.@ 6 % of the population ( of 6 @.@ 86 million eligible workers ) , a decrease from 1995 , when unemployment was 2 @.@ 9 % with a working @-@ eligible population of 5 @.@ 24 million . The per @-@ capita Gross national income rose from US $ 1 @,@ 423 in 1993 to US $ 5 @,@ 830 at the end of 2011 . One major economic issue Lukashenko faced throughout his presidency was the value of the Belarusian ruble . For a time it was pegged to major foreign currencies , such as the euro , US dollar and the Russian ruble in order to maintain the stability of the Belarusian ruble . Yet , the currency has experienced free fall and also several rounds of devaluation . A major devaluation took place in 2011 after the government announced that average salaries would increase to US $ 500 . The 2011 devaluation was the largest on record for the past twenty years according to the World Bank . Belarus also had to seek a bailout from international sources , and while it has received loans from China , receiving loans from the IMF and other agencies depend on how Belarus reforms its economy according to standards set by the IMF and other agencies . 
 Some critics of Lukashenko , including the opposition group <unk> , use the term <unk> to refer to the political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus . The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus . The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko 's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition . Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries . Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying : " I 've been hearing these accusations for over 10 years and we have got used to it . We are not going to answer them . I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves . I am sure that it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state . " 
 Since the November 1996 referendum , Lukashenko has effectively held all governing power in the nation . If the House of Representatives rejects his choice for prime minister twice , he has the right to dissolve it . His decrees have greater weight than ordinary legislation . He also has near @-@ absolute control over government spending ; parliament can only increase or decrease spending with his permission . However , the legislature is dominated by his supporters in any event , and there is no substantive opposition to presidential decisions . He also appoints eight members of the upper house , the Council of the Republic , as well as nearly all judges . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 Lukashenko 's relationship with the EU has been strained , in part by choice and in part by his policies towards domestic opponents . Lukashenko 's repression of opponents caused him to be called " Europe 's last dictator " and resulted in the EU imposing visa sanctions on him and a range of Belarusian officials . At times , the EU has lifted sanctions as a way to encourage dialogue or gain concessions from Lukashenko . Since the EU adopted this policy of " change through engagement " , it has supported economic and political reforms to help integrate the Belarusian state . 
 Lukashenko 's relationship with Russia , once his powerful ally and vocal supporter , has significantly deteriorated . The run @-@ up to the 2010 Belarusian presidential election was marked by a series of Russian media attacks on Lukashenko . Throughout July state @-@ controlled channel NTV broadcast a multi @-@ part documentary entitled " The Godfather " highlighting the suspicious disappearance of a number of opposition leaders during the late 1990s . Lukashenko called the media attack " dirty propaganda " . 
 His policies have been praised by some other world leaders and are seen as a model for at least one country . In response to a question about Belarus 's domestic policies , President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela said " We see here a model social state like the one we are beginning to create . " Chairman of the Chinese Standing Committee of National People 's Congress Wu Bangguo noted that Belarus has been rapidly developing under Lukashenko . Lithuanian MPs have also praised the Belarusian economy and its contribution to the Lithuanian economy ; <unk> <unk> said that he was in awe of the Belarusian progress created mostly by the efforts of the national leader . 
 During the 2014 crisis in Ukraine , Alexander Lukashenko became a critic of Russian policy and interferences in Ukraine 's internal affairs . Lukashenko criticized the Donbass status referendums and the idea of federalization , and proclaimed support for the government in Kiev . During the 9 May celebration , Lukashenko spoke in Belarusian instead of Russian for the first time . Later he arranged a meeting between Ukraine 's president Petro <unk> and Russian president Vladimir Putin . The Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza has written about Lukashenko 's transformation from " the last dictator in Europe to acceptable peacemaker " . 
 In 2015 , Lukashenko sought to improve trade relations between Belarus and Latin America . 
 = = Controversial statements = = 
 In 1995 , Lukashenko was accused of making a remark which has been construed to be in praise of Adolf Hitler : " The history of Germany is a copy of the history of Belarus . Germany was raised from ruins thanks to firm authority and not everything connected with that well @-@ known figure Hitler was bad . German order evolved over the centuries and attained its peak under Hitler . " 
 In October 2007 , Lukashenko was accused of making anti @-@ Semitic and anti @-@ Israel comments ; addressing the " miserable state of the city of Babruysk " on a live broadcast on state radio , he stated : " This is a Jewish city , and the Jews are not concerned for the place they live in . They have turned Babruysk into a pigsty . Look at Israel – I was there and saw it myself ... I call on Jews who have money to come back to Babruysk . " Members of the US House of Representatives sent a letter to the Belarusian ambassador to the US , Mikhail <unk> , addressing Lukashenko 's comments with a strong request to retract them , and the comments also caused a negative reaction from Israel . Consequently , Pavel <unk> , editor of Belarus Today , was sent to Israel , and in a meeting with the Israel Foreign Ministry said that Lukashenko 's comment was " a mistake that was said jokingly , and does not represent his positions regarding the Jewish people " and that he was " anything but anti @-@ Semitic , " and had been " insulted by the mere accusation . " The Belarusian Ambassador to Israel , Igor <unk> , stated that the president had a " kind attitude toward the Jewish people " , and Sergei <unk> , the press secretary at the Belarusian Embassy in Tel Aviv , said parts of Lukashenko 's comments had been mistranslated . 
 On 4 March 2012 , two days after EU leaders ( including openly gay German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle ) had called for new measures to pressure Lukashenko over alleged human rights abuses in Belarus at a summit in Brussels , Lukashenko provoked diplomatic rebuke from Germany after commenting that it was " better to be a dictator than gay " in response to Westerwelle having referred to him as " Europe 's last dictator " during the meeting .

 Lukashenko married Galina <unk> , his high school sweetheart , in 1975 . Later that year his oldest son , Viktor , was born . Their second son , <unk> , was born in 1980 . Galina lives separately in the family 's house in the village near Shklov . Though they are still legally married , Galina Lukashenko has been estranged from her husband since shortly after he became president . His son Viktor is a ' national security aide ' ; according to one foreign tabloid newspaper Lukashenko has dismissed him in public as " a useless weakling who will soon become even weaker " . 
 Lukashenko fathered an illegitimate son , Nikolai , who was born in 2004 . Though never confirmed by the government , it is widely believed that the child 's mother is Irina <unk> – the two had an affair when she was Lukashenko 's personal doctor . It has been reported by Western observers and media that Nikolai , nicknamed " <unk> " , is being groomed as Lukashenko 's successor . According to Belarusian state media , these speculations were dismissed by Lukashenko , who also denied that he would remain in office for a further thirty years – the time Nikolai will become eligible to stand for election and succeed him .

 Lukashenko believes that the president should be a conservative person and avoid using modern electronic gadgets such as an iPad or iPhone . He used to play <unk> and football , but abandoned both during his presidency . He is a keen skier and ice hockey forward , who played exhibition games alongside international hockey stars . His two elder sons also play hockey , sometimes alongside their father . 
 Lukashenko started training in cross @-@ country as a child , and in the 2000s still competed at the national level .

 The University of Chicago ( UChicago , Chicago , or U of C ) is a private research university in Chicago , Illinois . The university , established in 1890 , is composed of the College , various graduate programs , and interdisciplinary committees organized into five academic research divisions , six professional schools , and the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies . Beyond the arts and sciences , Chicago is also well known for its professional schools , which include the Pritzker School of Medicine , the Booth School of Business , the Law School , the School of Social Service Administration , the Harris School of Public Policy Studies , and the Divinity School . The university currently enrolls approximately 5 @,@ 700 students in the College and around 15 @,@ 000 students overall . 
 University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines , including : the Chicago school of economics , the Chicago school of sociology , law and economics theory in legal analysis , the Chicago school of literary criticism , the Chicago school of religion , and the <unk> school of political science . Chicago 's physics department helped develop the world 's first man @-@ made , self @-@ sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the university 's Stagg Field . Chicago 's research pursuits have been aided by unique affiliations with world @-@ renowned institutions like the nearby Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory ( Fermilab ) and Argonne National Laboratory , as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory . The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press , the largest university press in the United States . With an estimated completion date of 2020 , the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation . 
 Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history John D. Rockefeller , the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890 ; William Rainey Harper became the university 's first president in 1891 , and the first classes were held in 1892 . Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago 's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility . With Harper 's vision in mind , the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities , an international organization of leading research universities , in 1900 . 
 The University of Chicago has many prominent alumni . 89 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the university as professors , students , faculty , or staff , the fourth most of any institution in the world . In addition , Chicago 's alumni include 50 Rhodes Scholars , 22 Marshall Scholars , 9 Fields Medalists , 20 National Humanities Medalists , 16 MacArthur fellows , 13 billionaire graduates , and a plethora of members of the United States Congress and heads of state of countries all over the world .

 The University of Chicago was created and incorporated as a coeducational , secular institution in 1890 by the American Baptist Education Society and a donation from oil magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller on land donated by Marshall Field . While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long @-@ term endowment , it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings . The original physical campus was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans like Silas B. Cobb who provided the funds for the campus ' first building , Cobb Lecture Hall , and matched Marshall Field 's pledge of $ 100 @,@ 000 . Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson ( trustee , treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons ) , Martin A. Ryerson ( president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory ) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel , who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall , and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum , a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities . 
 Organized as an independent institution legally , it replaced the first Baptist university of the same name , which had closed in 1886 due to extended financial and leadership problems . William Rainey Harper became the modern university 's first president on July 1 , 1891 , and the university opened for classes on October 1 , 1892 . 
 The first president Harper , an accomplished scholar ( <unk> ) and a member of the Baptist clergy , believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus , to prepare students for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service to the church and community . As per this commitment , he brought the Morgan Park Seminary of the Baptist Theological Union to Hyde Park , and the Divinity School was founded in 1891 as the first professional school at the University of Chicago . 
 The business school was founded thereafter in 1898 , and the law school was founded in 1902 . Harper died in 1906 , and was replaced by a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929 . During this period , the Oriental Institute was founded to support and interpret archeological work in what was then called the Near East . 
 In the 1890s , the University of Chicago , fearful that its vast resources would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students , affiliated with several regional colleges and universities : Des Moines College , Kalamazoo College , Butler University , and Stetson University . In 1896 , the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll , Illinois . Under the terms of the affiliation , the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university , to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals , to make no faculty appointment without the university 's approval , and to send copies of examinations for suggestions . The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years , and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago . A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago , and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work . The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost ; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses ; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost . The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice . Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program , as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part , and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university . The program passed into history by 1910 .

 In 1929 , the university 's fifth president , Robert Maynard Hutchins , took office ; the university underwent many changes during his 24 @-@ year tenure . Hutchins eliminated varsity football from the university in an attempt to emphasize academics over athletics , instituted the undergraduate college 's liberal @-@ arts curriculum known as the Common Core , and organized the university 's graduate work into four divisions . In 1933 , Hutchins proposed an unsuccessful plan to merge the University of Chicago and Northwestern University into a single university . During his term , the University of Chicago Hospitals ( now called the University of Chicago Medical Center ) finished construction and enrolled its first medical students . Also , the Committee on Social Thought , an institution distinctive of the university , was created . 
 Money that had been raised during the 1920s and financial backing from the Rockefeller Foundation helped the school to survive through the Great Depression . During World War II , the university made important contributions to the Manhattan Project . The university was the site of the first isolation of plutonium and of the creation of the first artificial , self @-@ sustained nuclear reaction by Enrico Fermi in 1942 . 
 In the early 1950s , student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood . In response , the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park , which profoundly affected both the neighborhood 's architecture and street plan . During this period the university , like Shimer College and 10 others , adopted an early entrant program that allowed very young students to attend college ; in addition , students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year , having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses . 
 The university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s , beginning in 1962 , when students occupied President George Beadle 's office in a protest over the university 's off @-@ campus rental policies . After continued turmoil , a university committee in 1967 issued what became known as the <unk> Report . The report , a two @-@ page statement of the university 's policy in " social and political action , " declared that " To perform its mission in the society , a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions , passions , and pressures . " The report has since been used to justify decisions such as the university 's refusal to divest from South Africa in the 1980s and Darfur in the late 2000s . 
 In 1969 , more than 400 students , angry about the dismissal of a popular professor , Marlene Dixon , occupied the Administration Building for two weeks . After the sit @-@ in ended , when Dixon turned down a one @-@ year reappointment , 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended , the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement .

 In 1999 , then @-@ President Hugo Sonnenschein announced plans to relax the university 's famed core curriculum , reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15 . When The New York Times , The Economist , and other major news outlets picked up this story , the university became the focal point of a national debate on education . The changes were ultimately implemented , but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein 's decision to resign in 2000 . 
 From the mid @-@ 2000s , the university began a number of multimillion @-@ dollar expansion projects . In 2008 , the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the Milton Friedman Institute which attracted both support and controversy from faculty members and students . The institute will cost around $ 200 million and occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary . During the same year , investor David G. Booth donated $ 300 million to the university 's Booth School of Business , which is the largest gift in the university 's history and the largest gift ever to any business school . In 2009 , planning or construction on several new buildings , half of which cost $ 100 million or more , was underway . Since 2011 , major construction projects have included the Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery , a ten @-@ story medical research center , and further additions to the medical campus of the University of Chicago Medical Center . In 2014 the University launched the public phase of a $ 4 @.@ 5 billion fundraising campaign . In September 2015 , the University received $ 100 million from The Pearson Family Foundation to establish The Pearson Institute for the Study and Resolution of Global Conflicts and The Pearson Global Forum at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies . 
 On May 1 , 2014 , the University of Chicago was named one of fifty @-@ five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights " for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints " by the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault . 
 = = Campus = = 
 The main campus of the University of Chicago consists of 217 acres ( 87 @.@ 8 ha ) in the Chicago neighborhoods of Hyde Park and Woodlawn , seven miles ( 11 km ) south of downtown Chicago . The northern and southern portions of campus are separated by the Midway Plaisance , a large , linear park created for the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition . In 2011 , Travel + Leisure listed the university as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States . 
 The first buildings of the University of Chicago campus , which make up what is now known as the Main Quadrangles , were part of a " master plan " conceived by two University of Chicago trustees and plotted by Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb . The Main Quadrangles consist of six quadrangles , each surrounded by buildings , bordering one larger quadrangle . The buildings of the Main Quadrangles were designed by Cobb , Shepley , Rutan and Coolidge , Holabird & Roche , and other architectural firms in a mixture of the Victorian Gothic and Collegiate Gothic styles , patterned on the colleges of the University of Oxford . ( Mitchell Tower , for example , is modeled after Oxford 's Magdalen Tower , and the university Commons , Hutchinson Hall , replicates Christ Church Hall . ) 
 After the 1940s , the Gothic style on campus began to give way to modern styles . In 1955 , Eero Saarinen was contracted to develop a second master plan , which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway , including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle ( a complex designed by Saarinen ) ; a series of arts buildings ; a building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the university 's School of Social Service Administration , a building which is to become the home of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies by Edward Durrell Stone , and the Regenstein Library , the largest building on campus , a brutalist structure designed by Walter <unk> of the Chicago firm Skidmore , Owings & Merrill . Another master plan , designed in 1999 and updated in 2004 , produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center ( 2003 ) , the Max <unk> Residential Commons ( 2001 ) , South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons ( 2009 ) , a new children 's hospital , and other construction , expansions , and restorations . In 2011 , the university completed the glass dome @-@ shaped Joe and Rika Mansueto Library , which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off @-@ campus book depository . 
 The site of Chicago Pile @-@ 1 is a National Historic Landmark and is marked by the Henry Moore sculpture Nuclear Energy . Robie House , a Frank Lloyd Wright building acquired by the university in 1963 , is also a National Historic Landmark , as is room 405 of the George Herbert Jones Laboratory , where Glenn T. Seaborg and his team were the first to isolate plutonium . Hitchcock Hall , an undergraduate dormitory , is on the National Register of Historic Places .

As of May 2016 , the Chairman of the Board of Trustees is Joseph Neubauer , and the President of the university is Robert Zimmer . In December 2013 it was announced that the Director of Argonne National Laboratory , Eric Isaacs , would become Provost . Isaacs was replaced as Provost in March 2016 by Daniel <unk> . 
 The university 's endowment was the 12th largest among American educational institutions and state university systems in 2013 and as of 2015 was valued at $ 7 @.@ 6 billion . Part of President Zimmer 's financial plan for the university has been an increase in accumulation of debt to finance large building projects . This has drawn support and criticism from many in the university community .

The show served as part one of the " Glorious Excess " two @-@ part series , with the second installment " Glorious Excess ( <unk> ) " due at <unk> at August 22 , 2009 . Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series , stating , " It Got to a point where the pervasiveness of ' celebrity news ' concerned me . It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn 't belong . I would be watching the news , and thinking , ' of all the things going on in the world right now , why are they covering so @-@ and @-@ so 's breakup ? ' It didn 't make sense to me . Add to that the fact that I 'm supposed to somehow ' belong ' to that celebrity group — and I really don 't feel like I do in a lot of ways — and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me . The Glorious Excess ( <unk> ) show was my way of diving into those topics , trying to find answers . It follows a central ' celebrity ' character , who is filthy rich , slightly violent , and famous without any particular skill or talent . " 
 On November 6 , 2014 , Shinoda and Hahn painted an artwork on the Berlin Wall .

In addition albums , Shinoda scored the MTV VMA 's in 2005 and also worked with Ramin Djawadi to score the video game , Medal of Honor : <unk> . In 2011 , he collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to compose the score for the American release of The Raid : Redemption . 
 In 2004 , he released a remixed single and animated music video of Depeche Mode 1989 single , " Enjoy the Silence " . In 2005 , Shinoda hosted the Rock Phenomenon mixtape / remix CD with DJ Vlad and Roc <unk> . The CD is the first ( and to date , only ) in DJ Vlad 's Rock Phenomenon series ( which itself is a spin @-@ off of Vlad 's Rap Phenomenon mixtape series ) , and features a mashup of Linkin Park 's " Papercut " , and David Banner 's " Like a Pimp ( Remix ) " . For the 2006 Grammy awards , Shinoda and Brad Delson assembled the mashup track of Numb / Encore and " Yesterday " by The Beatles to be performed live by rapper Jay @-@ Z , Linkin Park and former Beatles singer Paul McCartney . Shinoda teamed up with former band mate Mark Wakefield to record and release a single , " Barack Your World " , in October 2008 .

 Various critics have compared Shinoda 's rapping style to that of fellow rapper Eminem . A reviewer for Entertainment Weekly noted that Shinoda 's vocals were " flowing like Eminem on Ambien " An editor for Uncut stated that The Rising Tied was " bound to please fans of Linkin Park and Eminem alike . " Jo <unk> of The Star thought " Where 'd You Go " is similar to Eminem 's song " When I 'm Gone " , noting the former as " more melancholic .

 = Anthony Parker = 
 Anthony Michael Parker ( born June 19 , 1975 ) is an American retired professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , as well as in Italy and Israel . 
 After graduating from Bradley University with a major in liberal arts , he entered the 1997 NBA Draft and played briefly in the NBA before plying his trade in Europe . There , Parker spent five seasons with the Israeli Super League basketball club Maccabi Tel Aviv and one season with the Italian Serie A club <unk> Roma . With Maccabi he won five Israeli Super League national championships , five Israeli National Cups , three European titles ( two Euroleague Basketball titles and the FIBA SuproLeague title in 2001 ) , and was voted two consecutive times Euroleague MVP . 
 After returning to the NBA as a free agent in 2006 , Parker was the Toronto Raptors ' starting shooting guard . In his first season with the Raptors , Parker helped the team clinch their first ever division title , first NBA Playoffs berth in five years , and best regular season record in franchise history . He helped the Raptors reach the playoffs again in the 2007 – 08 season , before becoming a free agent in 2009 . 
 On June 27 , 2012 , Anthony Parker retired after 9 seasons in the NBA and 6 seasons in Israel . He is currently a scout for the Orlando Magic .

 Parker was born in Naperville , Illinois . His father played college basketball at the University of Iowa , while his mother was a cheerleader . Parker 's younger siblings also played basketball ; his brother Marcus played basketball in high school , while his sister Candace plays in the WNBA and was the number one pick of the 2008 draft . Early in his professional basketball career , Parker married <unk> , and they had their first child in 2002 . Parker is Christian .

 = = = Early basketball career = = = 
 Parker started out playing high school basketball at Naperville Central High School . He then played college basketball at Bradley University where he established himself as a top player , averaging 18 @.@ 9 points per game ( ppg ) and shooting 42 % from the three @-@ point line in his third season , earning the Missouri Valley Conference ( MVC ) Most Valuable Player and All @-@ MVC first team honors in the same season . His outstanding performances for the Braves ensured that he became one of 15 players honored in Bradley 's All @-@ Century basketball team named in 2003 . Academically , Parker also excelled . He majored in chemistry before switching to liberal arts and sciences in his senior year , and earned two Major Robert H. Lawrence Jr . Scholarships while at Bradley . 
 Parker entered the 1997 NBA Draft after four years at Bradley and was selected 21st overall by the New Jersey Nets , but he was immediately traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in a multi @-@ player trade . In his two seasons with the 76ers , Parker was largely plagued by injury and played in only 39 regular season games , averaging just over five minutes a game and totaling 74 points and 26 rebounds . He was subsequently traded together with Harvey Grant to the Orlando Magic for Billy Owens before the 1999 – 2000 season began . Parker again struggled at Orlando , playing only 16 games with modest averages of 3 @.@ 6 ppg and 1 @.@ 7 rebounds per game ( rpg ) before being released in January 2000 . He finished the remainder of the season with the Quad City Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association where he averaged 11 @.@ 5 points in 26 games . 
 = = = European career = = = 
 Disappointed in his failure to make a breakthrough in the NBA , Parker turned to Europe to resurrect his basketball career , intending to return to the NBA after a good season with a European club . Eventually he moved to Israel in the 2000 – 01 season , where he was signed by the Israeli Euroleague powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv . Initially , Parker and his wife were intimidated by the occasional bomb attacks in the city , but they soon settled in and Parker was able to focus on his basketball career . Within his first season with his new club , he became one of their most pivotal players . Parker was signed to fill the void left by Doron Sheffer 's retirement at the shooting guard position , but ended up featuring as a both scorer and playmaker for Maccabi . He immediately brought to the team his ability to score , rebound , block shots , and even entertain the crowds with slam dunks . In Parker 's inaugural season , Maccabi won the Israeli domestic championship and the Israeli National Cup , as well as the FIBA SuproLeague Cup . He continued his fine form for the club in the 2001 – 02 season , averaging 16 @.@ 4 points per game and 5 @.@ 2 rebounds per game as Maccabi again won both domestic titles , and even reached the Euroleague 2001 – 02 Final Four . 
 Parker left Israel in 2002 , and in January 2003 moved to Italy , where he signed with Virtus Roma , playing in 27 Italian Serie A league games and averaging 14 @.@ 5 points per game and 5 @.@ 6 rebounds per game . However , half a year later Parker longed a return to Israel , a country he had grown to love . Back with Maccabi , he helped his team accomplish two more Triple Crowns by winning the Israeli domestic championship , the Israeli National Cup , and the Euroleague championship in both 2004 and 2005 . In the process , he was named the Israeli Basketball Super League MVP and the Euroleague Final Four MVP of the Euroleague 2003 – 04 season , as well as the Euroleague MVP and first team All @-@ Euroleague in the Euroleague 2004 – 05 season . The 2004 – 05 season also proved to be a watershed season for Parker , as he averaged career @-@ highs of 18 @.@ 0 points per game , 5 @.@ 3 rebounds per game and 3 @.@ 6 assists per game . In his final season with Maccabi , he led Maccabi to another domestic double , but in the Euroleague 2005 – 06 season 's championship game , Maccabi was defeated 73 – 69 by CSKA Moscow . For his efforts , Parker was named Euroleague MVP and first team All @-@ Euroleague for the second consecutive time . After six years of success in Europe however , Parker dreamed of returning to the NBA . Overall , he averaged 13 @.@ 6 points per game , 4 @.@ 8 rebounds per game and 1 @.@ 8 steals per game in his Israeli league career , while averaging 15 @.@ 8 points per game , 5 @.@ 7 rebounds per game and 1 @.@ 6 steals per game in the Euroleague . He made the 50 Greatest Euroleague Contributors list in 2008 , and the Euroleague 2001 – 10 All @-@ Decade Team in 2010 . 
 Parker 's experience playing in Israel left a positive impression upon him . He went on to wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland , explaining that : " I played in Israel before I came back to the NBA , and I had such a great time ... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel . And I just had such a great experience that I wanted to take something from that experience . The number 18 , in Judaism , it means ' chai ' ... and it 's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism . And I thought that was something to take away from Israel and let them know I 'm still representing them . "

 In October 2005 , during a pre @-@ season friendly representing Maccabi against the Toronto Raptors organized by then Israeli Consul @-@ General Cobie Brosh , Parker hit the game @-@ winning shot with less than a second remaining to lead Maccabi to a 105 – 103 win at the Air Canada Centre . This gave the Raptors fans and management a glimpse of his abilities and in July 2006 , Parker was officially signed by Raptors General Manager Bryan Colangelo as a free agent as part of a massive revamp of the 2006 – 07 Toronto team . He was signed for approximately $ 12 million ( USD ) over three years , joining recent European veteran acquisitions Jorge Garbajosa and José Calderón on the team . Adopting a # 18 jersey , Parker quickly established himself as the starting shooting guard for Toronto and a well @-@ respected three @-@ point shooter in the NBA , ranking fourth in the league for three point field goal percentage by the end of the regular season . Overall , in his first season with Toronto , he averaged 12 @.@ 4 ppg , 3 @.@ 9 rpg , and 2 @.@ 1 apg , leading his team in three @-@ point field goal percentage and free throw percentage . Parker 's defensive and offensive versatility were credited as instrumental in helping the Raptors clinch their first @-@ ever division title , first NBA Playoffs berth in five years , as well as best regular season record in franchise history . 
 In the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs , Parker was chosen to defend New Jersey Nets ' and former Toronto favorite Vince Carter . Parker was effective in shutting down Carter , restricting him to 13 @-@ for @-@ 43 shooting in the first two games . However , the Raptors were eliminated by the Nets after Game 6 . On April 4 , 2007 , the NBA also announced that Parker had been selected by a five @-@ member panel of former players as the divisional winner of the 2006 – 07 NBA Sportsmanship Award . The annual award reflects the ideals of sportsmanship in amateur and professional basketball . 
 In the 2007 – 08 season , Parker remained — despite the signing of Miami 's Jason Kapono — the starting shooting guard for the Raptors , with rookie Jamario Moon completing the wing positions . In a season that was fraught with lengthy injuries to a number of his team mates ( such as T.J. Ford and Chris Bosh ) , he managed to play in all 82 regular season games and ensured that Toronto made the 2008 NBA Playoffs , albeit as the sixth seed . However , the Raptors were eliminated in the first round by the Orlando Magic in five games . Parker was later named by ESPN as one of the best Euroleague players to have graced the NBA . 
 At the end of the 2007 – 08 season , he ranked 7th in NBA 's all @-@ time leaders in three @-@ point field goal percentage . 
 Parker played a variety of roles in the following season . First , Kapono was temporarily moved to the starting shooting guard spot after the Raptors fired head coach Sam Mitchell . When Calderón was injured , Parker had to fill in as the starting point guard . After struggling in December , he hit good form in January and helped the Raptors inch towards a better record after the team went 16 – 28 . Although Parker eventually regained his starting spot , Toronto fell further behind the playoff race as a result of changing rosters and inconsistent performances , dropping to 21 – 34 just before the All @-@ Star break . The shooting guard 's offensive output was also erratic throughout the season , and the Raptors all but fell out of the playoffs picture by March . The Raptors eventually concluded the regular season with only 33 wins , with Parker suffering a significant drop in his numbers ( shooting percentage and points per game ) . His future remained uncertain as he was due to become a free agent , but he expressed a desire to return to Toronto for the next season . With Toronto selecting shooting guard DeMar DeRozan in the 2009 NBA Draft , that <unk> was compounded . 
 = = = = Cleveland Cavaliers = = = = 
 On July 13 , 2009 , Parker signed a two @-@ year , $ 6 million deal with the LeBron James @-@ led Cleveland Cavaliers , a team that had reached the 2007 NBA Finals and 2009 Conference Finals . Cleveland General Manager Danny Ferry said of Parker : " Anthony will be a solid addition to our roster . He is a very good , intelligent all @-@ around basketball player . Our coaching staff will especially appreciate the good shooting and solid defense that Anthony brings to our team . " In a bid to ensure that James had his best shot of winning a title before he could potentially become a free agent after the season , Cleveland also acquired Shaquille O 'Neal and subsequently , Antawn Jamison , both of whom were veteran superstars . The new @-@ look Cleveland concluded the regular season with a league @-@ high 61 wins , with Parker starting all 81 games that he played in . In the first round of the playoffs , they defeated Chicago in five games . Cleveland faced the 2008 champions Boston in the next round , and despite expectations to prevail over the aging Celtics , Cleveland lost the series 4 – 2 . Parker started all 11 of Cleveland 's playoff games . 
 During the 2010 NBA offseason , LeBron James and <unk> <unk> left Cleveland for the Miami Heat , which led several other veterans to also leave the team . The departures would thrust Parker , Antawn Jamison and Anderson Varejão into the spotlight as the veteran leaders for the young team . While Cleveland only managed a conference @-@ worst 19 – 63 season , they were able to upset Lebron James ' heavily favored Miami Heat on March 29 , 2011 in a game where Parker grabbed eight rebounds and scored 20 points . 
 On June 27 , 2012 , Parker announced his retirement .

 = Maximum spacing estimation = 
 In statistics , maximum spacing estimation ( MSE or MSP ) , or maximum product of spacing estimation ( MPS ) , is a method for estimating the parameters of a univariate statistical model . The method requires maximization of the geometric mean of spacings in the data , which are the differences between the values of the cumulative distribution function at neighbouring data points . 
 The concept underlying the method is based on the probability integral transform , in that a set of independent random samples derived from any random variable should on average be uniformly distributed with respect to the cumulative distribution function of the random variable . The MPS method chooses the parameter values that make the observed data as uniform as possible , according to a specific quantitative measure of uniformity . 
 One of the most common methods for estimating the parameters of a distribution from data , the method of maximum likelihood ( MLE ) , can break down in various cases , such as involving certain mixtures of continuous distributions . In these cases the method of maximum spacing estimation may be successful . 
 Apart from its use in pure mathematics and statistics , the trial applications of the method have been reported using data from fields such as hydrology , econometrics , magnetic resonance imaging , and others . 
 = = History and usage = = 
 The MSE method was derived independently by Russel Cheng and Nik Amin at the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology , and Bo Ranneby at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences . The authors explained that due to the probability integral transform at the true parameter , the “ spacing ” between each observation should be uniformly distributed . This would imply that the difference between the values of the cumulative distribution function at consecutive observations should be equal . This is the case that maximizes the geometric mean of such spacings , so solving for the parameters that maximize the geometric mean would achieve the “ best ” fit as defined this way . Ranneby ( 1984 ) justified the method by demonstrating that it is an estimator of the <unk> – <unk> divergence , similar to maximum likelihood estimation , but with more robust properties for various classes of problems . 
 There are certain distributions , especially those with three or more parameters , whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space . Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down , with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite , rendering the other parameters inconsistent . The method of maximum spacings , however , being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points , does not have this issue , and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions . 
 The distributions that tend to have likelihood issues are often those used to model physical phenomena . Hall & al . ( 2004 ) seek to analyze flood alleviation methods , which requires accurate models of river flood effects . The distributions that better model these effects are all three @-@ parameter models , which suffer from the infinite likelihood issue described above , leading to Hall ’ s investigation of the maximum spacing procedure . Wong & Li ( 2006 ) , when comparing the method to maximum likelihood , use various data sets ranging from a set on the oldest ages at death in Sweden between 1905 and 1958 to a set containing annual maximum wind speeds . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Given an <unk> random sample { x1 , … , xn } of size n from a univariate distribution with the cumulative distribution function F ( x ; θ0 ) , where θ0 ∈ Θ is an unknown parameter to be estimated , let { x ( 1 ) , … , x ( n ) } be the corresponding ordered sample , that is the result of sorting of all observations from smallest to largest . For convenience also denote x ( 0 ) 
 = − ∞ and x ( n + 1 ) = 
 + ∞ . 
 Define the spacings as the “ gaps ” between the values of the distribution function at adjacent ordered points : 
 <formula> 
 Then the maximum spacing estimator of θ0 is defined as a value that maximizes the logarithm of the geometric mean of sample spacings : 
 <formula> 
 By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means , function Sn ( θ ) is bounded from above by − ln ( n + 1 ) , and thus the maximum has to exist at least in the supremum sense . 
 Note that some authors define the function Sn ( θ ) somewhat differently . In particular , Ranneby ( 1984 ) multiplies each Di by a factor of ( n + 1 ) , whereas Cheng & Stephens ( 1989 ) omit the 1 ⁄ n + 1 factor in front of the sum and add the “ − ” sign in order to turn the maximization into minimization . As these are constants with respect to θ , the modifications do not alter the location of the maximum of the function Sn . 
 = = Examples = = 
 This section presents two examples of calculating the maximum spacing estimator . 
 = = = Example 1 = = = 
 Suppose two values x ( 1 ) 
 = 2 , x ( 2 ) = 
 4 were sampled from the exponential distribution F ( x ; λ ) 
 = 1 − e − <unk> , x ≥ 0 with unknown parameter λ > 0 . In order to construct the MSE we have to first find the spacings : 
 The process continues by finding the λ that maximizes the geometric mean of the “ difference ” column . Using the convention that ignores taking the ( n + 1 ) st root , this turns into the maximization of the following product : ( 1 − e − 2λ ) · ( e − 2λ − e − <unk> ) · ( e − <unk> ) . Letting μ = 
 e − 2λ , the problem becomes finding the maximum of <unk> − <unk> + <unk> . Differentiating , the μ has to satisfy <unk> − <unk> + <unk> 
 = 0 . This equation has roots 0 , 0 @.@ 6 , and 1 . As μ is actually e − 2λ , it has to be greater than zero but less than one . Therefore , the only acceptable solution is 
 <formula> 
 which corresponds to an exponential distribution with a mean of 1 ⁄ λ ≈ 3 @.@ 915 . For comparison , the maximum likelihood estimate of λ is the inverse of the sample mean , 3 , so <unk> = 
 ⅓ ≈ 0 @.@ 333 . 
 = = = Example 2 = = = 
 Suppose { x ( 1 ) , … , x ( n ) } is the ordered sample from a uniform distribution U ( a , b ) with unknown endpoints a and b . The cumulative distribution function is F ( x ; a , b ) = ( x − a ) / ( b − a ) when x ∈ [ a , b ] . Therefore individual spacings are given by 
 <formula> 
 Calculating the geometric mean and then taking the logarithm , statistic Sn will be equal to 
 <formula> 
 Here only the first three terms depend on the parameters a and b . Differentiating with respect to those parameters and solving the resulting linear system , the maximum spacing estimates will be 
 <formula> 
 These are known to be the uniformly minimum variance unbiased ( <unk> ) estimators for the continuous uniform distribution . In comparison , the maximum likelihood estimates for this problem <formula> and <formula> are biased and have higher mean @-@ squared error . 
 = = Properties = = 
 = = = Consistency and efficiency = = = 
 The maximum spacing estimator is a consistent estimator in that it converges in probability to the true value of the parameter , θ0 , as the sample size increases to infinity . The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators . In particular , in cases where the underlying distribution is J @-@ shaped , maximum likelihood will fail where MSE succeeds . An example of a J @-@ shaped density is the Weibull distribution , specifically a shifted Weibull , with a shape parameter less than 1 . The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent . 
 Maximum spacing estimators are also at least as asymptotically efficient as maximum likelihood estimators , where the latter exist . However , <unk> may exist in cases where <unk> do not . 
 = = = Sensitivity = = = 
 Maximum spacing estimators are sensitive to closely spaced observations , and especially ties . Given 
 <formula> 
 we get 
 <formula> 
 When the ties are due to multiple observations , the repeated spacings ( those that would otherwise be zero ) should be replaced by the corresponding likelihood . That is , one should substitute <formula> for <formula> , as 
 <formula> 
 since <formula> . 
 When ties are due to rounding error , Cheng & Stephens ( 1989 ) suggest another method to remove the effects . Given r tied observations from xi to xi + r − 1 , let δ represent the round @-@ off error . All of the true values should then fall in the range <formula> . The corresponding points on the distribution should now fall between <formula> and <formula> . Cheng and Stephens suggest assuming that the rounded values are uniformly spaced in this interval , by defining 
 <formula> 
 The MSE method is also sensitive to secondary clustering . One example of this phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought to come from a single normal distribution , but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means . A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution , but actually comes from a gamma distribution . In the latter case , smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail . A high value of M ( θ ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect , and suggesting a closer look at the data is required . 
 = = Goodness of fit = = 
 The statistic Sn ( θ ) is also a form of Moran or Moran @-@ Darling statistic , M ( θ ) , which can be used to test goodness of fit . It has been shown that the statistic , when defined as 
 <formula> 
 is asymptotically normal , and that a chi @-@ squared approximation exists for small samples . In the case where we know the true parameter <formula> , Cheng & Stephens ( 1989 ) show that the statistic <formula> has a normal distribution with 
 <formula> 
 where γ is the Euler – Mascheroni constant which is approximately 0 @.@ <unk> . 
 The distribution can also be approximated by that of <formula> , where 
 <formula> , 
 in which 
 <formula> 
 and where <formula> follows a chi @-@ squared distribution with <formula> degrees of freedom . Therefore , to test the hypothesis <formula> that a random sample of <formula> values comes from the distribution <formula> , the statistic <formula> can be calculated . Then <formula> should be rejected with significance <formula> if the value is greater than the critical value of the appropriate chi @-@ squared distribution . 
 Where θ0 is being estimated by <formula> , Cheng & Stephens ( 1989 ) showed that <formula> has the same asymptotic mean and variance as in the known case . However , the test statistic to be used requires the addition of a bias correction term and is : 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> is the number of parameters in the estimate .

 Ranneby & Ekström ( 1997 ) generalized the MSE method to approximate other measures besides the <unk> – <unk> measure . Ekström ( 1997 ) further expanded the method to investigate properties of estimators using higher order spacings , where an m @-@ order spacing would be defined as <formula> .

 Ranneby & al . ( 2005 ) discuss extended maximum spacing methods to the multivariate case . As there is no natural order for <formula> , they discuss two alternative approaches : a geometric approach based on Dirichlet cells and a probabilistic approach based on a “ nearest neighbor ball ” metric . 
 = Joehana = 
 Akhmad Bassah ( also <unk> ; [ <unk> <unk> ] ; fl . 1923 – 30 ) , best known by the pen name Joehana ( [ <unk> ] ; Perfected Spelling : <unk> ) , was an author of the Dutch East Indies who wrote in Sundanese . He worked for a time on the railroad before becoming an author by 1923 , and had a strong interest in social welfare ; this interest influenced his novels . He was also a productive translator , dramatist , and reporter , and operated a company which offered writing services . Sources disagree when Joehana died ; some offer 1930 , while others give 1942 – 45 . 
 During the seven years in which he was active , Joehana wrote a number of stories and articles , as well as several novels . The years of publication are generally unclear , as reprints included neither the year of first publication nor the printing number . Stylistically , Joehana has been classified as a realist owing to his use of the names of actual locations and products in his works , as well as the predominantly vernacular Sundanese in his novels . However , influences from traditional theatrical forms such as wayang and literature such as pantun are evident . Joehana 's works cover a wide range of themes , although in general they are oriented towards social criticism and promote modernization . 
 Though Joehana 's works were published independently , they were popular in the Bandung area where they were sold . Local businesses may have offered funds for product placement , and Joehana 's works were adapted to the stage and film . However , they received little academic attention until the 1960s , and critical consensus since then has been negative . Two of his works have been republished since the 1960s , and stage productions of his novel Rasiah nu Goreng Patut continued into the 1980s . 
 = = Biography = = 
 It is uncertain when Akhmad Bassah was born , though he is thought to have been raised in Bandung , western Java , where he graduated from a Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs . Bassah spent time working on the state @-@ operated railroad , apparently rising to a fairly high position , but was fired for organizing a strike of the Union of Train and Tramway Personnel . Although he left the company , Bassah remained active in social movements . He was an active member of the Sarekat Rakyat ( People 's Union ) , an organization with communist leanings , and helped that group in its mission of social service . 
 Through contemporary reports it is clear that by 1923 Bassah had begun to make a name as a writer , and that he had also become active in the theatre and as a journalist . Bassah signed his writings " Joehana " , taken from the name of his adoptive daughter ; he is best remembered by that pen name . Although he was married to a schoolteacher named Atikah , they had no biological children . 
 Throughout his writing career , Joehana wrote independently , unattached to any publishing house . At the time , Balai Pustaka , a publisher operated by the Dutch colonial government , was attracting numerous Sundanese @-@ language writers . His biographers Tini Kartini et al. suggest that Joehana rejected his contemporaries ' approach , choosing to work independently rather than again work for the government which had fired him and would certainly censor his works . This , they write , is shown through the themes common in the stories : where his contemporaries focused on escapist literature and entertainment , Joehana focused on social criticism . However , Ajip Rosidi , a scholar of Sundanese literature , suggests that Joehana 's refusal to use formal Sundanese meant that Balai Pustaka would not accept his works . 
 In 1928 , Joehana opened the Romans Bureau , which was advertised as offering a variety of services , including the writing and printing of advertisements , translations ( from or into English , Dutch , Malay , and Sundanese ) , and the preparation of story concepts for other writers . Joehana may have also opened a writing course , although apparently most of his income was derived from the royalties of his publications . These publications , particularly his novels , were generally inspired by the types of works that were popular at the time of writing . One of his students , Abdullah <unk> 'i <unk> , recalled that Nangis Wibisana ( The Tears of Wibisana ) had been written when the dangding ( a traditional lyrical form ) <unk> <unk> ( <unk> 's Cry ) was popular , whereas Goenoeng <unk> ( The Smiling Mountain ) had been written during a period of increased interest in humorous anecdotes . 
 Joehana died after helping put together a stage performance based on his novel Kalepatan Poetra Dosana Iboe <unk> ( The Sins of the Son are the Sins of the Mother and Father ) in Tasikmalaya . His body is buried in Bandung . Sources disagree regarding the year of his death . Atikah dates it to c . 1930 , a year which Rosidi supports . Meanwhile , the publisher <unk> , which reissued Rasiah nu Goreng Patut in 1963 , cites the author as having died during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies ( 1942 – 45 ) ; this estimate has also been reported by literary critic Jakob <unk> , who gives Joehana 's estimated age at time of his death as 35 . 
 = = Works = = 
 Joehana 's oeuvre consists of fourteen books , as well as numerous editorials and articles in the newspaper <unk> . In their 1979 review of the author , Kartini et al. were able to find only six extant titles . It is difficult to determine the original year of publication for these works , for although Joehana 's books generally included a year of publication , the printing number was not recorded . As such , sources have works as having been published in different years ; for instance , Tjarios Agan Permas is variously dated 1923 , 1926 , and 1928 . 
 The following list is based on the one compiled by Kartini et al. in their 1979 study . It does not include any of Joehana 's work as a journalist , nor does it include works he published through his Romans Bureau .

 Joehana appears to have been familiar with the traditional literatures of Maritime Southeast Asia , drawing on the Ramayana for Nangis Wibisana . Wayang characters such as the clown <unk> are referred to in his writings , and he draws on traditional Sundanese storytelling techniques , such as the pantun form of poetry common in wayang golek performances . However , there are significant shifts . His writings depart from the traditional forms of literature such as wawacan , instead embracing the novel , a European literary form . Unlike the formal language used in traditional literature , Joehana wrote in everyday Sundanese . The grammar and structure shows evidence of influence from other languages , and the vocabulary is likewise not purely Sundanese ; some Dutch ( the language of the colonial government ) is mixed in . 
 The Sundanese author M. A. Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist . Rosidi writes that a sense of realism was promoted in Joehana 's writings through the use of references to existing ( and often popular ) brands of products , including cigars , salted fish , and biscuits ( though , as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to know these products , they are not given any in @-@ text explanation ) . Joehana used real @-@ life Bandung locations in his novels , and local figures prominent in the news ( such as the pickpocket Salim ) are mentioned in passing . There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement , in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels ; this payment may not have been direct , but in the form of goods or services , or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat . 
 Joehana displayed a sense of humour which was well received by his contemporaries : for instance , the frog chaser Karnadi of Rasiah nu Goreng Patut describes his trips to the rice fields to catch frogs as " going to the office " and the stick with which he kills the frogs as his " pencil " , whereas the Dutchman Van der <unk> of Tjarios Agan Permas uses the most polite register of Sundanese while speaking to his dog . Some of these jokes have remained popular ; Rosidi records one , about how to speak Dutch , as having survived into the 1980s . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The dominant theme in Joehana 's work is social criticism , particularly regarding socioeconomic conditions . In Rasiah nu Goreng Patut , he criticised those who sought material wealth above all other things through the Eulis Awang and her family , who are so enraptured by their greed that they do not realize that the man asking for Eulis Awang 's hand in marriage is not who he claims to be . In Tjarios Eulis Atjih , the main characters <unk> and Eulis Atjih , while both exemplifying greed and its inevitable repercussions , further show that wealth is not eternal : both lose their wealth and societal positions , then must earn a living . In the novel , Johanna calls on the rich to support and defend the poor , not despise them . That both rich and poor should receive equal treatment is emphasised in Tjarios Agan Permas : 
 Of the minds of the poor or the commoners , there is no difference with those of the rich or the <unk> [ noblemen ] , so long as they have the same chance to learn . Beware , never forget , one 's mind should not only be used to make a living , but must also be used to meet the needs of the many . 
 Another traditionally respected group which Joehana criticizes is the <unk> , those Muslims who have been on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca . The <unk> in Joehana 's stories are generally greedy and lustful , without any interest in the good of humanity . In Tjarios Agan Permas , for instance , Hajji <unk> displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam ( sinful ) while charging high interest rates for a loan , and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts . The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make @-@ up that , in the opinion of Kartini et al . , it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown . 
 Although Joehana rejects forced marriage , a common practice among the Sundanese in the early 20th century , and promotes the idea of marriage for love , he also warns against the dangers of overly free interactions between men and women . Through Kalepatan Poetra Dosana Iboe Rama he condemns forced marriage by depicting the marriage of a young woman to a wealthy man who is old enough to be her father ; this ultimately leaves the woman an outcast , reaping the " sins " of her parents . Both Moegiri and Neng Jaja , meanwhile , dealt with young women who were overly free in their interactions with men , and thus faced a sorrowful fate : divorce , abuse , and infidelity . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Joehana 's works were commercially successful , and often adapted to the stage . His Rasiah nu Goreng Patut , for instance , was adapted into a variety of forms , including as a Malay @-@ language lenong , and a stage performance of Tjarios Eulis Atjih is recorded in <unk> . Three films have been adapted from novels by Joehana , two from Tjarios Eulis Atjih and one from Rasiah nu Goreng Patut . The first , Eulis Atjih , was directed and produced by G. Krugers and released in 1927 to popular success . The second , generally referred to as Karnadi Anemer Bangkong , was adapted from Rasiah nu Goreng Patut by Krugers and released in the early 1930s ; it is known to have been a commercial failure , reportedly raising controversy for depicting a Muslim man eating frog meat . The third adaptation of a Joehana novel , also titled Eulis Atjih , was completed by Rd Ariffien in 1954 . Stage performances of Rasiah nu Goreng Patut continued as late as 1980 , though by that time the work was considered by the general public as part of folklore . 
 However , little academic discourse on Joehana was published until the 1960s ; according to Kartini et al . , this is attributable to Joehana 's use of non @-@ formal Sundanese . This renewal began with the republication of two of his works : Rasiah nu Goreng Patut in 1963 as a standalone book by <unk> , and Moegiri as a serial beginning with the 15 October 1965 edition of Sunda magazine . Rosidi , that magazine 's editor , included discussion of Joehana in his 1966 book <unk> Sunda <unk> Ini ( Contemporary Sundanese Literature ) . Some more discussion , by authors such as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , was published in magazines such as <unk> or included in university lectures . Until 1979 Joehana 's works had not been taught in Sundanese @-@ language courses in schools . 
 Modern critical reception of Joehana 's output has generally been negative . Sumardjo writes that his greatest weakness was a lack of in @-@ depth exploration of characters ' psyches , as well as a tendency to include an unclear social background . Kartini et al. note Joehana 's productivity , but find a lack of characterisation in his works . They find that , at times , his attempt to convey a social message is so dominant that the works come across as propaganda . Rosidi gives a more positive view of Joehana 's writing , noting that , although the use of non @-@ formal Sundanese was contentious in the 1920s , it nonetheless meant the language in Joehana 's works was more dynamic and " alive " than in works published by Balai Pustaka .

 = Ron Saggers with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = 
 Ron Saggers was a member of Donald Bradman 's famous Australian cricket team of 1948 , which toured England and went undefeated in their 34 matches . This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles . 
 The team 's reserve wicket @-@ keeper , Saggers played in only the Fourth of five Tests , due to an injury to first @-@ choice gloveman Don Tallon . The match was Saggers 's Test debut and he scored five in his only innings with the bat and took three catches . Despite being the second @-@ choice gloveman , Saggers conceded byes at a lower rate than Tallon did during the English summer . During the Fourth Test , Saggers conceded only six byes as England amassed a match total of 861 , the lowest percentage of byes conceded by Australia in a match during the tour . Despite this , Tallon remained the favoured gloveman , as Bradman deemed him to be faster and more athletic . 
 Bradman rotated the two glovemen during the tour , and Saggers played in 17 of the 31 first @-@ class matches , taking 23 catches and 20 stumpings . Due to Australia 's powerful batting line @-@ up , Saggers had few opportunities with the bat , scoring 209 runs at an average of 23 @.@ 22 , including his only century at first @-@ class level , 104 not out against Essex . 
 = = Background = = 
 Saggers started the tour as the clear second @-@ choice wicket @-@ keeper , as Don Tallon had played in each of Australia 's 11 Tests since the resumption of cricket after the Second World War , while Saggers was yet to make his Test debut . Saggers made his first @-@ class debut shortly before the start of the war , and after the resumption , was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon . However , as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities , there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips . However , the trip to England meant more than six months abroad , so a back @-@ up wicketkeeper was needed , and Saggers was selected for his first national squad . 
 = = Early tour = = 
 Australia traditionally fielded its first @-@ choice team in the tour opener , which was customarily against Worcestershire . Accordingly , Tallon was selected as the wicket @-@ keeper for the match . Tallon scored six , made five dismissals and conceded 11 byes as Australia crushed the hosts by an innings and 17 runs . 
 Tallon was then rested and Saggers took his place for the next county match against Leicestershire . Saggers scored six , took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings . Saggers was then rested for the next two matches , against Yorkshire and Surrey . Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter . Tallon batted steadily with 10 , 17 not out and 50 not out , but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches . Tallon was having difficulty with the bounce and movement of the ball in English conditions , and sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the Surrey match . He was hit after placing his hand over his face for protection , and the ball ran away for four byes . 
 While Tallon nursed a bruised finger , Saggers played in three successive tour matches . Against Cambridge University , he made two stumpings and took one catch , and was not required to bat as Australia won by an innings . He then played in the match against Essex where Australia scored 721 runs on the first day to set a new world record for the most runs scored in a day of first @-@ class cricket . Saggers made his highest first @-@ class score , 104 not out — the only first @-@ class century of his career — in a partnership of 166 runs in 65 minutes of batting with Sam Loxton . This made him the fourth century @-@ maker for the innings after Bill Brown , Bradman and Loxton . Of Saggers 's innings , former Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that " he reminded me at times of Alan Kippax in his artistry . He plays all the strokes . " Saggers took one catch as Australia won by an innings and 451 runs , their largest winning margin of the season . 
 He then faced Oxford University , scoring six runs and taking one catch in another innings victory . Saggers conceded six , eight and 14 byes respectively in the three matches . Up to this point , Saggers had conceded only 34 byes in his four tour matches , while Tallon had conceded 46 in <unk> 
 The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who went on to represent England in the Tests , N- and were basically a full @-@ strength Test team , as were Australia , who fielded their first @-@ choice team . It was a chance for players from both countries to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Test matches , and Tallon was selected ahead of Saggers despite conceding byes at a higher rate in the opening tour matches . Saggers looked on as Tallon conceded 26 byes and Australia won by an innings . 
 There were four more county fixtures before the First Test , against Lancashire , Nottinghamshire , Hampshire and Sussex . Australia drew the first two before winning the latter pair by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively . Saggers played in all but the Nottinghamshire match . Against Lancashire , Saggers came in at 6 / 145 and held up his end , making an unbeaten 22 as Australia reached 204 . He then completed a stumping and conceded 11 byes as the hosts replied with 182 before the rain @-@ affected match ended in a draw . Saggers went without a dismissal and conceded 16 byes as Hampshire made 195 in their first innings . He came to the crease with Australia having scored 98 runs for the loss of seven wickets ( 7 / 98 ) and was last man out for 17 , one of only four players to pass five , as Australia made 117 and conceded a first innings lead for the first time in the season . He then completed another stumping in the second innings and conceded four byes as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets . Saggers ' final opportunity to stake a claim for Test selection was in the match against Sussex . He did not concede a bye and took a catch in the first innings . Saggers was not required to bat as Australia declared their innings closed at 5 / 549 , and then made three more dismissals and conceded five byes as Australia won by an innings . 
 = = Test omission = = 
 In Saggers ' last three matches before the First Test , he conceded 36 byes and made six dismissals . In contrast , Tallon conceded 18 byes in his only match and scored 27 . Despite averaging more byes per innings than Saggers during the warm @-@ up matches , N- Tallon was retained in the Test team . He took four catches and conceded 17 byes as Australia won by eight wickets . 
 Between Tests , Australia played Northamptonshire and Yorkshire , and Tallon was rested for both matches . The first was won by an innings and the second was drawn . Saggers scored four against Northamptonshire and 22 against Yorkshire . After not making a dismissal against Northamptonshire , he took two catches and two stumpings in the latter match . He conceded 14 and 10 byes in the two matches respectively . 
 Tallon was retained for the Second Test at Lord 's , where he scored 53 , took three catches and conceded 16 byes as Australia won by 409 runs . A dive to stop a leg glance resulted in Tallon severely bruising the little finger on his left hand . Nursing his finger injury , Tallon was rested for both tour matches between the Tests , which were against Surrey and Gloucestershire . Australia won the matches by ten wickets and an innings respectively . In Tallon 's place , Saggers scored 12 , completed a catch and made four stumpings while conceding 18 byes against Surrey . In the match against Gloucestershire , Saggers was deprived of an opportunity to bat as Australia amassed 7 / 774 , its highest score of the tour and its second highest ever in England . He took two catches , completed three stumpings and conceded 13 byes for the match . 
 Tallon was retained as the teams then played out a draw in the Third Test at Manchester . During the match , Tallon conceded 16 byes and dropped Denis Compton three times as the English batsman went from 50 to 145 not out . Tallon 's little left finger swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during the next tour match against Middlesex , which Australia won by ten wickets . 
 = = Test debut = = 
 As a result of Tallon 's finger injury , Saggers made his Test debut in the Fourth Test , which started at Headingley on 22 July 1948 . As England made 496 runs in their first innings , Saggers took catches to remove Denis Compton for 23 , caught down the leg side , and Jim Laker for four . During the innings , Saggers was noted by Fingleton for maintaining a quiet presence behind the stumps , whereas Tallon was characteristically known for loudly appealing in concert with the bowler when he was playing . Fingleton felt that Saggers ' failure to appeal dampened the morale of the bowlers , who were vocally supported by Tallon in the other four Tests . Australia conceded 496 runs but Saggers leaked only two byes . 
 Australia replied with 458 , but Saggers was unable to make a substantial contribution , stumped by England 's wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans off the bowling of Laker for only five runs . England 's second innings reached 8 / 365 , as Saggers took one catch to secure the wicket of Ken Cranston and conceded four byes . This left Australia needing a world record Test run chase of 404 for victory . However , an innings of 182 runs from Arthur Morris and 173 not out from Bradman meant that Saggers was not required to bat in the second innings ; Australia defeated England by seven wickets , and set a world record for the highest successful Test run chase . Saggers 's six byes out of England 's match total of 861 runs was the lowest percentage of byes conceded by Australia in a match on the <unk> 
 Saggers made six not out , completed two catches , a stumping and conceded 15 byes in the innings victory over Derbyshire , before being rested in the next match against Glamorgan . In his first match back from injury , Tallon took a catch and two stumpings , but conceded 19 byes in a rain @-@ affected draw . Tallon 's byes were 9 @.@ 64 % of the hosts ' total , the highest percentage contribution made by byes to an innings on the <unk> Saggers returned for the nine @-@ wicket win over Warwickshire and struggled , making a duck . Although he took two catches and a stumping , he conceded 28 byes , 9 @.@ 56 % of Warwickshire 's total runs , the second highest percentage contribution of byes to a match total against <unk> Saggers was then rested for Australia 's second match and second draw against Lancashire as Tallon made three dismissals and conceded 23 byes . In the non @-@ first @-@ class match against Durham , Tallon played purely as a batsman , while Saggers kept wicket . Saggers came in at 8 / 226 and made 22 to help Australia reach 273 . He then made two stumpings and conceded four byes as the hosts reached 5 / 73 when rain ended the match . With Tallon fit again for the Fifth Test , Saggers was omitted as Australia won by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4 – 0 series victory . 
 = = Later tour matches = = 
 Seven matches remained on Bradman 's quest to complete an English tour without defeat . Tallon was rested for three consecutive matches against Kent , the Gentlemen of England , and Somerset , and Saggers kept wickets in all three fixtures ; Australia won all three by an innings . Saggers made only eight as Australia scored 361 against Kent . He then conceded only two byes and took two catches and made two stumpings as the home side made 51 and 124 . Saggers did not bat as Australia amassed 5 / 610 against the Gentlemen of England . He then took a catch and conceded 19 byes as Australia enforced the follow on and won . The match against Somerset was similar ; Saggers did not bat in Australia 's 5 / 560 declared , before making two stumpings and conceding eight byes . In total , he made seven dismissals and conceded 29 byes in the six innings of the three matches . Saggers was rested as Tallon returned for the following match against the South of England . Tallon took three catches and conceded 13 byes before the match was washed out when the hosts were dismissed for 298 . 
 Australia 's biggest challenge in the post @-@ Test tour matches was against the Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI . During the last tour in 1938 , this team was effectively a full @-@ strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts . Bradman then fielded a first @-@ choice team ; the only difference from the Fifth Test team was Ian Johnson 's inclusion at the expense of Doug Ring . Saggers was left out as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays . 
 The tour ended with two non @-@ first @-@ class matches against Scotland . In the first match , Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket . Saggers scored only eight in Australia 's 236 and then took two catches , three stumpings and conceded 13 byes in the innings victory . In the second match in Aberdeen , Saggers was rested as Australia completed another innings win .

 The reserve wicket @-@ keeper , Saggers played in 17 first @-@ class matches and scored 209 runs at an average of 23 @.@ 22 , including a career high score of 104 not out against Essex , 23 catches and 20 stumpings , also career records for one season . This compared with the first @-@ choice gloveman Tallon , who scored 283 runs at 25 @.@ 72 . In all his matches on tour , Tallon missed 249 byes as Australia conceded 5331 runs , a bye percentage of 4 @.@ 67 % . In contrast , Saggers conceded 221 byes from the 6190 runs scored against Australia when he was behind the stumps , a percentage of 3 @.@ 57 % .N- In his 1950 book Farewell to cricket , Bradman said of Saggers , " [ he ] had not quite the speed or agility of Tallon but could always be relied on for a solid performance . A most polished and unostentatious player . " 
 During the tour , Saggers had few opportunities with the bat , generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10 , N- because Australia 's frontline bowlers included the likes of Ray Lindwall , Colin McCool , Ian Johnson and Doug Ring , who were all capable batsmen . Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career , while McCool scored 18 first @-@ class centuries , one in Tests . Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first @-@ class level . As a result , many of the bowlers batted before he did . As Australia often won by an innings , and declared in the first innings on many occasions , Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first @-@ class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed .

Reviewers generally felt that the game was a faithful adaptation of the OutRun 2 series of games . The upgraded high definition graphics were also lauded . Critics felt that the game was worth the price , however , some felt that the amount of available content was lacking considering the cars and stages available in the series ' other titles .

 In OutRun Online Arcade , the player navigates a car from a rear third @-@ person perspective to race through a selection of fifteen stages . At the end of each stage , the player is presented with a fork in the road that allows the player to choose one of two stages . The left route presents an easier stage , while the right provides a greater challenge . The game times the player 's performance , and passing through checkpoints award the player with extra time . Once the timer reaches zero or the player completes the race , the game ends . 
 OutRun Online Arcade features four modes of play : OutRun , Time Attack , Continuous Race , and Heart Attack . In OutRun mode , the player drives through five of fifteen stages , selecting them en route . The Continuous mode is similar to OutRun mode , but instead the player must drive through all fifteen stages . As in previous games in the series , there is a time limit that is extended upon passing checkpoints . Time Attack mode has the player race a ghost car over a pre @-@ selected set of stages while timed . Time checks are presented to the player at various points on each stage . 
 Heart Attack mode is an expansion on OutRun mode . In addition to attempting to complete certain stages , a passenger riding in the player 's vehicle will frequently request certain stunts and actions . These requests can include passing cars , drifting around bends , driving through marked lanes , knocking over cones , and avoiding crashes into objects for as long as possible . If successful , the player receives hearts from the passenger . Crashing into the scenery results in the player losing hearts . At the end of each section and stage , the player is graded based on the number of hearts received . Should the player reach a goal with a satisfying grade , a romantic ending is displayed . 
 Players can also compete in multiplayer races with up to six players . The hosting player can adjust options for the race , including the ability to toggle vehicle collisions , give a speed boost to allow slower players to catch up , and set the vehicle performance to normal or tuned . Online leaderboards are also present in the game , divided by game mode , vehicle performance setting , and driving stage .

 Partially based on OutRun 2006 : Coast 2 Coast , the game contains the fifteen courses from OutRun 2 SP and ten officially licensed Ferraris . OutRun Online Arcade also supports online head @-@ to @-@ head play for six players , as well as high definition graphics . To promote the game , Sega Europe held a contest in which the winner of a race would receive a trip to Maranello , Italy , where Ferraris are manufactured . The game was released on for the Xbox 360 on April 15 , 2009 , and was part of Microsoft 's Days Of Arcade promotion . The PlayStation 3 release followed on April 16 , 2009 , exclusive to the European region . 
 The release was prior to Microsoft 's raising of the maximum size of Xbox Live Arcade titles to 2 gigabytes , which would happen later that fall . Because of this , developer Sumo Digital had only 350 megabytes in which to fit the game . In order to fit the game into the size restrictions , several elements of OutRun 2006 : Coast 2 Coast were removed from the game , including the fifteen original OutRun 2 stages , several cars , and the player 's choice of a passenger . Reviewers speculated that the developer would release additional content , bringing some of the lost content back as downloadable content . However , to date no downloadable content has been released . The game was removed from the PlayStation Network in October 2010 , with the Xbox Live Arcade version being scheduled for removal in December 2011 . Sega explained that the removal of the title was due to " the expiry of the contract with Ferrari . "

Game Revolution called OutRun Online Arcade " one of the better @-@ looking 3D games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network , " citing graphical improvements to the cars in addition to the new lens flare and light bloom features . 
 Some reviewers complained of faulty multiplayer components .

 Air Commodore Gordon Henry Steege , DSO , DFC ( 31 October 1917 – 1 September 2013 ) was a senior officer in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . He became a fighter ace in World War II , credited with eight aerial victories . Joining the RAAF in July 1937 , Steege first saw action with No. 3 Squadron in the Middle East , where he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after shooting down three German aircraft in a single sortie . He rose to command No. 450 Squadron in the Desert Air Force , before being posted to the South West Pacific , where he led Nos. 73 and 81 Wings . He earned the Distinguished Service Order for his " outstanding leadership " , and finished the war a temporary group captain . 
 Resigning his commission following the end of World War II , Steege rejoined the RAAF during the Korean War , and briefly took command of No. 77 Squadron late in 1951 . Returning to Australia , he held senior administrative and training posts before taking charge of RAAF Base Canberra in 1957 . In the 1960s he was appointed to various planning positions , followed by command of RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , and later RAAF Base Butterworth , Malaysia . Having been raised to air commodore , his final appointment before retiring in 1972 was on the staff of Headquarters Operational Command ( now Air Command ) at RAAF Base Glenbrook , New South Wales . He subsequently became an aeronautical consultant , and died in Sydney in 2013 , aged 95 .

 The son of William and Ida Steege , Gordon Henry Steege was born in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood on 31 October 1917 , and educated at North Sydney Boys High School . He recalled having always been interested in a military career , applying unsuccessfully to enter the Royal Australian Navy when he was twelve , and the Royal Military College , Duntroon , after he left school and started working with the Perpetual Trustee Company . On 21 July 1937 , he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , undergoing flight instruction at No. 1 Flying Training School in Point Cook , Victoria . He graduated with a distinguished pass on 23 June 1938 , and was commissioned a pilot officer . His first posting was to No. 3 ( Army Cooperation ) Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond , New South Wales , flying Hawker Demon biplane fighters . Steege and the squadron participated in several exercises with the Australian Army , undertaking reconnaissance , spotting for artillery , and practising ground @-@ attack missions . He was promoted to flying officer in December 1938 .

 Following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , Steege was appointed adjutant of the newly formed No. 11 Squadron , which initially operated two Short Type C flying boats requisitioned from Qantas Empire Airways . Half of the squadron 's personnel were Qantas employees . On 25 September , No. 11 Squadron became the RAAF 's first unit to be based in Papua New Guinea , when the flying boats , accompanied by Steege in a De Havilland Dragon Rapide , flew to Port Moresby to undertake maritime reconnaissance in the region .

 Steege returned to No. 3 Squadron in May 1940 , was promoted to flight lieutenant the following month , and shipped out to the Middle East with his unit on 15 July . Piloting a Gloster Gladiator biplane , he achieved his first aerial victory in the North African campaign when he shot down an Italian Fiat CR.42 on 10 December 1940 ; he also claimed a " probable " in the same action . Three days later he shared in three more " kills " : two CR.42s and a Savoia @-@ Marchetti <unk> After No. 3 Squadron converted to Hawker Hurricanes , Steege shot down three Junkers Ju 87s in a single sortie near Mersa Matruh on 18 February 1941 , to become his unit 's second ace . Following this exploit , and the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 on 3 April , he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . The recommendation noted his " unfailing courage " , and the award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 11 April . 
 Raised to acting squadron leader , Steege was given command of the newly arrived No. 450 Squadron at Rayak , Lebanon , on 31 May 1941 . The assignment was a challenging one , as the operational requirements of existing forces , and the RAAF Air Board 's insistence on staffing Article XV squadrons such as No. 450 with Australian Empire Air Training Scheme aircrew rather than Permanent Air Force members , meant that the unit was short of experienced pilots . Steege was mentioned in despatches on 24 September 1941 for his leadership of the squadron . By December , it was at nominal strength and equipped with P @-@ 40 Kittyhawks ; it commenced combat operations out of Gambut and El Adem , Libya , and began registering victories in February 1942 . Steege himself scored a confirmed victory over a Messerschmitt Bf 109 on 28 March . His final tally in the Middle Eastern theatre was eight enemy aircraft destroyed , two probables and five damaged . He returned to Australia a temporary wing commander in December 1942 .

 Steege undertook a fighter sector course in January 1943 , and was given command of No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters in Brisbane . As a result , he later contended , of his petitioning Eastern Area Command for reassignment to combat duties and complaining to Group Officer Clare Stevenson that there were too many <unk> in the sector for an unmarried man to supervise , he was posted to command No. 14 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters at Camden , New South Wales , on 23 May . The following month , the unit deployed to Goodenough Island in New Guinea as part of No. 71 ( Fighter ) Wing , becoming operational on 27 June . In August it moved to Kiriwina , under the aegis of No. 73 ( Fighter ) Wing . Steege relinquished command on 1 October to take charge of No. 73 Wing . The wing 's combat units consisted of two P @-@ 40 Kittyhawk squadrons and a Supermarine Spitfire squadron . As part of the build @-@ up to the Battle of Arawe in December , the Kittyhawks launched a series of assaults on Gasmata ; three days before the Allied landings , Steege personally led a force of thirty @-@ four aircraft in a bombing and strafing attack on the town 's landing strip . In January 1944 , the wing took part in the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time , each involving over seventy aircraft attacking enemy camps and depots at Lindenhafen , New Britain . Steege was promoted acting group captain the following month ; the rank was made temporary in July . 
 As part of the RAAF 's contribution to the Admiralty Islands campaign , Steege led No. 73 Wing on garrison duty at Los Negros , commencing in March 1944 . The wing 's combat squadrons — Nos. 76 , 77 and 79 — were supported by No. 49 Operational Base Unit , No. 114 Mobile Fighter Sector ( formerly No. 14 Mobile Fighter Sector ) , No. 27 Air Stores Park and No. 26 Medical Clearing Station , among other ancillaries . The fighters ' main duty was providing cover for Allied shipping ; they also carried out bomber escort , ground attack and anti @-@ shipping missions . In mid @-@ April , the wing escorted the largest Allied convoy in the South West Pacific to that date , 80 ships carrying 30 @,@ 000 personnel , from Finschhafen to Aitape . On 11 April , Steege was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his " outstanding leadership in aerial combat in New Guinea " . Completing their garrison work in the Admiralties that June , No. 73 Wing 's Kittyhawk units were transferred to No. 81 ( Fighter ) Wing on Noemfoor under Steege 's command . In September 1944 , No. 81 Wing became part of No. 10 Operational Group , which was renamed the Australian First Tactical Air Force the following month . During October and November , No. 81 Wing undertook offensive sweeps and ground attacks against targets in West Papua , and dive bombed Japanese airfields on Halmahera . Steege handed over command of the wing to Group Captain Wilf Arthur in December 1944 . In January 1945 , Steege became senior air staff officer ( SASO ) at Eastern Area Command in Sydney .

 Steege married Joan Tait on 5 January 1946 ; they had a son and a daughter . He was appointed RAAF Director of Operations in February . In December 1946 , he resigned from the RAAF , joining the New Guinea Administration as a patrol officer the next month . He rejoined the Air Force as a wing commander on the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 . The following month , he accompanied Major General William Bridgeford 's mission to Malaya . Steege assumed command of RAAF Station Schofields , New South Wales , in September 1950 , and commenced a jet training course at RAAF Station Williamtown early the next year . On 16 August 1951 , he was posted to Kimpo , South Korea , as commander of No. 77 Squadron , shortly after its conversion from P @-@ 51 Mustang piston @-@ engined fighters to Gloster Meteor jets . One of his first actions , following discussions with the US Fifth Air Force , was to take the Australian unit out of its then @-@ current air @-@ to @-@ air combat role , and curtail its operations in " MiG Alley " . Two encounters between No. 77 Squadron and Chinese MiG @-@ 15s had convinced Steege that the straight @-@ winged Meteors were outclassed as fighters by the swept @-@ wing MiGs . His decision caused controversy as some UN commanders believed that proper training and tactics would have allowed the Meteor to remain competitive as a fighter , while for the Australian pilots the change of role amounted to a loss of prestige . However , Steege was backed up by the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Marshal George Jones , and the squadron was relegated mainly to escort duty and local air defence . Morale suffered and it was not until after Steege 's departure on 26 December that a suitable offensive role was again found for the Meteors , namely ground attack . 
 After returning to Australia , Steege was appointed chief instructor at the School of Land / Air Warfare , Williamtown , in February 1952 . He was attached to the Department of Air in Canberra for two years beginning in August 1953 , holding secretarial posts on the Chiefs of Staff Committee , Joint Planning Committee , and Defence Committee . After serving on the staff of Headquarters Training Command from August 1955 to May 1957 , he took command of RAAF Base Canberra , Australian Capital Territory . At this time No. 86 Wing , operating Douglas Dakotas and Convair 440 <unk> , was located at Canberra , in part to satisfy the Federal government 's VIP transport needs . Steege was promoted to acting group captain in May 1958 ( substantive two months later ) , before becoming a senior planner at the SEATO Military Planning Office , Bangkok , in December 1958 . He returned to the Department of Air in December 1961 , where he rose to Director of Plans . Promoted to air commodore , he was appointed Officer Commanding ( OC ) RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , in November 1964 . Amberley was home to the RAAF 's bomber headquarters , No. 82 Wing , which operated English Electric Canberra jets . In May 1967 , Steege became OC RAAF Base Butterworth , Malaysia . The RAAF maintained two squadrons of fighters at Butterworth : No. 75 Squadron flying Dassault Mirages , and also No. 77 Squadron flying CAC Sabres until 1969 , and the Mirage @-@ equipped No. 3 Squadron after that . Returning to Australia , Steege served as SASO with Headquarters Operational Command ( now Air Command ) at RAAF Base Glenbrook , New South Wales , from May 1970 until retiring from the Air Force on 31 October 1972 .

 After leaving the RAAF , Steege served as a consultant to several aerospace defence firms . In 2004 , he married Jennifer Fisher , his partner since 1987 . He maintained his connection with No. 450 Squadron in his later years . As a guest at the 1994 RAAF History Conference in Canberra he spoke at length on the difficulties of establishing the unit in the Middle East in 1941 . He became patron of the squadron association in April 2008 . In 2010 , he joined three fellow members of No. 3 Squadron who shipped out to the Middle East on 15 July 1940 for the 70th anniversary commemoration of the event at RAAF Base Richmond . Steege made his home in Palm Beach , New South Wales , and died on 1 September 2013 , aged 95 . He was survived by his second wife , son and stepdaughter .
