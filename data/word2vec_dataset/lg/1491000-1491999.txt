 The producers for the show ran into issues with the legality of a circus animal in public streets . Several laws had been passed in British Columbia that prohibited the " use or appearance " of these animals as a way to protect them from abuse or exploitation . In order to circumvent these rules , scenes filmed with Bubbles took place " on a quiet country road " in South Surrey , where these laws were not in effect . A live tiger was also used for the episode . The biggest hurdle when filming was keeping the tiger " calm and warm " , due to the cool nature of Vancouver . The episode 's title comes from a line in the William Blake poem " The Tyger " . The fictional construction site where the tiger appears , " Blake Towers " , is named after the poet . The elephant 's name , " Ganesha " is named after the Hindu God . 
 Parts of the Zoo featured in " Fearful Symmetry " were shot on location at the Vancouver Aquarium located in Stanley Park , Vancouver .

 " Fearful Symmetry " was first broadcast in the United States on February 24 , 1995 , on the Fox network . In its original broadcast , it was watched by 9 @.@ 6 million households , according to the Nielsen ratings system . It received a 10 @.@ 1 rating / 17 share among viewers meaning that 10 @.@ 1 percent of all households in the United States , and 17 percent of all people watching television at the time , viewed the episode . The episode later won an EMA Award for its environmental message . 
 The episode received mostly mixed reviews from critics . Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a C , writing , " Aside from a well @-@ executed invisible @-@ elephant rampage , this one 's pretty much on automatic pilot " . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also graded it as a C , calling it " forgettable , and under @-@ baked ; not terrible enough to be a complete failure , but forgettable enough " . John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10 . He wrote , " Overall , this episode felt more like a statement by the writer regarding animal rights than an episode of [ The X @-@ Files ] . The plot doesn ’ t seem to know which direction it wants to explore , and ultimately , elements of the episode contradict each other . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two stars out of five . The two wrote that , despite the episode having " rare anger " and a " genuine passion behind " its conservation message , the entry was not " a very good story " . Shearman and Pearson called the plot " so confusing that all that impact [ of the teaser ] soon dissipates . " 
 = Briarcliff Lodge = 
 The Briarcliff Lodge was a luxury resort in the village of Briarcliff Manor , New York . It was a notable example of Tudor Revival architecture , and was one of the largest wooden structures in the United States . It was also the first hotel in Westchester County . Walter William Law had it built on his estate , and the Law family owned it until 1937 . When the lodge opened in 1902 , it was one of the largest resort hotels in the world . The lodge hosted presidents , royalty , and celebrities , and was the scene of numerous memorable occasions for visitors and local residents who attended weddings , receptions , and dances in the ballroom and dining room . For a long time , the lodge was situated among other businesses of Walter Law , including the Briarcliff Farms and Briarcliff Table Water Company . 
 In 1933 , the lodge ended year @-@ round service and housed a " health @-@ diet sanitarium " until the Edgewood Park School for Girls began operation there from 1937 to 1954 . From 1936 to 1939 , the lodge was run again as a hotel in the summer months while the school was closed . From 1955 to 1994 , The King 's College used the lodge building and built dormitories and academic buildings . Abandoned and unmaintained after 1994 , the Briarcliff Lodge was destroyed between 2003 and 2004 .

 Walter Law hired Pennsylvania architect Guy King to construct the Briarcliff Lodge on the highest point of Law 's estate . At its June 26 , 1902 opening , the Tudor Revival @-@ style building was a premier resort hotel with 93 rooms . The Olmsted Brothers , sons of the eminent landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted , designed the lodge 's surrounding grounds , including a large hillside landscape garden with shady walks , winding drives , green lawns , and flowers . In 1903 , the lodge additionally began being used by Mary Elizabeth Dow as Mrs. Dow 's School . Walter Law gave Dow a 35 @-@ acre ( 14 ha ) property on Elm Road ( later the site of Briarcliff College and then a Pace University campus ) . 
 In 1907 , John Clark Udall oversaw construction of a north wing , increasing the number of rooms to 150 . In 1909 , Udall oversaw a 72 @-@ room seven @-@ story west wing , further increasing the rooms to 221 . In Germany , it was advertised in January 1909 that the management of the Briarcliff Lodge and its architect Guy King planned to construct the platform to launch and dock airships , to cost $ 100 @,@ 000 . The platform would extend over the whole roof , and the tracks for the airship launch would be on an incline 105 meters long . The plans also included the purchase of a searchlight to guide the airships . A mooring mast for docking airships was constructed on top of the west wing , however no record exists of it having been used . The mooring mast nonetheless was the first built for docking airships . 
 There were two sets of greenhouses near the property ; one set behind Law 's home produced decorations for Law 's Briarcliff Farms , his house , the lodge , and workers ' houses . The other set , the Pierson Greenhouses , were used for growing the American Beauty rose and rare carnations , producing between 5 @,@ 000 and 8 @,@ 000 per week . Foreman George Romaine first propagated the Briarcliff rose there . The lodge also ran an annual American Beauty carnival , with events including a golf tournament , water sports , moonlight bathing and night diving , a dinner dance , cinema program , and a concert . During the lodge 's service , carriage transportation was provided for guests from the Scarborough and Briarcliff Manor train stations to the lodge . 
 The lodge had a large Roman @-@ style pool ; when it was built in 1912 , it was the largest outdoor pool in the world and was used for the 1924 Olympic trials . The Briarcliff Lodge was noted for its cuisine ( including Briarcliff dairy and table water ) , a golf course , fifteen tennis courts , a music room , theater , indoor swimming pool ( measuring 30 by 70 feet , with a depth of 4 to 10 feet ) , casino , library , stable , repair shops and a fleet of Fiat automobiles . The water tower at the property was constructed by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Company . The grounds were decorated with Japanese lanterns that Law had obtained from missionaries . The lodge had elevator service and electric lighting . The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace held its National Conference on International Problems and Relations at the Briarcliff Lodge from May 10 – 14 , 1926 . 
 In 1923 , a year before Walter Law 's death , the Law family leased the lodge to Chauncey Depew Steele for 20 years . Under Steele 's management , the lodge reached its prominence . The lodge also was opened to a wider variety of clientele , but continued to be known as a resort for the wealthy and famous . A 6 @,@ 500 @-@ yard ( 5 @,@ 900 m ) 18 @-@ hole golf course was completed in 1923 , designed by Devereux Emmet . In May 1925 , The New York Times reported that the Briarcliff Lodge installed the first artificial spa ; using radioactive mineral torbernite to affect the water , believed to counter ailments associated with old age . United States Senators Chauncey Depew , James Wolcott Wadsworth , Jr . , and Royal S. Copeland were to each place a bag containing the minerals into the lodge 's swimming pool . In June of that year , the newspaper mentioned in its report of an upcoming Briarcliff Lodge performance that the swimming pool was popular in the summer heat and that " the cool spring radioactive water gave considerable relief to several hundred guests " . 
 = = = Decline and lease = = = 
 The hotel declined during the 1930s . Walter Law 's son Henry ( also village mayor from 1918 to 1938 ) attributed the decline to the 1920 @-@ 1933 prohibition of alcohol . Another factor was the increasing usage of automobiles , as guests would be less inclined to stay throughout the summer . Steele ended up surrendering his lease in 1933 ; at the time the building was valued at $ 750 @,@ 000 ( $ 13 @.@ 7 million in 2015 ) . The lodge remained in use , housing a " health @-@ diet sanitarium " until the Edgewood Park School for Girls , a nonsectarian Christian <unk> and occupational @-@ preparatory school , leased the property in 1936 , and purchased it a year later ; at the time the lodge was valued at $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( $ 16 @.@ 5 million in 2015 ) . The lodge was run as a hotel in the summer months while the school was closed until 1939 . The Edgewood Park School operated there until 1954 . 
 In September 1955 , The New York Times reported that the lodge was being reopened as a 225 @-@ room resort ; after being purchased by a partnership led by Emanuel Shapiro , counsel for then @-@ New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey . It was assessed at $ 400 @,@ 000 ( $ 3 @.@ 53 million in 2015 ) at the time .

 From 1955 to 1994 , The King 's College , a strictly Fundamentalist coeducational liberal arts college , relocated to the Briarcliff Lodge property . The school used the lodge building and built dormitories and academic buildings . During that time , in 1985 , the Lodge and the Briarcliff library were among 60 sites given historical markers by Westchester County Tricentennial Commission . The New York State Board of Regents closed the school in 1994 due to financial difficulties and a deficiency of qualified faculty . The original 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building burned to the ground on September 20 , 2003 shortly before its scheduled demolition , and contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished . 
 The site will be developed as the Club at Briarcliff Manor , what The New York Times has described as " a super @-@ luxury retirement community " , with up to $ 2 million entrance fees . The Club was scheduled to open in 2013 and include tennis courts , a health spa , a Tudor @-@ style clubhouse , gardens , a surround @-@ sound theater , hiking trails , an indoor pool , a business center , a cocktail lounge , and multiple restaurants . As of 2010 , 65 people have put down deposits , although the Club is planned to include 325 residences , including thirteen houses , 24 townhouses , and 288 apartments . Briarcliff Manor 's village government took about five years to grant zoning changes , and several more years to approve the site plan . 
 The King 's College football and soccer field was replaced ( with a cost of $ 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 0000 ) and transferred to the village government around 2013 . The water tower will be replaced with a hydro @-@ pneumatic pump station ( with a cost of $ 850 @,@ 000 ) .

 The Briarcliff Lodge was located on a 184 @-@ acre ( 74 ha ) site on the highest point of Law 's estate . The original wing was designed by Pennsylvania architect Guy King , on the highest point of Walter Law 's estate , which was about 600 feet above sea level and 29 miles ( 47 km ) north of New York City . The building 's first floor exterior walls were constructed of stones from nearby forests , and Indiana limestone was used for <unk> the second floor exterior walls were decorated with richly colored half timber and <unk> . The roof had red shingles and tall red brick chimneys . The main facade of the building was two stories high , while the third and fourth floor had many gables and dormer windows present on the roof . The overall design of the building was in the Tudor Revival @-@ style , and was described to be in " the fashion of the old English inns " . The building was 307 feet ( 94 m ) long and had 93 rooms . Each room had Colonial mahogany furniture , a long @-@ distance telephone , concealed fire escape , electric lights , and suction ventilators . As well , each room had an exterior wall with a window . 
 In 1902 , the hotel 's first floor held its reception rooms , parlors , dining rooms , library , and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen , which had decorations and furnishings from Holland . Furniture was purchased from Law 's former employer W. & J. Sloane . Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets in Europe and Asia , and included expensive paintings , bronzes , marble sculptures , rare books , and carved antique furniture . The hotel also had a Chinese tea room and a dark room for amateur photographers . The kitchen was kept clean ( such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen ) . It was reported to be of elegant design , utilizing white tile and marble . The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum , and included numerous glass @-@ lined refrigerators . It sourced its milk , butter , eggs , and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms . The kitchen 's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal ; the lodge also had an ice @-@ producing plant that used sterilized well water . 
 John Clark Udall oversaw construction of the north wing in 1907 , increasing the number of rooms to 150 . In 1909 , Udall oversaw a 72 @-@ room seven @-@ story west wing , further increasing the rooms to 221 .

 In its first operating year , a stable was built for the lodge , at the lodge 's south driveway about 100 yards from Scarborough Road . In 1909 an addition was built ( of 62 by 126 feet ) and the entire structure became used for an automobile garage . The interior of the old stable was replaced . The east end held a commercial kitchen , dining room , and a billiard and smoking room . The west end held a repair shop . The front of the building held supply rooms , closets , and an office .

In 1930 , Franklin spoke there as New York Governor to the Westchester County Bankers Association . 
 John W. Davis , US Representative and nominee for President against Calvin Coolidge , visited the lodge in 1924 . US Senator Chauncey Depew visited in 1924 and 1927 . Composer and pianist Percy Grainger gave a recital at the ballroom of the lodge in 1925 . 
 The final German emperor Wilhelm II 's son Crown Prince Wilhelm was a guest at the Lodge for the 1909 Hudson @-@ Fulton Celebration . He led a Prussian regiment in a parade of fifty floats held in honor of the celebration in New York . 
 Other notable guests have included Thomas Edison , Tallulah Bankhead , Sarah Bernhardt , Boris <unk> , Johnny Weissmuller , Jimmy Walker , Babe Ruth , Edward S. Curtis , George B. Cortelyou , Mary Pickford , F. W. Woolworth , J. P. Morgan , Warner Baxter , Vincent Richards , and Ernestine Schumann @-@ Heink . Elihu Root , Al Smith , and a king of Siam were guests at the lodge in the 1920s , and John Campbell frequently hosted parties there .

 In 1906 , Walter Law replaced the Briarcliff Manor railroad station and moved the original building to serve as Millwood 's station . The new Briarcliff station , now part of the village library , was modeled in the style of his Briarcliff Lodge , and had Mission style furniture , rugs , and flowers decorating the interior . Central Briarcliff West is a neighborhood which has a number of mansions built by 20th @-@ century millionaires who stayed at the Briarcliff Lodge and later built estates in the area . The Seven Sisters , a 1915 production , was filmed at the Briarcliff Lodge . 
 = Cold @-@ core low = 
 A cold @-@ core low , also known as an upper level low or cold @-@ core cyclone , is a cyclone aloft which has an associated cold pool of air residing at high altitude within the Earth 's troposphere . It is a low pressure system which strengthens with height in accordance with the thermal wind relationship . These systems can be referred to as upper level lows . If a weak surface circulation forms in response to such a feature at subtropical latitudes of the eastern north Pacific or north Indian oceans , it is called a subtropical cyclone . Cloud cover and rainfall mainly occurs with these systems during the day . Severe weather , such as tornadoes , can occur near the center of cold @-@ core lows . Cold lows can help spawn cyclones with significant weather impacts , such as polar lows , and Von Karman Vortices . In regard to tropical cyclones , cold lows can lead directly to their development due to their associated cold pool of air aloft or by acting as additional outflow channels to aid in further development . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Cold cyclones are stronger aloft than at the Earth 's surface , or stronger in areas of the troposphere with lower pressures , per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation . The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces , which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness , and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation , the wind increases with height . It also means that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature . Because of its cold center , the center shows an area of thickness minimum . Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient , and therefore the wind , it is barotropic in nature . The movement of cold @-@ core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies , which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east . 
 Most cloud cover and precipitation in association with cold lows occurs during the daylight hours as sunlight warms the Earth 's surface , destabilizing the atmosphere and causing upward vertical motion . The development of severe weather , particularly tornadoes , can occur near the center of these systems over land during any season of the year . During winter , when cold @-@ core lows with temperatures in the mid @-@ levels of the troposphere reach − 45 ° C ( − 49 ° F ) move over open waters , deep convection forms which allows polar low development to become possible . 
 = = Importance to cyclones within the subtropics and mid @-@ latitudes = = 
 Kona lows , most extratropical cyclones , and tropical upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows . In the eastern half of the north Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean , the formation of a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper @-@ tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season ( winter ) is called a subtropical cyclone . In the case of the north Indian ocean , the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season . 
 East coast lows form near and east of where a cold core low interacts with a sea surface temperature ( SST ) gradient along the east coast of continents , such as Asia , North America , southern Africa , and Australia within a pre @-@ existing area of high pressure . Those offshore the East Coast of the United States , which normally form in the months between October and April , are termed nor 'easters . Not initially associated with weather fronts , they form in tandem with blocking anticyclones at higher latitudes , which leads to a slow poleward movement up the SST gradient . East coast lows can persist for up to a week . Some East coast lows develop rapidly , becoming meteorological bombs . There is a 4 @.@ 5 year cycle in the formation of East coast lows near Australia , in years in transition between warm ( El Niño ) and cold ( La Niña ) ENSO years . These systems can develop strong wind , heavy rains , waves over 10 metres ( 33 ft ) in height , and eye features on weather satellite imagery . 
 = = Importance to tropical cyclones = = 
 The summer tropical upper tropospheric trough in the Southern Hemisphere lies over the trade wind region of the east central Pacific and can cause tropical cyclogenesis offshore Central America . In the western Pacific , tropical upper tropospheric lows are the main cause for the few tropical cyclones which develop north of the 20th parallel north and east of the 160th meridian east during La Niña events . 
 Trailing upper cyclones and upper troughs can cause additional outflow channels and aid in the intensification process of tropical cyclones . Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet stream emanating from the developing tropical disturbance / cyclone . In the western North Pacific , there are strong reciprocal relationships between the areas of formative tropical cyclones and that of the lower tropospheric monsoon troughs and the tropical upper tropospheric trough . Tropical cyclone movement can also be influenced by TUTT cells within 1 @,@ 700 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 100 mi ) of their position , which can lead to non @-@ climatological tracks , such as eastward movement within the tropics or westward movement in an area where the Westerlies normally dominate . 
 Normally , an ocean temperature of 26 @.@ 5 ° C ( 79 @.@ 7 ° F ) spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres ( 160 ft ) is one of the six requirements needed to maintain the special mesocyclone that is the tropical cyclone . Cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude ( e.g. , at the 500 hPa level , or 5 @.@ 9 km ) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures than normal , as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection . In a moist atmosphere , this lapse rate is 6 @.@ 5 ° C / km ( 19 ° F / mi ) , while in an atmosphere with less than 100 % relative humidity , the required lapse rate is 9 @.@ 8 ° C / km ( 29 ° F / mi ) . A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Alex of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season , which became a hurricane over waters at only 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) . 
 At the 500 hPa level , the air temperature averages -7 ° C ( 18 ° F ) within the tropics , but air in the tropics is normally dry at this level , giving the air room to wet @-@ bulb , or cool as it moistens , to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection . A wetbulb temperature at 500 hPa in a tropical atmosphere of − 13 @.@ 2 ° C ( 8 @.@ 2 ° F ) is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26 @.@ 5 ° C ( 79 @.@ 7 ° F ) , and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 ° C in the sea surface temperature for each 1 ° C change at 500 hpa . Under a cold cyclone , 500 hPa temperatures can fall as low as − 30 ° C ( − 22 ° F ) , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres . This also explains why moisture in the mid @-@ levels of the troposphere , roughly at the 500 hPa level , is normally a requirement for development . However , when dry air is found at the same height , temperatures at 500 hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres . At heights near the tropopause , the 30 @-@ year average temperature ( as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990 ) was <unk> ° C ( <unk> ° F ) . 
 = Southcote , Berkshire = 
 Southcote ( / <unk> / ) is a suburb of Reading in the English county of Berkshire . Located to the south @-@ west of Reading town centre , Southcote has a population of about 8 @,@ 500 ( as of 2011 ) . The settlement lies primarily between the London @-@ to @-@ Bath road and the River Kennet . 
 The area was sparsely populated until after the Second World War , though excavations have revealed evidence of Paleolithic and Iron Age activity in Southcote , as well as Roman and Saxon habitation . By the time William the Conqueror undertook the Domesday Survey in 1086 , Southcote was sufficiently established to warrant a Lord of the Manor , who at that time was William de Braose . From the 16th century onwards , Southcote Manor was owned by the Blagrave family , who sold the manor house in the 1920s . The area was subsequently developed into housing : much of the land changed from agricultural to residential . A large proportion of the land in Southcote not used for housing is classified as flood @-@ meadow , providing flood plains between urbanisation and the River Kennet . 
 Southcote forms an electoral ward in Reading . The area is seen as a safe seat for Labour , as the Conservatives have not held a seat on the council since the 1980s . 
 Residents of Southcote generally self @-@ classify as Christian . The male life expectancy in the area is lower than the national estimate , although the female expectancy is slightly higher . Claimants of out @-@ of @-@ work benefits ( such as Jobseeker 's Allowance ) are more prevalent in Southcote than in surrounding areas . Attainment in education in Southcote is lower than the Reading average , as is residents ' self @-@ evaluation of health . 
 Near to the settlement is Southcote Junction , where two branches from the Great Western Main Line diverge : the Reading to Taunton line and the Reading to Basingstoke line . The railways were preceded by the Kennet and Avon Canal , which passes south of the settlement . Southcote lends its name to the 104th lock on the canal .

 Recorded in the Domesday Book as <unk> , Southcote has also been referred to as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , with the present spelling entering usage in the 15th century . Alternative spellings of <unk> and Southcott have also been used . 
 The name " Southcote " , comparable to that of neighbouring Norcot , originates from the Old English " <unk> cote " , meaning " south [ ern ] cottage " . It is likely that Circuit Lane , one of the primary roads into Southcote , derives its name from " <unk> Lane " , a corruption of " Southcote Lane " . A similar development of names occurred at <unk> Manor near <unk> , Oxfordshire . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Lower Paleolithic and Palaeolithic materials have been recovered in various excavations in the Southcote area . An Iron Age occupation was located when houses were constructed in the 20th century . A Saxon urn was found in Southcote in 1924 . The urn contained ashes and bone fragments , and was given to the Museum of Reading . A polished stone <unk> was also found in Southcote in 1926 . An excavation of Southcote Manor in the 1960s uncovered many Roman , Romano @-@ British and medieval artefacts such as sherds and pottery ; a sample of the latter was discovered to have originated in Oxford in the 2nd century . Similarly , a Pannonian brooch and samian ware have been found in the area , and Roman pottery was found in the vicinity of the clay pits at Prospect Park Brick Works . Later inhabitation of Southcote was discovered at Anslow 's Cottages south of the Kennet , where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made on a branch of the river . A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England — now known as English Heritage — detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow 's Cottages , showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote . Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century . Later discoveries , made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area , also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the river channel .

 The settlement of Southcote grew largely around the medieval house at Southcote Manor . Before the Norman Conquest , Southcote was held by <unk> — a Saxon landowner and priest — under Edward the Confessor . The settlement was documented in the Domesday Book as <unk> with a total population of 13 households , consisting of five villagers and eight smallholders , though a manor house is not mentioned . At this time Southcote was mostly ploughlands , but had a mill and a fishery , and was valued at £ 5 . The Lord of the Manor at the time was William de Braose , 1st Lord of Bramber . In the early 1200s a house was built and Southcote was owned by Henry Belet . This house had two moats , supplied with water by a channel from the nearby Holy Brook . Upon Henry 's death the estate was inherited by his son Michael , who was cup @-@ bearer to Henry II . In 1337 , a grant of free warren was made to the Belet family for the manor . In 1365 the manor and 13th @-@ century moated house passed into the <unk> family , and it passed through marriage to the Drew family of <unk> , Wiltshire , then the Sambourne family . Margaret Sambourne , the heir to the manor , died in 1494 and an inquisition the following year suggested that she held the manor ( then valued at £ 20 ) as a trustee on behalf of Hugh <unk> . Around this time a brick house was built to replace the earlier dwelling . After the death of Sambourne 's son , Drew , an inquisition reported in contradiction that the manor was held by the Abbot of Reading ; in their work on the Berkshire section of Victoria County History , Peter Ditchfield and William Henry Page write that at this point " the correct tenure had evidently been lost " . Through Drew Sambourne 's granddaughter , Margaret , the manor passed through marriage to William Windsor , 2nd Baron Windsor . William 's grandson , Henry ( 5th Baron Windsor ) , sold the manor to Anthony Blagrave by the early 16th century . 
 = = = 16th century – 19th century = = = 
 The Blagrave family were wealthy landowners around Reading , and the manor passed down through the family ( which included mathematician John Blagrave , who built a new house at Southcote ) ; a lease document dated from 1596 suggests that the manor was divided between three Blagrave brothers . Daniel Blagrave , a cousin of John , inherited the manor on the latter 's death in 1611 . At the time of the English Civil War , during the Siege of Reading in 1643 , the <unk> allowed Robert Devereux , 3rd Earl of Essex to use the manor as his headquarters . The Blagrave family , who were sympathetic to the Roundheads , are said to have hosted Oliver Cromwell , John Hampden and Robert Blake for a council of war in one of the house 's oak panelled rooms . In January 1649 , Daniel was one of the signatories of Charles I 's death warrant . 
 In 1665 Elias Ashmole wrote to Mervyn <unk> , 4th Earl of <unk> at " Southcote neere Redding " . At some point that century the manor house was largely rebuilt and modernised ; the existing 15th century guardhouse and vaulted well were retained . Come the Restoration in 1660 after the end of the war , Daniel fled from England and died in Aix @-@ la @-@ Chapelle in 1668 . Southcote saw development with the opening of the Kennet Navigation in the 1720s , where the River Kennet was made navigable by vessels as far upstream as Newbury ; industrialisation along the canal continued for the next century . 
 Throughout the 18th century the manor continued to pass through the Blagrave family , including John Blagrave MP . In 1778 , Frances Blagrave married John Blagrave of <unk> ( Ditchfield and Page suggest that the couple were not related before marriage ) . In 1813 , Daniel and Samuel Lysons wrote that the manor and mansion house were unoccupied but remained the property of the Blagrave family , who at that point resided at nearby Calcot Park . The same year , Calvespit House ( near Calvespit Farm to the west of Southcote Manor ) was renamed Southcott Lodge and incorporated into the estate . Between 1828 and 1850 the house was let to Charles and Frances Lutyens , whose son Charles was born at the house and who later fathered the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens . 
 Southcote was mentioned in Samuel Lewis 's 1835 Topographical Dictionary of England . It was described as a <unk> within the parish of St Mary 's , Reading , and had a population of 84 . 
 In 1847 , the Reading to Taunton branch of the Great Western Main Line was built through Southcote . The following year the Reading to Basingstoke line opened to the east of Southcote ; the railways diverging at Southcote Junction . Two years later , in 1850 , a water pumping station was built alongside the Kennet and Avon Canal at to Southcote Lock . The facility , owned by the Reading Corporation , was connected to the Bath Road Reservoir ( 1 @.@ 1 miles ( 1 @.@ 8 km ) north @-@ east ) and provided Reading with a source of water that originated upstream of any pollutants from the town . 
 In 1860 the occupant was Louisa Mundy , widow of Lieutenant Governor of Jersey Godfrey Mundy . Louisa was the niece of Henry Herbert , 2nd Earl of Carnarvon , and lived at Southcote with her sons Herbert and Cyril . By this time , Southcote had expanded to a population of 87 , with 14 houses . In his Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales , John Marius Wilson stated that the real property of Southcote was valued at £ 608 . 
 After the <unk> ' tenure , Southcote Manor was let to the Brisco ( or Briscoe ) family , who had made their money in slave trading and plantation ownership . The family were relatives of Hastings MP Musgrave Brisco and inheritors of the Pryce baronetcy . Along with one of his labourers , <unk> Brisco was taken to court in Reading in 1874 , charged with the " <unk> with intent to <unk> " a 13 @-@ year @-@ old servant girl . During the trial , the Reading Observer reported that " several rumours were in circulation that a person connected with the case had committed suicide " . Brisco supposedly used his wealth and social status to dissuade witnesses from testifying and the case was apparently abandoned . 
 Brisco was eccentric and wealthy , and added a ballroom to the building in 1891 , replacing a timber chapel . He also began construction of the house 's distinctive tower the same year but died before it was complete and building work was abandoned . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 The manor of Southcote remained in the Blagrave family until the early 20th century , when it was owned by Henry Barry Blagrave . Henry died in 1927 , though the manor house was demolished in 1921 after lying empty following the death of <unk> Brisco and his wife Sarah in 1891 and 1901 respectively . In 1920 the house had been purchased by a contractor with intentions to demolish the site , though the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a committee to attempt to raise money to save the house . The Sphere reported that the bricks and oak panelling were in demand and were likely removed for re @-@ use before the building 's demolition . 
 In 1908 Reading Central Goods railway station was opened on the Coley Branch Line diverting at Southcote Junction . During the first few decades of the 20th century , however , most of Southcote remained rural and undeveloped . An Ordnance Survey map of 1914 shows the majority of land as agricultural ( farms and nurseries ) with a number of gravel pits and smithies . The 1930s saw the construction of the Southcote Park Estate , a housing estate built on land inherited after the death of William Berkeley Monck of Coley Park . An Ordnance Survey map of 1938 shows greater provision for the population ( as opposed to industry ) ; some of the gravel pits no longer existed and Presentation College , a boys ' school , had opened in two large Victorian buildings — Rotherfield Grange and Oakland Hall , the latter a suburban villa built in the 1870s . By the advent of World War II , Southcote had begun to experience urban sprawl from Reading and the land bordering the Great Western Railway had begun to be used for housing . Following the war , Denton 's Field on the Bath Road in Southcote was used for celebratory events ; Battle of Britain commemorative fêtes were held in September 1949 and 1950 , and featured a performance by three Alsatians — Rocky , Lindy and Irma — to recognise their work in the war . Denton 's Field gained reputation as a location for outdoor community events , and was comparable to places such as Caversham Park and Palmer Park . 
 In the 1950s , a huge building project centred around Coronation Square ( named for the 1953 Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II ) with hundreds of council houses built to satisfy post @-@ war demand . The residents of many of these had moved from houses in central and east Reading that fell short of sanitation requirements of the Public Health Act 1875 , were compulsorily purchased and later demolished . 
 The gatehouse at Southcote Manor stood until the 1960s , when a fire broke out . It was demolished by 1964 to make way for housing . Reading Central Goods station was closed in 1983 , and with it the branch line from Southcote ceased to operate . Two years later the track bed and sleepers were removed . 
 The same decade a campaign was started to raise £ 1 million to save the decaying mansion in Prospect Park ; in 1986 the building was described as " crumbling " and " likely to be demolished " , though plans existed to convert the building into offices . In the 1990s , however , the building was renovated and re @-@ opened as a restaurant . 
 In 2004 , Presentation College went into administration . It was taken over by the Society of Licensed Victuallers and renamed The <unk> School . The school closed in 2010 . Following its closure , Taylor Wimpey applied to build 193 new homes on the site , competing with a proposal by a community group ( the West Reading Education Network ) to reopen the site as a free school known as the WREN . The housing plan was rejected , but Taylor Wimpey then appealed to Reading Borough Council and submitted a revised plan for 120 homes , which left room for the school . The appeal was taken to the High Court , which ruled that the site should be used solely for education ; the school opened for Year Seven pupils on 7 September 2015 .

 Southcote forms an electoral ward of the Reading West constituency , and has three seats on Reading Borough Council . It is seen as a safe seat for the Labour Party ; the Conservative Party last won a council seat in Southcote in 1987 . The current three councillors are Debs Edwards , John Ellis and Matt Lawrence . The most recent election was held in 2016 , which saw Edwards re @-@ elected . The ward has seen three by @-@ elections : in 2006 , in 2014 when Lawrence was elected following Pete Ruhemann 's death , and in 2016 when Lawrence resigned from <unk> . The seat , which was contested by candidates from Labour , the Liberal Democrats , the Green Party and the <unk> was held by the Labour party who gained 63 @.@ 7 % of votes . 
 Like all wards in Reading , the boundaries of Southcote ward were redrawn in 2004 . The ward holds elections by thirds — three seats are available , and in three years in every four , one seat comes up for election .

 Southcote , as a ward , is bounded to the north by Norcot , to the north @-@ east by Battle , to the east by Minster and to the south @-@ east by Whitley . To the south , south @-@ west and west Southcote forms the boundary between the Reading and West Berkshire . The boundaries of Southcote are formed by Calcot Park to the north @-@ west , the northern edge of Prospect Park to the north , the Reading to Basingstoke railway line to the east and by channels of the River Kennet to the south . The western boundary runs through housing in the Fords Farm area . Beyond the south @-@ west and western boundaries , in West Berkshire , are the wards of Burghfield and Calcot . 
 Less formally , Southcote is bordered by the settlements of Horncastle and Fords Farm to the west , Tilehurst to the north , West Reading to the north east , Coley to the east , Whitley to the south @-@ east and <unk> to the south . 
 = = = Topography = = = 
 Southcote is bordered to the south by the Holy Brook and the River Kennet ; as such much of the land in the south of the area is floodplain . The proximity of Southcote to the river has led to flooding of roads and residences , particularly during the 2013 – 2014 United Kingdom winter floods . Flooding is exacerbated by the routes of the Holy Brook and railway line ; the railway crosses the stream by bridges and culverts and in some locations the embankment acts as a bund , inhibiting the dissipation of floodwater . Similarly , a report by West Berkshire Council found that during the 2013 – 14 floods the single track road between the Holy Brook and the Kennet at Southcote Mill " acted as a barrier until the rising waters backing up in the flood plain fields finally breached " . Network Rail 's plans for electrification of the Great Western Main Line include provision for flood defences where the line is in proximity to the Holy Brook . 
 The elevation of Southcote ranges from almost 100 metres ( 330 ft ) in the north @-@ west extreme of the ward ( <unk> data records this as 94 metres ( 308 ft ) , Ordnance Survey as 92 metres ( 302 ft ) ) to approximately 37 metres ( 121 ft ) in the floodplains north and south of the Kennet . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 The geology of Southcote includes the Reading Formation — rock strata in the Lambeth Group consisting of clay , silt and sand formed in the Palaeogene period . Bedrock in Southcote is also formed of chalk , with geological surveys also finding flint samples . A map produced by the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1860 identifies the area as being predominantly Plastic Clay ( now known as the Lambeth Group ) and chalk north of the river , with flint and gravel samples typical of the Bagshot Formation south of the Kennet . More specifically , the 2000 survey showed different types of gravel , including Winter Hill ( variably clayey and sandy ) , Lynch Hill ( sand and gravel with lenses of silt , clay or peat ) , and head ( a <unk> deposit usually formed by periglacial solifluction or <unk> ) . The survey also identified that much of the land south of the Kennet is " infilled " or " worked " ground ; this area was formerly gravel pits and now used for leisure . The British Geological Survey defines infilled ground as " areas where the ground has been cut away then wholly or partially backfilled " and worked ground as " areas where the ground has been cut away such as quarries and road cuttings " .

 The settlement is concentrated to the south of the Bath Road ( A4 ) . Southcote consists substantially of planned post @-@ war housing , much of which is Wates @-@ constructed prefabricated housing . The majority of dwellings are semi @-@ detached , which account for 37 @.@ 7 % of all residences . 29 @.@ 1 % of dwellings are flats , and 23 @.@ 5 % are terraces . Reading 's first high @-@ rise dwellings — three eight @-@ storey tower blocks — were built in Southcote in the late 1950s . Home ownership in Southcote is 58 @.@ 3 % , which is average for the Reading area . Use of social housing is above the local average at 29 @.@ 2 % . 
 Southcote 's main thoroughfare is Southcote Lane which runs east – west through the area , connecting Southcote to Fords Farm ( to the west ) and Coley ( to the east ) . Southcote is centred around Coronation Square , an area of open grassland surrounded by community facilities and commercial premises . To the north of the Bath Road is Prospect Park , a large urban park surrounding the Mansion House . Development to the south of Southcote is restricted by the Holy Brook and the Great Western Main Line , and although the land is used for recreation , proposals are occasionally put forward to build housing on the floodplains . The land south of the railway line is subject to a Tree Preservation Order ( TPO ) . This land is defined by Reading Borough Council as Southcote Meadows , and stretches from the Burghfield Road ( near to the western boundary of Southcote ) to Milkmaid 's Bridge at the foot of Southcote Lock . Other parts of Southcote are subject to similar restrictions , including areas adjacent to ( but north of ) the railway embankment , trees lining the Kennet and Avon Canal west of Southcote Lock , and various individual sites . 
 = = = Parks and open spaces = = = 
 Prospect Park , one of the largest open spaces in Reading , is in Southcote Ward . Smaller parks such as Linear Park and Southcote Farm Lane playground are in the community . Coronation Square is a designated green space in the centre of Southcote . 
 Bordering Prospect Park is Devil 's Dip , a former gravel and clay pit . The site is recognised by Reading Borough Council as an area of wildlife and historical interest , and examples of elm , walnut , ash , horse chestnut and sycamore trees grow there . Other flora found at the site include nettle , bramble and elder , with flowers such as lesser <unk> , bluebells and Queen Anne 's lace appearing in the spring . Peacock butterflies and various species of woodland bird are prevalent in the area .

 According to the United Kingdom Census 2011 , the population of the Southcote area was 8 @,@ 548 , of which 48 % were male and 52 % female . This is an increase of 58 residents compared to the 2001 census . Censuses before this cannot be compared , as the ward boundaries ( and therefore population ) changed after the 1991 census . 
 The majority of residents of Southcote Ward ( 58 @.@ 6 % ) identify as Christian , with people specifying " no religion " counting for 24 @.@ 9 % of the population .

 Historically the land at Southcote was used for farming and gravel extraction . Farms such as Calvespit Farm ( <unk> ) , Honey End Farm ( <unk> ) , Southcote Manor Farm ( <unk> ) , and Southcote Farm ( <unk> ) were in the area . The 1888 Kelly 's Directory lists some residents of Southcote Lane as being employed as coachmen , butlers , gardeners , labourers , florists , dairy farmers , <unk> and carters . One resident was a member of the county police , and Major @-@ General C J Addington resided at Southcote Lodge . An Ordnance Survey map surveyed in the 1870s also identifies a <unk> and kennels . 
 The farming and gravel industries declined with the expansion of Reading after the Second World War , though the existence of the anti @-@ extraction groups " Save Southcote Meadows " and " Residents Against Gravel Extraction " ( RAGE ) in the 1980s suggests the demand for such industry in the area remained . By the mid @-@ 1980s , the Tarmac Group reportedly owned land near the site of Southcote Manor with the intent of extracting gravel there . 
 There are two primary centres of economical activity in Southcote — Coronation Square and Southcote Farm Lane . Coronation Square is home to a number of commercial and community premises , including a post office , takeaway food outlets , newsagents , healthcare businesses and a pet shop ; as well as a community centre and library . The square also featured a public house until its demolition in 2011 ; the land was subsequently used for affordable housing . Southcote Farm Lane has a small parade of shops and businesses including a convenience store and hairdressers . On the border of Southcote and Tilehurst is the <unk> Precinct , which includes an Asda supermarket and a Boots pharmacy , as well as other smaller shops . The precinct opened in 1967 , and a survey in 2012 revealed that the public thought the site had become run @-@ down and required modernisation . In 2015 a planning application was submitted to Reading Borough Council by a developer who plans to renovate the site . 
 Branches of Beefeater and Harvester @-@ owned public houses are in Southcote ; the latter in the former Prospect Park mansion . A third pub , The George and Dragon , is located at the westernmost extreme of Southcote , and is owned by Greene King and operated as a Hungry Horse outlet . 
 The Southcote Service Station is an Esso petrol filling station and Tesco Express convenience store , adjacent to which is a Nissan dealership .

 In the years following the Second World War , Southcote hosted a number of community events on Denton 's Field . Many of these fêtes included <unk> motorcycle racing events , which were held in 1947 , 1948 and 1949 . Speedway stars Bill Kitchen and George Wilks raced at Southcote in 1949 for a Conservative Party fête . The field was also used in 1949 for a gymkhana and a church fundraising fête . 
 Southcote holds an annual May <unk> in Coronation Square ; the 2015 event was organised by community groups from local churches and community centres . The event focuses on cuisine , live music and children 's entertainment .

 Southcote is within Thames Valley Police 's catchment , and is grouped as a neighbourhood with Norcot . Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as of concern in the area , as well as the antisocial use of mini motos , quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath . Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge . In June 2015 , signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way . 
 The majority of reported crime in Southcote is categorised as either violent or sexual attacks , where 46 incidents of this nature were reported in June 2015 within a 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) radius of Coronation Square . The highest concentration of crime occurs near the service station on the A4 road . Neighbourhood liaison sessions ( known as " Have Your Say " meetings ) are held in Coronation Square . 
 A surgery , operated by the Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust , is located at the junction of Circuit Lane and Southcote Lane . In late 2014 the practice was the subject of significant local media coverage when all five of the surgery 's general practitioners resigned . Other NHS facilities in Southcote include Prospect Park Hospital ( catering for in @-@ patient mental health and psychiatric intensive care ) and the Dutchess of Kent Hospice , which is also part of the Sue Ryder group . The NHS 's North and West Reading Clinical Commissioning Group 's headquarters is located in Southcote on the Bath Road . 
 Southcote has a number of council @-@ funded community facilities , including a library , a community centre , and a children 's centre . A number of community organisations , such as an elderly residents ' social club , litter picking groups , and allotments are in existence in the area . Reading 's <unk> ( Rivers and Environmental Spaces Clean @-@ Up Event ) , a rural litter @-@ picking initiative , operates periodically in the parks and along the tracks and towpaths in Southcote .

 Southcote is situated north of the M4 Motorway , approximately halfway between junctions 11 ( Reading central ) and 12 ( Reading west ) . 
 The Reading to Taunton branch of the Great Western Mainline railway bisects Southcote laterally . At the eastern boundary of the settlement is Southcote Junction , where the Reading to Taunton and Reading to Basingstoke Lines diverge . A third line — the Coley Branch Line — ran from the junction until its closure in the 1980s . There are a number of Brunel @-@ designed brick arch bridges along the Reading to Taunton line through Southcote , two of which have been described as " notably well preserved examples " and are designated " heritage assets " by Network Rail . A third bridge , which carries the main Burghfield to Reading road , may have originally been timber before being replaced with a steel deck by the Great Western Railway company . 
 Southcote is linked to Reading by a number of Reading Buses services along the A4 Bath Road , with some services stopping within Southcote itself . One service , named " Jet Black " , links Reading to Newbury via Southcote . 
 The Kennet and Avon Canal at Southcote is still used for pleasure boating ; moorings for narrowboats are located between Southcote Lock and Burghfield Bridge . The canal is accessible from footpaths near Burghfield Bridge , Southcote Mill and Fobney Lock , and the towpath through Southcote is a designated portion of National Cycle Route 4 . 
 During the First World War , an aerodrome was established near to Southcote at Coley Park . Aviator Henri <unk> based himself at Woodley Aerodrome , from which he gave " joyrides " in his Blériot Aéronautique aeroplane , but also gave flights in a Blériot XI from the Kennet meadows in Southcote . In 1915 a Farman aeroplane crash @-@ landed at Southcote Farm next to Southcote Junction . The pilot was able to jump from the plane before it crashed , and ran alongside it until it collided with a hedge near the railway embankment .

 Three primary schools are situated in Southcote — Manor Primary School , Holy Brook Special Educational Needs School , and Southcote Primary School . In each of their most recent Ofsted inspections , the schools achieved a " good " rating . 
 Three secondary schools are in operation in Southcote . Prospect School is a specialist sport and ICT school run under the academy system . In its latest Ofsted report , the school was judged to require improvement . The other secondary school in Southcote is The Blessed Hugh Faringdon Catholic School , a Catholic school named after the Reading abbot Hugh Cook alias Faringdon . The school was deemed to be " good " in its latest Ofsted inspection . In September 2015 , the third school — The Wren School — opened on the site of the former <unk> School . This operates as <unk> school , and was envisaged by a volunteer network after Reading Borough Council identified a shortfall in school capacity in 2012 . 
 Educational attainment in Southcote is lower than the Reading and national average . 47 % of students at GCSE ( or equivalent ) attain five or more A * to C passes , compared to the Reading figure of 57 % and 61 % nationally . The number of students achieving Level 2 writing at Key Stage 1 is 83 % — the same as in the wider Reading area — though the national percentage is higher at 85 % .

 = Design B @-@ 65 cruiser = 
 Design B @-@ 65 was a class of Super Type A cruisers planned by the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) before and during World War II . As envisioned by the IJN , the cruisers were to play a key role in the Night Battle Force portion of the " Decisive battle " strategy which Japan hoped , in the event of war , to employ against the United States Navy . 
 Begun in 1939 , plans were far enough along that tests were conducted with the main armament and against the underwater protection . Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet replenishment program , the prioritizing of aircraft carriers and smaller ships due to the war , followed by Japan 's defeat , killed any chance of the B @-@ 65 's construction . 
 = = Mission and plan = = 
 The Japanese navy 's experience in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 @-@ 1905 , especially the Battle of Tsushima , strongly influenced the creation of the IJN 's " Decisive Battle " doctrine , which guided the development and deployment of the IJN 's battle fleet into World War II . The Decisive Battle concept was the IJN 's primary strategy for defeating the navies of the major Western powers , such as Great Britain or the United States , in the event of war . The strategy consisted of four main components : a decisive surface fleet engagement determined by big guns , attrition tactics against a numerically superior enemy , a reliance on quality over quantity in naval weaponry , and the employment of nighttime torpedo attacks . 
 After the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the London Naval Treaty of 1930 , each of which placed restrictions on the size of the IJN 's fleet in comparison with the fleets of the western powers , notably the United States , the decisive battle strategy received increased emphasis within the IJN . In 1936 , the IJN formed the Night Battle Force ( <unk> Butai ) . As designed , the night battle force was to attack the hypothetical enemy 's , usually envisioned by the Japanese to be the US Pacific Fleet , outer defense ring of cruisers and destroyers at night . After cracking the outer defense ring , IJN cruisers and destroyers were to launch torpedo attacks on the enemy 's battleships . What remained of the enemy fleet was then to be finished @-@ off by the IJN 's main battleship line the following day . 
 The IJN assigned one division of fast battleships or battlecruisers to give additional firepower to the nocturnal attacks . The Kongō @-@ class battlecruiser were initially assigned to this role and were upgraded to fast battleships over a seven @-@ year period from 1933 @-@ 1940 . The IJN planned to eventually replace the four Kongō battleships with four heavy , " super " cruisers . As envisioned by the IJN in 1936 , these ships , the B @-@ 65 cruisers , would mount 12 @-@ inch guns , carry armor designed to withstand hits from 8 @-@ inch shells , and be capable of speeds up to 40 knots . They would be designated as " super @-@ A @-@ class cruisers " to signify their greater status than the A @-@ class ships ( heavy cruisers ) . 
 The plan for the cruiser class was finalized as part of the IJN 's Circle Five and Circle Six warship construction plans of 7 January 1941 . The plan called for six B @-@ 65s to be built in two increments , with the first two to be constructed in Circle 5 with the remainder in Circle 6 . By this time , Japanese intelligence had learned the specifications for the United States Navy 's Alaska @-@ class large cruisers , which had been authorized for creation by the passage of the Two @-@ Ocean Navy Act and ordered on 5 September 1940 . The Japanese believed that these ships would form part of the American battle fleet 's screen in times of war . Thus , the B @-@ 65s were now intended to counter the threat posed by the Alaska @-@ class cruisers . 
 = = Design = = 
 Design work on the B @-@ 65s began in 1939 . Preliminary plans for the new class were finished by September 1940 , and they were far enough along that tests of the lower protection — the armor intended to counter any shell that fell short but still hit the ship ( albeit underwater ) and torpedoes — and main armament were conducted from 1940 to 1941 . 
 These plans called for ships that bore a striking resemblance to the Yamato @-@ class battleships , with the same " clipper bow , flush @-@ deck construction , and a generally similar superstructure " , albeit at a reduced size . Primary weapons were to be nine 310 mm ( 12 @.@ 2 in ) / 50 caliber guns in three triple turrets and eight 610 mm ( 24 in ) torpedo tubes firing the excellent Type 93 " Long Lance " torpedo . Secondary weapons included sixteen 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) / 65 caliber Type 98 dual @-@ purpose guns in dual mounts on either side of the superstructure , twelve paired Type 95 25 mm ( 1 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns , and four <unk> Hotchkiss machine guns . The weight of the main battery turrets was to be around 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 100 short tons ; 1 @,@ 000 t ) , with 350 long tons ( 390 short tons ; 360 t ) of that devoted to armor ; however , no plans of how this latter figure was to have been distributed has survived . 
 The cruisers were to be protected by 190 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) belt armor sloped at 20 ° and 125 mm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) deck armor . Four geared turbine sets would have generated about 42 @,@ 500 shp each ; for a total of about 167 @,@ 674 shp , enough to power the ships through the water at 34 kn ( 39 mph ; 63 km / h ) , faster than the " fundamental design requirement " of 33 kn ( 38 mph ; 61 km / h ) . 
 In an attempt to counter the Alaska @-@ class cruisers ' 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns , a proposal to increase both the main battery to six 356 mm ( 14 in ) and armor protection to resist against the same was put forth . However , the increase in displacement ( to almost 40 @,@ 000 long tons ( 45 @,@ 000 short tons ; 41 @,@ 000 t ) ) and reduction in performance this entailed meant that nothing came of the proposed changes . 
 = = Final plans and cancellation = = 
 As war with the United States loomed in 1941 , the navy found that it had a more pressing need for aircraft carriers and auxiliary vessels . This need , plus a desire to complete the ongoing Circle Three and Four construction programs , delayed initiation of the Circle Five plan . 
 Following the Japanese navy 's defeat at the Battle of Midway in June 1942 , the Circle Five plan was significantly revised and Circle Six was postponed indefinitely . The new plan still called for the construction of two ships of Design B @-@ 65 , which were given the hull numbers 795 and 796 with projected commissioning dates of 1945 and 1946 , respectively . As the war progressed , however , strategic requirements further delayed the plans for the two cruisers . In the end , the B @-@ 65s ' plans were never finalized and no contracts for their construction were ever placed . 
 = Carrick , Tasmania = 
 Carrick is a small historic village 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) west of Launceston , Tasmania , Australia , on the banks of the Liffey River . The Meander Valley Highway passes through the town 's centre ; this road was formerly the main road from Launceston to Deloraine and Devonport . Carrick has a well @-@ preserved 19th @-@ century heritage ; fifteen of its colonial buildings are listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register including Carrick House ( 1840 ) , St Andrew 's Church ( 1848 ) , the Old Watch house ( 1837 ) , Monds Roller Mill ( 1846 ) and the Carrick Hotel ( 1833 ) . 
 The first land grant at Carrick was in 1818 and a decade later William Bryan was building a wooden mill on the river 's bank . The town was formed in consequence of this mill 's construction and town plots sold in 1838 . Carrick Post Office opened on 5 November 1841 . Carrick never grew large — the population varied from around 200 to 439 — and today it is largely a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town . During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage , though reticulated services for both are now connected . Volunteer labour enabled piped water supply , from the Liffey , from 1961 and a sewerage plant was built in the mid @-@ 1970s on the towns outskirts . The local councils ' strategic plan aims for the town to stay small with only infill development . 
 The 1846 stone building known as " Monds Roller Mill " is the town 's most prominent feature . The operation of this mill — and the preceding wooden mill — was the foundation of the town 's prosperity during the 19th century . The mill operated until 1924 , for most of this time by Thomas Monds and his family company , and was the last water powered flour mill in Tasmania . Since a 1984 renovation it has intermittently been a restaurant , wedding venue and meeting venue . Near the mill is Archer 's Folly , an imposing and now ruined , but never completed , grand colonial house . The folly was started in 1847 , sold incomplete in 1867 and burned to a roofless shell in 1978 . Significant people associated with Carrick include : Thomas Reibey , once Premier of Tasmania ; Thomas Monds who founded an extensive milling company ; and Sammy Cox whose claims would make him the earliest European settler in Tasmania . 
 The Anglican Church St Andrews has held services since the 1840s . For some time the town also had a Wesleyan Chapel . A private school opened in 1843 and a government one in the 1870s . By the late 1930s both schools had closed . Carrick hosts Agfest , the state 's largest single event and one of Australia 's largest agricultural field days . The 1848 Anglican church , 1833 hotel and a few other establishments serve the townspeople . A brewery , steam and water mill , butcher , schools and other hotels are all long since closed . Carrick has a long association with horse racing , starting prior to the race course 's formation in 1848 . For a time the town held the oldest horse race in Australia . Today regular harness racing , speedway racing and cycling events have replaced this .

 Carrick 's area is within the traditional grounds of the Northern Midlands group of Tasmanian Aborigines . Records held by Aboriginal Heritage Tasmania have no reference , as recently as 2010 , of any aboriginal heritage or artifacts in the area . The first land grant at Carrick was made in 1818 to Thomas Haydock Reibey , father of Thomas Reibey ( later Premier of Tasmania ) . The grant was for 4 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 600 ha ) taking in the area of the later town . Early land use was for agriculture and by 1823 , at least , there were only a few widely scattered settlers . 
 Captain William Thomas Lyttleton was granted over 1 @,@ 300 acres ( 530 ha ) near Carrick in late 1825 when he lived at nearby Hagley in Hagley House . What was then just a locality became known as Lyttleton after the Captain . The river that passed from the Great Western Tiers to nearby Meander River was then known as The Pennyroyal Creek , after a plant that grew profusely on its banks . William Bryan arrived at Hobart , from Ireland , in May 1824 . He received land grants of 1 @,@ 077 acres ( 436 ha ) in the Meander Valley and later purchased 500 acres ( 200 ha ) at Carrick , including 30 acres ( 10 ha ) on the creek . Bryan began building a mill on his Carrick grant in 1826 , on the same site as the later Monds Roller Mills . His business interests prospered and he purchased large amounts of land , including more at Carrick . By 1828 the first bridge over the river had been built , a simple log structure . Bryan 's mill was the impetus for foundation of the town . Van Diemen 's Land 's Land Commissioners recommended in early 1828 : " Mr W Bryan is building a mill a short way up the stream and we beg to recommend reserving 100 acres each side for the various purposes of a village which we called Lyttleton . " 
 Over the next few years Bryan used his influence to rename , in memory of his homeland , both the town and the river , much to the disgust of Lyttleton . It was reported in 1831 newspapers that the road from Launceston to Carrick had been opened . The path of the road was announced in April 1831 , and it was opened for public traffic in June . The State Government sold town allotments in late 1838 , obtaining what was noted as a high price of £ 45 ( A $ 8 @,@ 100 in 2005 ) per acre . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 Samuel Pratt Winter was sent to Tasmania by his father , at Bryan 's request , to act as an overseer of the mill . He managed the mill from 1834 , when Bryan went to London in the midst of a dispute with Governor Arthur , and leased it from 1837 onwards . A post office opened in November 1841 , and at the end of the year the village had also four dwellings , a blacksmith shop , a police station , the flour mill and an adobe hotel built by John Archer . While passing through the town Louisa Anne Meredith took note of the buildings . In her guidebook , published in 1843 , she referred to the " crazy weather board mill " . At the time the mill 's motive power came from an overshot water wheel supplied with water from the Liffey River via a long wooden trough . St Andrew 's church was built in 1843 by Thomas Reibey as a school . The initial church grounds of 14 acres ( 6 ha ) were donated by Thomas Reibey . Winter was living at the mill cottage in 1846 , when he arranged for the old wooden mill to be removed and , with John Kinder Archer , began building the blue @-@ stone mill . The town greatly expanded in the late 1850s , fueled by the efforts of those returning from the Victorian gold fields . Over time many cottages in Carrick were built for workers on the Reibey 's Entally House outside nearby Hadspen . 
 By 1859 the town had two mills — one steam and one water wheel powered — that processed approximately 4000 bushels per week . There was a steam @-@ powered brewery , opposite St Andrew 's church , whose produce won first prize at the 1859 Launceston show ( by 1947 the brewery was scant ruins ) . During its operation the brewery had supplied all of the town 's hotels . Four inns were open and the town had an agricultural machinery manufacturing business . A public library was established in 1860 . The mill was sold to Thomas Monds , an experienced miller , in 1867 . At the time it was reported that its machinery was in poor repair , but the building was sound . When a nearby rail line was built in 1869 traffic through Carrick greatly diminished and trade in the town suffered , though the nearest station was Bishopbourne over 5 miles ( 8 km ) away . 
 A government school was established in the 1870s and grew to 65 students by 1901 . Mond 's business expanded throughout the latter part of the 19th century and the prosperity of the town did likewise . He built a large grain store opposite the mill and opened offices and a depot in Launceston . Westbury Municipal Council built a public hall on the main road in 1883 . The current weatherboard town hall dates from <unk> and the old hall is presumed to have been destroyed prior to this . At the town 's height in the 19th century , just after the return of men from the Victorian gold fields , the town had four public houses and a population of approximately 400 . It had four public houses operating two of which , Prince of Wales and the Carrick Hotel , remained open in 1901 . As of 1883 it was reported that the inns were kept open by the Carrick Races and fortnightly livestock sales . Carrick 's livestock sales were held at the Carrick Hotel and were the main fat stock sales for Launceston . At the turn of the century the town had no reticulated water . It relied on wells , rainwater and the inconstant river . 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 The Liffey River — then called Pennyroyal Creek — was first bridged at Carrick in 1828 with a simple log structure . This was replaced in the 1830s with a more substantial bridge , though still wooden . As of 1834 the areas ' roads were poor and vehicles frequently became bogged on the road to Westbury . A bridge over the South Esk , at what is now Hadspen , was built in 1843 . It replaced a frequently impassable ford and more reliably connected Carrick to Launceston . Liffey bridge was repaired and raised in the mid @-@ 1860s , keeping the original foundations . In May 1875 water sufficiently eroded these foundations to lead to the bridge 's collapse , when one of the two supporting piles ( logs ) gave way . All of the Liffey bridges , and the connecting parts of the road , were subject to inundation when the river flooded ; the 1929 Tasmanian Floods carried the bridge away . In the 1950s the road was reconstructed and the bridge again replaced . To reduce the incidence and impact of flooding both were raised substantially leaving the mill 's ground floor far below the road level . 
 A rail line was built nearby in 1869 . With the advent of rail , traffic through Carrick was greatly diminished and trade in the town suffered . A rail siding was built at " The Oaks " , over 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the town 's edge and a station at Bishopbourne over 5 miles ( 8 km ) away . The passenger rail service had ceased before 1978 , a time when all Tasmanian passenger rail services ceased . 
 By 1877 there was a twice daily mail and passenger cart connecting Carrick to the railway station at Bishopbourne and " Blair 's Bus " ran thrice weekly to Launceston . The Bass Highway , which passed through Carrick , had been designated a National Highway as part of the Federal National Highway Act 1974 . The structure of this type of road required that the centre of Carrick be bypassed . The road through Carrick is now known as the Meander Valley Highway . Bass Highway , which connects Launceston , Burnie and Devonport , passes south of the town . As of 2011 Redline Coaches , runs a daily school bus service that passes through Carrick to many of the Schools in and around Launceston and regular services connecting Carrick to Burnie , Launceston , Hobart and towns in between . 
 = = Sports = = 
 Carrick has long been associated with horse racing . The Reverend Thomas Reibey and the Fields Family were instrumental in founding both a racing club and racecourse . Racing first begun on " The Moat " , a property on the east edge of Carrick . Reibey gifted a racecourse somewhat south of " The Moat " ; the course was originally 1 mile , 57 links long . The Carrick Racing Club was formed in 1848 and the course was well regarded ; it was called " the best in Tasmania " by author Hugh Munro Hull in 1859 . The Carrick Plate — a name now used for a race held in Launceston — was held at the new racecourse , without interruption , annually from 1849 to 1913 ; this made it the oldest race in Australia . 
 The track 's use changed from racing to trotting at this time . The Carrick Trotting club was formed in early 1914 and had its first meeting in February of the same year . The Carrick Trotting Club and Westbury Trotting Club combined in 1976 to form the Carrick Park Trotting Club , later to renamed Carrick Park Pacing Club . As of 2012 Carrick has a <unk> trotting track hosting 3 race meetings a year and up to 27 trial sessions . Next to the trotting track , on grounds owned by the club , is a speedway . Construction of the speedway began in 1967 and the first races were in September 1968 . The track has been in use since opening and crowds of over 10 @,@ 000 have been reported . 
 The town is frequent host to cycling events that are recorded as far back as 1897 , and continue to the present day . The Liffey is fished for brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) during the August to April fishing season . Trout were released into the Liffey River by the fisheries commission in 1940 , and by 1949 specimens of up to 11 pounds ( 5 kg ) had been caught in the river 's upper reaches . 
 = = Water and sewerage = = 
 Organised water supply in the town began at least by 1883 when it was reported being carted from the <unk> . The river 's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish . Five years later Thomas Monds installed hydraulic rams and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town . He on @-@ sold the water to townspeople , though the mill had priority over river water ; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to a trickle . Westbury Council — local government of the time — called for tenders for Carrick 's water supply in 1889 . This water supply system was completed in 1890 . Water was again pumped from the river near the mill , again by hydraulic rams , to a tank near the centre of the town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on the same road . Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use . 
 A typhoid outbreak in the early 20th Century was blamed on the water supplied from these tanks . Subsequent to this the pumps were shut down and the town again relied on rainwater tanks , wells and water carted from the river . The Westbury council 's " Carrick Water Supply " was not self @-@ funding and was abandoned in 1928 . The mill 's dam was washed away in the 1929 floods and has not been rebuilt , losing the town its water storage . 
 In 1961 a residents progress association was formed . A prime goal was the building of a reservoir — supplied from the river — on Armidale hill overlooking the town . To defray costs and gain council acceptance , a large part of the work was performed by volunteers . This scheme began supplying the town on 17 February 1961 . Up to the 1970s , Carrick 's growth was limited by the lack of town sewerage — which restricted the minimum allotment size — and reluctance of landowner 's to subdivide property . A 1977 planning study found that the land structure allowed most of the town to be served by a gravity fed system and recommended construction . As of 2008 the majority of the town was connected to reticulated water and sewerage . 
 From the mid @-@ 1970s sewerage was processed at a plant near the town , which also handles sewerage from nearby Hadspen . Treated waste @-@ water from there is discharged into a tributary of the Liffey River . As of 2003 the reticulated water supply in the town was untreated and both were operated by the Meander Valley council . By 2011 Carrick 's water was supplied from the Mount Leslie Water Treatment Plant . This plant was built in 1996 and supplies treated water from the <unk> Dam . 
 = = Education = = 
 Thomas Monds was instrumental in formation of the first school . This private school was built in 1843 , though Thomas Reibey converted it into St Andrews church in 1845 , and the school moved elsewhere in the town . A Government school was built in 1873 , next to the current recreation ground , and both schools were open as of 1883 . The private school closed late in the 19th Century , but the Government school still had 65 students on the 1901 roll . The latter was a weatherboard building . It was extensively renovated in 1920 and was in use until the mid @-@ 1930s when the last school in Carrick closed . The building was relocated to nearby Hagley in 1938 , though it was later demolished . In the same year the government began funding regular school transport from Carrick to the school at nearby Hagley , accompanying children from Hadspen whose school had also been closed . Since that time there has been no school in Carrick and a 1976 planning report stated the population was likely to remain insufficient to require one . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 Since European settlement the area has been subdivided , settled and farmed . A traveller in 1855 noted that the area was highly cultivated . The endangered Growling Grass Frog ( Litoria raniformis ) has been sighted , though there is only a single record . In some undisturbed areas there is Poa <unk> ( silver tussock ) grassland and Themeda triandra ( kangaroo grass ) . Glycine <unk> ( clover glycine ) was recorded south of the town in 1984 . <unk> pubescens ( Hairy Anchor Plant or Australian Anchor Plant ) , which appears on the states endangered species list , was recorded north @-@ east in 2001 on the South Esk River 's floodplain . Apart from introduced brown trout the Liffey River is home to platypus ( Ornithorhynchus anatinus ) . Platypus in the river have , in common with in other rivers nearby , been found with the potentially lethal fungal infection Mucor <unk> . 
 = = Religion = = 
 Carrick has one extant church , St Andrew 's , an Anglican church in the parish of Quamby . Until 1992 it was in the former Anglican Parish of Carrick . Church of England — now known as the Anglican Church of Australia — services were first held <unk> in a blacksmith 's shop and subsequently in a schoolhouse , whose building was later transformed into St Andrew 's . Thomas Reibey had the schoolhouse converted by 1845 , though the tower was a later addition . The church 's burial ground was consecrated in April 1845 , and the church itself , by Tasmania 's first Church Of England Bishop Francis Russell Nixon , on 25 November 1845 . Though not yet ordained , Reibey received dispensation to begin holding services , first in the blacksmith 's shop , prior to his ordination . He was later the first clergyman ordained by Bishop Nixon and was made an archdeacon in 1857 . Thomas Reibey was the first minister of St Andrew 's , and was succeeded by his brother James , for whom the church 's rectory was built . 
 A Wesleyan chapel was built in 1865 ; a small weatherboard building with an attached Sunday School . The Church eventually fell out of use and became a private home . It was demolished during the 1930s . There has not been a Roman Catholic church in Carrick — the nearest church is Westbury — but some Catholics are recorded as attending the Anglican Church . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The town is 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) from Launceston on the Meander valley Highway ( B54 ) between the towns of Hadspen and Hagley . The Liffey river crosses the town 's western end , after flowing from the Great Western Tiers , over the Liffey falls , through Bracknell and Bishopbourne . Shortly after passing through the town the river joins the Meander River . 
 = = Demographics and people = = 
 Carrick 's population has never been large . There were 430 residents in 1836 and near to 400 for most of the rest of the 19th Century . By late 1976 the population had shrunk to around 200 living in 70 buildings — of which sixteen were classified as " Significantly contributing to the heritage of Australia " by the National Trust . A recovery in the late 20th Century saw 317 residents recorded in the 2001 census and 439 in the 2006 census . Carrick 's role in 1976 was as : a residential area for those working in Launceston ; a retirement village ; and a service centre for farming and stock breeding enterprises . The population in 2006 was largely Australian @-@ born ( 87 % compared to an average for all of Australia of 70 @.@ 9 % ) and English @-@ speaking at home ( 92 @.@ 7 % compared to an Australian average of 78 @.@ 5 % ) . 
 Sammy Cox ( aka Samuel Emanuel Jervis ) ( <unk> – 1891 ) is a significant former resident . He claimed to have been born Samuel Emanuel Jervis in England and spent time on his uncle 's ship after his father died , then jumped ship in 1789 near Tamar heads and subsequently lived with the local aboriginals for twenty @-@ six years . This would have him resident in Tasmania years before the first recorded settlement , in 1803 on the Derwent River , and before even the existence of Bass Strait was proved by George Bass and Matthew Flinders . In 1814 he met and was befriended by the Cox family , residents near Hadspen , and took the family 's surname . He ended up working as a gardener and spent about 50 years living in a cottage on the " Little Moat " property on the Launceston side of Carrick . Cox died in the Launceston insane asylum in 1891 claiming to be 117 years old , though 115 is a more credible figure ( von Stieglitz in 1946 credited his age as 118 ) . His story has been widely reported ; the dining room of the Carrick Hotel is named after him on the basis of it . It has been called into doubt , though , with historian Dr Andrew Piper describing the story as a tall tale constructed by Cox . While writing about Cox , Thomas Monds , who had befriended and assisted him , also expressed doubt as to the story 's veracity . 
 Thomas Reibey has been written of as the Father of Carrick . Reibey was instrumental in construction of the Church , the racecourse and other , now heritage listed , buildings in the town . He donated over 10 @,@ 000 pounds for the construction of the town 's Anglican church , a very large sum for the time , and was appointed as the Archdeacon of Launceston in 1858 . Reibey was elected to the House of Assembly seat of Westbury in 1874 . He held the seat for 30 years and was the Premier of Tasmania from 20 July 1876 until 9 August 1877 . Reibey was an avid horse trainer . His horse " Stockwell " won the 1882 Launceston Cup , the Carrick Plate in 1881 and came second in the Melbourne Cup . 
 Thomas Wilkes Monds was a successful miller and builder before moving to Carrick . He bought the stone mill in Carrick in 1867 and a steam mill in the town the following year . The successful operation of the mills by Monds brought wealth to him and prosperity to the town . Monds built the Gothic house " Hawthorn " in 1875 and worked the nearby 1 @,@ 200 acres ( 490 ha ) farm called " <unk> " , as well as the mills . Before he left Carrick for Launceston in 1888 his holdings in Carrick included the mill , the steam mill , Archer 's Folly and some houses and acreages within the town and " <unk> " . Monds was chairman and treasurer of the Carrick Road Trust from 1870 to 1904 and spent nine years on the area 's local council . 
 = = Today 's town = = 
 Carrick is a small historic village that is primarily a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town . Development has been slow and has not changed the town 's original 19th century character . The local council 's development plan aims to restrict development along Meander Valley road and prevent the merging of Carrick and Hadspen , keeping them as distinct centres . Construction is only planned within the town 's boundary , where up to sixty homes could potentially be built under the strategic plan that runs until 2016 . The town 's development boundary is dictated by the span of sewerage connection . There are few businesses in the town and little incentive for business growth due to the town 's small population . The town is in the Meander Valley Council local government area , the Federal Division of Lyons , and the State Division of Lyons . 
 Carrick has a roadhouse , a post office , a hotel , a copper and metal gallery and some accommodation . After Thomas Monds merged his business into Monds and Affleck , the company built a milling operation on Oaks Road , just south of the now re @-@ aligned Bass Highway . As of 2010 the mill owner claimed it is " Tasmania 's only large @-@ scale commercial feed milling operation " . The town plays host to a number of events including the Agfest field days , trotting races , speedway racing and cycling events . Next door to the ruins of Archer 's Folly is the Tasmanian Copper and Metal Art Gallery . From here the Marik family makes , displays and sells handcrafted copper artworks . The lack of development over time has left the town with a significant number of colonial buildings and mature trees . The 1846 stone " Monds Roller Mill " is the town 's most prominent feature . It was closed but being renovated as of 2008 . Other heritage listed buildings are the ruin of Archer 's Folly ( begun 1847 ) , St Andrews Church ( 1845 ) , Balmoral ( 1851 ) , The Old <unk> ( 1837 ) , the Carrick Hotel ( 1833 ) . 
 = = = Agfest = = = 
 Agfest is an annual agricultural field day , held each May on a rural property in Carrick . It is the state 's , and one of the country 's , largest agricultural field days . Agfest is run by the Rural Youth Organisation of Tasmania with profits assisting Tasmanian Rural Counselling . It was first held at <unk> Plains , near Perth , Tasmania , in 1982 but the organising committee soon recognised the need for a larger site and in 1986 they purchased land on Oaks Road , Carrick from the Peterson family . This piece of land had originally been part of " Oaks Estate " belonging to Thomas Haydock Reibey , father to once Premier of Tasmania Thomas Reibey . They named it " Quercus Rural Youth Park " — Quercus is the genus name for oak — and held the first Agfest on the new site from 7 – 9 May 1987 . Agfest has grown to the state 's largest single event and attracts up to 70 @,@ 000 visitors during the three days in May each year at the 200 @-@ acre ( 80 ha ) site .

 Carrick has a large number of well @-@ preserved 19th @-@ century buildings . Fifteen properties in and around Carrick are listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register . The listings recognised their historic cultural heritage significance to all Tasmania . Some of the properties are also listed on the Register of the National Estate . 
 Pensioner 's Row is a pair of co @-@ joined brick cottages built by Thomas Reibey , originally for the blacksmith and saddler for " Entally Estate " in Hadspen . A heritage @-@ listed cottage close by on Meander Valley road was formerly called " Ivy Cottage " due to prolific growth of the plant and was used as a private school . The former police watch @-@ house was built opposite the Carrick Inn in 1837 using convict labour . The Prince of Wales Hotel was built in 1840 and was licensed for many years , but is now a private home . By 1869 it was a two @-@ storey brick building with sixteen rooms , a cellar and a separate stone stable . " <unk> " is the remains of an original farm building , built on a grant that was 4 @,@ 560 acres ( 1 @,@ 845 ha ) in 1835 . The original home was partly demolished to make way for an extension to an adjacent building in the late 20th century . The main farmhouse , said to be an " Outstanding Indian @-@ influence house " , has been demolished . Carrick House , on East Street was built around 1840 by Roderic O 'Conner and was extended in the 19th century . Until the 1980s the house was associated with horse racing ; its stables were used as a training base . It is a two @-@ storey brick house with an iron roof and twelve @-@ pane windows . Behind the stone mill is a single @-@ storey brick cottage that was built around 1840 as a four @-@ roomed , single @-@ story brick building . After he purchased the mill , Monds expanded the cottage with a pantry , three more rooms and a dairy . 
 The Carrick Hotel is a two @-@ storey brick building with an iron hip roof built in 1833 . It is the only licensed premises in Carrick and has been operated as a hotel for the entire of its history . The hotel has been sold and the licence transferred numerous times , including the first instance from John Taylor to Thomas Archer on 12 August 1839 , and was called the Hotel Marella from November 1945 to December <unk> Rudge built the Plough Inn in 1841 , though it was referred to in an 1842 survey map as the Carrick Inn . It is a two @-@ story brick building with an iron roof and 12 @-@ panel windows . John Archer was the Inn 's first licensee , but by 1863 it was no longer operating and the building was offered for lease . The last licensee was John Jordan in 1873 ; over time it has been used as a bakery , art gallery , hotel and private home . 
 = = = Monds Roller Mills = = = 
 Monds Roller Mills building is a four @-@ level , three @-@ story , bluestone building with an iron gabled roof built <unk> by John Kinder Archer . The mill , and its associated storage and transportation needs , was the main employer in Carrick for many years . It was the last mill in Tasmania to be powered by water . 
 The first mill was built of timber and powered by a water wheel fed from a dam on the Liffey , all constructed by William Bryan in 1826 . Samuel Pratt Winter was sent to Tasmania by his father , at <unk> 's request , as an overseer for the mill . He managed this mill from 1834 , when Bryan went to London in the midst of a dispute with Governor Arthur . From 1837 he leased the mill from Bryan and continued to operate it . He was living at the mill cottage in 1846 , and still leasing the mill , when he arranged for the old wooden mill to be removed and , with John Kinder Archer , began building the current stone structure . As built this new mill had a water wheel powering three pairs of French <unk> . Thomas Wilkes Monds was born in Launceston in 1829 and spent his early life gaining experience in numerous milling operations . In early 1841 , on Monds ' first visit to the town , he recorded it as having only four houses , a wooden flour mill , a blacksmith 's shop and a pub constructed of mud and straw . Thomas Monds purchased the mill , including 13 acres ( 5 ha ) of attached land , at Auction in 1867 for 2 @,@ 100 pounds . He then took ownership of the " Carrick Mills " and in early 1868 Monds , his wife and six children moved into the small cottage behind the mill . This cottage had four rooms that Monds later expanded with a pantry , three more rooms and a dairy . When he purchased it , and for some time afterwards , the mill was not financially successful . Monds blamed this state of affairs on the " speculative " operation of a steam @-@ powered mill , just a short distance uphill . The steam mill owners eventually became insolvent and Monds acquired the operation and building . 
 Over time the mill 's machinery was updated : in 1868 the existing wire machine was replaced with a silk dressing machine ; a corn screen was installed in 1871 ; an oatmeal plant was added in 1880 ; the water wheel was replaced with an American @-@ built water @-@ powered " Victor " turbine in 1887 ; and in 1889 the plant was converted from millstones to roller milling , making it one of the earliest conversions in Tasmania . This last change , to roller milling , was recorded by Monds as driven by public demand for the whiter flour that process produced . Monds ' oldest son took over office management of the mill in 1882 and Monds moved to Launceston in 1888 leaving the mill 's management to his sons . The mill was the scene of the town 's first telephones when they were installed at it and adjacent Hawthorn Villa in 1893 . 
 The mill remained in the hands of TW Monds & Sons until their 1918 merger with T Affleck & Son — which owned the Newry mill at Longford — creating the company Monds & Affleck . Monds & Affleck only operated the mill until 1924 , and never reopened it . By 1931 it was reported as having ceased operations years ago . Monds & Affleck sold the mill in 1947 , though it is not known when the mill 's machinery was removed . By this time the mill was descending into Ruin and had long been vacant . The mill was renovated in 1984 and opened as a restaurant , though four years later it had closed and was being sold . After this it was reopened as a wedding and meeting venue . It had closed again by 2008 , but was being renovated with the intention of reopening . 
 = = = St. Andrew 's Church = = = 
 St. Andrew 's Church is an actively used Anglican Church . The building is made from stuccoed brick with a crenelated tower and sits on 14 acres ( 6 ha ) — that includes a cemetery and a rectory — abutting the Liffey River . The building was begun in 1843 by Thomas Reibey as a school for the town . He had the building converted to a church in 1845 ; Reibey donated the church 's land and funded the building of the rectory and later purchase of the church 's organ . The cemetery was consecrated in April 1845 and the church itself in November of the same year . The current structure was not complete until the tower was added in 1863 . St. Andrew 's was renovated <unk> , the roof surface was replaced and new Cathedral glass installed . 
 A bell hangs in the tower , made in England from iron and steel and lined with silver .

St Andrew 's east window commemorates James , Charlotte and Thomas Reibey ( Archdeacon of Launceston for a time ) . The church features an organ , originally housed in the crypt of St Paul 's Cathedral , London . It was built by London organ builder J. C. Bishop around 1839 , probably for a private owner . This dating is based partly on the organ 's dedication plate 's claim that Bishop was " Organ Builder to her Majesty " Queen Victoria , a claim that Bishop did not make until around this time . The organ 's case is English oak with turned pillars at the front corners . It has a mechanical action with one manual and five speaking stops . A thorough restoration was completed in 1987 and the organ remains in use .

 John Kinder Archer , son of Carrick 's first Inn 's builder , began building a large mansion on Bishopbourne Road in 1847 . It was built as a substantial , brick quoin and rubble walled , two @-@ story structure with a triple @-@ gabled roof . It was designed to have large rooms ( 16 ft ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) by 30 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) ) and a domed driveway through the house 's centre . When only four rooms were completed , the ship " The City of Launceston " sank off Adelaide with much of the supplies to complete the building . After this setback , exacerbated by the lack of insurance , Archer abandoned the building . Thomas Monds bought it in 1867 and used it for storing grain . Archer 's building work created only a shell that became known as Archer 's Folly . The folly was recorded by The Mercury in 1883 as both unfinished and ugly . By 1946 the Folly remained uncompleted and was used as a barn . In the late 20th century it was owned by Mirek Marik , local copper @-@ work artist , who partly restored it . A fire broke out on 5 April 1978 and the conflagration left just a roofless shell . Marik Metal Art later built a replacement studio and workshop adjacent to the now grand ruin .

 Frozen is a 2013 American 3D computer @-@ animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . It is the 53rd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series . Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen 's fairy tale The Snow Queen , the film tells the story of a fearless princess who sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman , his loyal pet reindeer , and a naïve snowman to find her estranged sister , whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter . 
 Frozen underwent several story treatments for years before being commissioned in 2011 , with a screenplay written by Jennifer Lee , and both Chris Buck and Lee serving as directors . It features the voices of Kristen Bell , Idina Menzel , Jonathan Groff , Josh Gad and Santino Fontana . Christophe Beck , who had worked on Disney 's award @-@ winning short Paperman , was hired to compose the film 's orchestral score , while husband @-@ and @-@ wife songwriting team Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson @-@ Lopez wrote the songs .

 = = Plot = = 
 The beginning of the movie shows <unk> harvesting ice . A young boy named Kristoff and his pet reindeer , Sven , is among them ( " Frozen Heart " ) . Elsa , Princess of Arendelle , possesses <unk> powers , with which she is able to produce or manipulate ice , frost and snow at will . One night while playing , she accidentally injures her younger sister , Anna . Their shocked parents , the king and queen , seek help from the troll king , who heals Anna and removes her memories of Elsa 's magic . The royal couple isolate the sisters in the castle until Elsa learns to control her magical powers . Afraid of hurting Anna again , and with her ability to control her powers deteriorating , Elsa spends most of her time alone in her room , refusing even to speak to Anna and a rift develops between the sisters as they grow up ; when the girls are teenagers , their parents die at sea during a storm ( " Do You Want to Build a Snowman ? " ) . 
 When Elsa comes of age , the kingdom prepares for her coronation ( " For the First Time in Forever " ) . Among the guests is the Duke of Weselton , who seeks to exploit Arendelle for profit . Excited to be allowed out of the castle again , Princess Anna explores the town and meets Prince Hans of the Southern Isles ; the two quickly develop a mutual attraction . Despite Elsa 's fears , her coronation takes place without incident . During the reception , Hans proposes to Anna , who hastily accepts ( " Love Is An Open Door " ) . However , Elsa refuses to grant her blessing and forbids their sudden marriage . The sisters argue , culminating in the exposure of Elsa 's abilities in an emotional outburst . 
 Declared a monster by the Duke , a panicking Elsa flees the castle , while inadvertently unleashing an eternal winter on the kingdom . High in the nearby mountains , she abandons her restraint , vowing to never return and building herself a solitary ice palace ( " Let It Go " ) . Meanwhile , Anna leaves Hans in charge of Arendelle and sets out in search of her sister , determined to return her to Arendelle , end the winter and mend their relationship . While obtaining supplies from ' Wandering Oaken 's Trading Post and Sauna ' , Anna meets Kristoff and Sven ( " <unk> Are Better Than People " ) . She convinces Kristoff to guide her up the North Mountain . On their journey , the group encounters Olaf , Anna and Elsa 's childhood snowman whom the latter recreated and unknowingly brought to life . Olaf dreams of seeing and experiencing summer for the first time ( " In Summer " ) . He then leads them to Elsa 's hideaway . 
 Anna and Elsa reunite , but Elsa still fears hurting her sister . When Anna insists that Elsa return , she becomes agitated and her powers lash out , accidentally striking Anna in the heart ( " For the First Time In Forever ( Reprise ) " ) . Horrified , Elsa forces Anna , Kristoff and Olaf to leave by creating a giant snow creature named Marshmallow that chases them away from her palace . As they flee , Kristoff notices Anna 's hair turning white and deduces that something is very wrong . He seeks help from the trolls , his adoptive family , who explain that Anna 's heart has been frozen by Elsa ( " Fixer Upper " ) . Unless it can be thawed by an " act of true love " , she will become frozen solid forever . Believing that only Hans can save her with a true love 's kiss , Kristoff races back with her to Arendelle . 
 Meanwhile , Hans , who is leading a search for Anna , reaches Elsa 's palace . In the ensuing battle against the duke 's men , Elsa is knocked unconscious by a falling chandelier and imprisoned in Arendelle . There , Hans pleads with her to undo the winter , but Elsa confesses that she has no idea how . When Anna reunites with Hans and begs him to kiss her to break the curse , Hans refuses and reveals that his true intention in marrying her is to seize control of Arendelle 's throne . Leaving Anna to die , he charges Elsa with treason for her younger sister 's apparent death . 
 Elsa escapes and heads out into the blizzard on the fjord . Olaf comes across Anna and reveals Kristoff is in love with her ; they then escape onto the fjord to find him . Hans confronts Elsa , telling her Anna is dead because of her . In Elsa 's despair , the storm suddenly ceases , giving Kristoff and Anna the chance to locate each other . Nevertheless , Anna , seeing that Hans is about to kill Elsa , throws herself between the two just as she freezes solid , blocking Hans ' attack . 
 As Elsa grieves for her sister , Anna begins to thaw , since her decision to sacrifice herself to save her sister constitutes an " act of true love " . Realizing love is the key to controlling her powers , Elsa thaws the kingdom and gives Olaf his own personal flurry so he can survive in summer . Hans is deported to the Southern Isles to face punishment for his crimes against the royal family of Arendelle , while Elsa cuts off trade with Weselton . The two sisters reconcile and Elsa promises never to shut the castle gates again .

 Walt Disney Productions first began exploring a possible live action / animation biography film of author and poet Hans Christian Andersen sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , the first feature @-@ length hand @-@ drawn animated film ever made . In March 1940 , Walt Disney suggested a co @-@ production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn , where Goldwyn 's studio would shoot the live @-@ action sequences of Andersen 's life and Disney 's studio would animate Andersen 's fairy tales . The animated sequences would be based on some of Andersen 's best known works , such as The Little Mermaid , The Little Match Girl , The Steadfast Tin Soldier , The Snow Queen , Thumbelina , The Ugly Duckling , The Red Shoes , and The Emperor 's New Clothes . However , the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen , as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences . Even as far back as the 1930s and 1940s , it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities , but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic . After the United States entered World War II , the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda , which caused development on the Disney – Goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942 . Goldwyn went on to produce his own live @-@ action film version in 1952 , entitled Hans Christian Andersen , with Danny Kaye as Andersen , Charles Vidor directing , Moss Hart writing , and Frank Loesser penning the songs . All of Andersen 's fairy tales were , instead , told in song and ballet in live @-@ action , like the rest of the film . It went on to receive six Academy Award nominations the following year . Back at Disney , The Snow Queen , along with other Andersen fairy tales ( including The Little Mermaid ) , were shelved . 
 = = = = Later efforts = = = = 
 In the late 1990s , Walt Disney Feature Animation started developing a new adaptation of The Snow Queen after the tremendous success of their recent films during the Disney Renaissance era ( 1989 - 1999 ) , but the project was scrapped completely in late 2002 , when Glen Keane reportedly quit the project and went on to work on another project which became Tangled ( 2010 ) . Even before then , Harvey Fierstein pitched his version of the story to Disney 's executives , but was turned down . Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi , Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz reportedly all tried their hand at it , but failed . After a number of unsuccessful attempts from 2000 to 2002 , Disney shelved the project again . During one of those attempts , Michael Eisner , then @-@ chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company , offered his support to the project and suggested doing it with Oscar @-@ winning director John Lasseter at Pixar Animation Studios after the then @-@ expected renewal of Pixar 's contract with Disney . But negotiations between Pixar and Disney collapsed in January 2004 and that contract was never renewed . Instead , Eisner 's successor Bob Iger negotiated Disney 's purchase of Pixar in January 2006 for $ 7 @.@ 4 billion , and Lasseter was promoted to chief creative officer of both Pixar and Disney Animation . 
 The next attempt started in 2008 , when Lasseter was able to convince Chris Buck ( who co @-@ directed the 1999 film Tarzan for the studio ) to return to Walt Disney Feature Animation from Sony Pictures Animation ( where he had recently co @-@ directed the Oscar @-@ nominated 2007 film Surf 's Up ) ; that September , Buck pitched several ideas to Lasseter , one of which was The Snow Queen . Buck later revealed that his initial inspiration for The Snow Queen was not the Andersen fairy tale itself , but that he wanted " to do something different on the definition of true love . " " Disney had already done the ' kissed by a prince ' thing , so [ I ] thought it was time for something new , " he recalled . It turned out Lasseter had been interested in The Snow Queen for a long time ; back when Pixar was working with Disney on Toy Story in the 1990s , he saw and was " blown away " by some of the pre @-@ production art from Disney 's prior attempts . Development began under the title Anna and the Snow Queen , which was planned to be traditionally animated . According to Josh Gad , he first became involved with the film at that early stage , when the plot was still relatively close to the original Andersen fairy tale and Megan Mullally was going to play Elsa . By early 2010 , the project entered development hell once again , when the studio again failed to find a way to make the story and the Snow Queen character work . 
 = = = = Revitalization = = = = 
 On December 22 , 2011 , following the success of Tangled , Disney announced a new title for the film , Frozen , and a release date of November 27 , 2013 . A month later , it was confirmed that the film would be a computer @-@ animated feature in stereoscopic 3D , instead of the originally intended hand @-@ drawn animation . Anderson @-@ Lopez and Lopez joined the project and started writing songs for Frozen in January 2012 . On March 5 , 2012 , it was announced that Buck would be directing , with Lasseter and Peter Del Vecho producing . 
 After Disney decided to advance The Snow Queen into development again , one of the main challenges Buck and Del Vecho faced was the character of the Snow Queen , who was then a villain in their drafts . The studio has a tradition of screening animated films in development every twelve weeks , then holding lengthy " notes sessions " in which its directors and screenwriters from different projects provide extensive " notes " on each other 's work . 
 Buck and Del Vecho presented their storyboards to Lasseter , and the entire production team adjourned to a conference to hear his thoughts on the project . Art director Michael Giaimo later acknowledged Lasseter as the " game changer " of the film : " I remember John saying that the latest version of The Snow Queen story that Chris Buck and his team had come up with was fun , very light @-@ hearted . But the characters didn 't resonate . They aren 't multi @-@ faceted . Which is why John felt that audiences wouldn 't really be able to connect with them . " 
 The production team then addressed the film 's problems , drafting several variations on The Snow Queen story until the characters and story felt relevant . At that stage , the first major breakthrough was the decision to rewrite the film 's protagonist , Anna ( who was based on the Gerda character from The Snow Queen ) , as the younger sibling of Elsa , thereby effectively establishing a family dynamic between the characters . This was unusual in that relationships between sisters are rarely used as a major plot element in American animated films , with the notable exception of Disney 's Lilo & Stitch ( 2002 ) . To fully explore the unique dynamics of such relationships , Disney Animation convened a " Sister Summit , " at which women from all over the studio who grew up with sisters were asked to discuss their relationships with their sisters . 
 = = = = Writing = = = = 
 In March 2012 , Jennifer Lee , one of the screenwriters of Wreck @-@ It Ralph , was brought in as the film 's screenwriter by Del Vecho . Lee later explained that as Wreck @-@ It Ralph was wrapping up , she was giving notes on other projects , and " we kind of really connected with what we were thinking . " 
 According to Lee , several core concepts were already in place from Buck and Del Vecho 's early work , such as the film 's " frozen heart " hook : " That was a concept and the phrase ... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart . " They already knew the ending involved true love in the sense of the emotional bond between siblings , not romance , in that " Anna was going to save Elsa . We didn ’ t know how or why . " Lee said Edwin Catmull , president of Disney Animation , told her early on about the film 's ending : " First and foremost , no matter what you have to do to the story , do it . But you have to earn that ending . If you do [ , ] it will be great . If you don 't , it will suck . " 
 Before Lee was brought on board , another screenwriter had made a first pass at a script , and Anderson @-@ Lopez and Lopez tried to write songs for that script but none worked and all were cut . Then " the whole script imploded , " which gave the songwriters the opportunity " to put a lot of [ their ] DNA " into the new script that Lee was writing . The production team " essentially started over and ... had 17 months , " which resulted in a very " intense schedule " and implied " a lot of choices had to be made fast . " 
 The earlier versions differed sharply from the final version . In the original script the songwriters first saw , Elsa was evil from the start ; she kidnapped Anna from her own wedding to intentionally freeze her heart , then later descended upon the town with an army of snowmen with the objective of recapturing Anna to freeze her heart properly . By the time Lee came in , the first act included Elsa deliberately striking Anna in the heart with her freezing powers ; then " the whole second act was about Anna trying to get to Hans and to kiss him and then Elsa trying to stop her . " Buck revealed that the original plot attempted to make Anna sympathetic by focusing on her frustration as being perceived as the " spare " in relation to the " heir , " Elsa . The original plot also had different pacing , in that it was " much more of an action adventure " than a musical or a comedy . 
 One major breakthrough was the composition of the song " Let It Go " by songwriters Lopez and Anderson @-@ Lopez , which forced the production team to <unk> and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex , vulnerable , and sympathetic character . In The Daily Telegraph 's words , instead of the villain envisioned by the producers , the songwriters saw Elsa as " a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift . " Lee recalled : " Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [ to be Elsa ] . Forget villain . Just what it would feel like . And this concept of letting out who she is [ , ] that she 's kept to herself for so long [ , ] and she 's alone and free , but then the sadness of the fact [ sic ] that the last moment is she 's alone . It ’ s not a perfect thing , but it 's powerful . " Del Vecho explained that " Let It Go " changed Elsa into a person " ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive , " which in turn caused Lee to " rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie . So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were . " 
 Another major breakthrough was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film 's true villain only near the end . Hans was not even in the earliest drafts , then at first was not a villain , and after becoming one , was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot . Del Vecho said , " We realized [ what ] was most important [ was ] if we were going to make the ending so surprising [ , ] you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer ... [ when ] he 's not the answer , it 's Kristoff ... [ I ] f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out [ , ] you can surprise them by turning it the other way . " Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as " sociopathic " and " twisted " throughout the final version . For example , Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters : " He mirrors [ Anna ] and he 's goofy with her ... [ T ] he Duke [ of Weselton ] is a jerk , so he 's a jerk back . And with Elsa he 's a hero . " It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna 's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans ' betrayal of Anna too predictable , in that the audience had to " feel ... her feeling something but not quite understanding it ... Because the minute it is [ understood , ] it deflated . " At one point , Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him , but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans . 
 Lee had to work through the issue of how to write Anna 's personality , in that some of her colleagues felt Anna should be more dysfunctional and co @-@ dependent , like Vanellope von Schweetz in Wreck @-@ It Ralph . Lee disagreed with that position , but it took her almost a year to figure out how to convincingly articulate " this is what Anna 's journey is . No more than that . No less than that . " In the end , Lee successfully argued Anna 's journey should be presented as a simple coming @-@ of @-@ age story , " where she goes from having a naive view of life and love – because she 's lonely – to the most sophisticated and mature view of love , where she 's capable of the ultimate love , which is sacrifice . " Lee also had to let go of some ideas that she liked , such as a scene portraying Anna and Elsa 's relationship as teenagers , which did not work because they needed to maintain the separation between Anna and Elsa . 
 To construct Anna and Elsa 's relationship as sisters , Lee found inspiration in her own relationship with her older sister . Lee said her older sister was " a big inspiration for Elsa , " called her " my Elsa " in an op @-@ ed in the Los Angeles Times , and walked the red carpet with her at the 86th Academy Awards . Lee explained , " [ h ] aving to ... lose each other and then rediscover each other as adults , that was a big part of my life . " 
 The production team also turned Olaf from Elsa 's obnoxious sidekick into Anna 's comically innocent sidekick . Lee 's initial response to the original " mean " version of Olaf had been , " Kill the f @-@ ing snowman , " and she found Olaf by far " the hardest character to deal with . " 
 The problem of how exactly Anna would save Elsa at the film 's climax was solved by story artist John Ripa . At the story meeting where Ripa pitched his take on the story , the response was silence until Lasseter said , " I 've never seen anything like that before , " which was followed by a standing ovation . 
 Along the way , the production team went through drafts where the first act included far more detail than what ended up in the final version , such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent who would have explained the backstory behind Elsa 's magical powers , and a regent for whom Lee was hoping to cast comedian Louis C.K. After all those details were thoroughly " over @-@ analyzed " , they were excised because they amounted to a " much more complex story than really we felt like we could fit in this 90 @-@ minute film . " As Del Vecho put it , " the more we tried to explain things at the beginning , the more complicated it got . " 
 Following Lee 's extensive involvement in Frozen 's development process and her close work with director Buck and songwriters Lopez and Anderson @-@ Lopez , studio heads Lasseter and Catmull promoted her to director of the film alongside Buck in August 2012 . Her promotion was officially announced on November 29 , 2012 , making Lee the first woman to direct a full @-@ length animated motion picture produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios . She primarily worked on story while Buck focused on animation . Lee later stated that she was " really moved by a lot of what Chris had done " and that they " shared a vision " of the story , having " very similar sensibilities " . 
 By November 2012 , the production team thought they had finally " cracked " the puzzle of how to make the film 's story work , but according to Del Vecho , in late February 2013 , it was realized that the film still " wasn 't working " , which necessitated even more rewriting of scenes and songs from February through June 2013 . He explained , " we rewrote songs , we took out characters and changed everything , and suddenly the movie gelled . But that was close . In hindsight , piece of cake , but during , it was a big struggle . " Looking back , Anderson @-@ Lopez joked she and Lopez thought at the time they could end up working as " birthday party clown [ s ] " if the final product " pull [ ed ] ... down " their careers and recalled that " we were really writing up until the last minute . " In June ( five months before the already @-@ announced release date ) , the songwriters finally got the film working when they composed the song " For the First Time in Forever " , which , in Lopez 's words , " became the linchpin of the whole movie . " 
 That month , Disney conducted test screenings of the half @-@ completed film with two audiences ( one made up of families and the other made up of adults ) in Phoenix , Arizona , at which Lasseter and Catmull were personally present . Lee recalled that it was the moment when they realized they " had something , because the reaction was huge . " Catmull , who had instructed Lee at the outset to " earn that ending , " told her afterwards , " you did it " . 
 = = = = Casting = = = = 
 Actress Kristen Bell was cast as the voice of Anna on March 5 , 2012 . Lee admitted that Bell 's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young , where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid , including " Part of Your World " . Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant , and subsequently re @-@ recorded some of her character 's lines after her pregnancy , as her voice had deepened . Bell was called in to re @-@ record dialogue for the film " probably 20 times , " which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving . As for her approach to the role of Anna , Bell enthused that she had " dreamed of being in a Disney animated film " since she was four years old , saying , " I always loved Disney animation , but there was something about the females that was unattainable to me . Their posture was too good and they were too well @-@ spoken , and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and <unk> and more excitable and awkward . I 'm really proud of that . " 
 Idina Menzel , a Broadway veteran , was cast as Elsa . Menzel had formerly auditioned for Tangled , but did not get the part . However , Tangled 's casting director , Jamie <unk> Roberts , preserved a recording of Menzel 's performance on her iPhone , and on the basis of that , asked her to audition along with Bell for Frozen . Before they were officially cast , Menzel and Bell deeply impressed the directors and producers at an early table read ; after reading the entire script out loud , they sang " Wind Beneath My Wings " together as a duet , since no music had been composed yet . Bell had suggested that idea when she visited Menzel at her California home to prepare together for the table read . The songwriters were also present for the table read ; Anderson @-@ Lopez said " Lasseter was in heaven " upon hearing Menzel and Bell sing in harmony , and from that moment forward , he insisted , " Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel have to be in the movie ! " Lee said , " They sung [ sic ] it like sisters and what you mean to me [ , ] [ a ] nd there wasn 't a dry eye in the house after they sang . " Between December 2012 and June 2013 , the casting of additional roles was announced , including Jonathan Groff as Kristoff , Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton , Santino Fontana as Prince Hans , and Josh Gad as Olaf .

 Similar to Tangled , Frozen employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) and traditional hand @-@ drawn animation . From the beginning , Buck knew Giaimo was the best candidate to develop the style he had in mind – which would draw from the best Disney hand @-@ drawn classics of the 1950s , the Disney Little Golden Books , and mid @-@ century modern design – and persuaded him to come back to Disney to serve as the art director for Frozen . Buck , Lasseter , and Giaimo were all old friends who had first met at the California Institute of the Arts , and Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney 's Pocahontas ( 1995 ) , which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator . 
 To create the look of Frozen , Giaimo began pre @-@ production research by reading extensively about the entire region of Scandinavia and visiting the Danish @-@ themed city of Solvang near Los Angeles , but eventually zeroed in on Norway in particular because " 80 percent " of the visuals that appealed to him were from Norway . Disney eventually sponsored three research field trips . Animators and special effects specialists were dispatched to Jackson Hole , Wyoming , to experience walking , running , and falling in deep snow in a variety of types of attire , including long skirts ( which both female and male personnel tried on ) ; while lighting and arts teams visited an Ice Hotel in Quebec City , Quebec to study how light reflects and refracts on snow and ice . Finally , Giaimo and several artists traveled to Norway to draw inspiration from its mountains , fjords , architecture , and culture . " We had a very short time schedule for this film , so our main focus was really to get the story right but we knew that John Lasseter is keen on truth in the material and creating a believable world , and again that doesn 't mean it 's a realistic world – but a believable one . It was important to see the scope and scale of Norway , and important for our animators to know what it 's like , " Del Vecho said . " There is a real feeling of Lawrence of Arabia scope and scale to this , " he finished . 
 During 2012 , while Giaimo and the animators and artists conducted preparatory research and developed the film 's overall look , the production team was still struggling to develop a compelling script , as explained above . That problem was not adequately solved until November 2012 , and the script would later require even more significant revisions after that point . As a result , the single " most daunting " challenge facing the animation team was a short schedule of less than 12 months to turn Lee 's still @-@ evolving shooting script into an actual film . Other films like Pixar 's Toy Story 2 had been successfully completed on even shorter schedules , but a short schedule necessarily meant " late nights , overtime , and stress . " Lee estimated the total size of the entire team on Frozen to be around 600 to 650 people , " including around 70 lighting people [ , ] 70 @-@ plus animators , " and 15 to 20 storyboard artists . 
 Del Vecho explained how the film 's animation team was organized : " On this movie we do have character leads , supervising animators on specific characters . The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it 's always under one lead . I think it was different on Tangled , for example , but we chose to do it this way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew . Hyrum Osmond , the animator on Olaf , is quiet but he has a funny , wacky personality so we knew he 'd bring a lot of comedy to it ; Anna 's animator , Becky Bresee , it 's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna . " Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the film 's animators understand the characters they were creating . In order to get the general feeling of each scene , some animators did their own acting . " I actually film myself acting the scene out , which I find very helpful , " said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee . This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable . Elsa 's supervising animator was Wayne Unten , who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character . Unten carefully developed Elsa 's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna 's fearlessness . He also studied videos from Menzel 's recording sessions and animated Elsa 's breathing to match Menzel 's breathing . Head of Animation , Lino DiSalvo , said , " The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you 've ever seen . " 
 Regarding the look and nature of the film 's cinematography , Giaimo was greatly influenced by Jack Cardiff 's work in Black Narcissus . According to him , it lent a hyper @-@ reality to the film : " Because this is a movie with such scale and we have the Norwegian fjords to draw from , I really wanted to explore the depth . From a design perspective , since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects , and what the fjords provide , it was perfect . We encased the sibling story in scale . " Ted D. McCord 's work in The Sound of Music was another major influence for Giaimo . It was also Giaimo 's idea that Frozen should be filmed in the CinemaScope aspect ratio , which was approved by Lasseter . Giaimo also wanted to ensure that Norway 's fjords , architecture and rosemaling folk art , were critical factors in designing the environment of Arendelle . Giaimo , whose background is in traditional animation , said that the art design environment represents a unity of character and environment and that he originally wanted to incorporate saturated colors , which is typically ill @-@ advised in computer animation . For further authenticity , a live reindeer named Sage was brought into the studio for animators to study its movements and mannerisms for the character Sven . 
 Another important issue Giaimo insisted on addressing was costumes , in that he " knew from the start " it would be a " costume film . " To realize that vision , he brought in character designer Jean Gillmore to act as a dedicated " costume designer " . While traditional animation simply integrates costume design with character design and treats clothing as merely part of the characters , computer @-@ generated animation regards costume as almost a separate entity with its own properties and behaviors – and Frozen required a level of as @-@ yet untried detail , down to minutiae like fabrics , buttons , trim , and stitching . Gillmore explained that her " general approach was to meld the historic silhouettes of 1840 Western Europe ( give or take ) , with the shapes and garment relationships and details of folk costume in early Norway , circa 19th century . " This meant using primarily wool fabric with accents of velvet , linen , and silk . During production , Giaimo and Gillmore " ran around " supplying various departments with real @-@ world samples to use as references ; they were able to draw upon both the studio 's own in @-@ house library of fabric samples and the resources of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts ' costume division in Fullerton , California . The film 's " look development artists " ( the Disney job title for texture artists ) created the digitally painted simulation of the appearance of surfaces , while other departments dealt with movement , rigging and weight , thickness and lighting of textile animation . 
 During production , the film 's English title was changed from The Snow Queen to Frozen , a decision that drew comparisons to another Disney film , Tangled . Peter Del Vecho explained that " the title Frozen came up independently of the title Tangled . It 's because , to us , it represents the movie . Frozen plays on the level of ice and snow but also the frozen relationship , the frozen heart that has to be thawed . We don 't think of comparisons between Tangled and Frozen , though . " He also mentioned that the film will still retain its original title , The Snow Queen , in some countries : " because that just resonated stronger in some countries than Frozen . Maybe there 's a richness to The Snow Queen in the country 's heritage and they just wanted to emphasize that . " 
 = = = Technology development = = = 
 The studio also developed several new tools to generate realistic and believable shots , particularly the heavy and deep snow and its interactions with the characters . Disney wanted an " all @-@ encompassing " and organic tool to provide snow effects but not require switching between different methods . As noted above , several Disney artists and special effects personnel traveled to Wyoming to experience walking through deep snow . Dr. Kenneth <unk> , a professor from the California Institute of Technology , was invited to give lectures to the effects group on how snow and ice form , and why snowflakes are unique . Using this knowledge , the effects group created a snowflake generator that allowed them to randomly create 2 @,@ 000 unique snowflake shapes for the film . 
 Another challenge that the studio had to face was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky quality . According to principal software engineer Andrew Selle , " [ Snow ] ' s not really a fluid . It ’ s not really a solid . It breaks apart . It can be compressed into snowballs . All of these different effects are very difficult to capture simultaneously . " In order to achieve this , software engineers used advanced mathematics ( the material point method ) and physics , with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles to create a snow simulator software application called Matterhorn . The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in the film , including several key sequences . Software engineer Alexey <unk> referred to snow as " an important character in the film , " therefore it attracted special attention from the filmmakers . " When you stretch it , snow will break into chunks . Since snow doesn 't have any connections , it doesn 't have a mesh , it can break very easily . So that was an important property we took advantage of , " explained Selle . " There you see [ Kristoff ] walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk up and you see [ Anna ] being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces . It 's very organic how that happens . You don 't see that they 're pieces already – you see the snow as one thing and then breaking up . " The tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow , as it ensured that the snow reacted naturally to each step . 
 Other tools designed to help artists complete complicated effects included Spaces , which allowed Olaf 's <unk> parts to be moved around and rebuilt , Flourish , which allowed extra movement such as leaves and twigs to be art @-@ directed ; Snow <unk> , which helped preview the final look of the snow , especially when characters were interacting with an area of snow by walking through a volume , and Tonic , which enabled artists to sculpt their characters ' hair as procedural volumes . Tonic also aided in animating fur and hair elements such as Elsa 's hair , which contains 420 @,@ 000 computer @-@ generated strands , while the average number for a real human being is only 100 @,@ 000 . The number of character rigs in Frozen is 312 and the number of simulated costumes also reached 245 cloth rigs , which were far beyond all other Disney films to date . Fifty effects artists and lighting artists worked together on the technology to create " one single shot " in which Elsa builds her ice palace . Its complexity required 30 hours to render each frame , with 4 @,@ 000 computers rendering one frame at a time . 
 Besides 3D effects , the filmmakers also used 2D artwork and drawings for specific elements and sequences in the film , including Elsa 's magic and snow sculptures , as well as freezing fountains and floors . The effects group created a " capture stage " where the entire world of Frozen gets displayed on monitors , which can be " filmed " on special cameras to operate a three @-@ dimensional scene . " We can take this virtual set that 's mimicking all of my actions and put it into any one of our scenes in the film , " said technology manager Evan Goldberg . 
 = = = Scandinavian and Sámi inspiration = = = 
 The setting was principally based on Norway , and the cultural influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture . Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film , including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo , the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim , and Bryggen in Bergen . Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are also included in the film , such as stave churches , trolls , Viking ships , a hot spring , Fjord horses , clothes , and food such as <unk> . A maypole is also present in the film , as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa 's father opens to figure out where the trolls live . A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly . The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture , such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these , clothing styles ( the outfits of the ice cutters ) , and parts of the musical score . Decorations , such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff 's sled , are also in styles inspired by Sámi <unk> decorations . During their field work in Norway , Disney 's team , for inspiration , visited <unk> , a Sámi family @-@ owned company in the village <unk> that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events . Arendelle was inspired by <unk> , a branch of Norway 's longest fjord Sognefjorden , which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand @-@ painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom 's royal castle interior . 
 The filmmakers ' trip to Norway provided essential knowledge for the animators to come up with the design aesthetic for the film in terms of color , light , and atmosphere . According to Giaimo , there were three important factors that they had acquired from the Norway research trip : the fjords , which are the massive vertical rock formations , and serve as the setting for the secluded kingdom of Arendelle ; the medieval stave churches , whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired the castle compound ; and the rosemaling folk art , whose distinctive paneling and grid patterns informed the architecture , decor , and costumes . 
 = = = Music and sound design = = = 
 The songs for Frozen were written and composed by the husband @-@ and @-@ wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson @-@ Lopez , both of whom had previously worked with Disney Animation on Winnie the Pooh ( 2011 ) ( also produced by Del Vecho , who then hired them for Frozen ) and before that , with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo – The Musical ( 2007 ) . Lopez first heard Disney Animation 's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon , but Disney was so eager to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson @-@ Lopez ( who was busy raising the couple 's two young daughters ) . Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife 's strong story talent . The decision , of course , was easy : " Whenever Disney asks if you want to do a fairy tale musical , you say yes . " 
 About 23 minutes of the film are dedicated to their musical numbers . Because they live in New York City , collaborating closely with the production team in Burbank required two @-@ hour @-@ long transcontinental <unk> nearly every weekday for about 14 months . For each song they composed , they recorded a demo in their home studio ( with both of them singing the lyrics and Lopez accompanying on piano ) , then emailed it to Burbank for discussion at the next videoconference . Lopez and Anderson @-@ Lopez were aware of the fact that their work would be compared to that of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman from the Disney Renaissance era , and whenever they felt lost , they asked " What would Ashman do ? " In the end , they wrote 25 songs for the film , of which eight made it into the final version . One song ( " For the First Time in Forever " ) had a reprise and the other ( " Let It Go " ) was covered by Demi Lovato over the final credits , for a total of ten songs . Seven of the 17 that did not make it were later released on the deluxe edition soundtrack . 
 In February 2013 , Christophe Beck was hired to score the film , following his work on Paperman , a Disney animated short film released the year prior to Frozen . It was revealed on September 14 , 2013 , that Sámi musician Frode <unk> 's <unk> <unk> would be the film 's opening song , as it contains elements of the traditional Sámi singing style <unk> . The music producers recruited a Norwegian linguist to assist with the lyrics for an Old Norse song written for Elsa 's coronation and traveled to Trondheim , Norway , to record the all @-@ female choir Cantus , for a piece inspired by traditional Sámi music . 
 Under the supervision of sound engineer David Boucher , the lead cast members began recording the film 's vocal tracks in October 2012 at the Sunset Sound recording studio in Hollywood before the songs had been orchestrated , meaning they heard only Lopez 's demo piano track in their headphones as they sang . Most of the dialogue was recorded at the Roy E. Disney Animation Building in Burbank under the supervision of original dialogue mixer Gabriel Guy , who also mixed the film 's sound effects . Some dialogue was recorded after recording songs at both Sunset Sound and Capitol Studios ; for scenes involving Anna and Elsa , both studios offered vocal isolation booths where Menzel and Bell could read dialogue with line @-@ of @-@ sight with one another , while avoiding " <unk> " between their respective tracks . Additional dialogue was recorded at an ADR facility on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank ( across the street from the Disney Animation building ) and at the Soundtrack Group 's New York studio , since the production team had to work around the busy schedules of the film 's New York @-@ based cast members like Fontana . 
 Lopez and Anderson @-@ Lopez 's piano @-@ vocal scores for the songs along with the vocal tracks were sent to Salem , Oregon @-@ based Dave Metzger for arrangement and orchestration ; Metzger also orchestrated a significant portion of Beck 's score . 
 For the orchestral film score , Beck paid homage to the <unk> and <unk> @-@ inspired setting by employing regional instruments , such as the <unk> , and traditional vocal techniques , such as <unk> . Beck worked with Lopez and Anderson @-@ Lopez on incorporating their songs into arrangements in the score . The trio 's goal " was to create a cohesive musical journey from beginning to end . " Similarly , Beck 's scoring mixer , Casey Stone ( who also supervised the recording of the score ) , worked with Boucher to align their microphone setups to ensure the transitions between the songs and score were seamless , even though they were separately recorded on different dates . The final orchestrations of both the songs and score were all recorded at the Eastwood Scoring Stage on the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank by an 80 @-@ piece orchestra , featuring 32 vocalists , including native Norwegian Christine Hals . Boucher supervised the recording of Anderson @-@ Lopez and Lopez 's songs from July 22 to 24 , 2013 , then Stone supervised the recording of Beck 's score from September 3 to 6 and 9 to 10 . Boucher mixed the songs at the Eastwood stage , while Stone mixed the score at Beck 's personal studio in Santa Monica , California . 
 Regarding the sound of Frozen , director Jennifer Lee stated that sound played a huge part in making the film " visceral " and " transported " ; she explained , " [ i ] n letting it tell the story emotionally , the sound of the ice when it 's at its most dangerous just makes you shudder . " The complete silence at the climax of the film right after Anna freezes was Lasseter 's idea , one he " really wanted " . In that scene , even the ambient sound that would normally be there was taken out in order to make it feel unusual . Lee explained " that was a moment where we wanted everything to feel suspended . " 
 To obtain certain snow and ice sound effects , sound designer Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain , California , to record them at a frozen lake . However , the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the Warner Bros. lot by a Warner Bros. crew . The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds ( 22 @.@ 6 kg ) of snow ice while working , to help them record all the necessary snow and ice sounds for the film . Because the film 's visuals were finalized so late , five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded ( corresponding to five different types of snow ) , then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in the final version of each scene . One issue that the production team was " particular " about was the sound of Elsa 's footsteps in the ice palace , which required eight attempts , including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on ice ; they ended up using a mix of three sounds . 
 Although the vocals , music , sound effects , and almost all the dialogue were all recorded elsewhere , the final re @-@ recording mix to Dolby Atmos format was performed at the Disney lot by Casey E. <unk> of Disney Digital Studio Services . 
 = = = Localization = = = 
 Like other Disney media products which are often localized through Disney Character Voices International , Frozen was translated and dubbed into 41 languages ( compared with only 15 for The Lion King ) . A major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching Menzel 's warm vocal tone and three @-@ octave vocal range in their native languages . Rick Dempsey , the unit 's senior executive , regarded the process of translating the film as " exceptionally challenging " ; he explained , " It 's a difficult juggling act to get the right intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music . And then you have to go back and adjust for lip sync ! [ It ] ... requires a lot of patience and precision . " Lopez explained that they were told by Disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs , to ensure the film was easily translatable and had globally appealing lyrics . For the casting of dubbed versions , Disney required native speakers in order to " ensure that the film feels ' local ' . " They used Bell and Menzel 's voices as their " blueprint " in casting , and tried to match the voices " as much as possible , " meaning that they auditioned approximately 200 singers to fill the 41 slots for Elsa alone . For nearly 15 dubbed versions , they cast Elsa 's singing and speaking parts separately , since not all vocalists could act the part they were singing . After casting all the other roles for all 41 languages , the international cast ended up including more than 900 people , who voiced their roles through approximately 1 @,@ 300 recording sessions .

 = = = Trademark infringement lawsuit = = = 
 In late December 2013 , The Walt Disney Company filed a trademark infringement lawsuit in California federal court seeking an injunction against the continued distribution of the Canadian film The Legend of Sarila produced by 10th Ave Productions and <unk> Film & TV and distributed by Phase 4 Films , which had been retitled Frozen Land . Disney alleged that less than three weeks prior to the release of Frozen , Phase 4 theatrically released The Legend of Sarila , which garnered " minimal box office revenues and received no significant attention " ; and to trade off the success of Disney 's animated film , Phase 4 had " redesigned the artwork , packaging , logo , and other promotional materials for its newly ( and intentionally misleadingly ) retitled film to mimic those used by [ Disney ] for Frozen and related merchandise " . While film titles cannot be trademarked by law , Disney cited a number of alleged similarities between the new Phase 4 's Frozen logo and Disney 's original one . By late January 2014 , the two companies had settled the case ; the settlement stated that the distribution and promotion of The Legend of Sarila and related merchandise must use its original title and Phase 4 must not use trademarks , logos or other designs confusingly similar to Disney 's animated release . Phase 4 was also required to pay Disney $ 100 @,@ 000 before January 27 , 2014 , and make " all practicable efforts " to remove copies of Frozen Land from stores and online distributors before March 3 , 2014 .

 Ray Subers , writing for Box Office Mojo , compared the film to Disney 's 2010 animated feature Tangled by saying that the film 's story was not as " immediately interesting " and its marketing was aimed at boys ( similar to that of Tangled ) .

Chris Agar from ScreenRant expressed a similar opinion ; he cited a string of recent box office successes of the studio , and thought that Frozen would fill a void of kid @-@ friendly films in the marketplace , but did not expect it to surpass Catching Fire in terms of box office gross . 
 Clayton Dillard of Slant Magazine commented that while the trailers made the film seem " pallid , " positive critical reviews could attract interest from both " core demographics " and adult audiences , and therefore he believed Frozen stood a good chance of surpassing Tangled 's Thanksgiving three @-@ day opening record . Brad Brevet of <unk> described the film 's marketing as a " severely hit and miss " campaign , which could affect its box office performance . After Frozen finished its first weekend with a record $ 93 @.@ 6 million during Thanksgiving , most box @-@ office watchers predicted that it would end up grossing between $ 250 and $ 300 million in North America . Breitbart suggested that with " strong buzz " and " huge family audience support , " Frozen would " easily break the $ 130 million " mark in North America . At the time , Box Office Mojo reissued a $ 250 million box office gross prediction for North America . Box Office Mojo noted that it would be " the exclusive choice for family audiences " and attributed its successful opening to strong word @-@ of @-@ mouth and the studio 's marketing , which highlighted the connection between Frozen and Disney 's previous successful releases like Tangled and Wreck @-@ It Ralph , as well as the elements of humor . In an interview conducted in early December 2013 , Disney 's distribution executive Dave Hollis praised the efforts of the filmmakers and the studio 's marketing team : " For a company whose foundation is built on animation , an opening like this is really great . " He further commented that audiences could be " very targeted with a message " , and that Frozen aimed at a general audience instead of any one particular audience segment . 
 When Frozen became a box office success , Bilge Ebiri of Vulture analyzed the film 's elements and suggested eight factors that might have led to its success . He thought Frozen managed to capture the classic Disney spirit of the Disney Renaissance films and early classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella . He also wrote that the film has Olaf , a " wisecracking , irreverent " sidekick with mild humor which is " a requirement of modern animated kids ' movies , " and its " witty , catchy " songs were " pretty good . " Furthermore , Ebiri noted that Frozen was a " revisionist " film that didn 't " have a typical villain " ; Elsa , the person who should be the villain didn 't turn out to be a villain , but " a girl who 's having trouble . " She was the one who " [ created ] most of the challenges [ for ] the film 's more typical heroes – Princess Anna . " The story of two sisters who were separated as they grew up held real @-@ life overtones for many audience members who had siblings , and the struggle of Elsa to overcome the shame and fear of her powers was also relatable . Finally , he identified several factors which he believed attracted female audiences : two strong female characters ; a twist on the usual romantic subplot , when the traditional " Prince Charming " – Hans – turned out to be a gold @-@ digging villain ; and the " act of true love " which saved Anna was her own sacrifice in saving Elsa . 
 Scott Davis of Forbes credited the film 's commercial success to its marketing aimed at both sexes , and to the success of its soundtrack . 
 The commercial success of Frozen in Japan was considered to be a " phenomenon " which received widespread media coverage . Released in that market as Anna and the Snow Queen , the film increased its gross each week in its three first weeks of release , and only started to drop in the fourth ; while other films usually peak in the opening week and decline in the latter ones . Frozen has received over 7 million admissions in Japan as of April 16 , and nearly 18 @.@ 7 million admissions as of June 23 . Many cinemagoers were reported to have watched both the original and the Japanese @-@ dubbed version . Japan Today also reported that the local dubbed version was " particularly popular " in the country . Gavin J. Blair of The Hollywood Reporter commented on the film 's earnings in Japan : " Even after its $ 9 @.@ 6 million ( ￥ 986 @.@ 4 million ) three @-@ day opening , a record bow for a Disney animation in Japan , few would have predicted the kind of numbers Frozen has now racked up . " Disney 's head of distribution Dave Hollis said in an interview that " It 's become very clear that the themes and emotions of Frozen transcend geography , but what 's going on in Japan is extraordinary . " 
 " Frozen 's success doesn 't benefit from a general appetite for American films in Japan " ( as reported by the International Business Times ) , but according to Akira <unk> of the USC School of Cinematic Arts , there were several factors that constituted this phenomenon : besides the fact that animated films " are held in great regard in Japan , and the Disney brand name with all of its heritage is extremely valuable " , " the biggest reason is the primary audience ... 13- to 17 @-@ year @-@ old teenage girls . " He further explained that audiences of this age range have a vital role in shaping Japanese pop culture and " Frozen has so many elements that appeal to them , with its story of a young girl with power and mystique , who finds her own sort of good in herself . " He compared the film 's current situation with a similar phenomenon which occurred with Titanic in 1997 , " when millions of Japanese teen girls turned out to watch Leonard [ o ] DiCaprio go under – several times , " and thought the same would happen with Frozen . Another reason that contributed to the film 's success in the market was that Disney took great care in choosing " high quality " voice actors for the Japanese @-@ dubbed version , since Japan 's pop music scene had an important role particularly with teenage audiences . <unk> <unk> , Disney Japan 's marketing project leader for Frozen , said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal : " We really put effort into finding actors who could not only play the role but also belt out the tunes as well . We found the perfect match in Takako Matsu and Sayaka Kanda , and they really added a whole new dimension to the storytelling . " 
 When asked about the success of Frozen , director Chris Buck stated : " We never expected anything like this . We just hoped to make a movie that did as well as Tangled ! I hoped the audience would embrace it and respond to it , but there 's no way we could have predicted this . " He cited a number of reasons for the film 's popularity : " There are characters that people relate to ; the songs are so strong and memorable . We also have some flawed characters , which is what Jen [ <unk> Lee ] and I like to do – we essentially create two imperfect princesses . " He also said that what people could infer from the film had " blow [ n ] [ him ] away . " As Frozen approached the first anniversary of its release , Menzel mentioned the film 's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview : " It ’ s just a remarkable thing . Usually you do a project and it has its moment . This just feels like it keeps going . "

 Frozen opened to highly positive reviews , with several critics comparing it favorably to the films of the Disney Renaissance , particularly The Little Mermaid , Beauty and the Beast , Aladdin , and The Lion King . Some journalists felt that the film 's success marked a second Disney Renaissance . The film was praised for its visuals , themes , musical numbers , screenplay , and voice acting , especially that of Kristen Bell , Idina Menzel , and Josh Gad . The " Let It Go " musical sequence was also particularly praised by critics . The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 89 % of critics gave the film a positive review based on 216 reviews , with the site 's consensus being : " Beautifully animated , smartly written , and stocked with singalong songs , Frozen adds another worthy entry to the Disney canon . " Metacritic , which determines a normalized rating out of 100 from the reviews of mainstream critics , calculated a score of 74 based on 43 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews . " CinemaScore gave Frozen an " A + " on an A + to F scale , based on polls conducted during the opening weekend . Surveys conducted by Fandango among 1 @,@ 000 ticket buyers revealed that 75 % of purchasers had seen the film at least once , and 52 % had seen it twice . It was also pointed out that 55 % of audiences identified " Let It Go " as their favorite song , while " Do You Want to Build a Snowman ? " and " For the First Time in Forever " held proportions of 21 % and 9 % , respectively . Frozen was named the seventh best film of 2013 by Richard Corliss of Time and Kyle Smith of the New York Post . 
 Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote that the film is " the best animated musical to come out of Disney since the tragic death of lyricist Howard Ashman , whose work on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast helped build the studio 's modern animated division into what it is today . " He also said that " while it lags the tiniest bit on its way to the conclusion , the script ... really delivers ; it offers characters to care about , along with some nifty twists and surprises along the way . " Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter observed Frozen as a true musical and wrote , " You can practically see the Broadway musical Frozen is destined to become while watching Disney 's 3D animated princess tale . " McCarthy described the film as " energetic , humorous and not too cloying , as well as the first Hollywood film in many years to warn of global cooling rather than warming , this tuneful toon upgrades what has been a lackluster year for big studio animated fare and , beginning with its Thanksgiving opening , should live up to box office expectations as one of the studio 's hoped @-@ for holiday @-@ spanning blockbusters . " Kyle Smith of the New York Post awarded the film 3 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars and praised the film as " a great big snowy pleasure with an emotionally gripping core , brilliant Broadway @-@ style songs and a crafty plot . Its first and third acts are better than the jokey middle , but this is the rare example of a Walt Disney Animation Studios effort that reaches as deep as a Pixar film . " Scott Mendelson of Forbes wrote , " Frozen is both a declaration of Disney 's renewed cultural relevance and a reaffirmation of Disney coming to terms with its own legacy and its own identity . It 's also a just plain terrific bit of family entertainment . " 
 The Los Angeles Times extolled the film 's ensemble voice talent and elaborate musical sequences , and declared Frozen was " a welcome return to greatness for Walt Disney Animation Studios . " Entertainment Weekly 's Owen Gleiberman gave the film a " B + " grade and labeled it as a " squarely enchanting fairy tale that shows you how the definition of what 's fresh in animation can shift . " Richard Corliss of Time stated that : " It 's great to see Disney returning to its roots and blooming anew : creating superior musical entertainment that draws on the Walt [ Disney ] tradition of animation splendor and the verve of Broadway present . " Richard Roeper wrote that the film was an " absolute delight from start to finish . " Both Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune and Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film 's characters and musical sequences , which also drew comparisons to the theatrics found in Wicked . Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy awarded the film five out of five stars and called the film " a new Disney classic " and " an exhilarating , joyous , human story that 's as frequently laugh @-@ out @-@ loud funny as it is startling and daring and poignant . Hot on the heels of the 90th anniversary , it 's impossible to imagine a more perfect celebration of everything Disney is at its best . " Frozen was also praised in Norwegian Sámi media as showcasing Sámi culture to a broad audience in a good way . Composer Frode <unk> was lauded by Norwegian Sámi President <unk> <unk> for his contributions to the film , during the President 's 2014 New Year 's speech . 
 Scott Foundas of Variety was less impressed with the film , describing it as " formulaic " , though he praised its voice acting and technical artistry : " The tactile , snow @-@ capped Arendelle landscape , including Elsa 's ice @-@ castle retreat is Frozen 's other true marvel , enhanced by 3D and the decision to shoot in widescreen – a nod to the CinemaScope richness of Sleeping Beauty and Lady and the Tramp ... That 's almost but not quite enough to make up for the somewhat slack plotting and the generic nature of the main characters . Neither princess here is a patch on Tangled 's babe @-@ in @-@ the @-@ woods Rapunzel , while both Hans and Kristoff are cut from pretty standard @-@ issue hero cloth until a reasonably surprising third @-@ act twist somewhat ups the ante . Only Olaf is unimpeachable : Get this snowman a spinoff feature to call his own . " The Seattle Times gave the film two out of four stars , stating that " While it is an often gorgeous film with computer @-@ generated fjords and ice sculptures and castle interiors , the important thing that glues all this stuff together – story – is sadly lacking . " Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch also criticized the story as the film 's weakest point . Writing on Roger Ebert 's website , Christy Lemire gave a mixed review in which she awarded two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . Lemire praised the visuals and the performance of " Let It Go , " as well as the positive messages Frozen sends . However , she referred to the film as " cynical " and criticized it as an " attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much . " She also noted the similarity between Elsa and another well @-@ known fictional female who unleashes paranormal powers when agitated , Carrie White .

 Allegations of sexism occurred following a statement by Lino DiSalvo , the film 's head of animation , who said to Fan Voice 's Jenna Busch : " Historically speaking , animating female characters are really , really difficult , because they have to go through these range of emotions , but you have to keep them pretty . " However , a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo 's quote was widely misinterpreted , stating that he was " describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters . " Director Lee also said that DiSalvo 's words were recklessly taken out of context , and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation . " It is hard no matter what the gender is . I felt horrible for him , " she said . In an August 2014 interview , DiSalvo re @-@ emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context – the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model : " Translating that emotional range onto a CG character is one of the most difficult parts of the process . Male . Female . Snowman . Animal . " He added , " The really sad thing is people took that ... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere . People didn 't get back to me for comments and the sad thing is that 's the way the internet works . They don 't want the truth . "

 Several viewers outside the film industry , such as evangelical pastors and commentators , argued that Frozen promotes normalization of homosexuality , while others believed that the main character , Elsa , represents a positive image of LGBT youth , viewing the film and the song " Let It Go " as a metaphor for coming out . These claims were met with mixed reactions from both audiences and the LGBT community . When asked about perceptions of a homosexual undertone in the film , Lee said , " We know what we made . But at the same time I feel like once we hand the film over , it belongs to the world , so I don 't like to say anything , and let the fans talk . I think it 's up to them . " She also mentioned that Disney films were made in different eras and were all celebrated for different reasons , but a 2013 film would have a " 2013 point of view " .

 Frozen was nominated for various awards and won a number of them , including several for Best Animated Feature . The song " Let It Go " was particularly praised . The film was nominated for two Golden Globes at the 71st Golden Globe Awards and won for Best Animated Feature , becoming the first Walt Disney Animation Studios film to win in this category . It also won two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song ( " Let It Go " ) , the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film at the British Academy Film Awards ( BAFTA ) , five Annie Awards ( including Best Animated Feature ) , and two Critics ' Choice Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song ( " Let It Go " ) . It received other similar nominations at the Satellite Awards , and various critics ' groups and circles . At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards , the Frozen soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack For Visual Media and was nominated for Best Score Soundtrack For Visual Media ( with credits going to Christophe Beck as composer ) ; the song " Let It Go " won the award for Best Song Written For Visual Media , with credits going to Kristen Anderson @-@ Lopez and Robert Lopez as songwriters and Idina Menzel as performer . 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 During the spring and summer of 2014 , several journalists observed that Frozen was unusually catchy in comparison to the vast majority of films , in that many children in both the U.S. and the UK were watching Frozen so many times that they now knew all the songs by heart and kept singing them again and again at every opportunity , to the distress of their hapless parents , teachers , and classmates . Among the celebrities who have disclosed that they are the parent of a Frozen @-@ obsessed child are UK prime minister David Cameron as well as actors Amy Adams , Ben Affleck , Kevin Costner and Vince Vaughn . When Terry Gross brought up this phenomenon with songwriters Lopez and Anderson @-@ Lopez in an April 2014 interview on NPR , they explained there was simply no way they could have known how popular their work on Frozen would become . They were " just trying to tell a story that resonated " and " that didn 't suck . " 
 In May , columnist Joel Stein of Time magazine wrote about his young son Laszlo 's frustration with the inescapable " cultural assault " of Frozen at preschool and all social and extracurricular activities , and how he had arranged for a Skype call with lead actress Bell after Laszlo began asking why the film was made . When Laszlo asked whether Bell knew when she made Frozen that it would take over kids ' lives , she replied : " I did not know that people would not let it go . No pun intended . " In a December 2014 interview with The Hollywood Reporter , Lee acknowledged that she had transitioned from thanking people when they expressed their appreciation for Frozen to having to apologize when they said " we 're still listening to those songs " ( with their children ) . Lee also said that she used the film and its strong female characters to inspire her own daughter , who had experienced bullying at school , and admitted that she herself as a child was bullied as well ; thus , they had managed to be true to themselves like Anna and Elsa . 
 In a 2014 mid @-@ year report of the 100 most @-@ used baby names conducted by <unk> , Elsa was ranked 88 ; it was the first time the name had appeared on the site 's chart . Sarah Barrett , managing director of the site , explained that while the film 's popular heroine is called Anna , " Elsa offers a more unique name and is also a strong female role model . " Many parents revealed that their choices of name were " heavily influenced " by the siblings . Vice president of Disney UK Anna Hill later commented that " We 're delighted that Elsa is a popular name for babies and it 's lovely to hear that for many families , it is actually their siblings who have chosen it , " and that " Elsa 's fight to overcome her fears and the powerful strength of the family bond " were relatable to many families . On 2014 year @-@ end lists issued by Google , Frozen was the most searched movie of 2014 .

 In January 2014 , Iger announced that Frozen would be adapted into a Broadway stage musical . In the space of a single business quarter , Iger went from speaking of Frozen 's " franchise potential " ( in February 2014 ) to saying that it was " probably " one of Disney 's " top five franchises " ( in May 2014 ) . The film 's massive popularity resulted in an unusually severe merchandise shortage in the United States and several other industrialized countries in April 2014 , which caused resale prices for higher @-@ quality limited @-@ edition Frozen dolls and costumes to skyrocket past $ 1 @,@ 000 on eBay . By the time the merchandise shortage was finally resolved in early November 2014 ( nearly a year after the film 's release ) , Disney had sold over three million Frozen costumes in North America alone . Wait times for the meet @-@ and @-@ greets at Disney Parks soon regularly exceeded four hours and forced management in February 2014 to indefinitely extend what was originally intended as a temporary film promotion . Disney Parks later put on a temporary event ( Frozen Summer Fun ) at Disney 's Hollywood Studios , then announced on September 12 , 2014 , that the Maelstrom ride at Epcot 's Norway pavilion would be closed and replaced with a Frozen @-@ based attraction , which opened in early 2016 .

 The Boat Race is an annual rowing eight competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge . First held in 1829 , the competition is a 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) race along The Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 2004 race by six lengths , and led overall with 78 victories to Oxford 's 71 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) .

 = Magnetic Rag = 
 " Magnetic Rag " is a 1914 ragtime piano composition by American composer Scott Joplin . It is significant for being the last rag which Joplin published in his lifetime , three years before his death in 1917 . It is also unique in form and in some of the musical techniques employed in the composition . 
 = = Background = = 
 " Magnetic Rag " was written by an ailing Joplin near the end of his career , when interest in ragtime was waning . He was suffering from the latter stages of syphilis , the disease from which he died only three years later . Possibly as a result of Joplin 's mood at this time , the piece expresses a melancholy almost entirely unheard in his earlier works . 
 = = Form = = 
 While many of Joplin 's piano rags fit the classic rag scheme , " Magnetic Rag " is unique in its form of <unk> . Due to its novelty at the time , the form has been described as " progressive " . It has been suggested that Joplin was trying to merge ragtime elements with the classical sonata form . The form is cyclic : that is , the opening melody is revisited at the end of the piece . Cyclic form is rare among Joplin 's rags . 
 Joplin 's usage of Italian tempo indications in " Magnetic Rag " has been interpreted as his intention to give the piece a serious aspect in a similar manner to <unk> and " Scott Joplin 's New Rag " . " Magnetic Rag " begins with the instruction " Allegretto ma non troppo " ( moderately fast , but not too much ) and continues in the D strain with " Tempo l <unk> " ( tempo remains the same ) , a warning against slowing down for the minor @-@ mode section . As well , Joplin employed in " Magnetic Rag " the classic " common time " 4 / 4 time signature instead of the more usual 2 / 4 time of rag tunes . Simultaneously , Joplin doubled all the note values , effectively making the unusual 4 / 4 time signature have no practical effect on the way the piece sounded or the way it was performed . His publishing it in 4 / 4 was simply a way to connect the rag with classical and popular piano works of prior fame . Since Joplin published " Magnetic Rag " himself , it has been suggested that the composition fully reflected his wishes and contained no compromises . 
 Joplin produced " Magnetic Rag " during what several musicologists consider to be his experimental period . It was at this time that Joplin attempted to write rags that were not confined to the standard " oom @-@ pah " left @-@ hand beat and that incorporated several other novelties . 
 Like the classic rag , " Magnetic Rag " begins with a four @-@ bar introduction . Since it is featured at both the beginning and end of the piece , the melody of the A strain is possibly the most recognizable melody in the piece . Much of this melody is in the mode of B @-@ flat major , the main key of the entire piece ; however , during bars 11 and 12 , the mode shifts to G minor . This shift demonstrates one of Joplin 's late @-@ life techniques : establishing a foreign key within the framework of a strain . 
 The second , third , and fourth strains are what made " Magnetic Rag " unique among Joplin 's rags . The B strain is written entirely in G minor . The darkening tone generated by the minor scale stands out among Joplin 's rags , and is revisited in the D strain . In contrast to the minor themes in the B strain , the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies , returning once again to the scale of B @-@ flat major . Here , for the first time , the piece departs from the standard left @-@ hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime . This section of the piece has been compared to the style of twelve bar blues . The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen @-@ bar form , being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10 @-@ bar division . Its first 12 measures parallel the 12 @-@ bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars . 
 Of all the strains in the piece , the final D strain is perhaps the most interesting . It is written in B @-@ flat minor . When Joplin used minor keys in the previous sections , he used the relative key of G minor ( i.e. , relative to the main key of B @-@ flat major ) . However , in this fourth section , he instead used the parallel key . This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison , and in which the standard 2 / 4 time left @-@ hand beat is noticeably absent . Most of Joplin 's rags end with the last strain , but " Magnetic Rag " ends with a coda . This " smiling little coda " expresses some of the tonalities and rhythms heard throughout the piece . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 " Magnetic Rag " is widely understood to present a one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind combination of moods , especially for ragtime , and has been described as a melancholic and " haunting " rag . 
 With the Brahmsian darkness of . . . " Magnetic Rag , " the last piece he completed , Joplin had pushed the music far beyond the boisterous <unk> ambience that characterized , for many listeners and players , the rag idiom . This was music on a large scale that was now being squeezed into the narrow confines of rag form — so much so , that the music often burst at the seams . 
 Some music historians evaluate " Magnetic Rag " , as well as other works from Joplin 's late period , as being indicative of his unstable mental condition which resulted from the effects of syphilis . One of these is Martin Williams : 
 Joplin 's " last period " is a strange collection of contradictions . Some of his rags reach more toward concert music than did any Jazz up to Lennie Tristano 's , while others seem to revert to his 1900 style . Profoundly ambitious passages lie side by side with meaningless , mechanical ditties . It is not hard to find in these compositions a reflection of approaching derangement — he lost his mind in 1916 . 
 In This Is Ragtime , Terry Waldo criticizes this view : 
 To see Joplin 's late rags as a " strange collection of contradictions " . . . misses the point . . . . " Magnetic Rag " does indeed include parts reminiscent of Joplin 's 1900 style , but they serve to set up the " profound " parts . Here is a terrifying mixture of the familiar and the agonizing unknown . It is in fact more profound for being able to bring these opposites into focus . The music is heavy with the weight of Joplin 's approaching schizoid nightmare — but that is not a weakness . 
 In his biography of Scott Joplin , James Haskins writes : 
 Early in 1914 he completed what many consider his finest rag , " Magnetic Rag , " which he published himself that same year . It has about it a gentle quality like " The Entertainer , " and its distinctive form and range of moods suggest to some musicologists a breakthrough to a <unk> form of ragtime , albeit a breakthrough that came too late . 
 Near the end of his life , Scott Joplin was taking ragtime in a new direction by adding emphasis on form and tonality , and attempting to combine the characteristics of classical Western music and traditional ragtime . This is an entirely different direction than the one that jazz would take . 
 Jazz , seeking one theme as a center for improvisation , tended to weaken the sense of form that it inherited from ragtime . . . . Joplin 's efforts obviously strengthen this sense of form . One has only to hear the blazing return of the first theme of Magnetic Rag — the restoration of major tonality , the momentum of the renewed beat — to recognize the power of recapitulation in ragtime . 
 In the album notes to Scott Joplin : Piano Rags , Joshua Rifkin describes the " Magnetic Rag " as a " valedictory work " with Joplin paying " tribute " to a " transplanted Middle @-@ European dance music " and the European masters whom he tried to emulate . Rifkin speculates that the composition 's short coda also " seems like a farewell , as if he knew how brief and bleak was the time still <unk> him . " In 1979 Alan Rich in the New York Magazine wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin 's music on record Nonesuch Records " created , almost alone , the Scott Joplin revival .

 How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria ? is an English reality television talent show that documented the search for an undiscovered musical theatre performer to play the role of Maria von Trapp in the 2006 Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian stage production of The Sound of Music . 
 The series was originally devised by the then ' in house ' development team at BBC Entertainment Events and was announced by the BBC in April 2006 . BBC One broadcast the programme , which was hosted by Graham Norton , on Saturday evenings from 29 July through 16 September 2006 . 
 The title derives from the refrain of " Maria " , a song from the first act of The Sound of Music .

 The lead role of Maria von Trapp in the new West End production of The Sound of Music , to be staged by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian , was to be played by American actress Scarlett Johansson . Negotiations fell through , and after a four @-@ year search for an actress to fill the role , it was revealed in November 2005 that Lloyd Webber had approached the BBC to allow the public to cast the role through a Popstars @-@ style talent search , the first time that such a format had been used . 
 This was the first programme to allow the public to cast a leading role in a West End show , and it was initially criticised . However , it won International Emmy and Royal Television Society awards and became the first of a series of collaborations between the BBC and Lloyd Webber , including Any Dream Will Do , I 'd Do Anything , and Over the Rainbow . The series also led to versions and similar series abroad . 
 = = = Expert panel = = = 
 To assess and train the potential Marias and judge them during the live shows , an expert panel was chosen . The panel comprised : 
 Andrew Lloyd Webber – musical theatre composer and producer , co @-@ producer of the new stage production 
 David Ian – theatre producer , co @-@ producer of the new stage production 
 John Barrowman – musical performer , dancer , singer and actor 
 Zoe Tyler – voice coach , singer and performer , vocal coach to the finalists 
 Lloyd Webber also asked Denise van Outen to participate in the series , but she turned him down , saying that she " felt uncomfortable about being on the panel and giving my criticism " . She later became a judge on follow @-@ up series , Any Dream Will Do . 
 = = = Auditions = = = 
 Open auditions were held around the UK in April and May 2006 , open to both professionals and amateurs over the age of 17 . The top 200 made it through to the London callbacks where they performed for Ian , Barrowman and Tyler to secure one of 50 places at Lloyd Webber 's " Maria School " , where over four days they would receive vocal and drama training from the expert panel . 
 Several additional performers were selected over this fifty contestant limit ; one being Briony , who had been rejected initially due to nerves hampering her performance , but who returned for a second chance and was allowed in by Ian . A further four , whom the panel had rejected , were contacted by Lloyd Webber himself as he personally believed them to be potential Marias . 
 During " Maria School " , contestants were eliminated to leave twenty , who were then taken to Lloyd Webber 's house , where they performed for fifty people from the entertainment business . Ten finalists were then chosen by the panel and taken through to the live studio finals . 
 The series started on Saturday 29 July 2006 , and the first two programmes followed the audition stages of the competition before revealing the final ten at the end of the second programme . 
 = = = Live finals = = = 
 The final ten contestants then competed in the live studio finals held on Saturday nights over six weeks . Each week the contestants sang and performed during the live show , receiving comments from the judges following their performance . The public then got a chance to vote for their favourite Maria , and the two contestants with the fewest votes performed a sing @-@ off in front of Lloyd Webber , who then decided which Maria to keep in the contest . This was repeated with the top ten , the top nine and the top eight . With the top seven and top five , two were voted off in the program , and there were two different sing @-@ offs . 
 Lloyd Webber had no say in the final casting decision , when in the concluding edition of the series it was left to the public to choose who should play Maria out of the final two contenders , Connie Fisher and Helena Blackman . After more than 2 million votes were cast , the winning entrant was revealed as Fisher , who won a six @-@ month contract to play Maria in the West End production , performing six out of the eight weekly shows . 
 The profits from the telephone votes went to a bursary for young performers . Lloyd Webber also donated his fee to the bursary . 
 = = Finalists = = 
 Ten potential Marias were selected as finalists who would appear on the live shows . Abi Finley and Aoife Mulholland auditioned together having known each other from college , and both made it to the finals . One of the original 10 finalists , Emilie Alford , withdrew from the competition after deciding it was not for her . She was replaced by Siobhan Dillon , who lost a place in the final ten following a sing @-@ off against Alford and Laura <unk> in front of Lloyd Webber . This earned her the nickname " Second Chance Maria " .

 Following a public telephone vote , 23 @-@ year @-@ old Connie Fisher was chosen as Maria and performed the role in the West End from November 2006 to February 2008 . The series also helped the careers of the other finalists , some of whom later took leading roles in West End shows . Semi @-@ finalist Aoife Mulholland also took up the role of Maria in April 2007 for two shows a week , after Fisher was advised to reduce her performances to six per week . 
 = = After the series = = 
 Following the final , Lloyd Webber was criticised after it was revealed that actress Emma Williams had been hired to perform the two performances per week that Fisher would not . Prior to The Sound of Music opening Williams " withdrew her services " , reportedly because her role had been downgraded from four shows per week to two , leaving Fisher to perform all eight shows unless indisposed . 
 With £ 10 million in advance ticket sales , the £ 4 million production opened at the London Palladium on 15 November 2006 to positive reviews , leading to a £ 1 @.@ 1 million increase in ticket sales in one day . In January 2007 , Fisher was chosen by the London Critics ' Circle to win their award for best newcomer , sharing the prize with Andrew Garfield . Reducing her performances to six per week in March 2007 following an order to rest her voice , her run in the show was extended until 23 February 2008 , when actress Summer Strallen took over the role following a tie @-@ in with the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks . Fisher has also made numerous appearances on stage and on television , released two albums , and performed the lead role in the ITV1 drama Caught in a Trap on 26 December 2008 . She reprised her role as Maria in a UK tour of the production in July 2009 . 
 Several of the other final ten contestants have taken on leading roles in musicals following the series . Aoife Mulholland was cast in December 2006 as Roxie Hart in the West End musical Chicago , and took on the role of Maria in the West End production for two shows per week in April 2007 after Fisher 's reduction in performances . In July 2007 Siobhan Dillon started in the role of Patty Simcox in the musical Grease and later went on to play the lead role of Sandy in January 2010 . Fellow finalist Helena Blackman played Nellie Forbush in a UK tour of South Pacific . Mulholland originated the role of Brooke Wyndham in the West End production of Legally Blonde , and Dillon took over the role of Vivienne Kensington in October 2010 . 
 A follow @-@ up programme How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria ? – Connie 's Story aired on 27 December 2006 and followed Fisher during rehearsals for her new role up to and including the opening night . Fisher and several other finalists appeared in a special programme on 24 December 2007 with the winner and finalists from Any Dream Will Do titled When Joseph Met Maria . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Lloyd Webber was initially criticised for wanting to cast the role through a television talent search , and he and the BBC were also criticised by the actors union Equity . They stated that they believed their members would find the series " demeaning to their profession " and that it was not a " proper way " to choose a performer . 
 The series opened to mostly negative reviews from the press , with the Daily Mail stating that the series was a " trainwreck " . In response to the criticism , Lloyd Webber told The Times : 
 " This programme is providing a platform for musical theatre that it has never had before . The only people upset with Maria are a few precious <unk> who think things should be done a certain way . " 
 Lloyd Webber and the BBC were also criticised for giving the production " 11 hours of free publicity on prime @-@ time television " and that the series could be " considered commercial advertising " . The BBC Trust 's Editorial Standards Committee disagreed , saying that the corporation retained " editorial control of the programme " and avoided " disproportionate prominence for Lloyd Webber and the production " . 
 The first programme attracted 5 @.@ 1 million viewers with a 32 % audience share , with 4 @.@ 9 million viewers ( 30 % share ) watching the first of the live finals , and 4 @.@ 7 million ( 23 % share ) viewing the results programme . The series dropped to a low of 4 @.@ 4 million viewers ( 24 % share ) against the third series of The X Factor on ITV1 , which started the week before . The X Factor continued to gain higher viewing figures as the weeks progressed , with the final of Maria ? attracting 5 @.@ 5 million viewers ( 28 % share ) for the main show and 7 @.@ 7 million ( 35 % share ) for the results show . 
 Following the conclusion of the series on a ratings high and positive reviews for Fisher following her opening night , the series was followed by a number of similar series from both the BBC and other broadcasters in the UK and abroad . It was credited with helping London theatres reach record ticket sales and attendances in 2007 and , according to The Independent , for " persuading a new , younger audience to see the shows in the flesh " . 
 The series was shown on BBC America in the United States from June 2009 . It was described as being " refreshing in its simplicity " in a " landscape that lately seems dominated by audition @-@ heavy musical competitions " by LA Times critic Mary McNamara , but Brian Lowry of Variety didn 't feel that it would be successful in the U.S.

 The series won three awards , and received nominations for another two :

 2007 British Academy Television Awards : nominated – best entertainment programme

 The success of the series led to its becoming the first in a series of West End themed talent contests produced by the BBC in collaboration with Lloyd Webber . 2007 saw Any Dream Will Do search for a new male lead to play Joseph for a production of Lloyd Webber 's and Tim Rice 's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat . This was followed in 2008 by I 'd Do Anything , which sought a lead to play Nancy and three young performers to play the lead in a production of the musical Oliver ! . In 2010 , Over the Rainbow cast Dorothy and a dog to play Toto in the forthcoming stage production of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz . The BBC also collaborated with Lloyd Webber to find a performer for Britain 's entry into the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 through Eurovision : Your Country Needs You . 
 On 20 August 2006 , it was reported that Lloyd Webber had taken legal action against David Ian . Lloyd Webber reportedly wanted to take the format to the United States to cast a Broadway theatre production of Grease . Lloyd Webber discovered that Ian had already brought the idea to NBC , who announced they will look for unknowns to play Sandy <unk> and Danny Zuko , via reality TV show Grease : You 're the One that I Want ! with Ian and BBC Worldwide , leaving Lloyd Webber furious . Ian said " I don 't understand the problem . Andrew has no connection with the stage show Grease , which I have successfully produced in the UK . There is a new production of Grease on Broadway in the spring of 2007 , that 's why I 've been asked to judge on You 're The One That We Want . " This was followed in the UK with the ITV1 series Grease Is the Word , with Ian as a judge . It aired against Any Dream Will Do in 2007 . 
 Op zoek naar Evita ( Looking for Evita ) was produced in the Netherlands in 2007 , followed by Op zoek naar Joseph ( Looking for Joseph ) in 2008 , Op zoek naar Mary Poppins ( Looking for Mary Poppins ) in 2009 and Op zoek naar Zorro ( Looking for Zorro ) in 2011 and even Op zoek naar Annie ( Looking for Annie ) in 2012 . 
 In 2008 a Canadian version of the show with the same title , searched for a Maria for an upcoming Toronto production of The Sound of Music ; this show was initiated by Lloyd Webber , and was aired on CBC Television . 
 In 2009 <unk> aired a Flemish version titled Op zoek naar Maria ( Looking for Maria ) . 
 = Operation Perch = 
 Operation Perch was a British offensive of the Second World War which took place from 7 – 14 June 1944 , during the early stages of the Battle of Normandy . The operation was intended to encircle and seize the German occupied city of Caen , which was a D @-@ Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division in the early phases of Operation Overlord . Operation Perch was to begin immediately after the British beach landings with an advance to the south @-@ east of Caen by XXX Corps . Three days after the invasion the city was still in German hands and the operation was amended . The operation was expanded to include I Corps for a pincer attack on Caen . 
 Next day XXX Corps in the west , pushed south to Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles but then encountered the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division and the village changed hands several times . I Corps began the eastern thrust two days later from the Orne bridgehead , which had been secured in Operation Tonga by elements of the British 6th Airborne Division on D @-@ Day . I Corps was also delayed by constant counter @-@ attacks of the 21st Panzer Division . With mounting casualties and no sign of an imminent German collapse , the offensive east of Caen was suspended on 13 June . 
 Further west in the U.S. First Army area , American attacks forced a gap in the German defences . The British 7th Armoured Division was diverted from Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles , to advance through the gap in a flanking manoeuvre and force the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division to fall back , to avoid encirclement . On 14 June , after two days of battle including the Battle of Villers @-@ Bocage , the 7th Armoured Division was ordered to withdraw towards Caumont . Plans were made to resume the offensive once the 7th Armoured Division had been reinforced but these were postponed , when a storm in the English Channel seriously delayed the Allied landing of supplies and reinforcements . 
 The battle is controversial because historians and writers generally agree that failures by British divisional and corps commanders squandered an opportunity to capture Caen . To resist the offensive , the Germans had committed their most powerful armoured reserves , which deprived them of the fighting power for a counter @-@ offensive and forfeited the initiative to the Allies . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Operation Overlord = = = 
 The Norman town of Caen was a D @-@ Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division , which landed on Sword Beach on 6 June 1944 . Caen 's early capture , while " ambitious " , has been described by historian L F Ellis as the most important D @-@ Day objective assigned to Lieutenant @-@ General John T. Crocker 's I Corps . Operation Overlord called for Lieutenant @-@ General Dempsey 's Second Army to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont @-@ l 'Éventé to the south @-@ east of Caen , acquiring airfields and protecting the left flank of the U.S. First Army while it moved on Cherbourg . Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise , which could be used as the pivot for a swing left to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River . The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially promising , being open , dry and conducive to swift offensive operations — the Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units , and transforming the battle into a more fluid engagement would be to their advantage . 
 = = = Operation Perch = = = 
 Operation Perch was intended to create the threat of a British breakout to the south @-@ east of Caen by XXX Corps . The 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division landed on Gold Beach on 6 June and was rapidly to move inland and capture Bayeux and the road to Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles . The 7th Armoured Division and the 8th Armoured Brigade would then take over from the 50th Northumbrian Division and advance from Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles to Mont Pinçon . XXX Corps landed on Gold Beach at 07 : 30 on 6 June , cleared seven exits off the beach and advanced 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) inland . German resistance at Le Hamel delayed the division and prevented the achievement of all of the D @-@ Day objectives before dark . Patrols had reached Bayeux and made contact with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division , which had landed on Juno Beach to the east . The 47 Royal Marine Commando advanced eastwards along the coast , to link up with the American forces moving inland from Omaha Beach but fell short of Port @-@ en @-@ Bessin @-@ <unk> by 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) . 
 During the afternoon , the German LXXXIV Corps ordered its reserve , Kampfgruppe Meyer to strike into the flank of the 50th Division north of Bayeux . While advancing to the attack , a battalion was ordered towards Omaha beach , weakening the counter @-@ attack , which was a costly failure . On 7 June , the bulk of the 7th Armoured Division landed on schedule and XXX Corps secured its remaining D @-@ Day objectives , including Bayeux and Port @-@ en @-@ Bessin @-@ <unk> . The LXXXIV Corps sent its last reserve unit , Mobile Brigade 30 , towards Gold Beach to repeat the counter @-@ attack , which also failed , and the brigade was destroyed north of Bayeux . The survivors of the two counter @-@ attacks were driven into a pocket north of the city by the Anglo @-@ American advance , although the Americans did not discover that this had happened . From Sword Beach , the 3rd Infantry Division of I Corps had advanced towards Caen but diverted units to capture German positions along the 9 @.@ 3 @-@ mile ( 15 @.@ 0 km ) route , which reduced the strength of the infantry attack and the 27th Armoured Brigade was delayed by congestion in the beachhead . The division was stopped short of Caen by the 21st Panzer Division . 
 = = = Operation Wild Oats = = = 
 On 9 June the Allied ground forces commander , General Bernard Montgomery ( Monty ) , met Lieutenant @-@ Generals Miles Dempsey and Omar Bradley , the British Second and First U.S. army commanders and it was decided that Caen would be taken by a pincer movement , Operation Wild Oats . From the east the 51st ( Highland ) Infantry Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade of I Corps , would cross east into the 6th Airborne Division bridgehead over the Orne and attack towards <unk> , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) to the south @-@ east of Caen . XXX Corps to the west would send the 7th Armoured Division across the Odon River to take Évrecy and Hill 112 . The 1st Airborne Division would then drop between the pincers but Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh @-@ Mallory , the Allied air commander rejected the airborne plan , which was dropped .

 Late on 7 June , the I SS @-@ Panzer Corps was transferred from the command of the Seventh Army to Panzer Group West . Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt the supreme commander in the west ( OB West ) , ordered Panzergruppe West under General Geyr von Schweppenburg to plan a counter @-@ attack for 10 June but this was cancelled by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel the commander of Army Group B , due to lack of troops . German units were rushed from staging areas to Normandy to contain the invasion . The I SS @-@ Panzer Corps consisted of the Panzer @-@ Lehr @-@ Division which was one of the strongest divisions in the German army , the " fanatical teenagers " of the 12th SS @-@ Panzer Division Hitlerjugend and the 21st Panzer Division . 
 The leading elements of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division arrived during the night of 9 June at the Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles , having lost up to 200 vehicles to aerial attacks during its 90 @-@ mile ( 140 km ) drive from Chartres , having been diverted from I Corps because of the success of the 50th Northumbrian Division . Parts of the 12th SS @-@ Panzer Division , the 21st Panzer Division and the remains of the 716th Static Infantry Division were moved to Caen , facing I Corps . Several attacks were launched against the Anglo @-@ Canadian beachhead north of Caen . In the early hours of 9 June the survivors of Kampfgruppe Meyer and Mobile Brigade 30 broke out of the pocket north of Bayeux . Later in the day XXX Corps established a land link to the Americans while the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division reached the northeast outskirts of Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles and first encountered the tanks of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division . During the evening Panzer @-@ Lehr and the 12th SS @-@ Panzer Division counter @-@ attacked and overran a British infantry company before being repulsed the following morning .

 On 10 June the 7th Armoured Division took over parts of 50th Northumbrian Division front and the 56th Infantry Brigade was detached to the 7th Armoured Division . By nightfall the division had reached the north @-@ western fringe of Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles and next day elements entered the village and secured the central crossroads . The Panzer @-@ Lehr Division made several counter @-@ attacks , which forced a British withdrawal . Further attacks by the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Division bogged down in the bocage , unable to overcome the resistance of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division . Army Group B planned to begin a relief from 11 June of the armoured divisions facing the Second Army , with infantry divisions , to concentrate the tanks in the Carentan area and avert the danger to Cherbourg . Attacks by the Second Army and Adolf Hitler ’ s opposition forced Rommel to cancel the move ; next day Rommel was ordered by Hitler not to retreat and instead roll up the Allied beachhead , from east to west starting with the Orne bridgehead .

 While XXX Corps attacked Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles , the 51st ( Highland ) Infantry Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade were delayed and their attack was postponed until 12 June . On 10 June German tanks and infantry made several attacks on the 6th Airborne Division in the Orne bridgehead , forestalling the British attack . The German attacks were repulsed with the help of naval gunfire and counter @-@ attacked . A captured German officer remarked that his " battalion had been virtually wiped out " during twelve hours of fighting . In the evening German attack on Ranville was repulsed with many German casualties . The vanguard of the 51st Highland Division arrived during the evening and attacked Bréville at dawn , which was also a costly failure ; other elements of the division quickly secured <unk> . 
 During the afternoon of the 11 June , The Queen 's Own Rifles of Canada and 1st Hussars attacked Le Mesnil @-@ Patry to assist the advance of the 69th Brigade of the 50th Northumbrian Division but the Battle of Le Mesnil @-@ Patry was a costly failure . On 12 June further German attacks were launched from the Bréville area against the Orne bridgehead . Fighting lasted all day and casualties were severe on both sides , but during the evening the Germans pulled back . To close the gap in the British perimeter the decision was made to secure Bréville . A successful attack was launched by the 12th Battalion the Parachute Regiment that by midnight had captured the village , but of the 160 men that began the attack 141 casualties were sustained . However , 51st Highland was facing stiff resistance from the 21st Panzer Division in its efforts to push south to Saint Honorine and with the Highlanders unable to make progress , the offensive east of Caen was called off on 13 June . 
 = = = Caumont Gap = = = 
 Although the attempt to envelop Caen had been repulsed , on the right flank of XXX Corps , at the junction of the British Second and First U.S. armies , the possibility for a flanking manoeuvre had developed . Since D @-@ Day the British and Americans in the area had destroyed five German battle groups , including the reserves of LXXXIV Corps , leaving only remnants of the 352nd Infantry Division in the Trévières – <unk> sector . The 352nd Division had been in action since its defence of Omaha on 6 June and had received few replacements . The 1st U.S. Infantry Division and the 2nd U.S. Infantry Division had forced the collapse of the left flank of the 352nd Division . On the night of 9 / 10 June , the division received permission to retire to Saint @-@ Lô . The withdrawal created a 7 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) gap in the German lines near Caumont @-@ l 'Éventé . Only the reconnaissance battalion of the 17th SS @-@ Panzergrenadier Division , which had been detached when the division was moved west ready for a counter @-@ offensive at Carentan , remained in the area . 
 The Germans planned to use the 2nd Panzer Division to plug the gap but on 10 June , the bulk of the 2nd Panzer Division was strung out between Amiens and Alençon and not expected to arrive in strength for another three days . General Hans Freiherr von Funck of XLVII Panzer Corps rushed the divisional reconnaissance battalion to Caumont , with orders to hold the high ground . The I SS @-@ Panzer Corps commander Sepp Dietrich , ordered his only reserve Schwere SS @-@ Panzer @-@ Abteilung 101 , to move behind the Panzer @-@ Lehr and 12th SS @-@ Panzer divisions , to cover the open left flank . The 2nd Company , schwere SS @-@ Panzer Battalion 101 , under the command of Michael Wittmann and with five operational Tiger tanks , was ordered to a position south of Point 213 on the Villers @-@ Bocage ridge and arrived on 12 June , after a five @-@ day drive from Beauvais . 
 On 12 June , Dempsey met with Lieutenant @-@ General Gerard Bucknall , commander of XXX Corps and Major @-@ General George Erskine , commander of the 7th Armoured Division and ordered Erskine to disengage his armour from the fighting around Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles . The division was to exploit the gap to seize the Villers @-@ Bocage and advance behind the left flank of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division to a ridge about 1 @.@ 6 miles ( 2 @.@ 6 km ) east of the town . It was believed that the appearance of British tanks behind the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division on high ground astride the German supply @-@ lines would compel the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division to withdraw or be trapped . To support of the 7th Armoured Division flanking move , the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division was to continue the attack against the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division around Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles . The V U.S. Corps would push forward at the same time , the 1st U.S. Infantry Division to capture Caumont and the high ground nearby and the 2nd U.S. Infantry Division towards Saint @-@ Lô . 
 The 7th Armoured Division was slow to redeploy and spent the morning of 12 June continuing the attack on Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles , according to its original orders . At 12 : 00 Erskine ordered Brigadier Hinde , commander of the 22nd Armoured Brigade to move through the gap at once . With the 131st Infantry Brigade ready for action , the 56th Infantry Brigade was returned to the control of the 50th Northumbrian Division . The 7th Armoured Division armoured reconnaissance regiment , the 8th King 's Royal Irish Hussars began to reconnoitre the route and the rest of the division departed from <unk> at around 16 : 00 . Four hours later , the main body approached Livry after an unopposed advance of 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) , the last 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) of which were though German @-@ held territory . 
 North of Livry , the leading 8th Hussar Cromwell tanks were knocked out by an anti @-@ tank gun of the Panzer Lehr Division Escort Company ; infantry and tanks were brought forward and cleared the position after two hours . On reaching the vicinity of La <unk> , Hinde halted for the night to disguise the objective as the 8th Hussar | Cromwells and 11th ( Prince Albert 's Own ) Hussar armoured car regiment , reconnoitred the flanks . The 11th Hussars found no resistance on the right and linked with the 1st U.S. Infantry Division near Caumont and on the left flank , the 8th Hussars located elements of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division just under 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) away . 
 = = = Battle of Villers @-@ Bocage = = = 
 The British advance resumed at 05 : 30 and at about 08 : 30 , the vanguard of the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered the west end of Villers @-@ Bocage . A squadron of the 4th County of London Yeomanry ( Sharpshooters ) , moved through the town and occupied Point 213 , an area of high ground to the east on the Caen road . The regimental headquarters and a company of infantry occupied the eastern end of the town along the main road . 
 At about 09 : 00 the foremost British tanks were engaged by 3 – 5 Tiger tanks of the 2nd Company , schwere SS @-@ Panzer Battalion 101 . A Tiger under the command of Michael Wittmann , entered Villers @-@ Bocage and destroyed several tanks of the 4th County of London Yeomanry regimental headquarters and reconnaissance troop , then attacked British tanks entering the town from the west , before attempting to withdraw . The Tiger was immobilised by British return fire and was abandoned by the crew who fled towards Château <unk> , to report to the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division . In fewer than 15 minutes , 13 – 14 tanks , two anti @-@ tank guns and 13 – 15 transport vehicles had been destroyed , many by Wittmann . 
 During the rest of the morning , an infantry battalion from the 22nd Armoured Brigade group , took up defensive positions in the town ; the troops at Point 213 had been off and a force was assembled to extricate them . The relief force was unable to advance on the ridge and when more German forces arrived between 11 : 00 – 13 : 00 , the trapped squadron surrendered . More German troops had arrived and engaged the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the road back to Livry . 
 Tanks of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division arrived to seal off the north and west exits from Villers @-@ Bocage but were ambushed by British anti @-@ tank guns and several were disabled , before the British position was silenced and schwere SS @-@ Panzer Battalion 101 was ambushed in the town centre . Several Tigers and a Panzer IV were knocked out by anti @-@ tank guns , a Sherman Firefly and British infantry . The disabled tanks were later set on fire and British and German infantry clashed throughout the afternoon . The British positions were bombarded by heavy artillery and several German attacks were repulsed by British field artillery firing over open sights . A British company was overrun , a platoon taken prisoner and the battalion headquarters came under fire . Hinde decided that the brigade group should withdraw until morning to Point 174 , an area of high ground to the west of Villers @-@ Bocage near Amayé @-@ sur @-@ Seulles . At 20 : 00 the withdrawal began under cover of an artillery bombardment and was accomplished largely unmolested . 
 = = = 14 June = = = 
 On the morning of 14 June , Montgomery abandoned the pincer attack on Caen , because he lacked " sufficient strength to act offensively on both flanks " and ordered XXX Corps to continue in a " concentrated single blow " while in the I Corps area to the east , the 51st ( Highland ) Division was " piped down " . The 50th ( Northumbrian ) Division had continued the attack southwards , to pin down German forces and on 14 June , supported by its entire divisional artillery and the Royal Air Force , the division attacked with two brigades towards la <unk> , la Belle <unk> , Lingèvres and Verrières . If the attack succeeded , it would be exploited to capture Hottot @-@ les @-@ Bagues . A reconnaissance @-@ in @-@ force was conducted the evening before and the panzergrenadiers of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division , inflicted many casualties . Losses in the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division are unknown , although one tank was destroyed . 
 The attack began at 10 : 15 the next morning , when the 151st ( Durham ) Infantry Brigade and tanks of the 4th / 7th Royal Dragoon Guards , advanced towards Lingèvres and Verrières . The German defenders held their fire until the British were less than 150 yards ( 140 m ) distant and the battle lasted for five hours , until the 6th Durham Light Infantry ( 6th DLI ) with a huge amount of artillery support , captured the German positions . Two companies advanced to Verrières which was empty but further advances were checked by infantry and tanks . The 9th DLI were also caught in German machine @-@ gun fire and needed their reserve companies to break through the German front line . At about 13 : 30 , the battalion captured Lingèvres and moved anti @-@ tank guns into the village , although most of these were put out of action by the first German counter @-@ attack . 
 Two Panthers were spotted approaching the village by Sergeant Wilfred Harris , commander of a Sherman Firefly and engaged at 400 yards ( 370 m ) , destroying the first and disabling the second Panther . While Harris moved , a tank @-@ hunting party led by Major John Mogg the acting battalion commander , finished off the damaged Panther . Other tank @-@ hunting parties drove off a Panther , a British M4 Sherman was destroyed and a third Panther was knocked out by a Sherman . Three more Panthers moved towards the village and Harris destroyed the lead vehicle outside the village and the other two inside , one in the centre of Lingèvres . The 231st Infantry Brigade reached its objectives by nightfall and linked with the 151st Infantry Brigade . A 6th DLI officer , said that the attack was the best by the battalion during the campaign ; nine German tanks were knocked out but the division had been unable to break through the Panzer @-@ Lehr defences and the DLI had c . 353 casualties . 
 = = = Battle of the Island = = = 
 On 14 June , with the withdrawal from Villers @-@ Bocage complete , the brigade group formed a " brigade box " for all @-@ round defence near Hill 174 . The battle became known as " The Battle of the island " , or " Island Position " as named in the 22nd Armoured Brigade after action report . Other names given to the action are " The Battle of the Brigade Box " and " The Battle of Amayé @-@ sur @-@ Seulles " . Forty and Taylor wrote that the box was less than 2 square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 77 sq mi ) in area . 
 The Panzer @-@ Lehr Division had manoeuvred to defend against the 50th ( Northumbrian ) Infantry Division and to counter @-@ attack the 7th Armoured Division penetration , with the support of the 1st Company , schwere SS @-@ Panzer Battalion 101 . The 2nd Panzer Division reconnaissance battalion and other small infantry units also faced the brigade box but the divisional panzer regiment had not arrived . The British 131st Infantry Brigade , an infantry battalion and an armoured regiment , had moved up to Livry . During the morning , the 131st Brigade kept the road from the brigade box to the Livry – <unk> area open and Typhoon fighter bombers attacked German positions near the box . 
 German infantry were spotted advancing towards the brigade box and bombarded by heavy artillery , which repulsed the attack but around 09 : 00 , more infantry attacked the box and came too close for artillery fire . Hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting began and a British platoon was overrun , before a tank @-@ infantry counter @-@ attack repulsed the German infantry and restored the position . The Germans resorted to harassing fire , sniping , mortar bombardments and heavy artillery fire . After a long artillery bombardment , simultaneous attacks by tanks and infantry were made at 19 : 00 , from the north and south , which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters , before being driven back around 22 : 30 . 
 The 7th Armoured Division command was confident that the box was secure but the failure of the 50th Northumbrian Division to break through the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division and reach the 7th Armoured Division , led to orders for the brigade group to retire to straighten the front line and Operation <unk> began just after midnight . Decoy raids by Bomber Command on <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Odon and <unk> , caused 29 casualties , destroyed a Tiger tank and damaged three more . Artillery harassing fire was maintained north and south of the withdrawal route but the Germans did little to intervene . The Germans had lost 700 – 800 casualties and 8 – 20 tanks , including several Tigers . British casualties were light and only three tanks were lost . Reynolds called the German casualty figures " exaggerated " and in his report , Hinde wrote " It is questionable whether the expenditure of artillery and small arms ammunition was justified by the scale of the enemy 's efforts " .

 The failure of the operation led Dempsey to write that there was 
 no chance now of a snap operation with airborne troops either to seize Caen or to deepen the bridgehead on XXX Corps front . It is clear now that Caen can be taken only by set @-@ piece assault and we do not have the men or ammunition for that at this time . 
 After the war he wrote that the attack by the 7th Armoured Division should have succeeded and that his doubts about Bucknall and Erskine increased and that they might have to go . Dempsey called the handling of the battle a disgrace and said that the decision to withdraw [ from Villers @-@ Bocage ] was made by the corps commander and Erskine . " D 'Este called Dempsey 's comments " excessively harsh " but historians generally support them , suggesting that a great opportunity to swiftly capture Caen had been squandered by Bucknall . Buckley wrote that Bucknall was not ready to support the attack once problems developed and that Erskine was not capable of mastering the situation . Ellis wrote that the result was " disappointing " but that the fighting power of the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division and with the unexpected arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division , the 7th Armoured Division " could hardly have achieved full success " . Reynolds wrote that the 2nd Panzer Division tanks were nowhere near Villers @-@ Bocage . 
 Meyer wrote that Operation Perch failed because the 50th Northumbrian Division and its armoured brigade could not overcome the Panzer @-@ Lehr @-@ Division , the 51st ( Highland ) Infantry Division attack in the east of the bridgehead failed and because of the rapid counter @-@ attack by advanced elements of the 2nd Panzer Division . The allocation of insufficient infantry to the offensive has been criticised , Reynolds wrote that two infantry battalions and most of the 1st Battalion the Rifle Brigade of the 7th Armoured Division were available on 13 June , as were three infantry brigades and that Bucknall was at fault for failing to concentrate his forces . D 'Este wrote the same , although Bucknall had defended his decision claiming " 49 [ Division ] ... [ had ] no recent battle experience and it was important to launch them nicely into their first fighting in a properly coordinated battle , and not bundle them helter @-@ skelter into hot armoured scrapping like that around V [ <unk> ] -B [ <unk> ] and <unk> . " Buckley wrote that the operation was a failure of command . Copp wrote that Dempsey continued to underestimate the German defence of ground and Melvin wrote that Dempsey and the Second Army handled subordinate formations poorly , by not giving subordinates definite tasks , clear intentions and allowing discretion in the implementation of orders . 
 Wilmot called Operation Perch a strategic success 
 By the premature commitment of his armour , Rommel had delayed the British advance , but in the process he had played into Montgomery 's hands for , once the panzer divisions were locked into battle with Second Army , they could not be used for their proper offensive task . " 
 and Badsey wrote that Montgomery ’ s message to Bradley , " Caen is the key to Cherbourg " was true . The risk of a breakout past Caen , immobilised the German armoured divisions at the east end of front , unable mount a counter @-@ offensive against the First U.S. Army . Hitler ’ s interference saved Rommel 's military reputation because the unsuitability of the Cotentin for armoured operations , the difficulties involved in moving and supplying deployment in the area and the strength of the Anglo @-@ Canadian force , would have led to a more rapid and complete defeat of the German army in Normandy . Hitler ’ s order of 12 June made the rest of the campaign a battle of attrition .

 The British and Commonwealth system of battle honours recognised participation in the expansion of the bridgehead during the period of Operation Perch in 1956 , 1957 and in 1958 . One unit was awarded the honour Port En Bessin , one formation the honour Sully , four units the honour Breville , and 11 regiments the honour Villers @-@ Bocage .

 The battle between 50th Northumbrian Division and Panzer @-@ Lehr Division continued for several days and by 15 June , XXX Corps claimed to have destroyed at least 70 German tanks . On 18 June the British entered Tilly @-@ sur @-@ Seulles again and consolidated the village next day against light opposition ; it had changed hands 23 times . An attack was launched by the British towards Hottot @-@ les @-@ Bagues against the Panzer @-@ Lehr Division and gained a foothold in the village , until forced out by German counter @-@ attacks by tanks and infantry . The British retook the village and then withdrew during the night . The 7th Armoured Division was withdrawn to be reinforced by the 33rd Armoured Brigade which was landing in the beachhead . The reinforced division was intended to attack again but on 19 June a storm descended upon the English Channel , which delayed the landing of supplies and further British attacks were postponed .

 Croatia ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ AY @-@ <unk> ; Croatian : Hrvatska [ <unk> ̩ <unk> ] ) , officially the Republic of Croatia ( Croatian : Republika Hrvatska , listen ) , is a sovereign state at the crossroads of Central Europe , Southeast Europe , and the Mediterranean . Its capital city is Zagreb , which forms one of the country 's primary subdivisions , along with its twenty counties . Croatia covers 56 @,@ 594 square kilometres ( 21 @,@ 851 square miles ) and has diverse , mostly continental and Mediterranean climates . Croatia 's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands . The country 's population is 4 @.@ 28 million , most of whom are Croats , with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism . 
 The Croats arrived in the area of present @-@ day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD . They organised the state into two duchies by the 9th century . Tomislav became the first king by 925 , elevating Croatia to the status of a kingdom . The Kingdom of Croatia retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries , reaching its peak during the rule of Kings Petar Krešimir IV and Dmitar Zvonimir . Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102 . In 1527 , faced with Ottoman conquest , the Croatian Parliament elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg to the Croatian throne . In 1918 , after World War I , Croatia was included in the unrecognized State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs which seceded from Austria @-@ Hungary and merged into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . The fascist Croatian puppet state backed by the Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany existed during World War II . After the war , Croatia became a founding member and a federal constituent of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , a constitutionally socialist state . On 25 June 1991 Croatia declared independence , which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year . The Croatian War of Independence was fought successfully during the four years following the declaration . 
 A unitary state , Croatia is a republic governed under a parliamentary system . The International Monetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy , and the World Bank identified it as a high @-@ income economy . Croatia is a member of the European Union ( EU ) , United Nations ( UN ) , the Council of Europe , NATO , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and a founding member of the Union for the Mediterranean . As an active participant in the UN peacekeeping forces , Croatia has contributed troops to the NATO @-@ led mission in Afghanistan and took a non @-@ permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2008 – 2009 term . 
 The service sector dominates Croatia 's economy , followed by the industrial sector and agriculture . Tourism is a significant source of revenue during the summer , with Croatia ranked the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world . The state controls a part of the economy , with substantial government expenditure . The European Union is Croatia 's most important trading partner . Since 2000 , the Croatian government constantly invests in infrastructure , especially transport routes and facilities along the Pan @-@ European corridors . Internal sources produce a significant portion of energy in Croatia ; the rest is imported . Croatia provides a universal health care system and free primary and secondary education , while supporting culture through numerous public institutions and corporate investments in media and publishing . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name of Croatia derives from Medieval Latin <unk> – compare DUX <unk> [ sic ] ( " Duke of the Croats " ) attested in the Branimir inscription – itself a derivation of North @-@ West Slavic * <unk> , by liquid metathesis from proposed Common Slavic period * <unk> , from proposed Proto @-@ Slavic * <unk> ( * <unk> ) or * <unk> ( * <unk> ) . 
 The origin of the name is uncertain , but is thought to be a Gothic or Indo @-@ Aryan term assigned to a Slavic tribe . The oldest preserved record of the Croatian ethnonym * <unk> is of variable stem , attested in the Baška tablet in style <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Zvonimir , Croatian king " ) . 
 The first attestation of the Latin term is attributed to a charter of Duke Trpimir from the year 852 . The original is lost , and just a 1568 copy is preserved — leading to doubts over the authenticity of the claim . The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th @-@ century Branimir Inscription ( found near Benkovac ) , where Duke Branimir is styled as Dux <unk> . The inscription is not believed to be dated accurately , but is likely to be from during the period of 879 @-@ 892 , during Branimir 's rule .

 = = = Prehistory and antiquity = = = 
 The area known as Croatia today was inhabited throughout the prehistoric period . Fossils of Neanderthals dating to the middle Palaeolithic period have been unearthed in northern Croatia , with the most famous and the best presented site in Krapina . Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of the country . The largest proportion of the sites is in the northern Croatia river valleys , and the most significant cultures whose presence was discovered include Starčevo , Vučedol and Baden cultures . The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture . 
 = = = Greek and Roman rule = = = 
 Much later , the region was settled by <unk> and Illyrians , while the first Greek colonies were established on the islands of Korčula , Hvar and Vis . In 9 AD the territory of today 's Croatia became part of the Roman Empire . Emperor Diocletian built a large palace in Split when he retired in AD 305 . 
 During the 5th century , one of the last Emperors of the Western Roman Empire , Julius Nepos , ruled his small empire from the palace . The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions in the first half of the 7th century and destruction of almost all Roman towns . Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast , islands and mountains . The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from <unk> . 
 The ethnogenesis of Croats is uncertain and there are several competing theories , Slavic and Iranian being the most frequently put forward . The most widely accepted of these , the Slavic theory , proposes migration of White Croats from the territory of White Croatia during the Migration Period . Conversely , the Iranian theory proposes Iranian origin , based on <unk> Tablets containing Greek inscription of given names <unk> [ <unk> ] , <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) and their interpretation as <unk> of Croatian people . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th @-@ century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII , the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7th century , however that claim is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries . Eventually two dukedoms were formed — Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Croatia , ruled by <unk> and Borna , as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818 . The record represents the first document of Croatian realms , vassal states of Francia at the time . 
 The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later . According to the Constantine VII Christianization of Croats began in the 7th century , but the claim is disputed and generally Christianization is associated with the 9th century . The first native Croatian ruler recognised by the Pope was Duke Branimir , who received papal recognition from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . 
 Tomislav was the first ruler of Croatia who was styled a king in a letter from the Pope John X , dating kingdom of Croatia to year 925 . Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions , spreading the influence of Croatian kings . The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Krešimir IV ( 1058 – 1074 ) and Dmitar Zvonimir ( 1075 – 1089 ) . When Stjepan II died in 1091 ending the Trpimirović dynasty , Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed the Croatian crown in name of his sister Helena , wife of King Dmitar Zvonimir . Opposition to the claim led to a war and personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102 , ruled by Coloman . 
 For the next four centuries , the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the Sabor ( parliament ) and a Ban ( viceroy ) appointed by the king . The period saw increasing threat of Ottoman conquest and struggle against the Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas . The Venetians gained control over most of Dalmatia by 1428 , with exception of the city @-@ state of Dubrovnik which became independent . Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Mohács , both ending in decisive Ottoman victories . King Louis II died at Mohács , and in 1527 , the Croatian Parliament met in Cetin and chose Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg as new ruler of Croatia , under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire while respecting its political rights . This period saw the rise of influential nobility such as the Frankopan and Zrinski families to prominence and ultimately numerous Bans from the two families . 
 = = = Habsburg Monarchy and Austria @-@ Hungary ( 1538 – 1918 ) = = = 
 Following the decisive Ottoman victories , Croatia was split into civilian and military territories , with the partition formed in 1538 . The military territories would become known as the Croatian Military Frontier and were under direct Imperial control . Ottoman advances in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak , the first decisive Ottoman defeat , and stabilisation of borders . 
 During the Great Turkish War ( 1667 – 1698 ) , Slavonia was regained but western Bosnia , which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest , remained outside Croatian control . The present @-@ day border between the two countries is a remnant of this outcome . Dalmatia , the southern part of the border , was similarly defined by the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman – Venetian Wars . 
 The Ottoman wars instigated great demographic changes . Croats migrated towards Austria and the present @-@ day Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers . To replace the fleeing population , the Habsburgs encouraged the Christian populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier . Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737 – 39 . 
 The Croatian Parliament supported Emperor Charles 's Pragmatic Sanction and signed their own Pragmatic Sanction in 1712 . Subsequently , the emperor pledged to respect all privileges and political rights of Kingdom of Croatia and the empress Maria Theresa made significant contributions to Croatian matters . 
 Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire gradually occupied the entire eastern Adriatic coastline and a substantial part of its hinterland , ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics , establishing the Illyrian Provinces . In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the Adriatic Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811 . The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813 , and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815 . This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia , now both under the same crown . The 1830s and 1840s saw romantic nationalism inspire the Croatian National Revival , a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of all South Slavs in the empire . Its primary focus was the establishment of a standard language as a counterweight to Hungarian , along with the promotion of Croatian literature and culture . During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Croatia sided with the Austrians , Ban Josip Jelačić helping defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849 , and ushering a period of Germanization policy . 
 By the 1860s , failure of the policy became apparent , leading to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and creation of a personal union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary . The treaty left the issue of Croatia 's status to Hungary , and the status was resolved by the Croatian – Hungarian Settlement of 1868 , when kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united . The Kingdom of Dalmatia remained under de facto Austrian control , while Rijeka retained the status of Corpus separatum introduced in 1779 . 
 After Austria @-@ Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina following the 1878 Treaty of Berlin , the Croatian Military Frontier was abolished and the territory returned to Croatia in 1881 , pursuant to provisions of the Croatian @-@ Hungarian settlement . Renewed efforts to reform Austria @-@ Hungary , entailing federalisation with Croatia as a federal unit , were stopped by advent of World War I.

 On 29 October 1918 the Croatian Parliament ( Sabor ) declared independence and decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs , which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes . The Croatian Parliament never ratified a decision to unite with Serbia and Montenegro . The 1921 constitution defining the country as a unitary state and abolition of Croatian Parliament and historical administrative divisions effectively ended Croatian autonomy . The new constitution was opposed by the most widely supported national political party — the Croatian Peasant Party ( HSS ) led by Stjepan Radić . 
 The political situation deteriorated further as Radić was assassinated in the National Assembly in 1928 , leading to the dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929 . The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution , and changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia . The HSS , now led by Vladko Maček , continued to advocate federalisation of Yugoslavia , resulting in the Cvetković – Maček Agreement of August 1939 and the autonomous Banovina of Croatia . The Yugoslav government retained control of defence , internal security , foreign affairs , trade , and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown @-@ appointed Ban . 
 In April 1941 , Yugoslavia was occupied by Germany and Italy . Following the invasion the territory , parts of Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) , a Nazi @-@ backed puppet state . Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy and the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and Međimurje were annexed by Hungary . The NDH regime was led by Ante Pavelić and ultranationalist Ustaše . The regime introduced anti @-@ semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serb and Roma inhabitants of the NDH , exemplified by the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps . 
 It is estimated that out of 39 @,@ 000 Jews in the country only 9 @,@ 000 survived ; the rest were either killed or deported to Germany , both by the local authorities and the German Army itself . Croatian and Serbian sources disagree on the exact figures . 
 Furthermore , a significant number of Serbs were killed by the Ustaše on the territory of the NDH during the war . According to <unk> , the number of Serbs killed by the regime was at least half a million , but the figure is contradicted by Bogoljub Kočović and Vladimir Žerjavić . Kočović estimated total number of Serbs killed throughout Yugoslav territory in various circumstances at 487 @,@ 000 , while Žerjavić put the figure at 530 @,@ 000 . Žerjavić indicated that 320 @,@ 000 Serbs were killed in the NDH , including 82 @,@ 000 killed among the Yugoslav Partisans , 23 @,@ 000 killed as Axis collaborators , 25 @,@ 000 victims of typhoid epidemic , 45 @,@ 000 killed by Germans and 15 @,@ 000 by Italians . Kočović 's and Žerjavić 's total Yugoslav losses are in agreement with estimates made by Mayers and Campbell of the United States Census Bureau . The number of Croats killed in the NDH is estimated to be approximately 200 @,@ 000 , either by the Croatian fascist regime , as members of the armed resistance , or as Axis collaborators . Several thousand of these were killed by the Chetniks ; most Croatian historians place the number of Croats killed by the Chetniks on the territory of modern @-@ day Croatia at between 3 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 500 . Croatian estimates for the number of Croats killed by Chetniks in the whole of Yugoslavia range from 18 @,@ 000 to 32 @,@ 000 ( both combatants and civilians ) . 
 A resistance movement soon emerged . On 22 June 1941 , the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment was formed near Sisak , as the first military unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Europe . This sparked the beginning of the Yugoslav Partisan movement , a communist multi @-@ ethnic anti @-@ fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito . The movement grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies . 
 With Allied support in logistics , equipment , training and air power , and with the assistance of Soviet troops taking part in the 1944 Belgrade Offensive , the Partisans gained control of Yugoslavia and the border regions of Italy and Austria by May 1945 , during which thousands of members of the Ustaše , as well as Croat refugees , were killed by the Yugoslav Partisans . 
 The political aspirations of the Partisan movement were reflected in the State Anti @-@ fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia , which developed in 1943 as the bearer of Croatian statehood and later transformed into the Parliament of Croatia in 1945 , and AVNOJ — its counterpart at the Yugoslav level . 
 After World War II , Croatia became a single @-@ party socialist federal unit of the SFR Yugoslavia , ruled by the Communists , but enjoying a degree of autonomy within the federation . In 1967 , Croatian authors and linguists published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language demanding greater autonomy for Croatian language . The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy , culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971 , suppressed by Yugoslav leadership . Still , the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased autonomy to federal units , basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring , and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents . 
 Following the death of Yugoslav ruler Josip Broz Tito in 1980 , the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated , with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina , Kosovo and Montenegro . In January 1990 , the Communist Party fragmented along national lines , with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation . In the same year , the first multi @-@ party elections were held in Croatia , with Franjo Tuđman 's win raising nationalist tensions further . Some of Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina , intent on achieving independence from Croatia . 
 = = = Independence ( 1991 – present ) = = = 
 As tensions rose , Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991 ; however the full implementation of declaration only came into effect on 8 October 1991 . In the meantime , tensions escalated into overt war when the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) and various Serb paramilitary groups attacked Croatia . By the end of 1991 , a high @-@ intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to control of only about two @-@ thirds of its territory . The various Serb paramilitary groups then began pursuing a campaign of killing , terror and expulsion against the non @-@ Serb population in the rebel territories , killing hundreds of Croat civilians and forcing a further 170 @,@ 000 from their homes . 
 On 15 January 1992 , Croatia gained diplomatic recognition by the European Economic Community members , and subsequently the United Nations . The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory by Croatia . This was accompanied by the exodus of about 200 @,@ 000 Serbs from the rebel territories , whose lands were subsequently settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina . The remaining occupied areas were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995 , with the process concluded in January 1998 . Croatia became a World Trade Organization ( WTO ) member on 30 November 2000 . The country signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement ( SAA ) with the European Union in October 2001 . Croatia became a member of NATO on 1 April 2009 , and joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Croatia is located in Central and Southeast Europe , bordering Hungary to the northeast , Serbia to the east , Bosnia and Herzegovina to the southeast , Montenegro to the southeast , the Adriatic Sea to the southwest and Slovenia to the northwest . It lies mostly between latitudes 42 ° and 47 ° N and longitudes 13 ° and 20 ° E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial waters , but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum . 
 The territory covers 56 @,@ 594 square kilometres ( 21 @,@ 851 square miles ) , consisting of 56 @,@ 414 square kilometres ( 21 @,@ 782 square miles ) of land and 128 square kilometres ( 49 square miles ) of water . It is the 127th largest country in the world . Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Dinaric Alps with the highest point of the Dinara peak at 1 @,@ 831 metres ( 6 @,@ 007 feet ) near the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the south to the shore of the Adriatic Sea which makes up its entire southwest border . Insular Croatia consists of over a thousand islands and islets varying in size , 48 of which are permanently inhabited . The largest islands are Cres and Krk , each of them having an area of around 405 square kilometres ( 156 square miles ) . 
 The hilly northern parts of Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east ( which is part of the Pannonian Basin ) are traversed by major rivers such as Sava , Drava , Kupa and Danube . The Danube , Europe 's second longest river , runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Serbia . The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands . Natural resources found in the country in quantities significant enough for production include oil , coal , bauxite , low @-@ grade iron ore , calcium , gypsum , natural asphalt , silica , mica , clays , salt and hydropower . 
 Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps . There are a number of deep caves in Croatia , 49 of which are deeper than 250 m ( 820 @.@ 21 ft ) , 14 of them deeper than 500 m ( 1 @,@ 640 @.@ 42 ft ) and three deeper than 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 280 @.@ 84 ft ) . Croatia 's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes , a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades . The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours , ranging from turquoise to mint green , grey or blue . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the Köppen climate classification . Mean monthly temperature ranges between − 3 ° C ( 27 ° F ) ( in January ) and 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) ( in July ) . The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar where snowy forested climate is found at elevations above 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 feet ) . The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by the Mediterranean climate , as the temperature highs are moderated by the sea . Consequently , temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas — the lowest temperature of − 35 @.@ 5 ° C ( − 31 @.@ 9 ° F ) was recorded on 3 February 1919 in Čakovec , and the highest temperature of 42 @.@ 4 ° C ( 108 @.@ 3 ° F ) was recorded on 5 July 1950 in Karlovac . 
 Mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 millimetres ( 24 inches ) and 3 @,@ 500 millimetres ( 140 inches ) depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type . The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands ( Vis , Lastovo , <unk> , <unk> ) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia , however in the latter case , it is mostly occurring during the growing season . The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski kotar . 
 Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest , and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local area features . Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast , generally as <unk> or less frequently as sirocco . The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands , Hvar and Korčula , where more than 2700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year , followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general and northern Adriatic coast , all with more than 2000 hours of sunshine per year . 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 Croatia can be subdivided between a number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology . The country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity . There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia — Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland , Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar , Pannonian along Drava and Danube , and continental in the remaining areas . One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst , such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers , as well as underground habitats . 
 The karst geology harbours approximately 7 @,@ 000 caves and pits , some of which are habitat of the only known aquatic cave vertebrate — the olm . Forests are also significantly present in the country , as they cover 2 @,@ 490 @,@ 000 hectares ( 6 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 acres ) representing 44 % of Croatian land surface . Other habitat types include wetlands , grasslands , bogs , fens , scrub habitats , coastal and marine habitats . In terms of phytogeography , Croatia is a part of the Boreal Kingdom and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region . The World Wide Fund for Nature divides Croatia between three ecoregions — Pannonian mixed forests , Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests . 
 There are 37 @,@ 000 known species in Croatia , but their actual number is estimated to be between 50 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 . The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s ( decade ) alone . There are more than a thousand endemic species , especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains , Adriatic islands and karst rivers . Legislation protects 1 @,@ 131 species . The most serious threat to species is loss and degradation of habitats . A further problem is presented by invasive alien species , especially Caulerpa taxifolia algae . 
 The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect the benthic habitat . Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous . Those include five breeds of horses , five breeds of cattle , eight breeds of sheep , two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed . Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones . There are 444 protected areas of Croatia , encompassing 9 % of the country . Those include eight national parks , two strict reserves , and ten nature parks . The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme . The strict and special reserves , as well as the national and nature parks , are managed and protected by the central government , while other protected areas are managed by counties . In 2005 , the National Ecological Network was set up , as the first step in preparation of the EU accession and joining of the Natura 2000 network .

 The Republic of Croatia is a unitary state using a parliamentary system of governance . With the collapse of the ruling communist party in SFR Yugoslavia , Croatia organized its first multi @-@ party elections and adopted its present constitution in 1990 . It declared independence on 8 October 1991 leading to the break @-@ up of Yugoslavia and the country was internationally recognised by the United Nations in 1992 . Under its 1990 constitution , Croatia operated a semi @-@ presidential system until 2000 when it switched to a parliamentary system . Government powers in Croatia are divided into legislative , executive and judiciary powers . The legal system of Croatia is civil law , strongly influenced , as is the institutional framework , by the legal heritage of Austria @-@ Hungary . By the time EU accession negotiations were completed on 30 June 2010 , Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the Community <unk> . 
 The President of the Republic ( Croatian : Predsjednik Republike ) is the head of state , directly elected to a five @-@ year term and is limited by the Constitution to a maximum of two terms . In addition to being the commander in chief of the armed forces , the president has the procedural duty of appointing the prime minister with the consent of the parliament , and has some influence on foreign policy . The most recent presidential elections were held on 11 January 2015 , when Kolinda Grabar @-@ Kitarović won . She took the oath of office on 15 February 2015 . 
 The government is headed by the prime minister , who has four deputy prime ministers and 17 ministers in charge of particular sectors of activity . As the executive branch , it is responsible for proposing legislation and a budget , executing the laws , and guiding the foreign and internal policies of the republic . The government is seated at Banski dvori in Zagreb . Since 22 January 2016 , the prime minister of the government is Tihomir Orešković . 
 The parliament ( Sabor ) is a unicameral legislative body . A second chamber , the House of Counties , set up in 1993 pursuant to the 1990 Constitution , was abolished in 2001 . The number of Sabor members can vary from 100 to 160 ; they are all elected by popular vote to serve four @-@ year terms . The sessions of the Sabor take place from 15 January to 15 July , and from 15 September to 15 December . The two largest political parties in Croatia are the Croatian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia . 
 Croatia has a three @-@ tiered judicial system , made up of the Supreme Court , County courts , and Municipal courts . The Constitutional Court rules on matters regarding the Constitution . In addition there are misdemeanour courts , commercial courts and administrative courts . Law enforcement in Croatia is the responsibility of the Croatian police force , which is under the control of the Ministry of the Interior . In recent years , the force has been undergoing a reform with assistance from international agencies , including the Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ( OSCE ) since its mission to Croatia began on 18 April 1996 . 
 = = = Administrative divisions = = = 
 Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the Middle Ages . The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory , changes of political status of Dalmatia , Dubrovnik and Istria . Traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s , when the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes and subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced oblasts and banovinas respectively . 
 Communist @-@ ruled Croatia , as a constituent part of post @-@ WWII Yugoslavia , abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities , subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities . Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation , significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre @-@ 1920s subdivisions : In 1918 , the Transleithanian part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar , Gospić , Ogulin , Požega , Vukovar , Varaždin , Osijek and Zagreb , and the 1992 legislation established 14 counties in the same territory . 
 Since the counties were re @-@ established in 1992 , Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb , the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time . Borders of the counties changed in some instances since , with the latest revision taking place in 2006 . The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities . Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics ( NUTS ) division of Croatia is performed in several tiers . NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit , while there are three NUTS 2 regions . Those are Northwest Croatia , Central and Eastern ( Pannonian ) Croatia and Adriatic Croatia . The latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast . The Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb , Zagreb , Krapina @-@ Zagorje , Varaždin , Koprivnica @-@ Križevci and Međimurje counties , and the Central and Eastern ( Pannonian ) Croatia includes the remaining areas — Bjelovar @-@ Bilogora , Virovitica @-@ Podravina , Požega @-@ Slavonia , Brod @-@ Posavina , Osijek @-@ Baranja , Vukovar @-@ Syrmia , Karlovac and Sisak @-@ Moslavina counties . Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia . The NUTS Local administrative unit divisions are two @-@ tiered . LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units , while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia . 
 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 Croatia has established diplomatic relations with 174 countries . As of 2009 , Croatia maintains a network of 51 embassies , 24 consulates and eight permanent diplomatic missions abroad . Furthermore , there are 52 foreign embassies and 69 consulates in the Republic of Croatia in addition to offices of international organisations such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , International Organization for Migration , OSCE , World Bank , World Health Organization ( WHO ) , International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) , United Nations Development Programme , United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF . In 2009 , the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration employed 1 @,@ 381 personnel and expended 648 @.@ 2 million kuna ( € 86 @.@ 4 million ) . Stated aims of Croatian foreign policy include enhancing relations with neighbouring countries , developing international co @-@ operation and promotion of the Croatian economy and Croatia itself . 
 Since 2003 , Croatian foreign policy has focused on achieving the strategic goal of becoming a member state of the European Union ( EU ) . In December 2011 , Croatia completed the EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011 . Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking the end of a process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003 . A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia 's ICTY co @-@ operation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of Croatia – Slovenia border disputes . The latter was resolved through an Arbitration Agreement of 4 November 2009 , approved by national parliaments and a referendum in Slovenia . 
 Another strategic Croatian foreign policy goal for the 2000s was NATO membership . Croatia was included in the Partnership for Peace in 2000 , invited to NATO membership in 2008 and formally joined the alliance on 1 April 2009 . Croatia became a member of the United Nations Security Council for the 2008 – 2009 term , assuming presidency in December 2008 . The country is preparing to join the Schengen Area by 2015 . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 The Croatian Armed Forces ( CAF ) consist of the Army , Navy and Air Force branches in addition to the Education and Training Command and Support Command . The CAF is headed by the General Staff , which reports to the Defence Minister , who in turn reports to the President of Croatia . According to the constitution , the President is commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the armed forces and in case of immediate threat during wartime he issues orders directly to the General Staff . 
 Following the 1991 – 95 war defence spending and CAF size have been in constant decline . As of 2005 military spending was an estimated 2 @.@ 39 % of the country 's GDP , which placed Croatia 64th in a ranking of all countries . Since 2005 the budget was kept below 2 % of GDP , down from the record high of 11 @.@ 1 % in 1994 . Traditionally relying on a large number of conscripts , CAF also went through a period of reforms focused on downsizing , restructuring and professionalisation in the years prior to Croatia 's accession to NATO in April 2009 . According to a presidential decree issued in 2006 the CAF is set to employ 18 @,@ 100 active duty military personnel , 3 @,@ 000 civilians and 2 @,@ 000 voluntary conscripts between the ages of 18 and 30 in peacetime . 
 Compulsory conscription was abolished in January 2008 . Until 2008 military service was compulsory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six @-@ month tours of duty , reduced in 2001 from the earlier scheme of nine @-@ month conscription tours . Conscientious objectors could instead opt for an eight @-@ month civilian service . As of April 2011 the Croatian military had 120 members stationed in foreign countries as part of United Nations @-@ led international peacekeeping forces , including 95 serving as part of the <unk> in the Golan Heights . As of 2011 an additional 350 troops serve as part of the NATO @-@ led ISAF force in Afghanistan and another 20 with the KFOR in Kosovo . 
 Croatia also has a significant military industry sector which exported around US $ 120 million worth of military equipment and armament in 2010 . Croatian @-@ made weapons and vehicles used by CAF include the standard sidearm <unk> manufactured by HS Produkt and the M @-@ <unk> battle tank designed by the Đuro Đaković factory . Uniforms and helmets worn by CAF soldiers are also locally produced and successfully marketed to other countries . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Croatia has a high @-@ income economy . International Monetary Fund data projects that Croatian nominal GDP stands at $ 52 billion , or $ 12 @,@ 405 per capita for year 2017 , while purchasing power parity GDP stands at $ 97 billion , or $ 23 @,@ 171 per capita . According to Eurostat data , Croatian PPS GDP per capita stood at 61 % of the EU average in 2012 . 
 Real GDP growth in 2007 was 6 @.@ 0 per cent . The average net salary of a Croatian worker in February 2016 was 5 @,@ 652 HRK per month , and the average gross salary was 7 @,@ 735 HRK per month . As of March 2016 , registered unemployment rate in Croatia was 17 @.@ 2 % . 
 In 2010 , economic output was dominated by the service sector which accounted for 66 % of GDP , followed by the industrial sector with 27 @.@ 2 % and agriculture accounting for 6 @.@ 8 % of GDP . According to 2004 data , 2 @.@ 7 % of the workforce were employed in agriculture , 32 @.@ 8 % by industry and 64 @.@ 5 % in services . The industrial sector is dominated by shipbuilding , food processing , pharmaceuticals , information technology , biochemical and timber industry . In 2010 , Croatian exports were valued at 64 @.@ 9 billion kuna ( € 8 @.@ 65 billion ) with 110 @.@ 3 billion kuna ( € 14 @.@ 7 billion ) worth of imports . The largest trading partner is rest of the European Union . More than half of Croatia 's trade is with other European Union member states . 
 Privatization and the drive toward a market economy had barely begun under the new Croatian Government when war broke out in 1991 . As a result of the war , the economic infrastructure sustained massive damage , particularly the revenue @-@ rich tourism industry . From 1989 to 1993 , the GDP fell 40 @.@ 5 % . The Croatian state still controls a significant part of the economy , with government expenditures accounting for as much as 40 % of GDP . A backlogged judiciary system , combined with inefficient public administration , especially on issues of land ownership and corruption , are particular concerns . In 2011 the country has been ranked 66th by Transparency International with a Corruption Perceptions Index of 4 @.@ 0 . In June 2013 , the national debt stood at 59 @.@ 5 % of the nation 's GDP . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 Tourism dominates the Croatian service sector and accounts for up to 20 % of Croatian GDP . Annual tourist industry income for 2014 was estimated at € 7 @.@ 4 billion . Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business , processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment . The industry is considered an export business , because it significantly reduces the country 's external trade imbalance . Since the conclusion of the Croatian War of Independence , the tourist industry has grown rapidly , recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers , with more than 11 million tourists each year . The most numerous are tourists from Germany , Slovenia , Austria , Italy and the Czech Republic as well as Croatia itself . Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averages 4 @.@ 9 days . 
 The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the Adriatic Sea coast . Opatija was the first holiday resort since the middle of the 19th century . By the 1890s , it became one of the most significant European health resorts . Later a number of resorts sprang up along the coast and islands , offering services ranging from mass tourism to catering and various niche markets , the most significant being nautical tourism , as there are numerous marinas with more than 16 thousand berths , cultural tourism relying on appeal of medieval coastal cities and numerous cultural events taking place during the summer . Inland areas offer mountain resorts , <unk> and spas . Zagreb is also a significant tourist destination , rivalling major coastal cities and resorts . 
 Croatia has unpolluted marine areas reflected through numerous nature reserves and 116 Blue Flag beaches . Croatia is ranked as the 18th most popular tourist destination in the world . About 15 % of these visitors ( over one million per year ) are involved with naturism , an industry for which Croatia is world famous . It was also the first European country to develop commercial naturist resorts .
