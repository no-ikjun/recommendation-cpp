 = Hellenic Naval Air Service = 
 The Hellenic Naval Air Service ( Greek : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) or <unk> was the air arm of the Hellenic Navy from 1915 to 1930 . 
 The first aviation units in the Greek Armed Forces were formed in June 1912 . In the following Balkan Wars , the Hellenic Navy was the first in military history to use aircraft to track down and bomb the enemy fleet ( 1913 ) . The Naval Air Service was officially established during the First World War and participated with the Allies in several missions over the Aegean . After participation in the Greco @-@ Turkish War ( 1919 – 1922 ) a long period of peace followed during which the Naval Air Service was reorganized and upgraded , especially with the establishment of the State Aircraft Factory , which manufactured various types of aircraft . In 1930 the Naval Air Service was merged with the Hellenic Army Aviation and formed the third branch in the Greek Armed Forces , the Hellenic Air Force . 
 The Hellenic Naval Air Service must not be confused with the current aviation branch of the Hellenic Navy , which includes the helicopter @-@ equipped Navy Helicopter Command ( <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> ) and the 353rd Naval Cooperation Squadron ( 353 <unk> ) , run jointly with the Hellenic Air Force .

 Aviation had been introduced to Greece in February 1912 , when <unk> Argyropoulos performed a flight , with his privately owned Nieuport <unk> aircraft , around Athens . An hour later a second flight was carried on with the Prime Minister of Greece , Eleftherios Venizelos as passenger . Venizelos , impressed by the potential of air warfare , suggested that Greece should take advance of this new weapon . The following months a French military mission took up the development of Greek aviation by creating a fleet of four Maurice Farman MF.7 airplanes . In June 1912 , aviator Dimitrios <unk> modified one of the Farmans into a hydroplane , giving it the name of the mythical hero Daedalus . 
 When the Balkan Wars broke out in October 1912 , these airplanes performed a number of reconnaissance and bombing missions ; the most notable was a sortie against the Ottoman fleet anchorage in the Dardanelles , where First Lieutenant Michael <unk> and Ensign Aristeidis Moraitinis spotted the Ottoman fleet and dropped four bombs . This mission is regarded as the first naval @-@ air operation in military history and was widely commented upon in the press , both Greek and international . Meanwhile , the Hellenic Navy , in the process of setting up its air arm , bought a fleet of Sopwith <unk> seaplanes ( also known as Greek Seaplanes ) . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At the beginning of 1914 credits were voted for the creation of a naval aerodrome in Eleusina , Attica . Meanwhile , despite limited funds Aristeidis Moraitinis managed to establish the first naval aviation school and corps . In spring 1915 the establishment of an independent Naval Aviation Department within the Ministry of Naval Affairs and the incorporation of the Greek naval air fleet into the Greek Navy ensured the foundation of the Naval Air Service ( <unk> ) . Meanwhile , disagreements between King Constantine I and Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos over whether Greece should enter World War I , lead to political instability and the National Schism ( 1914 – 1916 ) . Greece officially joined the Triple Entente at June 1917 , however the anti @-@ royalist party of the country under the leadership of Venizelos formed a Movement of National Defence that supported the Allied military operations in the region from December 1916 . 
 During the following years ( 1917 – 1918 ) , a fighter and bomber squadron , known as " Z " Squadron ( Greek : <unk> <unk> ) , was created by Greek personnel under direct Royal Naval Air Service command and carried out operations in the northern Aegean , based at Moudros ( Lemnos ) and Thasos . Moreover , a joint Army @-@ Navy flight school was established at Moudros . The activity of " Z " Squadron included anti @-@ submarine sweeps , attacks against targets of vital importance , as well as dogfights . Among the most significant missions were the night raids against the Gallipoli @-@ Constantinople peninsula in June 1917 , the heavy bombings of enemy positions in the Macedonian front , as well as Izmir , Ottoman Empire . In 1918 the Naval Aviation had four squadrons of Sopwith Camel biplanes and other aircraft , while each one counted ca . 10 @-@ 12 aircraft . 
 Aristeidis Moraitinis , the commander of the Hellenic Naval Air Service , acquired the nickname the Fearless Aviator by his British colleagues and counted nine victories in total , becoming so Greece 's only World War I ace . In one occasion , on 20 January 1918 , Moraitinis , fought ten enemy aircraft which attacked two British Sopwith Baby seaplanes he was escorting on their way to bomb the Turkish battlecruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim ( the former German SMS Goeben ) and managed to shoot down three of them . 
 = = = Greco @-@ Turkish War and Interwar period = = = 
 In the following Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1919 – 1922 the Naval Aviation formed one squadron , that together with additional four of the Army Aviation Service participated in operations in Asia Minor . This squadron ( Greek : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) initially consisted of 10 Airco DH.9 bombers and 15 Sopwith Camel F.1 fighters . 
 The Asia Minor Campaign was followed by a long period of peace during which both the Hellenic Army and Naval Aviation Services were reorganized and upgraded . From 1925 new types of aircraft of British and , mainly , French manufacture were delivered . At 1925 , in co @-@ operation with the British Company Blackburn Aircraft , the State Aircraft Factory ( <unk> ) was set up in Phaleron , near Athens . The factory developed a number of aircraft that were designed by Blackburn Aircraft and built under license , like the two @-@ seat torpedo carrier , <unk> <unk> and the <unk> Chelidon , as well as the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas and the Avro 504 . On the other hand , a new Naval Aviation school was established at Tatoi , Attica , in 1926 . 
 In 1930 the Air Ministry was founded and the Hellenic Air Force was established as a unified independent branch of the Hellenic Armed Forces . Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos was sworn in as the first Air Minister and assigned the reorganisation of the branch to the veteran aviator Alexandros <unk> .

" The island 's east and west sides are connected by a tombolo , and the southern side has a lagoon that winds its way around the lighthouse . 
 = = History = = 
 There are two theories for how the island got its name , the first of which is that the island is named after Captain Kidd who was rumored to have buried a treasure of gold and silver on it . The Town of Greenwich acknowledges both this and another theory that states that " [ t ] he " Captain " of the title reportedly memorializes Captain Daniel Patrick , a partner in the first recorded real estate transaction in Greenwich in the 1640s and the town 's first military commander . " 
 In 1763 , George III granted the island to John Anderson . In 1829 , the federal government purchased 3 @.@ 5 acres of land on the southeast part of Great Captain Island from Samuel Lyons . The states of New York and Connecticut both claimed the island in the 19th century but , after 50 years , a commission resolved the dispute in favor of Connecticut . The lighthouse keepers and their families farmed on the tract of land and the other areas of the island were used for hunting , fishing and recreational use . In 1926 , the rest of the island was sold to a developer who built and opened an exclusive clubhouse on the site . Opening in 1930 , at the beginning of the Great Depression , it soon was closed . The Town of Greenwich acquired the island through foreclosure and sold the property to Port @-@ Green Corporation . During this time , the Coast Guard inadvertently destroyed the clubhouse by dropping flares on it while searching for a missing plane . A fire in 1955 would destroy the rest of the club . In 1955 , <unk> Industries purchased the island and used it as an employee recreational spot and built cabana cottages on it in 1957 . During its ownership with <unk> , it was re @-@ named Huckleberry Island , until the Town of Greenwich purchased it in 1966 for $ 90 @,@ 000 . In 1973 , the federal government turned over the remaining tract of land upon which the lighthouse rests .

 The Great Captain Island Light was first constructed in 1829 on the 3 @.@ 5 acre tract of land that Samuel Lyons sold to the government . The lighthouse was of poor construction and was replaced in 1868 with a new granite dwelling with attached lantern . The lighthouse is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk ; Morgan Point in Noank ; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York ; and Block Island North in Rhode Island . The lighthouse was deactivated in 1970 when a skeletal tower replaced it . The Town of Greenwich acquired the property in 1973 and had full @-@ time caretakers on the site until the lighthouse became too dilapidated in 2003 . A successful restoration effort was completed in 2009 and a non @-@ navigational light was activated in 2012 . In 1991 , the Great Captain Island Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places . In 2010 , a September 11 memorial plaque was installed to " honor the 23 people who lived in Greenwich , or had a connection to the town " , who died in the September 11 attacks " . A non @-@ navigational 4 @-@ second flashing green light was installed in the lighthouse on February 13 , 2012 . The lighthouse is currently occupied by a family who act as caretakers of the property .

 Great Captain Island is one of the state 's 26 " important bird areas " that provide an essential habitat for one or more bird species , according to the Connecticut Audubon Society . Great blue herons have been on the island since the 1990s . Great egrets , snowy egrets , and black @-@ crowned night herons also live on the island . The island was once known as the state 's largest heron and egret rookery , but in the early 2000s their populations shrunk dramatically , with summer counts down from a total of 364 in 1998 to 98 in 2004 . Patrick Comins , director of bird conservation for Audubon Connecticut , thinks that the bird populations have been hurt by human disturbances and possibly by competition from cormorants and a great horned owl that lives on the island and has fed on the birds . Comins also said that overall pollution in Long Island Sound waters might also have an effect .

 In the uplands of the island , an area that used to be lawn has been replaced with oak , hickory , ash , cherry , tree of heaven and sassafras . By the lighthouse , several openings in the shrubbery have been made to provide a variety of habitats for wildlife and a barrier of shrubs has been planted on the cliffs east of the lighthouse .

 " Diamonds " is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna for her seventh studio album , Unapologetic ( 2012 ) . It was written by Sia Furler together with its producers , Benny Blanco and StarGate . The song premiered on September 26 , 2012 , during the Elvis Duran and the Morning Show and was digitally released the following day as the lead single from Unapologetic . Def Jam Recordings serviced the single to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 2 . " Diamonds " is a mid @-@ tempo electronic and pop ballad that features heavy synthesizers , orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms . The song 's lyrics serve as a departure from the themes of unhealthy relationships that were on Rihanna 's previous singles and contain a prominent concept of love . 
 " Diamonds " was well received by most critics , some of whom complimented Rihanna 's different musical direction , while others criticized the song 's production . The single topped music charts in over twenty countries , including the United States , where it became Rihanna 's twelfth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and tied her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fifth @-@ most number one singles in the chart 's history . " Diamonds " was certified five @-@ times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and sold over 3 @.@ 5 million digital copies in the country . By May 2013 , it had sold over 7 @.@ 5 million copies worldwide and became one of the best @-@ selling singles of all @-@ time . 
 The song 's music video was shot by director Anthony Mandler , a frequent collaborator of Rihanna 's , and depicts her in four environments that represent the elements of earth , air , water and fire . The video received positive reviews and was praised for its imagery . Some critics believe that the heavily tattooed man intertwined with Rihanna 's arm in the video resembles Chris Brown . The singer performed " Diamonds " on television shows such as Saturday Night Live and The X Factor and included it on the 777 , Diamonds and The Monster Tour set lists . The American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers ( ASCAP ) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2013 and 2014 .

 In 2012 , American songwriter and record producer Benny Blanco met with Norwegian production duo StarGate at a recording studio in New York City to write new songs , including one for Rihanna . StarGate had previously produced her singles " Don 't Stop the Music " ( 2007 ) and " Only Girl ( In the World ) " ( 2010 ) . According to Blanco , he and StarGate wanted to deviate from Rihanna 's usual sound and produce as though the song would be for a rapper such as Kanye West : " It 's the one that we weren 't thinking Rihanna ... that turned into the Rihanna record ... But that 's how it always happens like with me " . They produced the song 's drum machine beat after the other instrumental music was recorded . 
 StarGate 's Mikkel Eriksen told The New York Times that Blanco took a recorded snippet of Eriksen 's singing , altered it electronically , and made it sound " dirtier " . He then applied timbre and used audio software to create ghostly accompaniment lines . Eriksen described Blanco 's style as " unorthodox , as he almost never plays the keyboards but throws in weird samples and alters them to the right pitch to go with the song . " Australian singer @-@ songwriter Sia later joined them and wrote the lyrics for " Diamonds " in 14 minutes . 
 After the song was completed , they wanted to play it to Rihanna , but Blanco was skeptical about the reaction towards the song because of its slow sound . After StarGate played it to her , they called Blanco from London and told him that she liked the song : " She 's flippin ' out . She played it like seven times in a row . It 's her favorite song . " Phil Tan and the assistant Daniela Rivera , mixed and mastered " Diamonds " . Recalling it , in an interview with The Huffington Post , Blanco commented , " we needed to have it recorded , the beat finished , mixed and mastered in 24 hours . She was recording in a separate part of the world , sending back the files , we 're finishing the music and then we 're mixing and mastering it , and then it was out in a few days . It 's fucking amazing and incredible . " Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna 's vocals on the song and recorded them together with Marcos Tovar .

It features heavy synthesizers , orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms accompanied with Rihanna 's vocal performance . Rolling Stone magazine wrote that " the track 's production mainly stays out of Rihanna 's way , letting the pop star build hooks with layers of her voice . " In a review of Unapologetic , Stacy @-@ Ann Ellis of Vibe noted that an improvement in the singer 's singing is evinced by ballads such as " Diamonds " and Stay " . According to EMI Music Publishing 's digital sheet music for the song , " Diamonds " is composed in the key of B minor and set in common time signature , and has a moderately slow groove of 92 beats per minute . Rihanna 's vocals span from the low note of F ♯ 3 to the high note of F ♯ 5 . 
 Lyrically , " Diamonds " is a departure from Rihanna 's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs , and contains a prominent concept of love . The first verse introduces the song 's concept : " Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I , you and I / We 're like diamonds in the sky . " The hook continues this metaphor : " So shine bright , tonight , you and I / We 're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye , so alive . " According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe , the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as " I choose to be happy " and " We 're like diamonds in the sky " . James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship , particularly with the line " When you hold me , I 'm alive " , and admits " I knew that we 'd become one right away " . Lindsay <unk> of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as , " When you hold me , I 'm alive , " and " At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes .

" He also tried to relate the video 's concept to Rihanna 's personal life : " What 's truth or fiction ? You know ' Is she drowning , or is she in complete ecstasy ? Are those hands coming apart , or are they finding each other ? ' ... we tried to bring up these deeper questions that relate to song and her life and finding beauty in chaos and finding beauty in pain and finding pain in beauty .

 = Conker 's Bad Fur Day = 
 Conker 's Bad Fur Day is an action @-@ platform video game developed by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in 2001 . As part of the Conker video game series , the game follows the story of Conker the Squirrel , a greedy , heavy @-@ drinking red squirrel who attempts to return home to his girlfriend Berri . The gameplay is composed of various challenges that involve platforming , solving puzzles , fighting enemies , and gathering objects . The game also features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players can compete in seven different game types . 
 Although visually similar to Rare 's family @-@ oriented Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo @-@ Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 , Conker 's Bad Fur Day was designed for mature audiences and features cartoon violence , alcohol and tobacco use , profanity , vulgar humor and pop culture references . It was developed over the course of four years and was originally intended for a family audience , but was ultimately retooled into its current form because previews were criticised for being both too cute and similar to Rare 's earlier platform games . 
 Upon release , Conker 's Bad Fur Day received critical acclaim from video game journalists , who praised its visual appeal and smart , funny humour . The game sold well below expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards the end of the Nintendo 64 's life cycle , but has since earned a cult following due to its unique styling . A remake , Conker : Live & Reloaded , was released for the Xbox in 2005 . In 2015 , the game was included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Conker 's Bad Fur Day is an action @-@ platform game where the player controls Conker the Squirrel through a series of three @-@ dimensional levels . The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another , although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash . Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do . The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges . These challenges may include defeating a boss , solving puzzles , gathering objects , and racing opponents , among others . The result is always a cash reward , which aids access to other areas in the overworld . 
 Conker 's abilities are far simpler than those of previous Rare platform games Banjo @-@ Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 . The player can run , jump , and smack enemies with a frying pan . Conker also has a few other physical abilities . He can swim underwater for a while until he runs out of breath , climb ladders or ropes , and is strong enough to push heavy objects . To regain lost health , Conker can eat pieces of " anti @-@ gravity " Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels . Additionally , the game employs " context sensitive " pads that allow Conker to gain different , temporary abilities when pressing the " B " button atop them . For instance , in the beginning of the game , by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters , Conker drinks some Alka @-@ Seltzer to wipe out his hangover , at which point players can proceed forward . Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil to slam into the ground , and some are also used to pull out his shotgun , to activate his throwing knives , slingshot and so on . They also serve to inform players of what needs to be done next . 
 The game also includes a multiplayer mode , where up to four players can compete against each other in seven different game types : Beach , Raptor , Heist , War , Tank , Race and Deathmatch . In Beach , some players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle , while others must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions . Raptor involves players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur , while others play as cavemen that have to steal dinosaur eggs . Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank , where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag from the center of the level and run with it to the team 's vault without being damaged . War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War , where players have to get the other teams gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy . Similarly , in Tank players fight against each other by using tanks and grabbing chemical canisters that can release a lethal corrosive gas , destroying all the tanks that are outdoors . Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course . Items can be acquired and used against opponents . Finally , there is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third @-@ person perspective . Players can set a number of different options for each game , such as score limit , number of lives , and inclusion of optional bots . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Conker 's Bad Fur Day follows the story of Conker the Squirrel , a red squirrel , who finds himself lost in a strange land after a night of binge drinking with his friends , and embarks on a quest simply to return home to his girlfriend , Berri . Meanwhile , the Panther King , ruler of the land that Conker is lost in , finds that his throne 's side table is missing one of its legs and orders his paraplegic weasel servant , Professor Von Kriplespac , to solve the problem . Kriplespac suggests the use of a red squirrel as the fourth leg for his table , and therefore the Panther King sends his minions to search for one and capture it . As Conker searches for his way home , he finds himself embroiled in a series of increasingly absurd and often dangerous situations , including having to recover a bee hive from some enormous wasps , confronting a giant opera @-@ singing pile of feces , being turned into a bat by a vampire , and even getting drafted into a war between grey squirrels and a Nazi @-@ like group of teddy bears known as the " <unk> , " which Conker ultimately destroys . During his quest to return home , Conker finds wads of cash scattered throughout the land and becomes sidetracked from his goal . 
 In the final chapter of the game , Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso , head of the Weasel Mafia , to rob a bank . After entering the vault , they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker . In the ensuing confrontation , Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker , but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King . Afterwards , he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing , and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside to watch as a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King 's chest , killing him instantly . Von Kriplespac explains that the alien , whom he had named Heinrich , is one of his creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity . Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship , which he activates and takes into low orbit . From there , he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the <unk> , which were also his creations . Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock , pulling Von Kriplespac and Berri 's corpse into space . After Conker briefly battles Heinrich with the aid of a robotic suit , Heinrich takes one last lunge at him , when suddenly the entire game freezes . Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly , and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation . The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King 's throne room , where he decapitates Heinrich . As a result , he is crowned the new King of the land . 
 As characters from the previous chapters of the game gather around to congratulate him , Conker realizes that he should have brought Berri back to life when he was negotiating with programmers . He calls them out to bring her back to life , only to realize that they have left already . Conker then gives a closing monologue , in which he discusses appreciating what one already has instead of always wanting more , stating that " the grass is always greener , and you don 't really know what it is you have until it 's gone . " The credits roll , and afterwards Conker is seen back at the same pub he was seen in at the start of the game , drowning his sorrows in Scotch whisky . He drunkenly exits the bar as it begins to storm outside , and leaves in the direction opposite the one he took previously . 
 = = Development and marketing = = 
 Conker 's Bad Fur Day was developed by Rare and directed by Chris Seavor . The game was announced to be in development at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 1997 , under the title Conker 's Quest . A year later , it was revealed that the game 's title was changed to Twelve Tales : Conker 64 and players would be able to control Conker in action @-@ based settings and Berri in strategy @-@ based settings , with the possibility of two player split @-@ screen gameplay . Early screenshots suggested that the game would be targeted at a family audience and feature cute characters and colourful settings . Rare had a history of making games of this sort and at first Twelve Tales : Conker 64 appeared to be similar . However , Rare was influenced by a critical reception of the prototype game 's cuteness , resulting in a game design overhaul . The fact that the game was delayed several times and not mentioned for almost a year led to speculation that the game was quietly cancelled . Rare later clarified that the game was " still being worked on by a full team and with the same level of dedication as when it was first announced . " 
 In 2000 , it was announced that Conker was retooled into a controversial game titled Conker 's Bad Fur Day with a large amount of scatological humour . According to the developers , " We already had the main character ( although he was eventually remodeled ) and a good deal of code already written , so the best option seemed to be to change the game 's direction . Mature humor was a key element . " Several aspects of the game were designed to attract an adult audience . Unlike in Banjo @-@ Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 , item collecting was mostly discarded and character abilities were simplified with " context sensitive " pads . The game also relies heavily on cutscenes and features a large number of film parodies . Some offensive content was censored under the supervision of Nintendo , including cutscenes with Pokémon and a joke at the expense of the Ku Klux Klan . Seavor , however , remarked that " pretty much 99 @.@ 9 % of the game remained . " 
 In 2013 , the developers explained that they had originally drawn inspiration from their deep analysis of the gameplay and camera mechanics of Super Mario 64 . According to them , " We were just copying Mario , weren 't we ? Which , to this day , is still the best 3D camera . " A lot of time and care was spent on system performance optimisation , animation details , and audiovisual appeal . For example , to increase the number of simultaneous light sources to four , one programmer spent four months deciphering and rewriting the Nintendo @-@ supplied Japanese @-@ commented microcode for the Nintendo 64 's Reality <unk> , while another <unk> the support for MP3 , reverberation , and Dolby Pro Logic surround sound . A developer also spent weeks optimising the system 's ability to display distant backdrops as texture tiles to enhance gameplay navigation and visual appeal . Due in part to its extensive vocal track , Conker 's Bad Fur Day is one of the few Nintendo 64 games that features a <unk> cartridge . 
 Conker 's Bad Fur Day was first released on 5 March 2001 in North America . Advertisements for the game were featured in adult magazines such as Playboy , and video commercials were geared towards an adult audience . As Nintendo was known for its family @-@ friendly games like Mario and Pokémon , the game was the subject of controversy . According to Rare , " Nintendo initially had concerns regarding this issue , because kids might confuse the product as being aimed at them , but I 'm sure you 'll agree if you 've seen the box that Nintendo is making sure nobody makes that mistake . " Nintendo of America declined to acknowledge the game in its Nintendo Power magazine and KB Toys , which specialised in toys and video games for children , decided not to sell the game . In Europe , the game was published and distributed by THQ on 6 April 2001 , after Nintendo of Europe declined to publish it .

 Conker 's Bad Fur Day received critical acclaim , with an aggregate review score of 92 out of 100 at Metacritic . Many publications and websites declared the graphics were the best on the Nintendo 64 . Critics noted that the game featured a number of technical effects that were uncommon at the time , especially for a Nintendo 64 game , such as dynamic shadowing , coloured lighting , large areas with a long draw distance , no distance fog , detailed facial animations , lip syncing , and individually rendered fingers on some characters . Shane Satterfield of GameSpot went so far as to say that the game " makes other Nintendo 64 games look like 16 @-@ bit software . " IGN 's Matt Casamassina praised the detailed 3D worlds , " fantastic " texture work , and cute character designs . He remarked that " Conker himself is equipped with an in @-@ game facial animation system that realistically portrays his different moods as he travels the lands . When he 's scared , he looks it , and when he 's pissed off players will actually be able to see his teeth showing in a frown . " Reviewers noted occasional drops in the frame rate , but most agreed it did not interfere with the gameplay . 
 Critics also gave high marks for the game 's audio and diverse vocal track , which easily outnumbered that of other voiced Nintendo 64 games such as Perfect Dark or Turok 2 : Seeds of Evil . The voice acting was praised highly for its different accents and styles , with " cleverly lewd " scripts and " dead @-@ on " movie spoofs . Similar to Rare 's earlier game Banjo @-@ Kazooie , the soundtrack was credited for its different arrangements of specific songs that gradually change as players move from one area to the next , and for its rich and creative instrumentation . Reviewers also highlighted the number of sound effects . Satterfield observed that " there are literally dozens of sounds just for Conker 's footsteps " . 
 The gameplay was highlighted for its variety and unconventional context @-@ sensitive systems . Matt Casamassina credited Rare for reducing the number of items to collect and simplifying the moves with context @-@ sensitive pads , stating that they " help keep the action shifting , refreshing , and always exciting . " In contrast , Game Revolution 's Johnny Liu criticised its simplistic action , short length and linear nature . Similarly , GameSpot noted that the game 's linearity " cuts its length considerably " . The game 's camera system was criticised by several reviewers . Geraint Evans of N64 Magazine felt that it does not allow players to properly judge their position within their surroundings , while GameSpot remarked that it can get caught on objects or refuse to obey commands . The multiplayer was described as inventive and was praised for its numerous options . Shane Satterfield , however , remarked : " While the extra [ multiplayer ] modes do add some longevity to [ Conker 's Bad Fur Day ] , the majority of them fail to stand the test of time . " Most reviewers agreed the jokes were clever and funny . According to Casamassina , " Is it over the top ? Yes . Is it lowbrow ? Yes . And yet , it 's also very well delivered and smart too -- and it 's funny . Really , honestly , funny " . Game Revolution noted that the game " has its crosshairs directly aimed at the college audience " and that " it works perfectly for the peeps who 've grown up with Mario and are now looking for someone less dorky " . 
 Conker 's Bad Fur Day was awarded the 2001 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for sound , IGN 's Game of the Month for March 2001 , and GameSpot 's Best Platform Game for 2001 . In 2009 , Official Nintendo Magazine placed Conker 's Bad Fur Day at # 97 on their list of 100 Greatest Nintendo Games Ever , and GameTrailers rated it # 1 on their list of Top Ten Funniest Games . In 2010 , UGO included the game at # 3 on their list of The 11 <unk> Game Endings . Although the game fared well with critics in both the United Kingdom and United States , it sold worse than expected ( only about 55 @,@ 000 copies as of April 2001 ) , partly due to its prohibitively high cost , advertisements exclusive to the older audience , and release towards the end of the Nintendo 64 's life cycle . Despite these factors , the game has enjoyed a cult following due to its unique styling .

 After the release of Conker 's Bad Fur Day , Rare began development of a direct sequel referred to as Conker 's Other Bad Day . Chris Seavor revealed that the game would deal with " Conker 's somewhat unsuccessful tenure as King . He spends all the treasured money on beer , parties and hookers . Thrown into prison , Conker is faced with the prospect of execution and the game starts with his escape , ball and chain attached , from the Castle 's highest tower . " However , the sequel was ultimately cancelled . 
 In 2002 , Rare was purchased by Microsoft and decided to develop a remake of Conker 's Bad Fur Day . The remake , titled Conker : Live & Reloaded , was released for the Xbox in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception . Developers noted that it was difficult to port the game to the Xbox system because Bad Fur Day 's <unk> performance <unk> had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware . Conker : Live & Reloaded features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live service . Additionally , some aspects in the single @-@ player mode were adjusted : several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that are present in the Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft 's request , the camera control was refined and improved with a zoom function , and an auto @-@ targeting system was added to the game . 
 After the release of Live & Reloaded , Rare began work on another game in the Conker universe titled Conker : Gettin ' Medieval . The game was to be multiplayer focused and did not feature Conker as a main character , with Rare instead hoping to focus on other characters in the series . However , the game was ultimately cancelled . Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for the sandbox game Project Spark . The campaign , titled Conker 's Big Reunion , is set ten years after the events of Bad Fur Day and Seavor reprised his voice roles . The first episode of the campaign was released in April 2015 , but the remaining ones were cancelled the following September . Conker 's Bad Fur Day is also included as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One . The compilation was released on August 4 , 2015 . 
 = Harbhajan Singh = 
 Harbhajan Singh <unk> ( pronunciation ; born 3 July 1980 in Jalandhar , Punjab , India ) , commonly known as Harbhajan Singh , is an Indian international cricketer and former captain of IPL team Mumbai Indians and Punjab state for the 2012 – 13 Ranji Trophy season . A specialist spin bowler , he has the second @-@ highest number of Test wickets by an off spinner , behind Sri Lanka 's Muttiah Muralitharan . Harbhajan made his Test and One Day International ( ODI ) debuts in early 1998 . His career was initially affected by investigations into the legality of his bowling action , as well as several disciplinary incidents . However , in 2001 , with leading leg spinner Anil Kumble injured , Harbhajan 's career was resuscitated after Indian captain Sourav Ganguly called for his inclusion in the Border @-@ Gavaskar Trophy team . In that series victory over Australia , Harbhajan established himself as the team 's leading spinner by taking 32 wickets , becoming the first Indian bowler to take a hat trick in Test cricket . He is also an Officer in the Punjab Police and has held the rank of a Superintendent of police ( India ) , reporting to Punjab Police HQ at <unk> . 
 A finger injury in mid @-@ 2003 sidelined him for much of the following year , allowing Kumble to regain his position as the first choice spinner in Tests and ODI 's . Harbhajan reclaimed a regular position in the team upon his return in late 2004 , but often found himself watching from the sidelines in Test matches outside the Indian subcontinent with typically only one spinner , Kumble , being used . Throughout 2006 and into early 2007 , Harbhajan 's accumulation of wickets fell and his bowling average increased , and he was increasingly criticised for bowling defensively with less loop . Following India 's first @-@ round elimination from the 2007 Cricket World Cup , Harbhajan was replaced by other spinners in the national squad for both formats . He regained a regular position in the team in late 2007 , but became the subject of more controversy . In early 2008 , he was given a ban by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) for racially vilifying Andrew Symonds . The ban was revoked upon appeal , but in April , Harbhajan was banned from the 2008 Indian Premier League and suspended from the ODI team by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) for slapping Sreesanth after a match . He appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling 's Indian promotion , Ring Ka King . He was in the World Cup @-@ winning team of 2011 Cricket World Cup . 
 He was conferred the Padma Shri , India 's fourth highest civilian honour , in 2009 . 
 = = Early years and personal life = = 
 Harbhajan was born into a Sikh family . He is the only son of Sardar <unk> Singh <unk> , a businessman who owned a ball bearing and valve factory . Growing up with five sisters , Harbhajan was in line to inherit the family business , but his father insisted that he concentrate on his cricket career and represent India . 
 Harbhajan was trained as a batsman by his first coach <unk> <unk> <unk> , but converted to spin bowling after his coach 's untimely death saw him turn to the tutelage of <unk> Arora . Arora credits Harbhajan 's success to a work ethic that included a three @-@ hour training session in the morning , followed by an afternoon session lasting from 3 pm until after sunset . 
 Following the death of his father in 2000 , Harbhajan became the family head , and by 2001 had organised marriages for three of his sisters . In 2002 he ruled out his own marriage until at least 2008 . In 2005 he again fended off marriage rumours linking him to a Bangalore @-@ based bride , stating that he would only make a decision " after a couple of years " , and that he would be seeking a Punjabi bride selected by his family . In a country where cricketers are idolised , Harbhajan 's performances have brought him government accolades and lucrative sponsorships . Following his performance against Australia in 2001 , the Government of Punjab awarded him Rs . 5 lakhs , a plot of land , and an offer to become a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Punjab Police , which he accepted . 
 Despite having a job with the constabulary , Harbhajan sustained minor injuries in March 2002 in an altercation with police outside the team hotel in Guwahati . The scuffle broke out when Harbhajan remonstrated with officers after they refused to allow a photographer into the hotel . Harbhajan cut his bowling arm and injured his elbow when he was struck by the police . Extensive negotiations from local officials and organisers were required to dissuade Harbhajan and captain Sourav Ganguly from leaving the area after Ganguly said that the Indian team would abandon the scheduled match against Zimbabwe . 
 Singh was caught at Auckland airport for failing to declare that he had filthy boots in his luggage . His only excuse was that he " couldn 't be bothered " complying with New Zealand quarantine laws . He was fined $ 200 on the spot . 
 One of his common nicknames , outside India , is The <unk> , deriving from his skill as a bowler in terminating the innings of the opposing team , and the fact that , as a Sikh , he wears a black turban whenever he plays . Among Indians , Harbhajan is more commonly known as <unk> . It was estimated in 2005 that Harbhajan was the most recognised and commercially viable Indian cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar , in part due to his colourful personality and iconic turban , as well as his reputation for enjoying the celebrity social scene . His signing for English county team Surrey in 2005 , based at The Oval in London , was partly attributed to his marketability . Harbhajan had generated a large personal following in the western London suburb of Southall , which boasts a majority Punjabi Sikh population , when he lived there in 1998 while training under Fred Titmus . 
 In 2006 Harbhajan 's endorsements generated controversy when he appeared without his turban in an advertisement for Royal Stag whisky . This angered many orthodox Sikhs , leading to anti @-@ Harbhajan protests in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar , with effigies of Harbhajan being burnt . The Sikh clergy and Shiromani Gurdwara <unk> Committee demanded an apology from him and asked Seagram 's to withdraw the advert , on the basis that it had " hurt the feelings of Sikhs " . Harbhajan quickly issued an apology , but he was also unhappy at the clergy 's interference , stating " If they were unhappy , they should have called me and talked to me like a son " . 
 Harbhajan Singh married his longtime girlfriend , actress Geeta Basra , on 29 October 2015 in Jalandhar . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Harbhajan broke into the Punjab Under @-@ 16s at the age of 15 years and 4 months in November of the 1995 – 96 season , and took 7 / 46 and 5 / 138 on debut against Haryana , setting up a nine @-@ wicket win . He scored 56 in his next match against Delhi and then took 11 / 79 in his third match against Himachal Pradesh , orchestrating an innings win . He ended with 32 wickets at 15 @.@ 15 and 96 runs at 48 @.@ 00 in four matches . He was rewarded with selection for North Zone Under @-@ 16s , a team that represents all of northern India for a one @-@ day series , in which he took two wickets at 43 @.@ 50 in four matches and scored 18 runs . At the end of the season , he was called into the national Under @-@ 19 team at the age of 15 years and 9 months for a youth One Day International against South Africa . He took 1 / 19 from seven overs in an Indian win . 
 In 1996 – 97 , Harbhajan was promoted to the Punjab Under @-@ 19s and he took 15 wickets at 20 @.@ 20 in three matches , although he managed only two runs with the bat . This included match figures of 8 / 54 in an innings win over Jammu and Kashmir . 
 Harbhajan made his first @-@ class cricket debut in late 1997 against Services , during the 1997 – 98 Ranji Trophy season . He took a total of 3 / 35 in an innings win but was dropped back to the Under @-@ 19s the following week . He then took 5 / 75 and 7 / 44 in two matches to earn a recall to the senior team . He then took a total of 7 / 123 in the next two matches for Punjab to earn selection for North Zone in the Duleep Trophy . 
 Harbhajan 's season was interrupted when he represented India at the Under @-@ 19 World Cup in January 1998 . He played in six matches , taking eight wickets at 24 @.@ 75 with a best of 3 / 5 against Kenya . 
 Returning to India he played in three more Ranji Trophy matches , and from a total of six matches , he took 18 wickets at an average of 22 @.@ 50 , ranking outside the top 20 in wicket taking . He took a total of 5 / 131 as North lost to East Zone by five wickets . 
 Despite the superior statistics of other bowlers in domestic cricket , Harbhajan was the selected for the Indian Board President 's XI to play the touring Australian cricket team ahead of the Tests . He managed only 1 / 127 , and was ignored for the first two Tests before being selected to make his Test debut in the Third Test against Australia in Bangalore , where he scored 4 not out and a duck , and recorded the modest match figures of 2 / 136 as Australia won the match by eight wickets . He was subsequently overlooked for the triangular ODI tournament in India that followed the Tests , involving Zimbabwe in addition to Australia , but was selected for all group matches in the triangular tournament that followed soon after in Sharjah , where he made his ODI debut against New Zealand . He took 1 / 32 from ten overs on debut as India narrowly won by 15 runs . He then took 3 / 41 in the next match , a defeat against Australia , but then struggled in the second qualifying match against the same team , taking 1 / 63 in eight overs . He was subsequently dropped for the final against Australia , which India won , and ended the series with five wickets at 33 @.@ 20 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 36 . 
 Harbhajan was fined and given a suspended ban for one ODI by the match referee in his first international series , when his on @-@ field behaviour was adjudged to breach the ICC Code of Conduct . The incident in question was his altercation with Ricky Ponting after dismissing him . 
 Harbhajan was then omitted from the team during a home triangular ODI tournament against Bangladesh and Kenya , after taking 0 / 18 from four overs in his only match of the tournament against the former opponent , but was recalled for the Singer Trophy in Sri Lanka and also involving New Zealand . Playing in all five matches , Harbhajan claimed eight wickets at an average of 24 @.@ 12 and economy of 4 @.@ 38 in this tournament , taking at least one scalp in each match . Harbhajan was retained for the final and took 1 / 57 , his worst return for the series , in an Indian win . After being omitted for the Sahara Cup series against Pakistan in Toronto , Harbhajan played in a weakened Indian team at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia . The matches were not given ODI status by the ICC , and India chose to send their better players to the Sahara Cup instead . India won their first two matches against Antigua and Canada , but Harbhajan managed only a total of 1 / 48 from 11 overs . The Indians then needed to beat a full @-@ strength Australian outfit to win their group and progress to the semi @-@ finals . Harbhajan was punished and went wicketless , conceding 50 runs in eight overs as Australia won by 146 runs , knocking India out of contention . 
 Harbhajan was then recalled to the first @-@ choice team and took five wickets at an average of 22 @.@ 60 at 3 @.@ 89 runs an over from three matches on a tour to Zimbabwe , in what would prove to be his last ODI appearances for India for more than two years . In all , he took 18 ODI wickets at an average of 27 @.@ 2 during the 1998 . 
 After taking 2 / 38 and 3 / 60 in an innings win in a tour match , Harbhajan was retained in the Test team , taking 2 / 42 and 3 / 63 in the only Test on the Zimbabwe tour . He was unbeaten on 15 in the second innings as the final wicket fell and India succumbed to a 51 @-@ run defeat . 
 Returning to India , Harbhajan started the 1998 – 99 domestic season well , taking 3 / 54 and 5 / 39 in an innings win over Services , before following up with 6 / 69 and 1 / 93 in the next match against Delhi , claiming his first five @-@ wicket innings haul . He then took 6 / 63 and scored 31 in the first innings of a match for the Board <unk> 's XI against a touring West Indies A , and was taken on the tour of New Zealand in December . In a tour match against Central Districts , Harbhajan struggled , aggregating 2 / 112 . He only played in one Test during the tour , and went wicketless , conceding 72 runs . Upon returning to India , he took a total of 3 / 158 for India A in a match against the touring Pakistanis ahead of the Tests . After being omitted for the First Test lost in Chennai , he was recalled for the latter two matches against Pakistan , and took five wickets at 34 @.@ 60 as the matches were split . He then took 3 / 127 in a high @-@ scoring draw against Sri Lanka . In all , he claimed 13 wickets at an average of 36 @.@ 8 in five Tests for the season . When he was free of international fixtures for the season , he played in the Ranji Trophy matches , claiming 27 wickets at an average of 24 @.@ 59 in five matches , including his first five @-@ wicket haul at first @-@ class level . He also registered his maiden first @-@ class fifty , scoring an unbeaten 67 against Tamil Nadu cricket team . 
 Harbhajan took four wickets at 33 @.@ 00 during the one @-@ dayers during the season and was overlooked for the ODI team for the whole season and missed selection for the 1999 Cricket World Cup . In September 2003 , he played for India A in a one @-@ day series against their Australian counterparts in Los Angeles . Harbhajan took eight wickets at 17 @.@ 00 at 3 @.@ 77 runs an over in the five matches , with a best of 3 / 38 . 
 After taking 4 / 91 against the touring team for the Board President 's XI at the start of the season , Harbhajan managed to retain his Test position for the late 1999 home series against New Zealand , as India fielded a three @-@ pronged spin attack on dusty tracks , taking six wickets at an average of 32 @.@ 66 as the hosts prevailed 1 – 0 in the two Tests . 
 = = International exile = = 
 After taking eight wickets in his next two Ranji matches , Harbhajan was selected to tour Australia in 1999 – 2000 , as the second spinner . He did not play in the Tests , with India opting to field only Anil Kumble in the team . Australia whitewashed India 3 – 0 , and Harbhajan struggled in his only first @-@ class outing against Tasmania , taking 0 / 141 , a portent of future unsuccessful tours to Australia . 
 Harbhajan was not part of the ODI squad for the Australian tour and upon returning to India in early 2000 needed strong first @-@ class results to maintain his Test position . He went wicketless against Hyderabad , and was selected for the Board President 's XI match against the touring South Africans . He took 2 / 88 and 2 / 59 and scored 38 and 39 to prevent the hosts being bowled out and defeated , but was dropped as the second slow bowler , as Murali Kartik became Kumble 's spinning partner . Harbhajan returned to domestic action , taking 24 wickets in Punjab 's remaining four first @-@ class matches . He ended the Indian season with 46 first @-@ class wickets at 26 @.@ 23 . 
 In mid @-@ 2000 an opportunity arose when Harbhajan was selected in the first group of trainees sent to the National Cricket Academy to study under <unk> Prasanna and Srinivas <unk> , two off spin bowlers from the Indian spin quartet of the 1970s . However , his behaviour did not conform to requirements , and he was expelled on disciplinary grounds . His sponsorship job with Indian Airlines was also reviewed as a result of his indiscipline . Harbhajan later admitted that he had been at fault earlier in his career . 
 Following his run @-@ ins with Indian cricket administrators , there was nothing to indicate that Harbhajan 's chances of national selection had improved at the start of 2000 – 01 . Despite Kumble being injured , Harbhajan was again overlooked as Kartik , Sunil Joshi , and debutant <unk> Singh were entrusted with the spin bowling duties in Test matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe on the subcontinent . Having made little success in this phase of his international career , averaging 37 @.@ 75 per Test wicket to date , and overlooked by selectors , Harbhajan faced a difficult decision . His father had recently died ; as the family 's only son , Harbhajan was now obliged to support his mother and unmarried sisters . He contemplated quitting cricket and moving to the United States to drive trucks for a living . After being out of the team for more than 12 months , there was little overt indication of the sudden rise that would occur in his cricketing career only a few months later . 
 During the first half of the season , still in international exile , Harbhajan continued to pick up wickets on the domestic circuit . In five Ranji Trophy matches , he claimed 28 wickets at 13 @.@ 96 . He claimed 3 / 29 and 3 / 39 against Himachal Pradesh , 2 / 53 and 5 / 88 against Jammu and Kashmir , 4 / 77 and 2 / 33 against Haryana and 5 / 40 against Services in the first four matches , all of which ended in innings wins for Punjab . He then took a total of 4 / 32 in a 199 @-@ run win over Delhi . Harbhajan 's batting , which had rarely been productive up to this point in his career , also improved . He scored a career @-@ best 84 against Haryana and added 52 against Services , aggregating 207 runs at 51 @.@ 75 . After taking eight wickets at 21 @.@ 12 in six one @-@ dayers , Harbhajan was selected for North in the Duleep Trophy , but his early @-@ season form deserted him . He took five wickets at 39 @.@ 00 in two matches , although he did continue his productive run with the bat , scoring 130 runs at 32 @.@ 50 with three scores above 35 . 
 = = 2001 Border @-@ Gavaskar Trophy = = 
 With Kumble injured before the home series in March 2001 against the visiting Australians , Harbhajan , whose previous best Test figures were only 3 / 30 , was the only capped spinner in the Indian team for the First Test . He had been recalled after captain Sourav Ganguly publicly called for his inclusion in the team . He was to lead the spin attack against an Australian team which had set a world record with 15 consecutive Test victories , and was searching for its first ever series victory on Indian soil since 1969 . In a warm @-@ up match for India A , Harbhajan had taken 2 / 63 and 3 / 81 against the tourists . Harbhajan started well in the First Test in Mumbai , taking three quick wickets in a spell of 3 / 8 , to reduce Australia to 99 / 5 in response to India 's first innings of 176 . However , a counter @-@ attacking 197 @-@ run partnership between Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist in just 32 overs , saw Harbhajan concede 103 runs from his last 17 overs , to end with 4 / 121 . Despite being struck for many sixes into the crowd , it was still Harbhajan 's best statistical analysis at Test level , as Australia proceeded to a crushing 10 @-@ wicket victory , their sixteenth consecutive Test victory in succession . 
 With leading paceman Javagal Srinath ruled out of the series with a finger injury during the First Test , the teams met for the Second Test in Kolkata , with an even bigger burden on Harbhajan . Public opinion was sceptical about India 's chances of stopping Australia 's winning streak , with former captain Bishan Bedi lamenting the demise of Indian cricket . Australia were again in control on the first day , having scored 193 / 1 , with Hayden having struck Harbhajan out of the attack . Harbhajan fought back to reduce Australia to 252 / 7 , taking five wickets in the final session , including Ricky Ponting , Gilchrist and Shane Warne in successive balls to become the first Indian to claim a Test hat @-@ trick . After a prolonged wait for the third umpire to adjudicate whether Sadagoppan Ramesh had managed to catch Warne before the ball hit the ground , the near @-@ capacity crowd at Eden Gardens erupted when he was given out . Harbhajan eventually finished with 7 / 123 as Australia were bowled out for 445 . India batted poorly and were forced to follow @-@ on , but a 376 @-@ run partnership between V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid , who batted together for an entire day , allowed India to set Australia an imposing target of 384 to win on the final day . Australia appeared to be safely batting out the match for a draw , until losing 7 / 56 in the final session , collapsing from 166 / 3 to be bowled out for 212 . Harbhajan claimed four of the wickets , to finish with 6 / 73 for the innings and a match tally of 13 / 196 . India ended Australia 's 16 @-@ match world record winning streak , and became only the third team to win a Test after being forced to follow on ( Australia having lost all three of those matches ) . 
 The teams arrived in Chennai for the deciding Third Test , and Australia 's batsmen again seized control after winning the toss , reaching 340 / 3 on the second morning . Then , Australian captain Steve Waugh padded away a delivery from Harbhajan . The ball spun back into Waugh 's stumps , who pushed the ball away with his glove , becoming only the sixth batsman in Tests to be given out " handled the ball " . Waugh 's dismissal instigated another Australian batting collapse , losing 6 wickets for 51 runs to be bowled out for 391 , with Harbhajan taking all six in a spell of 6 / 26 , to finish with 7 / 133 . After India 's batsmen gained a first @-@ innings lead of 110 , the Australian batsmen were again unable to cope with Harbhajan in the second innings , who took 8 / 84 to end with match figures of 15 / 217 . India appeared to be heading for an easy victory at 101 / 2 chasing 155 , before losing 6 / 50 to be 151 / 8 . Harbhajan walked to the crease , and struck the winning runs . 
 He was named man of the match and man of the series , having taken 32 wickets at 17 @.@ 03 for the series , when none of his team @-@ mates managed more than three . The Wisden 100 study conducted by Wisden in 2002 rated all four of Harbhajan 's efforts in the Second and Third Tests in the top 100 bowling performances of all time , the most for any bowler . He paid tribute to his father , who had died just six months earlier . His performance led to him usurping Anil Kumble 's position as India 's first @-@ choice spinner . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Harbhajan is considered to be one of the legends in Indian cricket . Harbhajan 's Test success saw him recalled to the ODI team after more than two years . He was unable to reproduce his Test form against Australia , managing only four wickets at an average of 59 @.@ 25 and economy rate of 5 @.@ 04 . His best performance was a 3 / 37 in a 118 @-@ run win in the third match , and a cameo batting performance of 46 runs from 34 balls , including three sixes , in a losing run chase in the fourth fixture . He was dropped from the ODI team during a subsequent triangular tournament in Zimbabwe in 2001 after only managing two wickets at 69 @.@ 00 in four matches although he had been economical at 3 @.@ 63 runs an over . Harbhajan was also unable to maintain his form in the Test series against Zimbabwe . Harbhajan began the tour well with 13 wickets in two warm @-@ up matches , including a match haul of 10 / 80 against the <unk> Academy , but could not repeat such performances in the Tests . He took eight wickets at 29 @.@ 12 in the two @-@ Test series , which was drawn 1 – 1 , but did manage to post his first Test half @-@ century , reaching 66 in the First Test in Bulawayo , before scoring 31 in the first innings of the Second Test as the Indian batsmen struggled and ceded their series lead . The Indians subsequently toured Sri Lanka in mid @-@ 2001 , enjoying spinning wickets similar to those in India . Harbhajan managed to establish himself in the ODI team with eleven wickets at 21 @.@ 18 at the low economy rate of 3 @.@ 42 in seven matches in the ODI tournament with the hosts and New Zealand . Ironically however , his best performances , in which he conceded less than 30 runs in his ten overs three times , all ended in Indian defeats . In contrast to his ODI improvement , Harbhajan 's Test form deteriorated further , yielding only four wickets at 73 @.@ 00 in three Tests , while Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was named man of the series with 23 wickets , in what was billed as a contest between the world 's two leading off @-@ spinners . With the Tests locked at 1 – 1 Harbhajan managed only 2 / 185 in the Third Test as the hosts accumulated 6 / 610 declared and won by an innings . He scored 79 runs at 15 @.@ 80 for the series . 
 Harbhajan was omitted from the Indian team in favour of Kumble as the first @-@ choice spinner on the following tour of South Africa , only playing in the later matches when India fielded two spinners . Nevertheless , Harbhajan continued to do well in the ODIs , taking nine wickets at 20 @.@ 44 in six matches at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 53 , winning his first man of the match award in the ODI form in an ODI against South Africa in Bloemfontein after taking 3 / 27 from his ten overs . He scored 62 runs at 15 @.@ 50 , including a rearguard 37 that was not enough to prevent an embarrassing 70 @-@ run loss to Kenya . After being omitted for the First Test , which India lost , his disciplinary problems continued when he was one of four Indian players fined and given a suspended one match suspension for dissent and attempting to intimidate the umpire by over @-@ appealing in the Second Test . India managed to draw the match , but Harbhajan struggled and took 1 / 89 and 2 / 79 . The off spinner continued his poor overseas Test form in what would have been the Third Test . However , India defied the ICC by playing banned batsman Virender Sehwag , while Mike Denness , the match referee who handed down the penalties , was locked out of the stadium , so the match was stripped of Test status . Harbhajan continued to be ineffective , taking only 1 / 104 , although he showed resistance with the bat , scoring 29 and 30 when many specialist batsmen failed , as India slumped to an innings defeat . 
 Harbhajan 's Test fortunes improved immediately upon the start of the 2001 – 02 international season in India . Playing in his first international match at his home ground in Mohali , Punjab , Harbhajan took match figures of 7 / 110 , including 5 / 51 in the first innings , to help India win the First Test by ten wickets against the touring English team . He continued his steady form throughout the series with another five wicket haul in the Second Test in Ahmedabad , to end with thirteen wickets at 24 @.@ 53 for the series , although he went wicketless in 27 @.@ 1 overs in the Third and final Test . Harbhajan 's good home form persisted in the Test matches against Zimbabwe , taking twelve wickets at 19 @.@ 66 in two games . In the First Test , he took 4 / 46 in the second innings to seal an innings victory after going wicketless in the second innings . His 2 / 70 and 6 / 62 in the Second Test in Delhi saw him named man of the match in a Test for the second time in his career . As in the first instance , he hit the winning runs , a straight @-@ driven six , after India had lost six wickets and threatened to collapse in pursuit of a modest 122 for victory . He also performed strongly in the ODIs during the Indian season , taking twenty wickets at 19 @.@ 75 in ten matches and taking his first five wicket haul in ODIs . In the five matches against England , he took ten wickets at 20 @.@ 10 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 27 . His best result was a 5 / 43 in the last of these matches , but a late collapse handed the tourists a five @-@ run win . He did better against the Zimbabweans , taking 10 wickets in five matches at an average of 19 @.@ 40 and an economy rate of 4 @.@ 06 . This included a 4 / 33 in the final match . He also scored 39 runs without defeat for the series , including a 24 not out as India were skittled for 191 in one match . As Harbhajan was ensconced in the Indian team for the first team , he only played in two <unk> Trophy matches for Punjab , taking 13 wickets at 20 @.@ 01 and scoring 71 runs at 17 @.@ 75 . 
 Harbhajan 's overseas difficulties returned during the tour of the West Indies in mid @-@ 2002 . He injured his shoulder while fielding in a tour match in which he started well with a total of 5 / 70 , and was forced to miss the First Test in Guyana . After taking only six wickets at 38 upon his return to the team for the Second and Third Tests , he was dropped for the Fourth Test , but was recalled again for the Fifth Test at Sabina Park , after Kumble was injured . Despite taking improved match figures of 8 / 180 , including 5 / 138 in the first innings , Harbhajan was unable to prevent an Indian defeat after the batting collapsed in the first innings . He claimed three wickets in the three match ODI series at 33 @.@ 00 , conceding 4 @.@ 71 runs per over . 
 Despite his performance at Sabina Park , Harbhajan was dropped again when Kumble returned for the First Test on the tour to England at Lord 's , where the hosts prevailed . India 's coach John Wright later admitted that Harbhajan 's omission had been a mistake . Harbhajan returned for the final three Tests with moderate success , taking 12 wickets at 34 @.@ 16 , improving as the English summer wore on . After claiming 3 / 175 in the drawn Second Test , he struck form in the tour match against Essex , taking 7 / 83 and 1 / 23 . He then took 3 / 40 and 1 / 56 as India levelled the series in the Third Test at Headingley , before taking 5 / 115 in the first innings of the Fourth Test at The Oval , as well as managing his second Test half @-@ century of 54 at Trent Bridge in the Second Test . He ended the series with 90 runs at 22 @.@ 50 @.@ for the entire tour , Harbhajan aggregated 28 wickets at 27 @.@ 60 . Harbhajan had modest results in the Natwest Trophy . After being dropped after one wicketless match , he was dropped and then took 4 / 46 against Sri Lanka in the last match before the final to ensure his retention , but went wicketless in the decider , which India won . He played in three ODIs and took four wickets at 37 @.@ 25 at 4 @.@ 96 . 
 The 2002 ICC Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka at the end of the tour brought moderate results with six wickets at 30 @.@ 66 at an economy rate of only 3 @.@ 68 , and a best of 3 / 27 from ten overs in the <unk> out final against the host nation . Harbhajan helped restrict Sri Lanka to 5 / 244 , but rain ended proceedings with India at 0 / 14 . He then took 1 / 34 the next day during a replay of the final . This time the hosts made 7 / 222 and a downpour again thwarted the players , with India at 1 / 38 when play was called off and the trophy shared . 
 As was the case in the previous season , Harbhajan 's return to Indian soil coincided with an improvement in results . He took 1 / 37 and 7 / 48 in an innings victory at Mumbai in the First Test against the West Indies , and then contributed match figures of 3 / 56 , 4 / 79 and 37 in an eight @-@ wicket victory in Chennai which saw him named man of the match . A haul of 5 / 115 in the Third Test at Calcutta was the best in a high scoring match , and with 20 wickets at 16 @.@ 75 and 69 runs at 17 @.@ 25 , Harbhajan was named as the man of the series . He was unable to transfer his performances to the ODI format , taking only five wickets at 49 @.@ 00 against the same team at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 44 . Harbhajan took only five wickets at 18 @.@ 80 in the subsequent Test tour to New Zealand , in a series where five pace bowlers averaged less than 20 on green , seaming tracks . India lost the series 2 – 0 and Harbhajan 's 20 and 18 in the Second Test amounted for more than 15 % of India 's match total . The off spinner then took 1 / 56 in one ODI before heading for his World Cup debut in South Africa . 
 Harbhajan had a mixed tournament at the 2003 Cricket World Cup , taking 11 wickets at 30 @.@ 45 with an economy rate of 3 @.@ 92 in ten matches . He was the first @-@ choice spinner and played in all matches but one , being dropped for the victory against arch @-@ rivals Pakistan in the group phase . His counterpart , Kumble , played in only three matches . Harbhajan was steady throughout the tournament , never taking more than two wickets in a match , and never conceding more than 42 runs from his quota of ten overs , except in the two matches against Australia , who went through the tournament without defeat . In the group match , Harbhajan was the second highest score , with a counter @-@ attacking 28 as India collapsed for 125 , but when it was his turn to bowl , the Australians attacked him and scored 49 runs from his 44 balls without losing a wicket in a decisive nine @-@ wicket win . In the final , Ganguly elected to field and Harbhajan was the only Indian bowler to take a wicket , taking 2 / 49 from eight overs . In contrast , the Australians scored at 7 @.@ 38 runs per over from the other bowlers to reach 2 / 359 , the highest total in a World Cup final , and win by 125 runs . He was the fourth leading wicket taker for India overall and his tournament bowling average was worse than those of Zaheer Khan , Ashish Nehra and Javagal Srinath . He finished the season with six wickets at 14 @.@ 00 at 3 @.@ 65 runs per over in three matches in an ODI tournament in Bangladesh , where he was fined for abusing an umpire . 
 = = Finger injury = = 
 After experiencing pains in his spinning finger during the World Cup , Harbhajan was scheduled to undergo surgery in mid @-@ 2003 in Australia , but the surgery was delayed as he sought to play through the pain . He underwent physiotherapy in lieu of surgery and was declared fit for a two @-@ match Test series at home against New Zealand in late 2003 . His performance was substantially worse than his previous displays on Indian soil , taking only six wickets at an average of 50 @.@ 00 as both matches ended in high @-@ scoring draws . Aside from his debut series , it was his worst series bowling average on Indian soil . Despite a triangular ODI series against New Zealand and Australia in which he managed only four wickets at 40 @.@ 50 in four matches and spent time in the sidelines , the Indian team attempted to manage his injury rather than have his finger operated on , and took him on the 2003 – 04 tour of Australia . As with his previous visit four years earlier , Harbhajan had an unhappy time , taking 2 / 159 in a tour match against Victoria . After an ineffective 1 / 169 in the First Test at Brisbane , his injury deteriorated and he underwent major finger surgery , sidelining him for a predicted five months . Kumble replaced him and took 24 wickets in the remaining three Tests in <unk> contrast of Harbhajan 's struggles in Australia . Kumble bowled India to victory in the following Test against Pakistan in Multan , taking 6 / 71 to reclaim his position as the No. 1 spinner . 
 After a seven @-@ month layoff , Harbhajan returned to represent India in ODIs in the Asia Cup in July 2004 , where he took four wickets at 39 @.@ 75 in four matches at 3 @.@ 97 runs per over . His performance improved on the tour to England for an ODI series against England and the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy , taking eight wickets at 14 @.@ 00 , conceding only 2 @.@ 80 runs an over , including 3 / 28 against England and 3 / 33 against Kenya and hitting as an unbeaten 41 against England at The Oval as India 's batting collapsed to a substantial defeat . 
 Harbhajan made his Test return against Australia , who were again seeking their first series win on Indian soil since 1969 in the late 2004 home series . Harbhajan took 5 / 146 in the first innings and 6 / 78 in the second innings in addition to making a run out to reduce Australia from 103 / 3 to 228 all out . Despite this , India required 457 in their second innings to win , slumping to 125 / 8 before Harbhajan ( 42 ) and Irfan Pathan helped India to reach 239 after a rearguard counter @-@ attack , still a 217 @-@ run loss . Harbhajan was less effective in the drawn Second Test in Chennai , with match figures of 5 / 198 , which was washed out with India still needing 210 more runs on the last day with all ten wickets in hand . Harbhajan then withdrew from the Third Test in Nagpur due to illness . Australia won the match easily , clinching the series . Harbhajan returned for the final Test in Mumbai . After failing to take a wicket in the first innings , he claimed 5 / 29 in the second to help India bowl Australia out for 93 and claim a dramatic 14 @-@ run victory . Harbhajan ended the series with 21 wickets at 24 @.@ 00 and 69 runs at 13 @.@ 80 . 
 A Test series in India against South Africa followed , with Harbhajan taking match figures of 4 / 166 in the drawn First Test in Kanpur , before producing a man of the match performance in the Second Test in Calcutta to lead India to a 1 – 0 series win . After taking 2 / 54 in the first innings , he took 6 / 78 in the second , including South Africa 's first five batsman to help dismiss the tourists for 222 . This set up a run @-@ chase of 117 , which India reached with eight wickets in hand . Harbhajan was the leading wicket @-@ taker for the series , with 13 victims at an average of 23 @.@ 61 . He ended 2004 with a quiet tour of Bangladesh , scoring a 47 in the Second Test and taking four wickets at 41 @.@ 75 in two Tests and one wicket at 94 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 22 in two ODIs . He had a relatively light workload , bowling only 47 @.@ 4 overs in the Tests , as Irfan Pathan frequently scythed through the Bangladeshi batsmen with the new ball , taking three five wicket hauls . He then returned to India and took a total of 6 / 172 in North Zone 's seven @-@ wicket win over South . 
 His performance in Bangladesh saw him dropped for the First Test in the early 2005 series against Pakistan on his home ground in Mohali , with Kumble being the only spinner selected on the pace @-@ friendly surface . India were in control of the match for four days , and needed only four wickets on day five , but were unable to break the Pakistani lower @-@ order until play was almost over and the tourists had taken a lead , and the match ended in a draw . Harbhajan was recalled for the Second Test in Calcutta and took match figures of 4 / 145 in an Indian victory . Despite taking 6 / 152 in a marathon 51 @-@ over spell in the first innings of the Third Test in Bangalore , Pakistan won the match to level the series after India collapsed on the final day . Harbhajan finished the series with 10 wickets at 33 @.@ 20 . His performance in the subsequent ODI series was even worse , managing only three wickets at 73 @.@ 66 in five matches at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 80 . In spite of the poor end to the season , his performance in the year since finger surgery in the long form of the game saw him nominated for the 2005 ICC Test Player of the Year . Harbhajan spent the international off @-@ season playing for Surrey in English county cricket , citing the improvement that other international players had gained from such an experience . It was his first stint in county cricket , after a planned season at Lancashire in 2003 was cancelled due to injury . After taking six wickets in his opening two first @-@ class fixtures , he struck form against Hampshire , taking 6 / 36 and 2 / 47 in an innings triumph . In is fourth and final first @-@ class match , against Gloucestershire , Harbhajan took a total of 6 / 193 and equalled his previous first @-@ class best of 84 . He ended with 20 wickets at 25 @.@ 85 and 124 runs at 31 @.@ 00 . In the Twenty20 competition , he had less success in the new format , taking four wickets at 38 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 6 @.@ 60 in eight matches . In all he spent six weeks with the county . 
 = = Chappell era = = 
 Harbhajan 's first outings under newly appointed coach Greg Chappell came at the Indian Oil Cup in Sri Lanka in August 2005 . He took five wickets at 31 @.@ 40 , conceding 4 @.@ 02 runs per over in four matches , but was wicketless in the final , which was won by the host nation . This was followed by a tour of Zimbabwe , which was marred by tension between the new coach and Indian captain Ganguly . This broke into the public arena when Ganguly claimed that he was asked to resign as captain . Harbhajan played in all five matches in the Videocon Tri @-@ Series involving Zimbabwe and New Zealand with little success , managing only two wickets at 99 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 77 , both of them against an inexperienced Zimbabwe team crippled by a mass exodus of white players from the Mugabe regime . Harbhajan had a quiet Test series against Zimbabwe , taking six wickets at 31 @.@ 00 . He was only required to bowl 58 overs , as the majority of the Zimbabwean batsmen were removed after being unable to cope with Pathan 's swing which was likened to " <unk> at high speed " , leaving little work for the spinners . He managed to claim his 200th Test wicket in the First Test , and in doing so became the second youngest player to reach the mark after Kapil Dev . Harbhajan 's batting was notable for an exceptionally aggressive 18 @-@ ball innings in the First Test in Bulawayo , where he struck four fours and three sixes in a cameo innings of 37 . 
 Harbhajan 's difficulties were compounded when he earned the ire of cricket authorities by publicly attacking Chappell and defending Ganguly after the team returned to India . He claimed that Chappell had used " double standards " and instilled " fear and insecurity " into the team . The Punjab Cricket Association called him to explain his actions , but he was not punished after offering an apology . In early 2006 , Harbhajan changed his stance publicly , praising Chappell for the team 's improved form , stating " He has great knowledge about the game and it has been a very successful year for us under him . He has lifted our team to great heights " . 
 Harbhajan was under pressure to perform when Sri Lanka toured India in late 2005 following his attack on Chappell and the replacement of Ganguly , who had frequently supported him during previous career difficulties , with new captain Rahul Dravid . In addition , his home ODI form had been poor in the previous three years , managing only 12 wickets at 56 in 16 matches , with an economy rate of 4 @.@ 8 . In the three Challenger Trophy matches at the start of the season , he took five wickets at 24 @.@ 20 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 25 . He responded by claiming 3 / 35 in the first ODI in Nagpur after Sri Lanka had raced to 50 in just 6 @.@ 3 overs . The Sri Lankan batsmen hit the Indian fast bowlers out of the attack , scoring 74 runs in the first 10 overs and forcing Dravid to delay the Power Play and introduce Harbhajan . This sparked a collapse , with 4 wickets taken for 14 runs , resulting in a 152 @-@ run Indian victory . Harbhajan took 2 / 19 in the next match , and aggregated six wickets at 26 in the first four matches , at a low economy rate of 3 @.@ 43 , with a series of performances noted for skilful variations in pace and flight , helping India gain an unassailable 4 – 0 series lead . He was subsequently rested for the fifth ODI , and ended the series as the most economical bowler , conceding only 3 @.@ 62 runs per over . 
 He put on another strong personal performance in the first ODI of the following series against South Africa in Hyderabad , where he struck an aggressive unbeaten 37 from 17 balls , including two sixes , to help India recover to 249 / 9 , before taking 1 / 35 from his 10 overs . He was unable to prevent an Indian loss , and was fined after pointing <unk> Prince to the pavilion after dismissing him . Harbhajan ended the series with five wickets at 27 @.@ 40 , and was again India 's most economical bowler , conceding 3 @.@ 92 runs per over . 
 The year ended with a three Test series against Sri Lanka . After the first match in Chennai was washed out by monsoonal rains , Harbhajan took match figures of 4 / 137 as India took a 1 – 0 series lead in Delhi . He finished the calendar year with a man of the match performance in Ahmedabad , which saw India seal a 2 – 0 series victory with a 259 run victory . He took 7 / 62 in the first innings , including six of Sri Lanka 's top eight batsmen . He precipitated a middle @-@ order batting collapse , with 6 wickets falling for 82 runs , which allowed India to take a 193 @-@ run first innings lead . Harbhajan later contributed an aggressive innings of 40 not out from 51 balls , in an unbroken 49 @-@ run final @-@ wicket partnership with Kumble in the second innings , their display of unorthodox hitting stretching India 's lead to 508 runs . His prospects of a half century were cut short by a declaration from acting captain Virender Sehwag , but he was compensated with opening the bowling , as Sehwag employed a novel tactic of assigning the new ball to a spinner . He took 3 / 79 to finish with match figures of 10 / 141 , ending the year on a high note after he had been embroiled in the leadership struggle only three months earlier . 
 = = Test decline = = 
 2006 began with Harbhajan 's first tour to arch @-@ rivals Pakistan . The First Test was a high scoring draw held in Lahore , where Harbhajan recorded his worst ever Test figures of 0 / 176 , conceding more than five runs an over in a match where 1 @,@ 089 runs were scored for the loss of just eight wickets . In a match in which many batting records fell , Harbhajan was hit for 27 runs in one over by Shahid Afridi , just one short of the world record . The second Test in Faisalabad was another high scoring draw , with the aggregate runs being the fourth highest in Test history . Harbhajan took 0 / 101 and 0 / 78 . His 81 overs in the series were the fourth highest amount of overs in any Test series without taking a wicket . When he was given the opportunity to make use of the batting surface in India 's only innings in Faisalabad , he managed a brisk 38 , including two sixes . Harbhajan was dropped for the Third Test in Karachi , where a green pitch promised to favour seam bowling , and Kumble was the only spinner used . After sustaining an injury , Harbhajan was sent home during the subsequent ODI series without playing a match , ending his tour without taking a wicket . 
 A return to Indian soil for the Test series against England failed to ease Harbhajan 's wicket @-@ taking difficulties . He managed match figures of 2 / 172 in the drawn First Test in Nagpur , and 1 / 83 in the Second Test in Mohali , where his main contribution was to hit 36 runs , helping India to a first innings lead . Despite taking 3 / 89 and 2 / 40 in the Third Test in Mumbai , Harbhajan ended the series with eight wickets at an average of 48 @.@ 00 , nearly twice his career average on Indian soil . Despite his difficulties in Test cricket , Harbhajan 's ODI form remained strong , as he top @-@ scored with a rearguard 37 out of 203 and then took 5 / 31 in a man of the match performance in the first ODI against England in Delhi , sparking a collapse of 7 / 47 which secured a 39 @-@ run victory . He ended the series with 12 wickets at 15 @.@ 58 at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 74 from five matches , and topped the wicket @-@ taking list despite being rested for the last match , as well as having the best bowling average and economy rate . India took the series 5 – 1 , Harbhajan taking 3 / 30 in their only loss . 
 Harbhajan was unable to maintain his ODI form on the tour to the West Indies , where he managed three wickets at 64 in five matches , although he continued to be economical , conceding 3 @.@ 91 runs per over . He was omitted from the Test team for the opening two Tests as India opted to use three pace bowlers and Anil Kumble , scrapping the five bowler strategy used since early 2006 . The reasons for the return to the four @-@ man attack were unclear , with performance , fatigue and injury variously offered as explanations . Harbhajan was recalled for the Third Test in St Kitts after the pace attack was unable to dismiss the West Indian batsmen , with local captain Brian Lara stating that his team , who had three wickets in hand at the end of play , would have been lucky to draw the Second Test had Harbhajan been playing . In a drawn match , Harbhajan claimed the leading match figures of 6 / 186 , as well as contributing an unbeaten 38 in the first innings . Harbhajan 's 5 / 13 in 27 balls in the first innings in the Fourth Test saw the hosts lose their last six wickets for 23 , to give India a 97 run first innings lead . India went on secure a victory in a low scoring match in three days and win the series 1 – 0 , although Harbhajan was punished in the second innings , conceding 65 runs in 16 overs without taking a wicket . It was India 's first series victory in the Caribbean in 35 years , with Harbhajan contributing 11 wickets at 24 @.@ 00 . 
 The 2006 – 07 season began with the DLF Cup in Malaysia , where Harbhajan made a good start to the season , taking six wickets at 19 @.@ 16 at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 59 in four matches . He was man of the match against the West Indies , scoring 37 in a 78 @-@ run partnership to push India to 162 , before taking 3 / 35 to secure a 16 @-@ run victory . India failed to reach the final , contested by Australia and the West Indies . Harbhajan was unable to maintain his form in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy held in India , managing only two wickets at 51 @.@ 50 and saving his worst performance of 0 / 49 in the final group match against Australia on his home ground in Punjab . India won only one of their three matches and were eliminated , although Harbhajan continued to be tidy , conceding 3 @.@ 67 runs per over . The tour of South Africa in late 2006 saw even less success , taking only one wicket in three ODI matches while conceding 161 runs at the expensive economy rate of 5 @.@ 75 . He finished the year watching from the sidelines as India fielded Kumble as the only spinner in the three Test series , which India lost 2 – 1 . Apart from the injury hit 2003 , it was Harbhajan 's least productive year in Test cricket since he became a regular team member in 2001 , managing only 19 wickets at 52 @.@ 78 . 
 Harbhajan returned for the early 2007 ODI series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka in India , taking seven wickets at 36 @.@ 00 in seven matches at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 27 . Despite criticism that he was afraid to toss the ball up , and was concentrating on bowling flat in a defensive run @-@ saving style , Harbhajan was selected as the off spin bowler in the Indian squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , while Ramesh Powar , who had been more expensive but had taken more wickets in recent times , was omitted . A statistical study showed that since the start of 2006 , Harbhajan has been the second most economical bowler in the final 10 overs of ODIs . 
 During the 2007 Cricket World Cup , Harbhajan started as India 's first @-@ choice spinner and played in their first match against Bangladesh . He took 0 / 30 from his ten overs , but India lost the match as their batsmen collapsed and Bangladesh had no need to take risks against the bowling . Harbhajan was dropped in favour of Kumble for the second match against Bermuda , which India won easily . Harbhajan was recalled for the final group match against Sri Lanka , and had little effect , taking 0 / 53 from his ten overs as India were set 255 for victory . Harbhajan made an unbeaten 17 as India collapsed to 185 to lose the match and be eliminated in the group phase . Following the failed campaign , the Indian selectors made multiple changes to the national team and Harbhajan was dropped for the tours of Bangladesh and England . Rajesh Pawar , Piyush Chawla and Powar were the spinners selected to partner Kumble . Harbhajan 's waning wicket @-@ taking and his lack of flight were again perceived to be the cause of his problems . 
 In the meantime , Harbhajan played in two ODIs for the Asian Cricket Council against a combined African team , taking 1 / 53 and 3 / 48 as the Asians won both matches . He then returned to Surrey for a second season of county cricket in an attempt to rediscover his form while his compatriots were touring England , staying throughout July and August . After easing into the season with six wickets in the first two first @-@ class matches , Harbhajan found a rich vein of form , taking 4 / 64 and 5 / 64 against Worcestershire , before following up with 5 / 34 and 6 / 57 against Kent , finishing off by scoring 29 to help guide Surrey home by four wickets after they had stumbled in pursuit of 107 . He ended the first @-@ class campaign with five and six wickets against Durham and Hampshire respectively and totalled 37 wickets at 18 @.@ 54 in only six outings . He was not so successful in the one @-@ dayers , taking six wickets at 29 @.@ 50 and an economy rate of 4 @.@ 65 in five matches . 
 = = Recall = = 
 Harbhajan returned to international cricket as part of India 's squad for the ICC World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa in September 2007 , which India won , having been rank outsiders at the start of the tournament with many senior players opting out of the competition . He played in all six of India 's matches and totalled seven wickets at 26 @.@ 00 and an economy rate of 7 @.@ 91 . In the opening pool match against Pakistan , Harbhajan hit the stumps in a bowl @-@ out after scores were tied ; India won 3 – 0 after three rounds . In the semi @-@ final against Australia , Harbhajan bowled Michael Clarke and conceded only three runs in his final over , the 18th of the match , to turn the match towards India . The final against Pakistan was the only match in which Harbhajan did not bowl his full quota of four overs , after being struck for three sixes in his third over by Misbah @-@ ul @-@ Haq , who led a late charge towards the target . India prevailed by five runs in the final over , Misbah being the last man to fall . 
 Harbhajan was recalled to the ODI squad during India 's home season in 2006 – 07 , which comprised series against Australia and Pakistan . In ten ODIs , he took seven wickets at 61 @.@ 71 125 and an economy rate of 4 @.@ 59 , much higher than his career average . He scored 101 runs at 33 @.@ 66 in these matches , including an unbeaten 38 in one match against Pakistan . He was then recalled to the Test squad , and with India fielding two spinners in its home series against Pakistan , Harbhajan accompanied Kumble in all three Tests . Playing in Tests for the first time in 16 months , he took 10 wickets at 44 @.@ 10 , much higher than his career average in India . His best result was 5 / 122 in the first innings of the Second Test at Eden Gardens . He toured Australia and played in three of the four Tests — India persisted with two spinners in all venues except for the Third Test at the pace @-@ friendly WACA Ground . As he was during his previous visits to Australia , Harbhajan was ineffective with the ball . In the First Test in Melbourne , he took match figures of 3 / 162 , before taking 4 / 200 in the Second Test in Sydney . Upon his recall in Adelaide , he took 1 / 128 in Australia 's only innings on a placid surface , ending the series with eight wickets at 61 @.@ 25 . However , he did manage to take Ponting 's wicket for three consecutive innings in the first two Tests , leading to much speculation about the Australian captain 's difficulties against the off spinner . After the third dismissal in the Sydney Test , Harbhajan celebrated by running a distance before twice rolling over on the ground . Harbhajan 's most noted contribution with the bat came in the Second Test when he came to the crease with India at 345 / 7 , still 118 runs behind Australia , after a middle @-@ order collapse of 4 / 52 . He made 63 runs in a 129 @-@ run partnership with Tendulkar , which enabled India to gain a first @-@ innings lead . In the Fourth Test , he came to the crease at 7 / 359 and scored 63 in a 107 @-@ run rearguard partnership with captain Kumble , allowing India to reach 529 . He failed to reach double figures in his four other innings and ended with 142 runs at 23 @.@ 66 . 
 = = <unk> with Andrew Symonds and Sreesanth = = 
 While Harbhajan was batting during his 63 on the third day of the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground , he became involved in an altercation with Australia 's Andrew Symonds . As a result of this , he was charged with a Level 3 offence of racially abusing Symonds by calling the Australian — of Caribbean descent — a " monkey " . Harbhajan and Tendulkar , his batting partner at the time of the incident , denied this . At a hearing after the conclusion of the Test , match referee Mike Procter found Harbhajan guilty and banned him for three Tests . This decision generated controversy because no audio or video evidence was available , and the conviction relied on the testimony of the Australian players . The Indian team initially threatened to withdraw from the series pending an appeal against Harbhajan 's suspension , however BCCI president Sharad Pawar later claimed that the tour would proceed even if the second hearing was unsuccessful . 
 On 29 January , following the Fourth Test , the appeal hearing was conducted in Adelaide by ICC Appeals Commissioner Justice John Hansen . The result was that the racism charge was not proved , resulting in the revocation of the three @-@ Test ban imposed by Procter . However , Harbhajan was found guilty of using abusive language and fined 50 % of his match fee . Hansen later admitted he " could have imposed a more serious penalty if he was made aware by the ICC of the bowler 's previous transgressions " — including a suspended one @-@ Test ban . It was reported that senior players from both sides had written a letter to Hansen requesting that the charge be downgraded . According to this report , the letter was signed by Tendulkar and Ponting and counter @-@ signed by Michael Clarke , Hayden and Symonds . 
 In the aftermath of the hearing , Hayden called Harbhajan an " obnoxious weed " during a radio interview , which earned him a code of conduct violation charge from Cricket Australia . 
 Following the appeal , Harbhajan played in all eight of India 's round @-@ robin matches in the Commonwealth Bank series , which also involved Sri Lanka , taking five wickets at 39 @.@ 00 . In the two finals matches , Australia suffered a top @-@ order collapse and lost their first three wickets with only 24 and 32 runs on the board respectively . Symonds and Hayden — with whom Harbhajan clashed during the summer — led a recovery with stands of 100 and 89 respectively . In both matches , Harbhajan had a hand in removing both of his bitter opponents . In the first final in Sydney , he removed both in the space of four overs , caught from his bowling . In the second final in Brisbane , he completed the run out of Hayden after a mix @-@ up , and then trapped Symonds leg before wicket in the same over . Australia lost the momentum and their run @-@ rate slowed , and India went on to win the series 2 – 0 . Harbhajan ended with 2 / 38 and 1 / 44 from his 10 overs in the respective matches . 
 Following the tour of Australia , India hosted South Africa in a three @-@ Test series . The First Test in Chennai was a high @-@ scoring draw in which 1 @,@ 498 runs were scored for the loss of 25 wickets . Harbhajan was the top wicket @-@ taker for the match , with figures of 5 / 161 and 3 / 101 . In the Second Test in Ahmedabad , he was India 's leading wicket @-@ taker for the third consecutive innings , taking 4 / 135 as the home team lost by an innings . With India needing a win in the Third Test in Kanpur to avoid series defeat , Harbhajan again took the leading bowling figures in both innings , with 3 / 52 and 4 / 44 . His second innings effort helped bowl out the tourists for 121 and set up an eight @-@ wicket win . As a result of his efforts , Harbhajan was named man @-@ of @-@ the @-@ series , having taken 19 wickets at 25 @.@ 94 . In contrast to his efforts in Australia , he struggled with the bat , scoring 11 runs at 2 @.@ 75 . He was troubled by South African paceman Dale Steyn , who dismissed him all four times by breaking through his defences , bowling him once and trapping him lbw the other three times . 
 Harbhajan was involved in further controversy after an 2008 Indian Premier League ( IPL ) match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab at Mohali in April 2008 . While the teams were shaking hands , he slapped Punjab paceman and Indian team @-@ mate Sreesanth in the face . Harbhajan , who had stood in as the Mumbai captain for the first three matches of the tournament to that point , all of which were lost , had apparently been angered by Sreesanth 's aggressive sending @-@ off of his batsmen as Punjab coasted to a decisive victory . The Kings XI Punjab lodged an official complaint to the IPL . The match referee <unk> Engineer found Harbhajan guilty of a level 4 @.@ 2 offence , banning him from the remainder of the IPL and preventing him from claiming his entire season 's salary . Harbhajan made up with Sreesanth , and said that " I have been punished for the wrong I did " . Harbhajan had taken five wickets at 16 @.@ 40 at an economy rate of 8 @.@ 20 and scored 30 runs at 15 @.@ 00 in the three matches before his ban . On 14 May , the BCCI disciplinary committee found Harbhajan guilty under Rule 3 @.@ 2 @.@ 1 of their regulations and handed down the maximum punishment of five @-@ match ban from ODIs . Harbhajan faces the prospect of a life ban if he commits significant disciplinary breaches in the future . As a result , Harbhajan missed the tri @-@ series in Bangladesh and the 2008 Asia Cup in Pakistan , and India went down in the final of both tournaments after qualifying first on both occasions . He would have been eligible for selection after the first two matches of the Asia Cup , but the selectors omitted him entirely .

 Harbhajan returned to international cricket for the tour of Sri Lanka in July and August . In the First Test at Colombo , he took 2 / 149 as Sri Lanka amassed 600 / 6 declared and won by an innings . In the Second Test in Galle , he took 6 / 102 to help India take a first innings lead of 37 and then took 4 / 51 in the second innings to help India level the series with a 170 @-@ run win . It was his fifth ten @-@ wicket match haul and his first outside India . He was again India 's leading wicket @-@ taker in the Third Test defeat , with 3 / 104 and 1 / 44 . He was India 's leading wicket @-@ taker with 16 scalps at 28 @.@ 12 , twice as many the second most @-@ prolific Indian . In the subsequent ODI series , he played in the first four matches , taking six wickets at 18 @.@ 83 at an economy rate of 3 @.@ 80 , including 3 / 40 in the win in the fourth match , which sealed the series . He was rested from the final dead rubber . 
 At the start of the Indian season , Harbhajan took 2 / 32 and 4 / 31 as the Rest of India defeated Delhi in the Irani Trophy . This was followed by the First Test against Australia in Bangalore . Harbhajan took Ponting 's wicket in taking 1 / 103 in the first innings , but not before the Australian captain had scored 123 . In reply to Australia 's 430 , India were in trouble at 195 / 6 when Harbhajan came in to bat . He scored a rearguard 54 , putting on 80 with fellow bowler Zaheer Khan , to reduce India 's deficit to 70 . He then took 2 / 76 in the second innings as the match ended in a draw . Ponting later cited Harbhajan and Zaheer 's partnership as the passage of play that prevented an Australian win . In the Second Test at his home ground in Mohali , Harbhajan took 2 / 60 in the first innings as India took a 201 @-@ run first innings lead . In the second innings Australia were chasing 516 for victory and had started aggressively , reaching 49 / 0 after seven overs . Harbhajan was introduced into the attack and removed Hayden and Simon <unk> in his first over and then Mike Hussey in his next . This triggered Australia 's collapse to 58 / 5 and their eventual defeat by 320 runs . Harbhajan was unable to find a fourth wicket , which would have seen him reach 300 Test wickets on his home ground , and ended with 3 / 36 . He was then ruled out of the drawn Third Test because of a toe injury . Harbhajan returned for the Fourth Test in Nagpur and dismissed Ponting for the tenth time in Tests in the first innings to register his 300th wicket . He ended with 3 / 94 as India took an 86 @-@ run lead . However , a batting collapse meant that India were 6 / 166 at tea on day four , only 252 runs ahead and facing possible defeat if Australia could clean up the tail quickly . Harbhajan then scored 52 , combining in a 107 @-@ run partnership with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to guide India out of trouble . India then successfully defended the target of 380 to win by 172 runs , with Harbhajan taking 4 / 64 including top @-@ scorer Hayden and the final wicket . Harbhajan was the equal @-@ leading wicket @-@ taker for the series along with Ishant Sharma , taking 15 wickets at 28 @.@ 86 . He also scored 125 runs at 41 @.@ 66 , helping to prevent two defeats . The series also saw the end of Harbhajan 's partnership with Kumble , who missed the Second Test due to injury and then retired after suffering another wound in the next match . As a result , Harbhajan started a new pairing with leg spinner Amit Mishra . 
 In the five @-@ match home ODI series against England , Harbhajan took seven wickets at 30 @.@ 29 and an economy rate of 5 @.@ 04 as India won 5 – 0 . He took one wicket in each of the matches , except the third match in Kanpur . In that match , he took 3 / 31 , registered his 200th ODI wicket and was named man @-@ of @-@ the match . During the two Tests , Harbhajan was the equal @-@ leading wicket @-@ taker with eight wickets at 35 @.@ 00 and he also scored 69 runs at 34 @.@ 50 . This included a 40 in the first innings of the First Test to help India reach 241 after a top @-@ order collapse , keeping India 's deficit to 75 ; they went on to win the match . Harbhajan ended the year as the third @-@ highest wicket @-@ taker in the world , and the highest among Indian players . He was named by Wisden in their selection of the Test team of the year . 
 Harbhajan then missed the ODI tour of Sri Lanka at the beginning of the year with a hamstring injury . He recovered in time to be recalled for the tour of New Zealand . Harbhajan was the leading wicket @-@ taker from both sides in both ODIs and Tests . Harbhajan was India 's most economical bowler in the two T20 internationals at the start of the tour , taking a total of 2 / 34 from eight overs and scoring 21 in the first match ; the hosts prevailed in both games . In series that saw four of the five ODIs truncated by rain , Harbhajan took five wickets at 29 @.@ 60 at an economy rate of 5 @.@ 69 . He took 3 / 27 in the opening match , and then took 2 / 56 from ten overs in the third game , in which both teams passed 330 , helping India to wins in both matches . In the First Test , Harbhajan took 1 / 57 and 6 / 63 to help set up a ten @-@ wicket win . It was only the second time that he had taken five wickets in an innings outside the subcontinent . However , he was disappointing in a high @-@ scoring draw in the Second Test , taking 2 / 120 as the hosts amassed 9 / 619 declared . In the Third Test , India suffered a middle @-@ order collapse on the first afternoon , and a counter @-@ attacking 60 by Harbhajan helped them to 379 . He then took 3 / 43 and 4 / 59 ; New Zealand had only two wickets in hand when rain caused the match to end in a draw with more than a day 's playing time lost . Harbhajan ended with 16 wickets at 21 @.@ 37 and 94 runs at 23 @.@ 50 . 
 India won both series , their first series win in New Zealand since 1981 and 1968 for ODIs and Tests respectively . 
 Harbhajan then played the full 2009 Indian Premier League season in South Africa , taking 12 wickets at 21 @.@ 33 and an economy rate of 5 @.@ 81 in 13 matches . He was one of the most economical bowlers in the competition , and took 1 / 9 in four overs against Punjab to win the man of the match award . He ended the season with 4 / 17 against Delhi , but it was not enough to prevent a four @-@ wicket defeat . 
 Harbhajan was part of the Indian team that attempted to defend their crown at the 2009 World Twenty20 . However they lost all three of their matches in the Super 8s round and were eliminated . Harbhajan took 3 / 30 in one of those matches against England , and ended the tournament with five wickets at 26 @.@ 20 and an economy rate of 6 @.@ 55 . During the tour of the West Indies that followed , Harbhajan took three wickets at 45 @.@ 33 , conceding almost a run a ball in three ODIs as India prevailed 2 – 1 . 
 In September , Harbhajan took 5 / 56 in the final of the Compaq Cup to help secure a 46 @-@ run Indian win over the hosts Sri Lanka . It was his first five @-@ wicket haul in three years and capped off a tournament in which he took six wickets at 22 @.@ 00 in three matches . He then struggled at the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa , taking 1 / 71 from ten overs against Pakistan and 0 / 54 from nine overs against Australia . India lost to Pakistan and the latter match was washed out . He then took 2 / 14 from eight overs against the West Indies , but it was not enough to prevent India from being eliminated in the first round , despite winning the match . 
 After his travails in South Africa , Harbhajan started the Indian season with eight wickets at 12 @.@ 87 in three Challenger Trophy one @-@ dayers for India Blue . He then played in a home ODI series against Australia taking eight wickets at 33 @.@ 87 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 51 in six games . This included a best of 2 / 23 in the sixth match , but he made a more influential contribution in the first match with the bat , striking 49 at the death as India came within striking distance of their target before he fell in the last over and the hosts ended five runs adrift of the target . He scored a similarly rapid 31 in the fourth match , but India fell 24 runs short . Harbhajan ended the series with 81 runs at 20 @.@ 25 . 
 In the three home Tests against Sri Lanka , Harbhajan was the highest wicket @-@ taker with 13 scalps , but these came at an average cost of 41 @.@ 00 . After taking 2 / 189 in the drawn First Test , he aggregated 5 / 152 and 6 / 192 as India took the next two fixtures by an innings . In the subsequent ODI series , he took six wickets at 35 @.@ 00 at an economy rate of 4 @.@ 88 as India won 3 – 1 . He took 2 / 58 from his ten overs in the first match , which proved to be tidy in the context of a match in which both teams passed 410 and India prevailed by three runs . 
 During the tri @-@ series in Bangladesh in January 2010 , Harbhajan took six wickets at 24 @.@ 00 in three matches . He missed the First Test due to neck pain but returned to take a total of 2 / 123 as India completed a clean sweep with a ten @-@ wicket win in the Second Test . 
 During New Zealand 's tour of India in November 2010 , Harbhajan scored his maiden Test century during the First Test in Ahmedabad . This was the 100th century by an Indian in the second innings and he reached triple figures with a six . His 115 , along with Laxman 's 91 saved the game for India after they had collapsed to 5 / 15 . Harbhajan was named man of the match . He followed on in the next test with 111 * in India 's 1st innings , becoming the first no . 8 batsman to score back @-@ to @-@ back test centuries . 
 After an ordinary performance with the ball in the 5 @-@ match ODI series in West Indies in June 2011 ( where he was the vice captain to skipper Suresh Raina ) ( took 4 wickets from 3 matches , best of 3 / 32 ) , he helped his team revive from dire straits in the 1st Test in Sabina Park at Kingston , Jamaica . With India struggling at 85 / 6 , he along with Suresh Raina initiated a counter @-@ attack to string an aggressive 146 @-@ run partnership with Suresh Raina ( 82 of 115 balls , 15 fours ) to help India reach 246 . Harbhajan scored 70 from 74 balls ( 10 fours , 1 six ) . 
 = = 2011 Exclusion = = 
 Following a few poor performances , Harbhajan was injured in India 's tour of England in the summer / monsoon of 2011 and was ruled out of the rest of the series . He returned to competitive cricket to lead the Mumbai Indians to 2011 Champions League Twenty20 title , but fell out of favor with the national selectors . He was not chosen in the home series squad against England in October and West Indies in November and December . Mumbai Indians won their first ever championship under his captaincy , winning the Champions League by 31 runs . Harbhajan was man of the match for his contribution . Harbhajan was also not selected for the Australian tour and the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh . He went to play the IPL 2012 which was not that successful for him , but took his team to semi final while being captain . Harbhajan is now going to play for Essex in England but is not selected for the Sri Lankan tour before the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 . In his debut match for Essex against Gloucestershire , Harbhajan did not take any wicket on 12 July 2012 , conceding 33 runs in his 12 overs . He has , however , been included in 30 probables for the World T20 tournament being held in Sri Lanka in September 2012 . He has been recalled to the Test squad after a gap of more than a year against New Zealand starting in the end of August 2012 . Harbhajan was dropped from the test team after the 2013 series against Australia . He was called back to the test team after 2 years for a solitary test against Bangladesh . 
 = = 2015 @-@ 2016 Inclusion = = 
 Following performances in IPL for Mumbai Indians in 2015 and 2014 , he was included in the test team captained by Virat Kohli against Bangladesh for the one @-@ off test match in <unk> . He took 3 wickets in that test to overtake Wasim Akram in the list of most test match wickets to become the ninth highest wicket @-@ taker in Tests . He was then called up for the ODI and T20I teams when a second @-@ string Indian side toured Zimbabwe to play 3 One @-@ day and 2 Twenty @-@ 20 matches . Though he did not take many wickets in that tour , he was impressive maintaining a tight line and stopping the flow of runs . Harbhajan returned with figures of 2 / 29 ( in 4 overs ) in his first T20 international over two and a half years . He was in the squad for the 3 test away series against Sri Lanka led by Virat Kohli . He replaced injured Ashwin in series against South Africa . He was also part of the team that played 3 T20I matches against Australia , home series against Sri Lanka , Asia Cup in Bangladesh . He played only one match in the Asia Cup against UAE . He was also part of the T20 World Cup that took place in India but did not play any of the matches . 
 = = Centuries = = 
 = = = Test Centuries = = = 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Harbhajan is an attacking @-@ minded bowler who is regarded for his ball control and ability to vary his length and pace , although he is often criticised for his flat trajectory . His main wicket @-@ taking ball climbs wickedly on the unsuspecting batsman from a good length , forcing him to alter his stroke at the last second . With a <unk> bowling action , he was reported for throwing in November 1998 . Although forced to travel to England for tests , his action was cleared by former English player Fred Titmus . 
 He has developed an ability to bowl the doosra , which was the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad , on @-@ field umpires <unk> Dar and Mark Benson , and TV umpire <unk> Rahman after the Second Test between India and Bangladesh at Chittagong , Bangladesh in December 2004 . The ICC cleared his action in May 2005 , saying that the straightening of his elbow fell within the permitted limits . 
 Among off spinners , Harbhajan is the second highest wicket @-@ taker in Test history , behind Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka . He is the third @-@ highest Test wicket @-@ taker among all Indians . Harbhajan average with the ball in home Test matches hovers in the mid @-@ 20s . All five of his man of the match awards and both of his man of the series awards have been obtained in India . Outside India , his bowling average climbs to around 40 . Statistically , his bowling in Test matches is most effective against the West Indies and Australia . As of May 2008 , his most productive hunting grounds have been Eden Gardens in Calcutta , where he has taken 38 wickets at 23 @.@ 10 in six Tests , while the <unk> in Chennai , where he has claimed two man of the match awards , has yield 34 wickets at 24 @.@ 25 in five Tests . Harbhajan has claimed his wickets most cheaply at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai , where he has taken 22 wickets at 19 @.@ 45 . Compared to Muralitharan , Harbhajan is less reliant on targeting the stumps for his dismissals ; he captures more than 60 % of his wickets via catches and less than 25 % by bowling or trapping batsmen leg before wicket , whereas the corresponding figures for Muralitharan are in the 40s . Harbhajan 's off spin complements Kumble 's leg spin . While Harbhajan is known for his emotional and extroverted celebrations , which are part of a deliberate strategy of aggression , Kumble is known for his undemonstrative and composed approach . Both spinners have opined that they bowl more effectively in tandem via persistent application of pressure to batsmen , but statistics have shown that while Kumble has performed better when paired with Harbhajan , Harbhajan has been more effective in Kumble 's absence . 
 Harbhajan has been particularly successful against Australian batsman Ricky Ponting , taking his wicket on ten occasions in Test cricket . 
 In an interview in 2001 , Harbhajan stated his ambition to become an all @-@ rounder . Although he has recorded a few half @-@ centuries at Test level , his batting average hovers around 15 in both Tests and ODIs . However , in the span of four years starting from 2003 , he has shown improved performance , averaging around 20 with the bat . His style is frequently described as unorthodox , with pundits agreeing with his self @-@ assessment attributing his batting achievements to his hand @-@ eye coordination , rather than his footwork or technique . The aggression in Harbhajan 's bowling also extends to his batting , with a Test strike rate in the 60s , placing him in the ten highest strike rates among players who have scored more than 1000 runs in Test cricket . Harbhajan Singh Is also a useful lower @-@ down the order batsman . For Mumbai Indians he had made valuable 49 runs of 18 balls to guide the MI to a seemingly impossible win over the DC . In the 2011 test , he also scored quickfire 70 of 72 balls to stabilise India 's batting

 = Typhoon Wayne ( 1983 ) = 
 Typhoon Wayne was an intense tropical cyclone that brought significant flooding to the Philippines in July 1983 . The typhoon originated from an area of disturbed weather that formed far from land towards the end of July . Late on July 22 , Wayne developed gale @-@ force winds while moving west . The next day , it was estimated to have become a typhoon , and Wayne subsequently entered a period of rapid deepening . During the morning hours of July 24 , the typhoon was estimated to have reached its peak intensity of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) , but soon began to weaken due to interaction with land . By the time it moved ashore in southern China on July 25 , Wayne had weakened considerably . After moving inland , Wayne weakened rapidly . The following day , Wayne was no longer a tropical cyclone . 
 Typhoon Wayne became the second typhoon to strike the Philippines within nine days . Furthermore , 42 people lost their lives in flood waters while attempting to cross a temporary bridge . A total of 28 persons were hurt and 39 were rescued , and there were initially reports of up to 200 people missing . Although Wayne passed south of Taiwan , moderate flooding was reported due to rough seas . Elsewhere , in China , Wayne was the fifth most intense typhoon on record to impact Fujian between 1960 and 2005 . Throughout China , 440 persons were injured , 105 people died , and 30 @,@ 000 dwellings collapsed . Overall , 147 people were killed due to Typhoon Wayne . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Typhoon Wayne originated from an elongated surface trough west of Truk . Initially , the trough was poorly organized , but after 1200 UTC on July 21 , satellite imagery indicated an increase in the organization and convective activity of the system . Based on this , a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) was issued late on July 21 by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) . Early the next day , Hurricane Hunters estimated that the system developed into a tropical depression , and the JTWC subsequently initialized warnings . Around this time , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) started monitoring the system . 
 During the next 24 hours , Wayne began to intensify and was soon upgraded into a tropical storm by the JTWC . The JMA first classified the low as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC on July 22 while the system generally moved west . By early July 23 , the JTWC upgraded the storm into a typhoon while the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm . Around this time , aircraft reconnaissance revealed an eyewall and a small inner core . Six hours later , the JMA upgraded Wayne to a typhoon . Later that day , the JMA announced that Wayne attained winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) . The storm continued to rapidly deepen , and within 24 hours , Typhoon Wayne had more than doubled in intensity according to the JTWC . Meanwhile , the cyclone moved westward along the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge in a low wind shear environment . At 0600 UTC on July 24 , the JTWC estimated that the storm attained peak intensity of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , a Category 4 hurricane @-@ equivalent on the United States Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ( SSHWS ) . According to the JTWC , Wayne was also a super typhoon . Early on July 24 , the JMA reported that Typhoon Wayne attained peak intensity of 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) ( equivalent to a Category 3 on the SSHWS ) , which it maintained for 12 hours before weakening slightly . As Super Typhoon Wayne passed north of Luzon , the low @-@ level atmospheric circulation was disrupted north of the storm by the high terrain of Taiwan and thus Wayne weakened . Wayne then began a more northwestward track and made landfall approximately 560 km ( 350 mi ) east of Hong Kong . At the time of landfall on July 25 , the JMA estimated winds of 170 km / h ( 105 mph ) , equivalent to a mid @-@ level Category 2 system on the SSHWS . Wayne struck the coast of China at typhoon strength according to JTWC , but rapidly dissipated as it moved inland over the mountainous terrain of southeastern China . By 0000 UTC on July 26 , the JMA ceased monitoring Typhoon Wayne . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 Upon affecting the Philippines , Typhoon Wayne became the second system to strike Luzon in nine days after Typhoon Vera . There , 42 people lost their lives including two children and 12 woman when they drowned in flood waters while trying to cross a damaged , but temporary bridge that was built after the 1981 Pacific typhoon season . The bridge was 150 ft ( 45 m ) long and 1 yd ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) wide and was responsible for connecting <unk> and Cebu . Many of the deceased were swept downstream the Managua River , which was situated 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) below the bridge . Additionally , 28 people were injured and 39 were rescued . Initially , an estimated 100 to 200 people were listed as missing , many of which were believed to have drowned in floodwaters . Many motorists were stranded due to flooding . 
 Despite veering south of Taiwan , Wayne generated high waves , which flooded farmland . A total of 1 @,@ 482 acres ( 600 ha ) of banana crops were flooded . Typhoon Wayne was the fifth most intense tropical cyclone to impact Fujian between 1960 and 2005 . Heavy rainfall led to severe flooding in Fujian and Guangdong . Across China , 105 persons perished . In addition , 440 persons were injured and 30 @,@ 000 dwellings collapsed . Although little damage was reported , winds of 43 km / h ( 27 mph ) and gusts of 56 km / h ( 35 mph ) were measured at Waglan Island. in Tia Po Kau , a slight storm surge was measured , peaking at 2 @.@ 18 m ( 7 @.@ 2 ft ) . Nearby , in <unk> 's Carin , a peak rainfall total of 113 @.@ 9 mm ( 4 @.@ 48 in ) was recorded . 
 = Walter de Lacy ( died 1085 ) = 
 Walter de Lacy ( died 27 March 1085 ) was a Norman nobleman who came to England after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066 . He received lands in Herefordshire and Shropshire , and served King William I of England by leading military forces during 1075 . He died in 1085 and one son inherited his lands . Another son became an abbot . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Walter was originally from <unk> , in Normandy . He had a brother , Ilbert de Lacy . Ilbert was the ancestor of the de Lacy family of Pontefract . Both Walter and Ilbert jointly held the Norman lands that were held of the Bishop of Bayeux . 
 = = Career in England = = 
 Walter was given the lordship of Weobley in Herefordshire after the Conquest . He is already attested in the Welsh Marches by 1069 , when he is recorded stopping a Welsh attack and then raiding into Wales in retribution . Walter and Ilbert may have come to England in the household of Odo of Bayeux , the Bishop of Bayeux and half @-@ brother of King William the Conqueror . Although some historians , such as W. E. Wightman , have argued that Walter was a follower of William fitzOsbern , others , including C. P. Lewis and K. S. B. Keats @-@ Rohan , have argued that Walter was an independent agent in England . By the time of Walter 's death , he held a block of lands in Herefordshire along the border with Wales . Another group of lands was centered on Ludlow in Shropshire . These two groupings of lands allowed Walter to help defend the border of England against Welsh raids . Walter also had other lands in Berkshire , Gloucestershire , Worcestershire , and Oxfordshire . Walter kept a large number of his manors in demesne , managing them directly rather than giving them as fiefs to his knightly followers . Some of these lands in Hereford , including Holme Lacy , were held of the Bishop of Hereford through feudal tenure . In total , Domesday Book records Walter 's lands as being worth £ 423 in income per year and as comprising 163 manors in 7 different counties . He was one of 21 individuals with land valued at more than £ 400 at the time of the survey . 
 In 1075 , Walter was one of the leaders of the force that prevented Roger de Breteuil from joining up with the other rebels during the Revolt of the Earls . Walter had joined forces with Wulfstan the Bishop of Worcester , Æthelwig the Abbot of Evesham Abbey , and Urse d 'Abetot the Sheriff of Worcester . 
 = = Family and death = = 
 Walter married Emma or <unk> and they had three sons – Roger , Hugh and Walter . Roger was the heir to Weobley and Walter became Abbot of Gloucester Abbey . Occasionally the elder Walter is claimed to have married twice – once to Emma and once to an <unk> , but this is probably a confusion of the variations of Emma 's name . Walter and Emma also had a daughter who became a nun at St Mary 's Abbey , Winchester . A niece was married to <unk> de Cormeilles . Considerable confusion exists about Sybil , the wife of Pain fitzJohn . C. P. Lewis names her as the daughter of Walter , but W. E. Wightman calls her the daughter of Hugh , Walter 's son . Yet another pedigree has her as the daughter of Agnes , the daughter of Walter . In this rendition , favoured by Bruce Coplestone @-@ Crow , Agnes was married to Geoffrey Talbot . 
 The elder Walter died on 27 March 1085 , falling off some scaffolding at Saint Guthlac 's Priory when he was inspecting the progress of the building at that monastery . He was buried in the chapter house at Gloucester Abbey . He was a benefactor to Gloucester Abbey , as well as Saint Guthlac 's . 
 = Adventure Time ( season 4 ) =

 On April 6 , 2011 , Eric Homan announced through Frederator 's official blog that , although he was unable to " confirm nor deny " whether the series had been renewed for a fourth season , " if there were a fourth season planned [ ... ] writing would begin next week . " On April 28 , 2011 , Ward officially announced that , with the storyboards for season three nearing completion , much of the production staff had shifted its focus onto the show 's fourth season . The first episode to enter into production was " Five Short Graybles " , based on its production number . However , it was later the second episode aired . 
 During the writing for the season , Ward and series ' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was increasingly difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had " already used a lot of cool ideas " . Osborne called this slump the " season four blues " . Ward went on to clarify that , " everything 's still coming out super weird and interesting — but it just gets a little harder . You have to dig deeper . " To combat these issues , the writer staff tried different story writing methods , such as a technique called exquisite corpse , in which one writer starts a story on a sheet of paper , and the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it . Ward , however , noted that " the ideas are usually terrible " . They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show . 
 This season 's episodes were produced in a process similar to previous seasons ' episodes . First , all of the episodes began as simple two @-@ to @-@ three @-@ page outline that contained the necessary plot information . These outlines were then handed off to storyboard artists , who would then expand the rough outline into a full storyboard . The episodes ' design and coloring were done in Burbank , California . Animation was handled overseas in South Korea , either by Rough Draft Korea or by Saerom Animation . The season was storyboarded and written by Cole Sanchez , Rebecca Sugar , Tom Herpich , Skyler Page , Ako Castuera , Moynihan , Bert Youn , Somvilay Xayaphone , and Steve Wolfhard . Ward was proud with the writing staff for the season , saying , " Everyone [ on the writing staff ] is super talented [ ... ] And they 're all a bunch of <unk> , super smart " . He explained that " They 're amazing in helping us because they let us write really cool ideas [ because ] they 're really supportive , is what I am trying to say , of what we 're trying to do . " The season was produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios . The series is rated TV @-@ PG .

 = M @-@ 43 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 43 is a state trunkline highway in southwestern and central parts of the US state of Michigan . The highway runs from South Haven to Webberville along an indirect path through both rural areas and larger cities . The trunkline follows three overall segments : a southeasterly track from South Haven to Kalamazoo , a northeasterly course to the Hastings area and an easterly route through the Lansing area . 
 The M @-@ 43 designation dates back to at least July 1 , 1919 , when it was used on a series of roadways running between Kalamazoo and St. Charles . Its <unk> and easternmost sections were transferred to other highways in the 1930s . Additions to M @-@ 43 extended it to its current termini . Several sections of the highway were realigned during its history , one of these changes led to the creation of a business loop in Grand Ledge . Another former segment of the trunkline in the Lansing area has been renumbered M @-@ 143 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 43 begins at an intersection with BL I @-@ 196 in South Haven . Known locally as Bailey Avenue , the road heads out of the city to the southwest , intersecting County Road A @-@ 2 before running over Interstate 196 ( I @-@ 196 ) . From there , the road continues to the southeast near the airport through the rural areas of Van Buren County . The road runs through mixed woodland and fields before passing through Bangor . After Bangor , the route heads due east past Glendale and then intersects M @-@ 40 north of Paw Paw . 
 After the junction with M @-@ 40 , the highway then enters Kalamazoo County and has an interchange with US Highway 131 ( US 131 ) just before entering the city of Kalamazoo on Main Street near the north side of the campus of Western Michigan University . Through downtown , M @-@ 43 runs concurrently with both of the city 's business loops for I @-@ 94 and US 131 . Eastbound traffic along the combined highway is routed on Michigan Avenue , while westbound traffic uses Kalamazoo Avenue . Business US 131 ( Bus . US 131 ) turns north at Park Street and BL I @-@ 94 / M @-@ 43 continues east . After the two traffic directions merge back together and cross the Kalamazoo River , BL I @-@ 94 turns to the southeast , and M @-@ 43 follows Riverview Drive to an intersection with Gull Road . There M @-@ 43 begins to head northeast out of the city . The highway passes in front of the <unk> Medical Center and along a row of retail and commercial properties next to Gull Road . The trunkline then travels through a rural area for a brief period before entering the community of Richland where it merges with M @-@ 89 . 
 M @-@ 43 and M @-@ 89 run concurrently for a mile north of Richland before M @-@ 89 heads off to the west while M @-@ 43 continues north . After the concurrency ends , M @-@ 43 turns east and then back north to run between Little Long and Gull lakes . It is at this point where M @-@ 43 begins its northward trek . The road continues on a general north @-@ northeast track through rural areas and beside several lakes in Barry County before meeting M @-@ 179 and M @-@ 37 . M @-@ 43 merges with the latter highway and together they run into Hastings . Downtown , M @-@ 37 leaves town to the south , while M @-@ 43 heads north before curving around the east , passing through <unk> approaching the community of Woodland . After leaving town , the road meets M @-@ 66 , and together they head north to a junction with M @-@ 50 . 
 M @-@ 43 then turns east with M @-@ 50 , and they briefly run together before M @-@ 50 diverges to the southeast . Now known as the Grand Ledge Highway , M @-@ 43 continues its easterly path across northern Eaton County before dipping south briefly to travel around the south side of Grand Ledge . Just south of town , M @-@ 43 has a junction with M @-@ 100 and then follows Saginaw Highway . The highway then has a junction with I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 69 in Delta Township before continuing into Lansing , merged with BL I @-@ 69 . 
 In Lansing , the highway travels splits to follow the one @-@ way streets of Saginaw ( eastbound ) and Oakland ( westbound ) near the Sparrow Specialty Hospital . BL I @-@ 69 / M @-@ 43 then crosses the Grand River and passes Marshall Park . The trunkline then passes over US 127 just before the paired one @-@ way streets merge back together on Grand River Avenue . After the merge , M @-@ 43 heads southeast through East Lansing , passing the main campus of Michigan State University and Spartan Stadium . The road continues on its southeast path , traveling by the Meridian Mall as it enters Meridian Township . From here the road travels through Williamston before terminating at an interchange with I @-@ 96 just south of Webberville at exit 122 . 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) maintains M @-@ 43 like all other state trunkline highways . As a part of those responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roadways using a metric called average annual daily traffic . This is a calculation of the traffic levels for a roadway segment for any average day of the year . In 2009 , MDOT determined that the highest traffic volume along M @-@ 43 was east of the I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 69 interchange at 38 @,@ 927 vehicles per day . The highest commercial traffic was west of the interchange at 645 trucks daily . The lowest volumes were at Woodland with only 1 @,@ 700 vehicles and 120 trucks traveling along that section of the highway daily . Two segments of M @-@ 43 are listed on the National Highway System . The first section runs from US 131 in Oshtemo Township east to the intersection of M @-@ 43 ( Gull Road ) and Sprinkle Road in Comstock . The second segment is between I @-@ 96 / I @-@ 69 in Delta Township and the junction between Saginaw Street and Grand River Avenue in East Lansing .

 When M @-@ 43 was first commissioned by July 1 , 1919 , it ran from M @-@ 17 in Kalamazoo to Hastings . It also extended north to Ionia and Stanton before turning east through Ithaca to St. Charles . In 1929 , the western end was extended from Kalamazoo to South Haven , with a section still under construction . By the end of 1930 , the sections of M @-@ 43 north and east of Woodbury were redesignated as parts of other highways . The Woodbury – Stanton segment was renumbered M @-@ 14 , and the Stanton – St. Charles highway became M @-@ 57 . In 1938 , the road was extended to the east , replacing the routing of M @-@ 39 from Woodbury all the way to East Lansing where it intersected US 16 as it existed on Grand River Avenue . 
 The next year , M @-@ 37 was realigned , which created a concurrency with M @-@ 43 in the Hasting area . When M @-@ 43 was rerouted in 1954 , the new course of the highway ran concurrently with M @-@ 66 for a few miles in rural northeastern Barry County . All of the highway was completely paved in 1956 when a new routing opened northeast of Hastings , bypassing Coats Grove . The fourth change in the Barry County routing was made by the next year. the highway was rerouted due northward out of Hastings along Broadway Street . 
 Around 1959 , M @-@ 43 was shifted to bypass Grand Ledge . The former route through town was retained as a state highway , designated Bus . M @-@ 43 . M @-@ 43 was extended from its eastern end in Lansing in 1962 along a section of highway that was formerly part of US 16 on Grand River Avenue ; the extension to Webberville was made when the I @-@ 96 freeway opened that year . Through the Lansing area , M @-@ 43 was rerouted off Michigan Avenue downtown . This former routing was renumbered M @-@ 143 .

 Business M @-@ 43 ( Bus . M @-@ 43 ) was a business loop through the city of Grand Ledge . It ran east along Jefferson Street . The street curves to the southeast at a bend in the Grand River . M @-@ 100 merges in from the northeast at Bridge Street . The two highways ran concurrently south to Saginaw Highway . There , Bus . M @-@ 43 ended at the intersection with M @-@ 43 while M @-@ 100 continued south . 
 The business loop was created when M @-@ 43 was rerouted to a new roadway southwest of downtown Grand Ledge . This roadway opened on November 14 , 1959 , at which time the business loop was signed along the former route in town . In 1968 , Bus . M @-@ 43 was decommissioned . The section not concurrent with M @-@ 100 was turned over to local control and removed from the state trunkline highway system . 
 = J. Proctor Knott = 
 James Proctor Knott ( August 29 , 1830 – June 18 , 1911 ) was a U.S. Representative from Kentucky and served as the 29th Governor of Kentucky from 1883 to 1887 . Born in Kentucky , he moved to Missouri in 1850 and began his political career there . He served as Missouri Attorney General from 1859 to 1861 , when he resigned rather than swear an oath of allegiance to the federal government just prior to the outbreak of the Civil War . 
 Knott was disbarred and briefly imprisoned for his refusal to take the oath of allegiance . He returned to Kentucky in 1863 and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives . In 1871 , he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads . In the speech , he lampooned the remote town of Duluth , Minnesota . The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim . He did not stand for re @-@ election in 1870 , instead making a failed run for the office of governor . In 1875 , he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee . 
 In 1883 , Knott left Congress and made a successful run for governor . He secured major reforms in education , but was stymied in his pursuit of tax reform . After his term as governor , he was a delegate to the state 's constitutional convention in 1891 . In 1892 , he became a professor at Centre College in Danville , Kentucky and helped organized the college 's law school in 1894 . He served as dean of the law school until an illness forced him to retire in 1902 . He died at his home in Lebanon , Kentucky on June 18 , 1911 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 J. Proctor Knott was born in <unk> , Marion County , Kentucky on August 29 , 1830 . He was the son of Joseph Percy and Maria Irvine ( McElroy ) Knott . He was tutored by his father from an early age , and later attended public school in Marion and Shelby counties . In 1846 , he began to study law . In May 1850 , he relocated to Memphis , Missouri , where he was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in 1851 . He also served in the offices of the circuit court and county clerks . 
 Knott married Mary E. Forman on November 17 , 1852 . Forman died during the birth of the couple 's first child in August 1853 . On January 14 , 1858 , Knott married his cousin , Sarah R. McElroy . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Knott 's political career began in 1857 when he was elected to represent Scotland County in the Missouri House of Representatives . He served as chair of the judiciary committee and conducted the impeachment hearings against Judge Albert Jackson . Knott resigned his seat in the legislature in August 1858 to accept Governor Robert M. Stewart 's appointment to fill the unexpired term of Missouri 's attorney general , Ephraim B. Ewing . In 1860 , he was elected to a full term as attorney general . 
 In January 1861 , Missouri called a convention to determine whether it would follow the lead of other pro @-@ slavery states and secede from the Union . Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause , but opposed the methods of the secessionists . The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80 @,@ 000 @-@ vote majority . Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an oath of allegiance required by the federal government . As a result of his refusal , he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time . 
 = = = In the House of Representatives = = = 
 In 1863 , Knott returned to Kentucky and re @-@ opened his legal practice in Lebanon . He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1867 . As a legislator , he opposed the Reconstruction agenda of the Radical Republicans and ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments . He was re @-@ elected to a second term , but did not stand for re @-@ election in 1870 . 
 Knott 's most notable action as a legislator occurred near the end of his first stint in Congress . On January 27 , 1871 , he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty @-@ seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion . In the speech , Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad 's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth , Minnesota to make his point . He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located . Following the speech , the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day . 
 Knott 's speech , known as Duluth ! or The Untold Delights of Duluth , brought him national acclaim and copies of the speech were reprinted and sold . Residents of Duluth apparently were not offended by the speech , extending an offer for Knott to visit the city ; Knott accepted the offer in 1891 . In 1894 , a city near Duluth was incorporated as " <unk> " ; in 1904 , it adopted its present name of Proctor , Minnesota . 
 In 1871 , Knott made an unsuccessful bid to become governor of Kentucky , losing the Democratic nomination to Preston Leslie . He was re @-@ elected to the House of Representatives in 1875 , serving four consecutive terms . He chaired the House Judiciary Committee for the first three of these terms . In 1876 , he was named one of the managers of impeachment proceedings against ex @-@ Secretary of War William W. Belknap .

 Knott was one of several candidates seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1883 . Other prominent candidates included Congressman Thomas Laurens Jones , former Confederate general Simon Bolivar Buckner , Judge John S. Owsley , and Louisville mayor Charles Donald Jacob . Balloting began on May 16 , 1883 , with Jones as the leading vote @-@ getter but unable to secure a majority . After four ballots , Jacob withdrew his name , and Knott moved into the lead . The following day , Owsley dropped out of the balloting , and Knott extended his lead . Though Buckner remained on the ballot , the race came down to Jones and Knott . Delegates from Owen County switched to Knott , and other counties soon followed suit . Jones withdrew , and Knott was nominated unanimously . 
 In the general election , Knott defeated Republican Thomas Z. Morrow by a margin of nearly 45 @,@ 000 votes . During his term in office , he asked the legislature to conduct a thorough reform of the state 's tax system , but the legislators ' only response was to create a board of equalization charged with making equitable tax assessments . The legislature also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested . 
 Knott 's most successful initiatives were in the area of education . Under his leadership , the state established a normal school for blacks in Frankfort and created a state teacher 's organization . New legislation spelled out , often for the first time in the state 's history , the duties and responsibilities of educators , administrators , and school boards . 
 Knott 's major shortcomings were in deterring crime . Despite the feuds that continued to rage in the state , including one that lasted several years in Rowan County , Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem . Overcrowding of prisons prompted Knott to employ his pardon power liberally . The legislature approved the construction of the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville , but it was Knott 's predecessor , Luke P. Blackburn , who laid most of the groundwork for this project . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Following his term as governor , Knott continued his legal practice in Frankfort . He declined two separate appointments offered to him by President Grover Cleveland . The first was to become Territorial Governor of Hawaii ; the other was an appointment to the Interstate Commerce Commission . Knott served as a special assistant to Kentucky 's attorney general in 1887 and 1888 , and in 1891 , he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention . 
 Knott became a professor of civics and economics at Centre College in Danville , Kentucky in 1892 . In 1894 , Knott and Centre president William C. Young organized a law department at the college ; Knott became the department 's first dean . An illness forced him to retire in 1902 . He died in Lebanon on June 18 , 1911 , and was buried at the Ryder Cemetery in Lebanon . Knott County , Kentucky was formed in 1884 and named in his honor . 
 = Battle of the Assunpink Creek = 
 The Battle of the Assunpink Creek , also known as the Second Battle of Trenton , was a battle between American and British troops that took place in and around Trenton , New Jersey , on January 2 , 1777 , during the American Revolutionary War , and resulted in an American victory . 
 Following a surprise victory at the Battle of Trenton early in the morning of December 26 , 1776 , General George Washington of the Continental Army and his council of war expected a strong British counter @-@ attack . Washington and the council decided to meet this attack in Trenton , and established a defensive position south of the Assunpink Creek . 
 Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis led the British forces southward in the aftermath of the December 26 battle . Leaving 1 @,@ 400 men under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood in Princeton , Cornwallis advanced on Trenton with about 5 @,@ 000 men on January 2 . His advance was significantly slowed by defensive skirmishing by American riflemen under the command of Edward Hand , and the advance guard did not reach Trenton until twilight . After assaulting the American positions three times , and being repulsed each time , Cornwallis decided to wait and finish the battle the next day . Washington moved his army around Cornwallis 's camp that night and attacked Mawhood at Princeton the next day . That defeat prompted the British to withdraw from most of New Jersey for the winter .

 At Trenton Washington faced a dilemma . All but a handful of his men 's enlistments were expiring on December 31 , and he knew that the army would collapse unless he convinced them to stay . So , on the 30th , Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars . He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks , but not a man turned out . Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops , saying " My brave fellows , you have done all I asked you to do , and more than could be reasonably expected ; but your country is at stake , your wives , your houses and all that you hold dear . You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships , but we know not how to spare you . If you will consent to stay only one month longer , you will render that service to the cause of liberty and to your country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances . " At first no one stepped forward , but then one soldier stepped forward , and he was followed by most of the others , leaving only a few in the original line .

 On January 1 , money from Congress arrived in Trenton and the men were paid . Washington also received a series of resolves from Congress including one that gave Washington powers similar to those of a military dictator . Washington decided that he would stand and fight at Trenton , and ordered General John Cadwalader , who was at Crosswicks with 1 @,@ 800 militia , to join him in Trenton . On December 31 Washington learned that an army of 8 @,@ 000 men under the command of General Charles Cornwallis was moving to attack him at Trenton . 
 Washington ordered his men to build earthworks that were parallel to the south bank of the Assunpink Creek . The lines extended about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) down the south end of the stream . However , one of Washington 's aides , Joseph Reed , pointed out that there were fords up stream that the British could cross , and then they would be in position to drive in Washington 's right flank . Washington could not escape across the Delaware because all of his boats were a few miles upstream . Washington told his officers that he planned to move the army and that their current position was only temporary .

 By January 1 , 1777 , Cornwallis and his army had reached Princeton . On January 2 , Cornwallis left part of his force there under the command of Charles Mawhood , and with 5 @,@ 500 men , set off down the road to Trenton , 11 miles ( 18 km ) away .

 Out in front of his army , Cornwallis placed a skirmish line of Hessian jägers and British light infantry .

As the British approached , Fermoy returned to Trenton , drunk . Colonel Edward Hand took over his command . 
 As the British came within range , the American riflemen opened fire . The American riflemen took cover in the woods , ravines and even in bends in the road , and each time the British would line up in a battle line , the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover . After Hand was forced to abandon the American position along Five Mile Run , he took up a new position , a heavily wooded area on the south bank of <unk> Creek . Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream . The riflemen fired at them from point @-@ blank range . The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines , bringing up their cannon . The British searched the woods for a half an hour looking for the Americans , but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position . 
 By three in the afternoon , the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow , about a half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense . Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall , when darkness would prevent the British from attacking his defenses on the south side of Assunpink Creek . The British , with artillery in position , attacked Hand 's new position , and he gave way , slowly falling back into Trenton . Along the way , Hand had his troops fire from behind houses . As Hand 's troops came to the creek , the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed , causing chaos among the Americans . Washington , seeing the chaos , rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge , and shouted that Hand 's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery .

 As the British prepared to attack the American defenses , cannon and musket fire was exchanged between the opposing sides . The British moved across the bridge , advancing in solid columns , and the Americans all fired together . The British fell back , but only for a moment . The British charged the bridge again , but were driven back by cannon fire . The British charged one final time , but the Americans fired canister shot this time , and the British lines were raked with fire . One soldier said , " The bridge looked red as blood , with their killed and wounded and their red coats . "

 When Cornwallis arrived in Trenton with the main army , he called a council of war as to whether or not he should continue to attack . Cornwallis ' quartermaster general , William Erskine , urged Cornwallis to strike right away , saying " If Washington is the General I take him to be , his army will not be found there in the morning . " But James Grant disagreed , and argued that there was no way for the Americans to retreat , and that the British troops were worn out , and that it would be better for them to attack in the morning after they had rested . Cornwallis did not want to wait until morning , but he decided that it would be better than sending his troops out to attack in the dark . Cornwallis said , " We 've got the old fox safe now . We 'll go over and bag him in the morning . " Cornwallis then moved his army to a hill north of Trenton for the night .

 During the night , the American artillery , under the command of Henry Knox , occasionally fired shells into Trenton to keep the British on edge . As Cornwallis had , Washington also called for a council of war . Using the road leading to Princeton , and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there . By 2 am the army was on its way to Princeton . Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British think they were digging in . By morning , these men too had evacuated , and when the British came to attack , all of the American troops were gone . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 Casualty estimates are widely divergent . Howard Peckham records the fighting on January 2 as two separate engagements , both of which he categorizes as " skirmishes " . In the first , at Five Mile Run , he gives no American losses . In the second , at Stockton Hollow , he gives the American casualties as 6 killed , 10 wounded and 1 deserted . William S. Stryker , on the other hand , gives the entire American loss on January 2 as 1 killed and 6 wounded , while David Hackett Fischer says that they had 100 killed and wounded . 
 Peckham gives the British losses at Five Mile Run as 1 Hessian killed and those for Stockton Hollow as " at least " 10 killed , 20 wounded and 25 captured . Edward J. Lowell gives the Hessian losses on January 2 as 4 killed and 11 wounded . David Hackett Fischer gives the British casualties as 365 killed , wounded or captured .

 By morning , Washington had reached Princeton . After a brief battle , the British there were decisively defeated and a substantial number of the garrison under command of Mawhood was captured . With their third defeat in ten days , Cornwallis ' superior , General William Howe ordered the army to withdraw from southern New Jersey and most of the way back to New York . This they did , leaving forward positions at New Brunswick . Washington moved his army to Morristown for winter quarters . 
 = Asashōryū Akinori = 
 Asashōryū Akinori ( <unk> <unk> , born 27 September 1980 , as Dolgorsürengiin <unk> , Mongolian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> ) is a Mongolian former sumo wrestler ( <unk> ) . He was the 68th yokozuna in the history of the sport in Japan and became the first Mongol to reach sumo 's highest rank in January 2003 . He was one of the most successful yokozuna ever . In 2005 he became the first wrestler to win all six official tournaments ( honbasho ) in a single year . Over his entire career , he won 25 top division tournament championships , placing him fourth on the all @-@ time list . 
 From 2004 until 2007 , Asashōryū was sumo 's sole yokozuna , and was criticized at times by the media and the Japan Sumo Association for not upholding the standards of behaviour expected of a holder of such a prestigious rank . He became the first yokozuna in history to be suspended from competition in August 2007 when he participated in a charity soccer match in his home country despite having withdrawn from a regional sumo tour claiming injury . After a career filled with a multitude of other controversies , both on and off the <unk> , his career was cut short when he retired from sumo in February 2010 after allegations that he assaulted a man outside a Tokyo nightclub . 
 = = Early life and sumo background = = 
 Asashōryū comes from a family with a strong background in Mongolian wrestling , with his father and two of his elder brothers all achieving high ranks in the sport . He also trained in judo in Mongolia . He originally came to Japan as an exchange student , together with his friend , the future <unk> , where they attended <unk> <unk> High School in Kochi Prefecture . They both trained together at the sumo club there . 
 = = Early career = = 
 He was recruited by the former ōzeki Asashio of the Wakamatsu stable ( now Takasago stable ) , who gave him the <unk> of Asashōryū , literally " morning blue dragon , " Asa being a regular prefix in the Wakamatsu stable . He made his professional debut in January 1999 . At that time , fellow Mongolians Kyokushūzan and <unk> were in the top division and stars back in their home country , but Asashōryū was quick to overtake them both . He attained elite sekitori status in September 2000 by winning promotion to the jūryō division , and reached the top makuuchi division just two tournaments later in January 2001 . In May 2001 , he made his san 'yaku debut at <unk> rank and earned his first <unk> award , for Outstanding Performance . 
 In 2002 , Asashōryū put together back @-@ to @-@ back records of 11 – 4 , 11 – 4 and 12 – 3 and was promoted to sumo 's second highest rank of ōzeki in July . In November 2002 , he took his first top division tournament championship ( yūshō ) with a 14 – 1 record . It took Asashōryū only 23 tournaments from his professional debut to win his first top division title , the fastest ever . In January 2003 , he won his second straight championship . Shortly after the tournament , Asashōryū was granted the title of yokozuna , the highest rank in sumo . His promotion coincided with the retirement of the injury @-@ plagued Takanohana , last Japanese born yokozuna to date . 
 = = Yokozuna career = = 
 While his first tournament as yokozuna ended in a disappointing 10 – 5 record , he won a further twenty @-@ three tournaments . Combined with his two yūshō as an ōzeki , he had twenty @-@ five career championships in the top division . This puts him in fourth place on the all @-@ time list , behind only Hakuhō , Taihō , and Chiyonofuji . 
 = = = 2003 = = = 
 Asashōryū nominally shared the yokozuna rank with Musashimaru , but in fact his rival only fought a handful of bouts in 2003 due to injury . The two did not meet in competition all year . Asashōryū won his first championship as a yokozuna in May 2003 and came back from an injury sustained in the July tournament to win his third title of the year in September . Musashimaru announced his retirement in November , leaving Asashōryū as sumo 's only yokozuna . 
 = = = 2004 = = = 
 Asashōryū began 2004 with two consecutive perfect 15 – 0 tournament wins ( <unk> @-@ yūshō ) in January and March . Nobody had attained <unk> <unk> since 1996 ; yet Asashōryū went on to add three more such titles after 2004 , for a career total of five . Only Hakuhō , with eleven , Taihō , with eight , and Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi with seven , have recorded more 15 – 0 scores . His unbeaten run continued into the first five days of the May 2004 tournament , giving him a winning streak of 35 bouts in total , the longest run since Chiyonofuji 's 53 in 1988 . Although he was then upset by maegashira <unk> , he gained revenge by defeating <unk> in a playoff on the final day to claim the championship . On 27 November 2004 , Asashōryū became the first wrestler to win five tournaments in a year since Chiyonofuji achieved the feat in 1986 , and won his ninth Emperor 's Cup . Asashōryū 's below average 9 – 6 score in the Autumn basho of 2004 , the only one he did not win , was attributed in part to the official ceremony for his marriage , which was held in August 2004 ( although he had actually married in December 2002 ) . The hectic social round that inevitably follows Japanese weddings affected his pre @-@ tournament preparations , as it prevented him from doing any training . 
 = = = 2005 = = = 
 He continued to dominate sumo in 2005 , becoming the first wrestler ever to win all six honbasho ( sumo tournaments ) in the same year . The great yokozuna Taihō achieved the feat of six consecutive tournament victories twice , but never in a calendar year . Asashōryū lost only six bouts all year ( 0 – 1 – 0 – 2 – 2 – 1 ) . One of those rare losses came on 11 September 2005 , at the start of the Aki Basho when he dropped his first <unk> ( Day 1 ) bout during his tenure as yokozuna . On 26 November 2005 , a visibly emotional Asashōryū wept after winning his eighty @-@ third bout of the year , ( surpassing Kitanoumi 's record set in 1978 ) and clinching the tournament at the same time . The six championships of 2005 ( including two more 15 – 0 wins in January and May ) combined with his victory from the final tournament of 2004 , meant Asashōryū became the first man in sumo history to win seven consecutive tournament championships . 
 = = = 2006 = = = 
 Asashōryū 's consecutive basho streak came to an end in January 2006 , when ōzeki <unk> took the first tournament championship of the year . Asashōryū 's performance in January was a surprisingly poor 11 – 4 but he successfully rebounded by winning the March tournament . However , his six losses in those tournaments matched his loss total for all of 2005 . In the May tournament , he sustained an injury to the ligaments in his elbow on the second day falling off of the <unk> in a surprising loss to <unk> and was visibly slow to rise from the ground . He was absent from the tournament the next day and later released a statement confirming he was withdrawing from the tournament . Doctors told him he would not be able to compete for two months , which meant he would miss the July tournament as well . However , Asashōryū was ready by the start of the July tournament and won with a 14 – 1 record . In the following tournament , Asashōryū won his eighteenth career title with a 13 – 2 record . He also won the final tournament of 2006 for his nineteenth career title , the fifth he has won with a perfect 15 – 0 record . 
 = = = 2007 = = = 
 In January 2007 , Asashōryū posted a 14 – 1 record , his fourth straight championship since returning from injury , and became the fifth man to win twenty career championships . In March , he dropped his first two bouts but then won thirteen in a row for a 13 – 2 score . However , this was not enough to win the title — he lost a playoff for the first time in his career , to fellow Mongolian Hakuhō . In May he turned in a below par 10 – 5 record , losing to all four ōzeki and maegashira Aminishiki ( although he appeared to be carrying an injury ) . Hakuhō won this tournament as well and was promoted to yokozuna immediately afterwards . Asashōryū had been the sole yokozuna for a total of 21 tournaments since the retirement of Musashimaru in November 2003 – the longest period of time in sumo history . In July he lost to Aminishiki once again on the opening day but rallied to win the next fourteen bouts , taking his 21st title with a 14 – 1 record . He was suspended by the Sumo Association from the next two tournaments ( see below ) . 
 = = = 2008 = = = 
 Asashōryū returned to tournaments in January 2008 . On the final day , he faced Hakuhō in a battle of 13 – 1 yokozuna , but was defeated , giving him a final record of 13 – 2 . In March the two yokozuna faced off for the title again on the last day , marking only the fifth time in the last 30 years that two yokozuna have contested the championship on the last day of two consecutive tournaments . In this rematch , Asashōryū was the victor , winning his 22nd title , thus equalling Takanohana 's haul of tournament championships . 
 In the May tournament he lost to <unk> on the opening day . He injured his back in this match and subsequent losses to <unk> ( the eventual winner of the tournament ) and <unk> put him out of contention . 
 Asashōryū got off to a bad start in the July tournament by losing to <unk> on the first day . After a second loss to maegashira <unk> on day five , he pulled out of the tournament on the sixth day citing pain in his elbow . The September tournament unfolded in a similarly poor fashion . After compiling a lacklustre 5 – 4 record through the first nine days , Asashōryū forfeited his tenth @-@ day match to maegashira <unk> and withdrew . He had elbow pain , and presented a medical certificate . 
 He returned to Mongolia in October 2008 , staying until shortly before the tournament in Kyushu in November , which he did not enter . He stated that he would not withdraw for a third time partway through a tourney , and suggested that he would retire if his comeback proved unsuccessful . 
 = = = 2009 = = = 
 The January 2009 honbasho , Asashōryū 's first full tournament since May 2008 , was a remarkable success . He won his first fourteen matches , losing only on the last day to Hakuhō . He then won the resulting playoff to earn his 23rd championship and pass Takanohana on the all @-@ time list to become the fourth ever wrestler to have won 23 tournaments ( the other three being Taihō , Kitanoumi and Chiyonofuji ) . His victory came exactly twenty years after yokozuna <unk> also returned from three tournaments out to win the championship with a 14 – 1 record . Sumo Association head Musashigawa described Asashōryū 's comeback as " amazing . " Ticket sales and television ratings showed a marked increase as his winning run continued . After his playoff win Asashōryū announced to the crowd , " Everyone , thank you very much . Really . I am back . " 
 In the following tournament in March he went undefeated for the first nine days but then lost to three of the five ōzeki over the next five days , putting him out of contention for the championship . He also lost his final day match to Hakuhō to finish at 11 – 4 . In the May tournament he lost early to Aminishiki , then won ten in a row before falling to Harumafuji on Day 14 . He again lost to Hakuhō , on the final day , finishing at 12 – 3 . 
 Asashōryū returned to Mongolia after the May tournament to receive treatment for a bruised chest suffered in his defeat to Harumafuji . In June he received the Hero of Labour Award from outgoing Mongolian President <unk> <unk> , the highest government award in Mongolia and equivalent to the Japanese People 's Honour Award . He performed poorly in the July tournament with a 10 – 5 record , his worst finish in just over two years . 
 He damaged ligaments in his right knee during a regional tour of Akita in August 2009 ( the first time he has injured his knee ) , hampering his preparations for the September tournament . Despite this , he won his first 14 matches , before finally losing to Hakuhō , leaving both wrestlers at 14 – 1 . Asashōryū would win the resulting playoff to win his 24th yūshō , tying him with Kitanoumi for third on the all @-@ time yūshō list . The triumph took place on his 29th birthday . He finished on 11 – 4 in the Kyushu tournament in November , losing his last four matches .

 In the January 2010 tournament Asashōryū clinched his 25th yūshō on Day 14 after beating Harumafuji to go 13 – 1 , two wins ahead of Hakuhō on 11 – 3 . He was however beaten by Hakuhō on the final day for the seventh straight time in regulation matches , and he finished on 13 – 2 .

 In January 2007 , The Shūkan Gendai , a weekly tabloid magazine , reported that Asashōryū had paid opponents about ¥ 800 @,@ 000 ( $ 10 @,@ 000 ) per fight to allow him to win the previous November 2006 tournament with a perfect score . Asashōryū denied these claims in court on 3 October 2008 , during the first ever court appearance by a yokozuna . He appeared as part of a lawsuit brought by the Japan Sumo Association and about 30 other wrestlers seeking around ¥ 660 million ( $ 8 @.@ 12 million ) from Shūkan Gendai 's publisher , Kodansha Ltd . He said the allegations were " complete lies ... I am very sad and disgusted . " Also appearing in court , in defence of the magazine , was former wrestler Itai , who had made similar allegations of bout @-@ fixing in 2000 regarding his own career . Itai suggested that Asashōryū 's win over <unk> in the November 2006 tournament was an example of a fixed match . 
 On 26 March 2009 , the Tokyo District Court ordered Kodansha , the publisher of the magazine , and <unk> Takeda , the freelance writer of the articles , to pay ¥ 42 @.@ 90 million ( $ 437 @,@ 000 ) in damages , believed to be the highest award for libel damages against a magazine in Japanese history . Chief judge Yasushi Nakamura stated that the reporting was " slipshod in the extreme . " 
 = = = Suspension = = = 
 After his tournament victory in July 2007 , Asashōryū decided to skip the regional summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury . The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left elbow and a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal . However , he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia . He was reported to have done so at the request of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government . However , the suggestion that he had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm . 
 Asashōryū was ordered to return to Japan and on 1 August 2007 , the Sumo Association suspended him for the upcoming September tournament as well as the next one in November , the first time in the sport 's history that an active yokozuna has been suspended from a main tournament . They also announced that Asashōryū and his stablemaster Takasago would have their salaries cut by 30 % for the next four months . He was also instructed to restrict his movements to his home , his stable , and the hospital . <unk> , a Director of the Sumo Association , called Asashōryū 's behaviour " a serious indiscretion . Given that a yokozuna should act as a good example for the other wrestlers , this punishment for his action is appropriate . " It was the most severe punishment ever imposed on a yokozuna since the Grand Tournament system was adopted over 80 years ago . Asashōryū responded by saying he would get his injuries treated and prepare for the winter regional tour and the January 2008 tournament . However , his stablemaster reported that Asashōryū was finding the severity of the punishment difficult to deal with , and two doctors from the Sumo Association diagnosed him as suffering from acute stress disorder , and then dissociative disorder . On 28 August he was allowed to return to Mongolia for treatment . After recuperation and onsen treatment , he returned to Japan on 30 November 2007 , apologising for his actions at a press conference . 
 = = = Assault allegations and subsequent retirement = = = 
 During the January 2010 tournament , a tabloid magazine claimed Asashōryū punched his personal manager after getting drunk during a night out in downtown <unk> . After the tournament Asashōryū was reprimanded by Japan Sumo Association ( JSA ) head Musashigawa , and he apologised once again for his behaviour . However , it subsequently emerged that it was not his manager but a restaurant employee who was attacked , reportedly sustaining a broken nose . The man did not file a report with the police , and on 31 January 2010 , Asashōryū told the authorities that he had reached a settlement with him . Despite this , the police did not rule out the possibility of questioning Asashōryū about the assault . 
 Subsequently , on 4 February 2010 , he announced his decision to retire , after discussing the matter at a meeting with the Board of Directors of the Sumo Association . He stated , " I feel heavy responsibility as a yokozuna that I have caused trouble to so many people . I am the only person who can put an end to it all . I think it 's my destiny that I retire like this . " Asashōryū did not comment directly on the brawl , except to say that what actually happened was " quite different " to media reports . " I decided to step down to bring this to a closure . " 
 Asashōryū referred to criticism for not showing <unk> ( dignity ) as a yokozuna . " Everybody talks about dignity , but when I went into the ring , I felt fierce like a devil . " Asked what his most memorable bout was , he chose his first win over Musashimaru in May 2001 , with his parents watching him . 
 JSA Chief Director Musashigawa revealed that directors were debating on that day whether to punish Asashōryū . " He felt compelled to resign for misconduct that was inexcusable , and the board accepted . I want to apologize to all of the fans and to the person injured in the incident . " The Yokozuna Deliberation Council had recommended his retirement , and would have pressed for his dismissal if he had not chosen to go . 
 In Mongolia , there was anger at the news . One high @-@ ranking Mongolian official accused the Sumo Association of using the incident as an excuse to get rid of Asashōryū before he could reach Taihō 's 32 tournament victories . " I feel that they did not want him to break the record for most titles . This behavior is unjust . The Mongolian people disapprove . " The <unk> <unk> newspaper called for sumo broadcasts in Mongolia to be suspended . Reacting to the tense mood among the Mongolian public , a spokesman at the Foreign Ministry of Mongolia issued a statement that the " resignation of Asashōryū will have no influence to the friendship between Mongolian and Japanese citizens . " and he requested people stay calm . Reaction in Japan was more mixed , with some of the public saying the yokozuna had to go while others said they would miss him . Many Japanese media compared his case with earlier yokozuna <unk> who was forced to resign in 1949 after dropping out of a tournament claiming illness but subsequently photographed at a baseball game . Both his stablemaster and the Sumo Association received criticism for their handling of this incident and Asashōryū in general . 
 As Asashōryū never obtained Japanese citizenship , he was not eligible to stay in the sumo world as an oyakata , or coach . He was , however , entitled to a formal retirement ceremony , or <unk> @-@ shiki , at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan and was also given a retirement allowance by the Sumo Association , believed to be around ¥ 120 million ( $ 1 @.@ 34 million ) . 
 Asashōryū gave a press conference in Mongolia on 11 March , and denied committing any " act of violence , " but said he did not regret his decision to retire . He claimed it was " an undeniable fact " that there were people within the Sumo Association " trying to push me out of sumo " and that he could have gone on to win 30 or more tournament titles . Asked about rumours that he would enter mixed martial arts , he replied , " I haven 't really thought about what to do next . " He refused to take any questions from Japanese reporters . 
 He was questioned voluntarily by investigators in May , and reportedly said that his hand " may have struck " the man , but he denied assault . In July police reported him to the public prosecutors . His former stablemaster Takasago said if Asashōryū was indicted then his retirement ceremony may be cancelled . However , in the event it went ahead as planned on 3 October , with around 380 dignitaries taking turns in snipping his <unk> or topknot before Takasago made the final cut . <unk> said to the 10 @,@ 000 fans at the Kokugikan , " In another life as a Japanese , I would like to become a yokozuna with Japanese spirit ... I want to show everyone that I can become a better person . " 
 = = = Other events = = = 
 Asashōryū received criticism from Sumo Association officials and the media throughout his yokozuna career for various other infractions of the strict code of conduct expected of top sumo wrestlers , both on the <unk> and off it . His breaches of etiquette during tournament bouts ranged from merely accepting the prize money with the wrong hand , to raising his arms in victory after clinching the championship , to giving opponents an extra shove after the bout was already over ( such as Hakuhō in May 2008 ) , and appealing to judges to overturn the referee 's decision . In July 2003 he pulled on fellow Mongolian Kyokushūzan 's mage ( traditional Japanese top knot ) during their bout on day five of the tournament , resulting in an immediate <unk> @-@ make , or disqualification . He was the first yokozuna to be disqualified from a bout . They reportedly brawled in the communal bath afterwards , and Asashōryū was also accused of breaking the wing mirror of Kyokushūzan 's car . Some Japanese fans called on him to " go back to Mongolia " after this incident . During the same year , Asashōryū was taking interviews from journalists when he called a Korean journalist a " kimchi bastard " ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , sparking controversy within South Korean newspapers . He also had an uneasy relationship with his stablemaster Takasago . In July 2004 he apologized after a row with Takasago over his wedding arrangements resulted in him being seen drunk in public and damaging the stable property , and his tendency to return to Mongolia without informing his stablemaster led to embarrassments like being unable to attend the funeral of Takasago stable 's previous head coach <unk> in December 2003 . He was also sometimes seen in public in a business suit or in casual dress instead of the traditional kimono that wrestlers are expected to wear . 
 = = Post @-@ sumo career = = 
 Immediately after his retirement from sumo there was speculation that Asashōryū would switch to mixed martial arts , and he was reported to be forming an MMA camp for Mongolian athletes . However , he has instead become a businessman . Asashōryū had business interests in Mongolia whilst still active in sumo , launching the family holding company as early as 2003 . Based in <unk> and investing exclusively inside Mongolia , the company has assets in banking , real estate and mining . In 2012 his wealth was estimated to be between <unk> and 75 million . He is also active in philanthropy , establishing the <unk> Foundation which has supported the Mongolian Olympic team , given scholarships to Mongolian college students studying in Mongolia and Japan , and donated English language textbooks to schools . 
 He became a member of the Democratic Party in May 2013 .

 Asashōryū was a relative lightweight early in his career , weighing just 129 kg ( 284 lb ) , in 2001 , and relied on speed and technique to compete against often much heavier opponents . However , he gradually put on weight and by 2010 was about 148 kg ( 326 lb ) , right on average . In his later career he tended to confront his opponents head on with the intention of out @-@ muscling them . In training , he was reported to do multiple repetitions of biceps curls with 30 kg ( 66 lb ) dumb @-@ bells , and whilst in the gym with NHK commentator Hiro Morita in 2008 he reportedly bench pressed 200 kg ( 440 lb ) . He had an intense approach to <unk> ( training ) , and some high @-@ profile wrestlers avoided training with him , fearing injury . 
 Asashōryū 's favoured techniques according to his Sumo Association profile were <unk> @-@ yotsu / yori , a left hand outside , right hand inside grip on his opponent 's mawashi ( belt ) , and <unk> , a series of rapid thrusts to the chest . His most common winning kimarite throughout his career were <unk> ( force out ) , <unk> ( push out ) , <unk> ( outer arm throw ) , <unk> ( inner arm throw ) and <unk> ( thrust out ) . He used 45 different kimarite in his career , a wider range than most wrestlers . In July 2009 he defeated Harumafuji by an " inner thigh throw " or <unk> , a technique not seen in the top division since 1975 . His trademark , however , was <unk> , or " lifting body slam " , a feat of tremendous strength normally only used on much smaller and weaker opponents . In 2004 Asashōryū twice dumped the 158 kg ( 348 lb ) <unk> using this technique .

 Asashōryū 's brothers are active in other combat sports : Dolgorsürengiin <unk> is a mixed martial arts fighter , and Dolgorsürengiin <unk> , a professional wrestler , competes in New Japan Pro Wrestling under the name Blue Wolf ( after the Mongolian Blue Wolf legend ) . All <unk> brothers have strong backgrounds in Mongolian wrestling . 
 Asashōryū first met his wife in high school when they were both 15 years old . They divorced in 2009 having been separated for several years . He has a son and a daughter .

 = Thomcord = 
 Thomcord is a seedless table grape variety and a hybrid of the popular Thompson Seedless or <unk> grape ( a Vitis vinifera variety ) and Concord grape ( a Vitis labrusca variety ) . Thomcord was developed in 1983 by Californian grape breeders working for the Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) , an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) , as part of a test to better understand a new seedless grape breeding procedure . 
 Its aromatic , " labrusca " flavor is similar to that of Concord , but mellowed by the mild , sweet taste from Thompson Seedless . Thomcord grows well in hot , dry climates , ripens between late July and mid @-@ August , and tolerates powdery mildew . It is a productive variety , yielding an average of 15 @.@ 1 kg ( 33 lb ) of grapes per vine , but has produced as much as 30 to 32 kg ( 66 to 71 lb ) per vine in grower trials . The berries weigh between 2 @.@ 72 and 3 @.@ 38 g ( 0 @.@ 096 and 0 @.@ 119 oz ) and have a medium @-@ thick , blue @-@ black skin that adheres to the fruit , unlike Concord , which has a thick skin that can slip off the pulp easily . The aborted seeds in the fruit body are relatively small , but larger than those in Thompson Seedless . 
 The plant is not restricted for propagation and distribution . Virus @-@ free propagation material is available from the Foundation Plant Services ( FPS ) at the University of California , Davis , and its genetic material is archived at the National Plant Germplasm System . After 17 years of testing , it was declared ready for use in 2003 . It is currently available in supermarkets . 
 = = Description = = 
 Thomcord grape is a hybrid of Thompson Seedless grape ( Vitis vinifera , or <unk> ) , which is popular in supermarkets during the summer , and seeded Concord grape ( Vitis labrusca ) , commonly used to make grape juice and jelly . It is a plump , juicy , seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord . Thomcord has a blue @-@ black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom . Unlike Concord , whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit , Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh , much like Thompson Seedless . It has an aromatic flavor , similar to the Concord in taste ( " labrusca " ) , though lighter due to the sweet , mild taste from Thompson Seedless . 
 Thomcord is suitable for hot , dry growing conditions , more so than Concord and other Concord seedless types . Its adaptability to hot dry climates was derived from Thompson Seedless . It grows well in California 's vineyards , particularly the San Joaquin Valley , just like Thompson Seedless . The plant is tolerant of ( but not resistant to ) powdery mildew , and is less susceptible to the fungus than Ruby Seedless , but more susceptible than Mars , Venus , <unk> , and Cayuga White varieties . The fungus can affect its leaves , stems , rachis ( stem of the grape cluster ) , and berries . The grape ripens in the summer ( mid @-@ season ) , between late July and mid @-@ August . 
 = = = Production details = = = 
 Thomcord is a productive variety , with a yield comparable to Thompson Seedless . When two cordons ( arms ) of the vines are trained horizontally on wires ( " bilateral @-@ trained " ) and are pruned to remove most of the previous year 's growth ( " spur @-@ pruned " ) during the winter , it can produce up to 13 – 16 kg ( 29 – 35 lb ) per vine , or an average of 15 @.@ 1 kg ( 33 lb ) . In 2002 , cane @-@ pruned vines of Thomcord were significantly more productive than Sovereign Coronation and were comparable to the Venus variety , averaging 21 @.@ 3 kg ( 47 lb ) per vine . Unlike Thompson Seedless , which has its cluster size thinned as a normal production practice , Thomcord 's is not thinned because of its smaller cluster size . The grape clusters range in weight between 259 and 534 g ( 0 @.@ 571 and 1 @.@ 177 lb ) and average 340 g ( 0 @.@ 75 lb ) , have medium to slightly loose tightness ( or are " well @-@ filled " , meaning the individual pedicels are not easily visible ) , and have a conical shape with a small wing . 
 Compared with Thompson Seedless , the berry weight and diameter of Thomcord are larger , but cluster tightness is similar . The berry length ranged between 18 @.@ 2 and 18 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 72 and 0 @.@ 72 in ) and the diameter ranged from 16 @.@ 7 to 17 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 66 to 0 @.@ 68 in ) in tests between 2001 and 2002 . The berries weigh between 2 @.@ 72 and 3 @.@ 38 g ( 0 @.@ 096 and 0 @.@ 119 oz ) , averaging 2 @.@ 85 g ( 0 @.@ 101 oz ) in 2002 , which is on par with Venus , but heavier than Sovereign Coronation , and even more so than Thompson Seedless . The fruit 's size has not been shown to increase appreciably by girdling the vines or by applying gibberellic acid when the berries set . 
 The aborted seeds of Thomcord are small , but in some years they can become <unk> ( a thickening and <unk> of the walls of plant cells and the subsequent dying off of the protoplasts ) , making them more noticeable inside the medium @-@ soft flesh . There are usually two aborted seeds per berry , which averaged between 14 and 22 @.@ 3 mg in 2001 and 2002 . This varied in comparison to Venus depending on the year and location , was comparable to the Sovereign Coronation , and was significantly smaller than the Sovereign Rose and Saturn varieties . However , as with the other cultivars , it was consistently larger than Thompson Seedless , which had the smallest aborted seeds . 
 = = = Vegetative description = = = 
 The mature leaves on the vine have three lobes with open upper lateral sinuses ( spaces between the lobes ) of medium depth . The main vein is slightly longer than the petiole ( stalk attaching the leaf blade to the stem ) , and the petiole sinus opens widely . Between the veins on the underside of both the mature and young leaf there are dense hairs that lie flat against the surface . The teeth on the edge of the leaf blade are convex on both sides , medium in size , and short relative to their width . Young leaf blades are dark copper red on the upper surface . 
 The shoots have at least three consecutive tendrils . Young shoots are fully open and have very dense hairs of medium anthocyanin coloration that lie flat against the tip . The <unk> of the young shoot is green with red stripes on the front ( dorsal ) side and solid green on the back ( ventral ) side . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1983 , research horticulturist David W. Ramming and technician Ronald L. <unk> — Californian grape breeders working for the ARS , the chief scientific research agency of the USDA — crossed Thompson Seedless and Concord in order to answer a technical question about a newly developed procedure for breeding novel , superior seedless grapes . The researchers wanted to demonstrate that plants created from embryo culture were derived from fertilized eggs ( <unk> ) instead of the maternal tissue ( somatic ) . From 1231 <unk> ( removal of male flower parts to control pollination ) of Thompson Seedless , the researchers produced 130 ovules using embryo rescue procedures . From these , 40 embryos developed and three seedlings were planted . The original seedling of Thomcord was planted in 1984 in plots in cooperation with California State University , Fresno . It was later selected in 1986 by Ramming and <unk> and tested in the San Joaquin Valley under the name A29 @-@ 67 , and was introduced as " Thomcord . " 
 The new hybrid was tested and scrutinized for 17 years before it was declared ready for growers and gardeners and was released on 11 September 2003 . Around 2008 , trials outside of California were just beginning . Thomcord quickly became a hit at farmers ' markets while it was being tested , and it has appeared in the fresh @-@ fruit section at supermarkets . This continued the long @-@ standing success of the ARS ' grape @-@ breeding research in California , which has developed some of the most popular seedless grapes on the market as well as red , white , and black grapes varieties for hobbyists and professional growers since 1923 . 
 Although it has been called a " sentimental favorite " at farmers ' markets , it is not expected to become a major commercial variety because its flavor is not as neutral as more popular grapes , such as Thompson Seedless , Crimson Seedless , or Flame Seedless . However , Ramming predicted that it would become a specialty item , much like the Muscat varieties , due to its distinctive , Concord @-@ like flavor . Because of its strong reception at farmers ' markets , it could compete with Concord and <unk> varieties in eastern markets , according to Ramming . 
 = = Availability = = 
 The Foundation Plant Services ( FPS ) at the University of California , Davis indexed Thomcord and found it to be free of known viruses . The FPS offers certified virus @-@ free propagation material . The FPS also deposited genetic material in the National Plant Germplasm System , which offers material for research , including development and commercialization of new cultivars . The ARS does not offer Thomcord plants for distribution . 
 Thomcord is a public variety and is not restricted in its propagation and distribution . 
 = NSB Class 64 = 
 NSB Class 64 ( Norwegian : NSB type 64 ) is a class of three electric multiple units built by Strømmens Værksted for the Norwegian State Railways . Delivered in 1935 , they were built for the opening of the Hardanger Line and served there until 1985 , when the line closed and the trains were retired . They also periodically served on the Flåm Line . The delivery consisted of three motor cars and four carriages , with each train consisting of up to three units . The motor cars were 16 @.@ 3 meters ( 53 ft ) long , had a power output of 464 kilowatts ( 622 hp ) and were capable of 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) . The motor units were given road numbers 505 through 507 . Two of the units have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Club and are at Garnes Station . 
 = = History = = 
 The Hardanger Line opened in 1935 as a steep and curvy branch of the Bergen Line to connect Bergen to the Hardangerfjord . The line was 27 @.@ 45 kilometers ( 17 @.@ 06 mi ) long , had a maximum gradient of 4 @.@ 5 percent , a minimum curve radius of 180 meters ( 591 ft ) , a maximum speed of 40 km / h ( 25 mph ) , a maximum permitted axle load of 12 tonnes ( 12 long tons ; 13 short tons ) , standard gauge and a 15 kV 16 2 ⁄ 3 Hz AC electrification system . In 1931 , NSB had taken delivery of its first electric multiple unit , the Class 62 , for use on commuter trains on the Drammen Line . For the Hardanger Line , NSB ordered similar units , but these were modified to have a higher power output . Three motor cars and four carriages were delivered in 1934 . The mechanical components and assembly were done by Strømmens Værksted , while the electrical equipment was made by Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri ( NEBB ) . The class was similar to the future Class 65 , and was regarded as a prototype . Class 64 were the shortest multiple units ever used by NSB . 
 From 21 November 1944 , when the Flåm Line received electric traction , Class 64 trains were also used there . The Flåm Line is even steeper and more curved than the Hardanger Line , so the trains received track brakes . In 1947 , El 9 locomotives were delivered for the Flåm Line . Class 64 trains continued to be used periodically on the Flåm Line when there was insufficient availability of El 9s , as well as in periods with very little or very much traffic . 
 Unit 64 @.@ 07 was retired on 20 December 1982 after rust damage had been found on it . By 1984 , the carriages were in such bad shape that they needed to be replaced . Trailers from Class 65 and Class 67 were taken into use , and for a short period a Class 91 trailer . On 28 August 1985 , passenger traffic on the line was terminated and the two remaining trains were retired . Reasons for the termination included a lack of sufficient political support for financing new trains , and also that Class 64 was no longer suitable for use . The last two trains have been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Club and are stored at Garnes Station , part of the Old Voss Line . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The units each had four NEBB <unk> motors , giving a combined power output of 464 kilowatts ( 622 hp ) . They had an overall length of 16 @.@ 3 meters ( 53 ft ) , weighed 35 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 34 @.@ 9 long tons ; 39 @.@ 1 short tons ) and had a Bo @-@ Bo wheel arrangement . The motor cars had a capacity for 38 passengers and a maximum speed of 50 km / h ( 31 mph ) . Because of the steep gradients , the units had a low weight combined with high power output , and had both track brakes and dynamic braking . They were originally given road numbers <unk> though <unk> , but this was later changed to 64 @.@ 05 through 64 @.@ 07 . 
 = Varaha = 
 Varaha ( Sanskrit : <unk> , " boar " ) is the avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu in the form of a boar . Varaha is listed as third in the Dashavatara , the ten principal avatars of Vishnu . When the demon Hiranyaksha stole the earth ( personified as the goddess Bhudevi ) and hid her in the primordial waters , Vishnu appeared as Varaha to rescue her . Varaha slew the demon and retrieved the Earth from the ocean , lifting it on his tusks , and restored Bhudevi to her place in the universe . 
 Varaha may be depicted completely as a boar or in an anthropomorphic form , with a boar 's head and human body . His consort , Bhudevi , the earth , is often depicted as a young woman , lifted by Varaha . The earth may be depicted as a mass of land too . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 Like Vishnu 's first two avatars - Matsya ( fish ) and Kurma ( turtle ) , the third avatar Varaha is depicted either in zoomorphic form as an animal ( a wild boar ) , or <unk> . The main difference in the anthropomorphic form portrayal is that the first two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and the bottom half as animal , while Varaha has an animal ( boar ) head and a human body . The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha ( portrayed as a lion @-@ headed man ) , who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal . 
 In the zoomorphic form , Varaha is often depicted as a free @-@ standing boar colossus , for example , the monolithic sculpture of Varaha in Khajuraho ( c . 900 @-@ 925 ) made in sandstone , is 2 @.@ 6 metres ( 8 ft 6 in ) long and 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 5 ft 7 in ) high . The sculpture may not resemble a boar realistically , and may have his features altered for stylistic purposes . The earth , personified as the goddess Bhudevi , clings to one of Varaha 's tusks . Often the colossus is decorated by miniature figurines of gods and goddesses and other world creatures appearing all over his body , which signify the whole of creation . Such sculptures are found in Eran , Muradpur , <unk> , Gwalior , Jhansi and <unk> . 
 In the anthropomorphic form , Varaha often has a stylized boar face , like the zoomorphic models . The snout may be shorter . The position and size of the tusks may also be altered . The ears , cheeks and eyes are generally based on human ones . Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced the issue of how to attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck . However , in Badami , the problem was resolved by including a human neck . While some sculptures show a mane , it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others . Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right ; there are very rare instances of left @-@ facing Varaha depictions . 
 Varaha has four arms , two of which hold the Sudarshana chakra ( discus ) and shankha ( conch ) , while the other two hold a gada ( mace ) , a sword , or a lotus or one of them makes the <unk> ( gesture of blessing ) . Varaha may be depicted with all of Vishnu 'a attributes in his four hands : the Sudarshana chakra , the shankha , the gada and the lotus . Sometimes , Varaha may carry only two of Vishnu 's attributes : a shankha and the gada personified as a female called Gadadevi . Varaha is often shown with a muscular physique and in a heroic pose . He is often depicted triumphantly emerging from the ocean as he rescues the earth . 
 The earth may be personified as the goddess Bhudevi in Indian sculpture . Bhudevi is often shown as a small figure in the icon . She may be seated on or dangling from one of Varaha 's tusks , or is seated on the corner of his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout , as being lifted from the waters . In later Indian paintings , the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha 's tusks . In Mahabalipuram , a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi , who he carries in his arms . The earth may be portrayed as a globe , a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings , temples , humans , birds and animals . The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha 's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha 's gada . Nagas ( snake gods ) and their consorts <unk> ( snake goddesses ) , residents of the underworld , may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion . Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures , denoting the cosmic waters . 
 Two iconographical forms of Varaha are popular . Yajna Varaha - denoting Yajna ( sacrifice ) - is seated on a lion @-@ throne and flanked by his consorts Bhudevi and Lakshmi . As Pralaya Varaha - indicative of lifting the earth from the stage of the pralaya ( the dissolution of the universe ) , he is dedicated only with Bhudevi . Varaha may be depicted with Lakshmi alone too . In such sculptures , he may be depicted identical to Vishnu in terms of iconography with Vishnu 's attributes ; the boar head identifying the icon as Varaha . Lakshmi may be seated on his thigh in such portrayals . 
 Varaha often features in the Dashavatara stele - where the ten major avatars of Vishnu are portrayed - sometimes surrounding Vishnu . In the Vaikuntha Vishnu ( four headed Vishnu ) images , the boar is shown as the left head . Varaha 's shakti ( energy or consort ) is the Matrika ( mother goddess ) Varahi , who is depicted with a boar head like the god . 
 = = Legends = = 
 The earliest versions of the Varaha legend are found in the Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Shatapatha Brahmana . They narrate that the universe was filled with the primordial waters . The earth was the size of a hand and was trapped in it . The god Prajapati ( the creator @-@ god Brahma ) in the form of a boar ( varaha ) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out . He also marries the earth thereafter . The Shatapatha Brahmana calls the boar as <unk> . The epic Ramayana and the Vishnu Purana - considered sometimes as the oldest of the Puranic scriptures - are the first to associate Varaha with Vishnu . Various Puranic scriptures including the Agni Purana , the Bhagavata Purana , the Devi Bhagavata Purana , the Padma Purana , the Varaha Purana , the Vayu Purana and the Vishnu Purana narrate the legend of Varaha with some variations . 
 The gate @-@ keepers of Vishnu 's abode Vaikuntha , Jaya and Vijaya are cursed by the four <unk> , sages who roam the world in the form of children , to be born as asuras ( demons ) . They are born on earth as Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu to the sage Kashyapa and his wife <unk> and were one of the <unk> , a race of demons originating from <unk> . The demon brothers are manifestations of pure evil and create havoc in the universe . The elder brother Hiranyaksha practises tapas ( austerities ) and blessed by Brahma with a boon that makes him indestructible by any animal or human . He and his brother torment the inhabitants of earth as well as the gods and engage in war with the latter . Hiranyaksha takes the earth ( personified as the goddess Bhudevi ) and hides her in the primordial waters . In some versions of the tale , the earth gives a loud cry of distress as she is kidnapped by the demon ; in others , she assumes the form of a cow and appeals to Vishnu to rescue her from the clutches of the demon . In some variants , the distressed gods led by Brahma along with the sages go to Vishnu for help . In some versions , the kidnap of the earth by Hiranyaksha is dropped . Instead , the earth sinks on her own to <unk> ( underworld ) due to the weight of the mountains or due to the torture of the demons . 
 Since Hiranyaksha had not included the boar in the list of animals that would not be able to kill him , Vishnu assumes this form with huge tusks and goes down to the primordial ocean . In the Bhagavata Purana , Varaha emerges as a tiny beast ( a size of a thumb ) from the nostrils of Brahma , but soon starts to grow . Varaha 's size increases to that of an elephant and then to that of an enormous mountain . The scriptures emphasize his gigantic size . The Vayu Purana describes Varaha as 10 yojanas ( The range of a yojana is disputed and ranges between 6 – 15 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 3 mi ) ) in width and a 1000 yojanas in height . He is large as a mountain and blazing like the sun . Dark like a rain cloud in complexion , his tusks are white , sharp and fearsome . His body is the size of the space between the earth and the sky . His thunderous roar is frightening . In one instance , his mane is so fiery and fearsome that Varuna , the god of the waters , requests Varaha to save him from it . Varaha complies and folds his mane . 
 In the ocean , Varaha encounters Hiranyaksha , who obstructs his path and challenges him for a duel . In some versions , the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him not to touch earth . Ignoring the demon 's threats , Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks . Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace . The two fiercely fight with maces . Finally , Varaha slays the demon after a thousand @-@ year duel . Varaha rises from the ocean with the earth in his tusks and places her gently above it in her original position , as the gods and the sages sing Varaha 's praises . 
 Further , the earth goddess Bhudevi falls in love with her rescuer Varaha . Vishnu - in his Varaha form - marries Bhudevi , making her one of the consorts of Vishnu . In one narrative , Vishnu and Bhudevi indulge in vigorous embraces and as a result , Bhudevi becomes fatigued and faints , sinking a little in the primordial ocean . Vishnu again acquires the form of Varaha and rescues her , reinstating her in her original position above the waters . Some scriptures state that Bhudevi gives birth to Varaha 's son , an asura called <unk> . 
 The scripture Varaha Purana is believed to be narrated by Vishnu to Bhudevi , as Varaha . The Purana is devoted more to the " myths and genealogies " connected to the worship of Vishnu . 
 Some Saiva Puranas narrate a tale in which the god Shiva defeats Varaha . In Kalika Purana , Varaha had amorous dalliance with Bhudevi . He and his three boar sons then create mayhem in the world , which necessitates Shiva to take the form of Sharabha , to kill Varaha . Vaishnava scriptures not only refute this story , some texts also speak of Vishnu 's " ugra <unk> " Gandaberunda eventually killing the Sharabha . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 Varaha was originally described as a form of Brahma , but later on was crystallized as the avatar of Vishnu . The earliest Varaha images are found in Mathura , dating to the 1st and 2nd century CE . The cult of Varaha seems to have been popular in the Gupta era ( 4th @-@ 6th century ) in Central India , considering the large number of Varaha sculptures and inscriptions found . A red sandstone sculpture of Varaha in boar form with an inscription is traced to the reign of <unk> ( late 5th to early 6th century CE ) . Early sculptures of Varaha generally depict him in his boar form . Anthropomorphic depictions of Varaha with human body and boar ’ s head become popular in the later period . Other early sculptures exist in the cave temples in Badami in Karnataka ( 6th century ) and Varaha Cave Temple in Mahabalipuram ( 7th century ) ; both in South India and Ellora Caves ( 7th century ) in Western India . In the Udayagiri Caves ( Cave 5 ) in Madhya Pradesh , an image of Varaha rescuing the earth sculpted in sandstone ( dated to 401 @-@ 450 CE ) is seen ; and a <unk> image from 8th century from Bago @-@ <unk> is now with the Archeological Museum at Gwalior . By 7th century , images of Varaha were found in all regions of India . By the 10th century , temples dedicated to Varaha were established in Khajuraho ( existent , but worship has ceased ) , Udaipur , Jhansi ( now in ruins ) etc . 
 In the first millennium , the boar was worshipped as a symbol of virility . The Chalukya dynasty ( 543 – 753 ) was the first dynasty to adopt Varaha in their crest and minted coins with Varaha on it . The Gurjara @-@ Pratihara king <unk> Bhoja ( 836 – 885 CE ) assumed the title of Adi @-@ varaha and also minted coins depicting the Varaha image . Varaha was also adopted as a part of royal insignia by the Chola ( 4th century BCE – 1279 CE ) and Vijayanagara Empires ( 1336 – 1646 CE ) of South India . In Karnataka , a zoomorphic image of Varaha is found in a carving on a pillar in Aihole , which is interpreted as the Vijayanagara emblem , as it is seen along with signs of a cross marked Sun , a disc and a conch . 
 However , the boar and its relative the pig started being seen as polluting since the 12th century , due to Muslim influence on India . Muslims consider the pig and its meat unclean . This led to a decline in Varaha worship to a certain extent . 
 = = Symbolism = = 
 In the Vishnu Purana , Varaha represents yajna ( sacrifice ) , as the eternal upholder of the earth . His feet represent the Vedas ( scriptures ) . His tusks represent sacrificial stakes . His teeth are offerings . His mouth is the altar with tongue of sacrificial fire . The hair on his head denotes the sacrificial grass . The eyes represent the day and the night . His coarse hair represents sexual prowess . The head represents the seat of the Brahmin ( priest ) . The mane represents the hymns of the Vedas . His nostrils are for oblation . His joints represent the various ceremonies . The ears are said to indicate rites ( voluntary and obligatory ) . Thus , Varaha is the embodiment of the Supreme Being who brings order amidst chaos in the world by his sacrifice . 
 Varaha symbolizes the resurrection of the earth from a pralaya ( dissolution of the universe ) and the establishment of a new kalpa ( aeon ) . Symbolism also attributes that evolution from water could relate to the geological phenomenon of the tectonic age . It could also represent the rescue of earth from “ false cults ” . 
 = = Temples = = 
 The oldest Varaha temple is located in Jawad , Madhya Pradesh which was built in 11th century named Nav Toran Temple . Nav or Nou means Nine and Toran means Pillars , this is where temple gets its name . It is said that there is a tunnel beneath the temple that goes to the <unk> Fort and Maharana Pratap used to come through that tunnel often to worship the deity of the temple . 
 The most prominent temple of Varaha is the Sri <unk> Temple in Tirumala , Andhra Pradesh . It is located on the shores of a temple pond , called the Swami <unk> , in Tirumala , near Tirupati ; to the north of the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple ( another temple of Vishnu in the form of Venkateswara ) . The region is called Adi @-@ Varaha <unk> , the abode of Varaha . The legend of the place is as follows : at the end of Satya Yuga ( the first in the cycle of four aeons ; the present one is the fourth aeon ) , devotees of Varaha requested him to stay on earth , so Varaha ordered his mount Garuda to bring his divine garden <unk> from his abode Vaikuntha to Venkata hills , Tirumala . Venkateswara is described as having taken the permission of Varaha to reside in these hills , where his chief temple , Tirumala Venkateswara Temple , stands . Hence , pilgrims are prescribed to worship Varaha first and then Venkateswara . In the Atri Samhita ( <unk> ) , Varaha is described to be worshipped in three forms here : Adi Varaha , Pralaya Varaha and Yajna Varaha . The image in the sanctum is of Adi Varaha . 
 Another important temple is the <unk> Temple in <unk> town , to the northeast of Chidambaram , Tamil Nadu . It was built in the late 16th century by Krishnappa II , a Thanjavur Nayak ruler . The image of Varaha is considered a <unk> ( self manifested ) image , one of the eight self @-@ manifested <unk> Vaishnava kshetras . An inscription in the <unk> ( circumambulating passage around the main shrine ) quoting from the legend of the <unk> <unk> ( a local legend ) mentions the piety one derives in observing festivals during the 12 months of the year when the sun enters a particular zodiacal sign . This temple is venerated by Hindus and Muslims alike . Both communities take the <unk> murti ( festival image ) in procession in the annual temple festival in the Tamil month of Masi ( February – March ) . The deity is credited with many miracles and called Varaha <unk> by Muslims . 
 Varaha shrines are also included in Divya Desams ( a list of 108 abodes of Vishnu ) . They include Adi Varaha Perumal shrine <unk> , located in the Kamakshi Amman Temple complex , Kanchipuram and <unk> , 15 km from Mahabalipuram . 
 In Muradpur in West Bengal , worship is offered to an in @-@ situ 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 ft 2 in ) zoomorphic image of Varaha ( 8th century ) , one of the earliest known images of Varaha . A 7th century anthropomorphic Varaha image of <unk> is still worshipped in a relatively modern temple . Other temples dedicated to Varaha are located across India in the states of Andhra Pradesh , Haryana Pradesh at <unk> Kalan , Karnataka at <unk> and Kallahalli , Kerala , Madhya Pradesh , Odisha at Yajna Varaha Temple , and Lakhmi Varaha Temple , Rajasthan at Pushkar , Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh . 
 = The Lodger ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " The Lodger " is the eleventh episode of the fifth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on BBC One on 12 June 2010 . It was written by Gareth Roberts , who based the story on his 2006 Doctor Who Magazine comic strip " The Lodger " . 
 The episode features the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) stranded on Earth and separated from his companion Amy Pond ( Karen Gillan ) , when an unknown force prevents his time travelling spaceship , the TARDIS , from landing . To investigate , he moves into the flat of Craig Owens ( James Corden ) and attempts to fit in with ordinary humans while unknowingly playing matchmaker for Craig and his good friend Sophie ( Daisy Haggard ) . 
 Showrunner Steven Moffat was a fan of Roberts ' original comic strip and enthused him to adapt it into an episode for the series . While some elements of the comic strip remain , Roberts wrote most of it from scratch . " The Lodger " replaced a slot held by an episode that was pushed back due to budgetary constraints and was consequently one of the last to be filmed . The episode was watched by a final 6 @.@ 44 million viewers , the least @-@ watched episode of the fifth series of Doctor Who . However , it achieved the joint highest Appreciation Index of the series at the time of broadcast and received positive to mixed reviews from critics . Praise was given to the acting of Smith and Corden , but reviewers expressed disappointment over the resolution .

 After stepping out of the TARDIS in modern @-@ day Colchester , the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air , and the TARDIS , Amy still inside , dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to <unk> . With Amy 's help , the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house . The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant , Craig Owens , in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature . Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again , but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor . 
 Over two days , the Doctor attempts to adapt to human life . He learns about Craig , an office worker with little aspiration to move onward . Craig is stuck in a platonic relationship with his co @-@ worker , Sophie . The Doctor becomes overly involved in Craig 's life , becoming the star player in Craig 's local football club , filling in for him at the call centre when Craig falls ill , and encouraging Sophie to follow her dream of traveling overseas to help animals . Craig , who has not yet professed his love for Sophie , becomes upset ; he accosts the Doctor and demands that he leave , which forces the Doctor to reveal his history and his reason for being in the flat . 
 Sophie arrives while they argue and is lured upstairs ; the Doctor and Craig follow , learning from Amy that Craig 's building has never had a second floor . Inside , they find an alien ship housing a primitive time engine . The ship crashed some time ago and has used a perception filter to disguise itself as part of Craig 's house . The ship 's emergency holographic program has been drawing in passersby , all who have a desire to escape , to find a replacement pilot for itself , but they were killed in the attempt . The machine identifies the Doctor as a possible pilot and tries to draw him to the controls , but the Doctor warns that if he should touch the controls , the ship could explode and take the solar system with it . The Doctor convinces Craig to touch the controls since he does not want to leave due to his love for Sophie , which will counteract the ship 's protocols . Craig does so , and he and Sophie admit their love and share a kiss that breaks the ship 's hold on the Doctor and themselves . The three escape in time to see the perception filter turn off and the ship implode , leaving Craig 's undamaged one @-@ story flat below . 
 Craig and Sophie thank the Doctor , Craig giving him a spare set of keys in case he ever needs it . Aboard the TARDIS , the Doctor directs Amy to write the note that led him to Craig 's house , using a red pen in his jacket ; she rummages around and finds the engagement ring from her husband @-@ to @-@ be , Rory , whom she had forgotten after he was consumed by the crack in space and time and erased from existence . A similar crack appears behind Craig 's refrigerator , and widens .

 On Craig 's fridge is a postcard advertising the Van Gogh exhibit at the Parisian Musée d 'Orsay , which the Doctor , Amy and Van Gogh himself visited in the previous episode . At the end of the episode , the Doctor instructs Amy to leave him a note with Craig 's address , which his younger self had at the start of the episode . Amy is shown leaving the note in the series finale , " The Big Bang " , when the Doctor 's timeline rewinds and he revisits points in his past . The spaceship control room reappeared in " The Impossible Astronaut " / " Day of the Moon " , where it was connected to the Order of the Silence . Corden returned to play Craig in the episode " Closing Time " of the next series , Gareth Roberts ' sequel to this story .

 " The Lodger " is based on a short comic strip of the same name , written by Gareth Roberts for Doctor Who Magazine issue 368 in 2006 . The comic features the Tenth Doctor , who spends several days staying in Mickey Smith 's flat , waiting for Rose Tyler and the TARDIS to catch him up in a few days , and by chance saving the Earth by hiding it from the passing space fleet of a violent alien race . The story was based on ideas that Roberts had since a child to imagine the Doctor experiencing everyday human life and his enjoyment of stories set on Earth rather than in space . Roberts ' original comic strip appealed to new executive producer Steven Moffat , who enthused to Roberts that he had " got to do " " The Lodger " as an episode . Roberts had previously had the idea to make the television version , but he had never mentioned it . Roberts considered " The Lodger " less an adaptation than was previously done by Paul Cornell for " Human Nature " / " The Family of Blood " , taken from Cornell 's novel , and instead wrote most of the episode from scratch . 
 Elements of the comic 's story carry over into the episode , such as his confusion between a sonic screwdriver and a toothbrush , and the Doctor 's aptitude at football . However , Roberts said that the episode was " a completely different situation " from the comic strip , as the Doctor did not know Craig as he did Mickey , and there was the added enemy of the upstairs apartment . When Roberts began writing for the episode , he knew the series ' overarching plot but was not aware who was to be cast as the Eleventh Doctor . Roberts based the Doctor 's lines on those written in Moffat 's completed scripts and further characterization was added by Matt Smith 's reading of the lines . 
 The episode also contains several cultural references . When the Doctor is having a shower , he is heard singing " La donna è mobile " , which his third incarnation sang in Inferno . When the Doctor introduces himself to the time ship 's Avatar , he claims to be " Captain Troy Handsome of International Rescue , " which is a reference to both Captain Troy Tempest from Stingray and International Rescue from Thunderbirds , both series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson . Steven Cooper of Slant Magazine also saw a reference to the Emergency Medical Hologram the Doctor from Star Trek : Voyager , as the Doctor continued " Please state the nature of your emergency . " 
 " The Lodger " made up the seventh and final production block of the series along with " Amy 's Choice " . The read @-@ through for both episodes took place on 17 February 2010 in the Upper Boat Studios . The story replaced another one , " The Doctor 's Wife " , when the latter was pushed back to the next series due to budgetary constraints . Location filming took place in Cardiff in early March 2010 . The house in which Craig has his flat is in Westville Road , and the location for the football match was Victoria Park ; the play area there had previously been used as a location in " Forest of the Dead " . Matt Smith performed his own athletics in the football match shots ; he has had previous experience as a youth footballer , having played for the youth teams of Northampton Town , Nottingham Forest and Leicester City before a back injury turned him towards acting . As such , little choreography was needed for the sequence .

 " The Lodger " was met with positive to mixed reviews from critics . Gavin Fuller , writing for The Daily Telegraph , called the episode " a delight " , " thoroughly enjoyable " and " often amusing " . In particular he praised Corden and Haggard for avoiding the usual " cliches of romcom " , and Smith 's portrayal of The Doctor as almost @-@ but @-@ not @-@ quite human . However , he expressed some disappointment that the origin of the lurking time machine was not explained . Dan Martin of The Guardian called it " one of the strongest episodes of the year " . He praised the acting of Smith and Corden , but wondered why the Doctor did not use his usual alias of " John Smith " when posing as a human . 
 Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern praised Corden and Smith , but said it did not " quite tick [ his ] boxes " . He was not engaged by the upstairs villain , wished for more " laugh @-@ out @-@ loud moments than good @-@ humoured banter " and disliked that the Doctor seemed " diminished " when thrown into the everyday atmosphere . In a review for IGN , Matt Wales rated it 7 out of 10 and referred to it as " one of the fluffier episodes " in terms of plot , but he said it was an " enjoyable little duck @-@ out @-@ of @-@ water adventure " . He called Smith " an absolute joy to watch " and said that Corden and Haggard " [ acquitted ] themselves admirably " . However , he criticised the " more traditional Who elements " , such as the alien threat that the directing left " devoid of almost all tension " , Amy 's occasional appearances that did not seem to gel with the rest of the story , and the short resolution , where " the whole thing collapsed into an incomprehensible muddle " . 
 SFX magazine 's Russell Lewin gave " The Lodger " three and a half out of five stars , saying it was " brimming with witty dialogue " and was a " pleasant diversion " before the finale . He ranked it " mid @-@ table " among the other episodes of the series . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded it an A- , saying it was a " funny outing " that allowed Smith to show comic depth as the Doctor , as well as praising the guest stars . Though he referred to the alien up the stairs as a " pretty standard @-@ issue " , he liked it for being a metaphor of " the trap of complacency and the ways staying in a rut can lead to safety , stagnancy , and ignorance of the peril encroaching just outside one 's four walls " . 
 = Matriarch of the Blues = 
 Matriarch of the Blues is an album by Etta James , released in December 2000 through the record label Private Music . The album 's title reflects James ' nickname as " matriarch of the blues " . Marking James ' return to blues following attempts at country music and jazz and pop standards , the album consisted primarily of rhythm and blues covers . James ' sons , Donto and Sametto , are credited as engineers , mixers and producers , among other contributions ; the album features Mike Finnigan on the Hammond organ , guitarist Leo Nocentelli , and performances on multiple instruments by Jimmy Zavala . 
 Matriarch of the Blues received mixed critical reception . Following its release , the album reached a peak position of number two on Billboard 's Top Blues Albums chart . Billboard 's final issue for 2001 included Matriarch as number ten on its list of Top Blues Albums for the year . The album was nominated for Best Contemporary Blues Album at the 44th Grammy Awards .

 Entertainment Weekly considered Matriarch of the Blues to be James ' reclamation as the " mother of the blues " following recent attempts at country music and jazz and pop standards . Rolling Stone grouped Matriarch in a " trifecta " with James ' previous two studio albums , Life , Love & the Blues ( 1998 ) and Heart of a Woman ( 1999 ) . Prior to the album 's release , James performed at the eighteenth annual San Francisco Jazz Festival at the Masonic Auditorium . The concert lasted over three house and featured an eight @-@ piece band , members of which included her sons Donto and Sametto . 
 Matriarch is composed of rock , soul and blues standards between five and seven minutes in length . People magazine contributors described James ' vocals as " deeply funky " . Mike Finnigan performed the Hammond B3 organ , Leo Nocentelli featured on guitar , and Jimmy Zavala contributed performances on multiple instruments . James ' two sons — Donto and Sametto — produced and engineered , and played drums and bass , respectively . 
 The album begins with the sound of a motorcycle engine . Bob Dylan 's " Gotta Serve Somebody " is delivered , according to Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone , with " the air of Old Testament @-@ style authority it demands " . James does not modify the lyrics , singing " You can call me Bobby , you can call me Zimmy " . " Don 't Let My Baby Ride " , originally by Deadric Malone and O. V. Wright , adds a bit of sensuality to the album with the line " If his jeans are too tight ... you might see what you like . " Other covers include Al Green 's " Rhymes " , " Try a Little Tenderness " ( Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly , Harry M. Woods ) , and Otis Redding 's " Hawg for Ya " . The tempo of The Rolling Stones ' " Miss You " is slowed down to a " sensual simmer " . James modified the gender mentioned in the lyrics , singing " Puerto Rican boys just dying to meet you " . Following " Hawg " are Malone 's " You 're Gonna Make Me Cry " , which features vocals by Finnigan , Sandy Jones ' " Walking the Back Streets " , and Benny Latimore 's " Let 's Straighten It Out " . Closing the album are John Fogerty 's " Born on the Bayou " , " Come Back Baby " ( Ray Charles , Lightnin ' Hopkins ) , and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller 's " Hound Dog " .

 Matriarch of the Blues received mixed critical reception . Allmusic 's Matthew Robinson wrote that James " coast [ ed ] " through the album and the backing band lacked " youthful vitality " . Robinson thought the album 's opening track " Gotta Serve Somebody " came across more as a " sleepy suggestion " . However , he felt the " <unk> pace and intermittent woofs " in " Miss You " added sex appeal and complimented the " <unk> " of " Born on the Bayou " and " Hound Dog " . Associated Press contributor Gene Bright wrote a positive review of the album but was disappointed with James ' cover of " Miss You " , writing " the song just can 't be slowed and manipulated with any success " . People magazine contributors felt that the motorcycle introduction was unnecessary and considered the album to be more " full @-@ throated gospel @-@ rock " than blues . However , they wrote that James sounded " as sexy and full of sass as she did nearly half a century ago " . With James ' sons contributing to the album , Bill Milkowski of JazzTimes called the album a " real family affair " and " worthy follow @-@ up " to Heart of a Woman . In his review for Out , Barry Walters complimented Donto and Sametto 's rhythm performances . Walters admitted that James all of the notes available to her in the 1960s but wrote that her " interpretive abilities are sharper than ever " . 
 The Morning Call 's Larry Printz published a negative review , concluding that James ' performance was mediocre and that the " nuances in [ her ] once @-@ formidable voice are long gone " . Printz also criticized the slow tempo throughout the album and accused James of " coasting " on her legendary status . James Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly wrote that James ' " voice isn 't quite the nasty snarl it once was , but the attitude remains " . Sullivan thought " Hound Dog " was the album 's best composition . Rolling Stone 's Marie Elsie St. Léger wrote that James provided a " healthy dose of rootsy feminism and mettle " with her " passionately seasoned and gravel @-@ edged voice " . St. Léger also complimented James and her performance for having " inimitable depth " and for " making no apologies and needing no permission to sing it like she feels it . " Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone named " Don 't Let My Baby Ride " , " Hawg for Ya " and " Come Back Baby " as the album 's greatest tracks . In his review , Puterbaugh concluded that the album is a " solid return to roots " , allowing James the right to reclaim her titular throne .

 = Æthelred , Lord of the Mercians = 
 Æthelred , Lord of the Mercians ( or Ealdorman Æthelred of Mercia ; died 911 ) became ruler of English Mercia shortly after the death of its last king , Ceolwulf II in 879 . His rule was confined to the western half , as eastern Mercia was then part of the Viking @-@ ruled Danelaw . Æthelred 's ancestry is unknown . He was probably the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881 , and soon afterwards he acknowledged the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex . The alliance was cemented by the marriage of Æthelred to Alfred 's daughter Æthelflæd . 
 In 886 Alfred took possession of London , which had suffered greatly from several Viking occupations ; as it had traditionally been a Mercian town , he handed control to Æthelred . In 892 the Vikings renewed their attacks , and the following year Æthelred led an army of Mercians , West Saxons and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of <unk> . He spent the next three years fighting them alongside Alfred 's son , the future King Edward the Elder . At some time in the decade 899 to 909 , Æthelred 's health may have declined , and Æthelflæd may have become the effective ruler of Mercia . 
 After Æthelred 's death , Æthelflæd ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918 . The couple 's only child , a daughter called Ælfwynn , then ruled briefly until deposed by her uncle , King Edward . 
 = = Background = = 
 Mercia was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century , and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by King Egbert of Wessex at the Battle of Ellandun in 825 . Egbert briefly conquered Mercia , but it recovered its independence in 830 , and thereafter the two kingdoms became allies , which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings . The Mercians traditionally held overlordship over Wales , and in 853 King Burgred of Mercia obtained the assistance of King Æthelwulf of Wessex in an invasion of Wales in order to reassert their hegemony . The same year , Burgred married Æthelwulf 's daughter . 
 In 865 the Viking Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia , and used it as a starting point for an invasion . The East Anglians were forced to buy peace , and the following year the Vikings invaded Northumbria , where they established an obscure Northumbrian man called Egbert as puppet king in 867 . They then moved on to Nottingham in Mercia , where they spent the winter of 867 – 868 . Burgred was joined by King Æthelred of Wessex and his brother , the future King Alfred , for a combined attack on the Vikings , but they refused an engagement and in the end the Mercians bought peace with them . The following year , the Vikings conquered East Anglia . They returned to Mercia in 872 ; two years later they expelled Burgred , and Ceolwulf became king with their support . Ceolwulf was described by the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle as " a foolish king 's thegn " who was a puppet of the Vikings , but the historian Ann Williams regards this view as partial and distorted : he was accepted as a true king by the Mercians and by King Alfred . 
 In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia , taking the eastern part for themselves and leaving Ceolwulf with the west . The Vikings went on to attack Wessex , leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales . At almost the same time as Alfred 's victory over the Vikings in 878 at the Battle of Edington , Ceolwulf defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr , king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd . After Ceolwulf 's disappearance in 879 , Mercia began to fall under the hegemony of Wessex . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Early rule = = = 
 Æthelred 's descent is unknown , and he does not appear to have been closely related to his immediate predecessors , although his name suggests possible descent from earlier Mercian kings . He may have been related to King Alfred 's Mercian father @-@ in @-@ law , Æthelred <unk> , and brother @-@ in @-@ law , Æthelwulf , who appears to have been a member of Æthelred 's court from the mid 880s . Æthelred may have been the man of the same name who attested two Mercian charters in the late 860s , but he is not listed in the two surviving charters of Ceolwulf . Lists of witnesses to charters show that Æthelred 's witan ( council ) shared bishops and at least two ealdormen with Ceolwulf , but Ceolwulf 's thegns all disappeared . In the view of Ian Walker : " He was a royal ealdorman whose power base lay in the south @-@ west of Mercia in the former kingdom of the Hwicce around Gloucester . " 
 It is not known when Æthelred took over following Ceolred 's death or disappearance , but in the view of Thomas Charles @-@ Edwards , a historian of medieval Wales , Æthelred was almost certainly " <unk> Long @-@ Hair " , the leader of a Mercian army which invaded Gwynedd in 881 , and was defeated by Rhodri Mawr 's sons at the Battle of the Conwy . This was described by Welsh annals as " revenge by God for Rhodri " . The defeat forced Æthelred to abandon his ambitions in north Wales , but he continued to exercise overlordship over the south @-@ eastern Welsh kingdoms of Glywysing and Gwent . According to Alfred 's Welsh biographer Asser , Æthelred 's " might and tyrannical behaviour " forced these kingdoms to submit to the protection of King Alfred 's lordship . By 883 , Æthelred had accepted Alfred 's lordship . Charles @-@ Edwards suggests that in 881 – 882 he tried to maintain his dominance in south @-@ east Wales , but Alfred offered his protection to Glywysing and Gwent , and in 882 – 883 Æthelred accepted that West Saxon power made continued independence impossible . Charles @-@ Edwards comments : 
 The implication of all this is that the Mercian submission to Alfred – a crucial step in the creation of a single English kingdom – occurred not just because of one battle , Alfred 's victory over the Great Army at Edington in 878 , but also because of another , more distant battle , " God 's revenge " on the Mercians at the Conwy , when Anarawd of Gwynedd and his brothers defeated Æthelred and so brought about that collapse of the Mercian hegemony in Wales from which Alfred was only too pleased to benefit . 
 When Æthelred made a grant to Berkeley Abbey in 883 , he did it with the approval of King Alfred , thus acknowledging Alfred 's lordship . Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred 's permission , but issued some charters in his own name without reference to Alfred , such as at a meeting in Risborough in Buckinghamshire in 884 , showing that English Mercia extended quite far south @-@ east towards London . 
 After the Battle of Edington in 878 , Alfred established a network of fortified settlements , called burhs , in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks , and when Æthelred accepted Alfred 's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia . One of the burhs was Worcester , where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town 's defences . Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen . 
 London suffered severely from Viking attacks and was several times occupied by Viking armies . In 886 Alfred took possession of London , and according to Asser he " restored " the city and " made it habitable again " . He then handed control to Æthelred . Historians , however , disagree about the circumstances . According to Frank Stenton , Alfred recovered London by force from the Vikings and handed it to Æthelred because it had previously been a Mercian town , and he respected the traditions of other kingdoms . Marios <unk> takes a similar view , arguing that Alfred 's decision was probably due to the need to maintain unity among the English who were outside Viking territory . Alfred Smyth suggests that the Chronicle 's account reflects bias in Alfred 's favour , and that Æthelred took charge because he had a greater role in London 's recovery than the West Saxon chronicler was willing to admit . Some versions of the Chronicle state that Alfred besieged London in 883 , and Simon Keynes argues that Alfred probably took London at that time and that the " occupation " in 886 may have been a restoration of London 's defences following Viking attacks close to the city in 885 . 
 Anglo @-@ Saxon London , called Lundenwic , was located a mile west of Roman Londinium , but Lundenwic was undefended , and the restoration was carried out inside the walls of the old Roman city , especially an area close to the River Thames now called <unk> , but which was then known as Æthelred 's Hythe after its Mercian ruler . Æthelred moved quickly to restore the area ; in 889 he and Alfred granted property there to the Bishop of Worcester , and in 899 they made another grant to the Archbishop of Canterbury . Both bishops were , like Æthelred , Mercians and strong allies of King Alfred , who had the right to all tolls from markets along the river bank . 
 After the restoration of London , Alfred received the submission of " all the English people who were not under subjection to the Danes " , and the alliance between Wessex and Mercia was cemented by the marriage of Æthelred to Alfred 's oldest daughter , Æthelflæd . She is first recorded as Æthelred 's wife in a charter of 887 , but Keynes thinks that the marriage may have taken place two or three years earlier , and the historian Maggie Bailey dates it to between 882 and 887 , with the most likely political context being the occupation of London in 886 . Æthelred was probably much older than his wife . They had a daughter , Ælfwynn , and according to the twelfth century chronicler , William of Malmesbury , she was their only child . In King Alfred 's will , drawn up in the 880s , Æthelred was left a sword worth 100 mancuses . 
 In 892 , two Viking armies attacked eastern England , and Æthelred took part in the defence . After the defeat of one Viking leader , Hastein , Alfred became godfather to one of Hastein 's two sons and Æthelred to the other . Soon afterwards , the English captured Hastein 's wife and children , but they were returned to him because the sons were <unk> of the English leaders . In 893 , Æthelred brought troops from London to join Alfred 's son Edward against a Viking army at Thorney in Buckinghamshire , but the Vikings were too strong for a direct attack so they were allowed to leave English territory . Later in the year , a larger Viking force marched from Essex through Mercia to the Welsh border , followed by Æthelred with a joint force of Mercians and West Saxons . Welsh kings joined Æthelred to meet the Vikings at the Battle of <unk> , where according to Smyth " these invaders were utterly routed ... in what was the most decisive battle in the war " , although Marios <unk> states that the Vikings eventually cut their way out and retreated back to Essex . The Viking army finally dispersed in 896 . For much of the time , Alfred had been in the west country defending Devonshire , and in the view of Richard Abels : " King Alfred had little to do directly with the great victories enjoyed by the English in 893 – 896 . His son , Edward , and his ealdormen , in particular his son @-@ in @-@ law , Æthelred , had won the glory . " 
 In the last years of the ninth century , three sub @-@ ealdormen ruled Mercia under Æthelred . Æthelflæd 's uncle , Æthelwulf , controlled western and possibly central Mercia , while the south and east were ruled by Æthelfrith , the father of Æthelstan Half @-@ King . <unk> was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw . Æthelwulf and <unk> are not recorded after the turn of the century , and Æthelfrith may have been Æthelflæd 's chief lieutenant when Æthelred 's health collapsed soon afterwards . Keynes sees Æthelfrith as an ealdorman of West Saxon origin , probably appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south @-@ east Mercia . 
 Evidence from charters show that Æthelred and Æthelflæd supported religious communities . In 883 they freed Berkeley Abbey from obligations to the king 's <unk> ( payments in kind ) , and in 887 they confirmed the possession of land and transferred manpower to <unk> Minster in Oxfordshire . In 901 they gave land to Much Wenlock Abbey , and donated a gold chalice weighing thirty mancuses in honour of its former abbess , Saint <unk> . In 903 they negotiated a settlement over a former monastic estate which the bishops of Worcester had been trying to recover since the 840s , and Bishop <unk> wrote " we never could get anywhere until Æthelred became lord of the Mercians " . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 Some historians believe that at an unknown time in the decade 899 to 909 , Æthelred 's health collapsed and Æthelflæd became the effective ruler of Mercia . Cyril Hart and Maggie Bailey believe that it occurred by 902 . Bailey cites " Mercian Register " entries from 902 showing Æthelflæd acting alone or in conjunction with Edward in military operations . Irish annals called the Three Fragments also suggest that Æthelred was unable to take an active part in government from about 902 , although he did attend a meeting in 903 with King Edward , Æthelflæd and Ælfwynn . In 1998 Keynes suggested that Æthelred may have been incapacitated by illness at the end of his life , but in a summary of his career in 2014 Keynes does not mention this , stating that Æthelred and Æthelflæd cooperated with King Edward in campaigns against the Vikings . Martin Ryan also makes no mention of a decline in Æthelred 's health , describing him as joining Edward in encouraging thegns to purchase land in Viking territories . In Michael Livingston 's view , he campaigned with Edward in Northumbria in 909 , and may have died as a result of wounds sustained at the Battle of Tettenhall in 910 . 
 According to William of Malmesbury , King Edward 's eldest son , the future King Æthelstan , was sent to be brought up at the court of Æthelred and Æthelflæd after Edward remarried in about 900 . This is supported by one independent piece of evidence . According to a transcript dating from 1304 in York 's archives , in 925 Æthelstan gave a grant of privileges to St Oswald 's Priory in Gloucester " according to a pact of paternal piety which formerly he pledged with Æthelred , ealdorman of the people of the Mercians " . When King Edward died in 924 , Æthelstan initially faced opposition at the West Saxon court , but was accepted as king in Mercia . 
 After Æthelred 's death in 911 , Æthelflæd ruled as " Lady of the Mercians " , but she did not inherit the Mercian territories of London and Oxford , which were taken by Edward . Æthelflæd died in 918 , and their daughter Ælfwynn briefly ruled Mercia until deposed by Edward the Elder , who took the territory under his direct control . 
 = = = St Oswald 's Priory , Gloucester = = = 
 Gloucester seems to have been the main seat of Æthelred 's and Æthelflæd 's power , and before 900 they founded a new minster there , dedicated to St Peter . In 909 a West Saxon and Mercian army raided Viking territory and seized the bones of the Northumbrian king and martyr , St Oswald , from Bardney in Lincolnshire . The bones were translated to the new Gloucester minster , which was renamed St Oswald 's Priory in his honour . Both Æthelred and Æthelflæd were buried there . The historian Martin Ryan sees the new minster as something like a Mercian royal mausoleum , to replace the one at Repton destroyed by the Vikings . 
 = = Æthelred 's status = = 
 Æthelred 's status is unclear , and this is reflected in the varying titles given to him by different historians . He is sometimes called " ealdorman " , but also " Lord of the Mercians " and " subking " . Coinage issued in English Mercia in Ceolred 's time named him as king , but in Æthelred 's time it named the West Saxon king , yet Æthelred issued some charters in his own name , implying royal authority . West Saxon sources refer to him as an ealdorman , emphasising Mercian subordination to the West Saxon monarchy , whereas Mercian ones describe him as Lord of the Mercians , and Celtic ones sometimes as King of Mercia . The late tenth @-@ century chronicler Æthelweard , who used sources independent of surviving versions of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , called him " King of the Mercians " . 
 King Edward 's influence over Mercia is unclear , and he may have had less power than his father . Edward 's charters show Æthelred and Æthelflæd as accepting his royal authority , but their own charters make no reference to an overlord , and some use expressions such as " holding , governing and defending the sole rule of the Mercians " , which come close to describing them as king and queen . 
 Pauline Stafford comments that " Alfred 's dominance in the 890s over Æthelred , Lord of the Mercians , was as debatable at the time as it still is . " In the view of Ann Williams , " though he accepted West Saxon overlordship , Æthelred behaved rather as a king of Mercia than an ealdorman " , and Charles <unk> states that Mercia remained an independent kingdom until 920 . To the Welsh and Irish looking east , Mercian rulers still kept all their old regality until Æthelflæd 's death in 918 , and Nick Higham argues that : " Celtic visions of Æthelred and Æthelflæd as king and queen certainly offer a different , and equally valid , contemporary take on the complex politics of this transition to a new English state . " 
 Keynes takes the West Saxon view , arguing that Alfred created the " kingdom of the Anglo @-@ Saxons " , inherited by his son Edward the Elder in 899 , and Æthelred ruled Mercia under the king . Keynes points out that according to Asser , the Welsh king Anarawd submitted to Alfred on the same terms as Æthelred — " Namely that in every respect he would be obedient to the royal will " . Keynes regards the designation " K. [ King ] Æthelred II " in the Handbook of British Chronology as a " delightfully provocative " extension of the " received wisdom " that Mercia retained a real measure of independence in Æthelred 's time . However , Keynes also says : 
 Æthelred usually acted with the permission of or in association with King Alfred , but occasionally he acted independently of him . Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman , his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces , for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal . In other words , there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings , and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity ; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an <unk> world . 
 = Pinkham Notch = 
 Pinkham Notch ( elevation 2032 ft . / 619 m ) is a mountain pass in the White Mountains of north @-@ central New Hampshire , United States . The notch is a result of extensive erosion by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Wisconsinian ice age . Pinkham Notch was eroded into a glacial U @-@ shaped valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential , Wildcat , and Carter @-@ Moriah ranges . Due to the volatility of the area 's climate and rugged character of the terrain , a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout the notch . 
 The notch was discovered in 1784 by Jeremy Belknap , but its isolation prevented further development for several years . The construction of New Hampshire Route 16 has led to increased accessibility and a rise in tourism . Its location makes it a hub for hiking and skiing . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The notch separates the Presidential Range , which forms the western wall , from the Wildcat Range , which forms the eastern wall . Two rivers drain the notch ; the Ellis River drains the south end and is a tributary of the Saco , and the Peabody River drains the north end and is a tributary of the Androscoggin . 
 The bulk of the western slope of the notch is formed by Mount Washington , the highest peak in the northeast United States , reaching 6 @,@ 288 feet ( 1 @,@ 917 m ) above sea level . Mount Washington rises more than 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) above the floor of the notch . A number of glacial cirques are found on this side of the notch . The Great Gulf and its tributary cirques form the largest cirque in the White Mountains . South of the Great Gulf is Huntington Ravine , with a rocky , precipitous headwall renowned for its rock and ice climbing . The slope then dips into the Ravine of Raymond Cataract , a non @-@ glacial " V @-@ shaped " valley with a notable waterfall . After this comes Tuckerman Ravine , with a uniform , smoother headwall that is known for its high @-@ quality skiing . After passing the Gulf of Slides , a smaller and lesser @-@ known cirque , the notch opens up and continues until Jackson . 
 The eastern slope of the notch consists of the Wildcat and Carter @-@ Moriah Ranges , slightly lower than the Presidential Range to the west . The Wildcat Range consists of five peaks , named A , B , C , D , and E from northeast to southwest in order of height . Wildcat A is the highest , at 4 @,@ 422 feet ( 1 @,@ 348 m ) . From the main ridge , the slopes drop very steeply , but not precipitously , to the floor of the notch . The Wildcat Mountain Ski Area occupies the western slopes of Wildcat up to the col between D and E peaks . As the notch rounds E peak , the slope becomes extremely steep , and Wildcat Ridge begins to drop to the end of the notch . 
 The Carter @-@ Moriah Range lies to the north of Wildcat Ridge , forming the eastern side of Pinkham Notch all the way to the Androscoggin River . From south to north , the peaks overlooking the notch are Carter Dome ( 4 @,@ 832 ft / 1 @,@ 473 m ) , Mount Hight ( 4 @,@ 675 ft / 1 @,@ 425 m ) , South Carter Mountain ( 4 @,@ 420 ft / 1 @,@ 347 m ) , Middle Carter Mountain ( 4 @,@ 600 ft / 1 @,@ 402 m ) , North Carter Mountain ( 4 @,@ 530 ft / 1 @,@ 381 m ) , Imp Mountain ( 3 @,@ 720 ft / 1 @,@ 134 m ) , and Mount Moriah ( 4 @,@ 049 ft / 1 @,@ 234 m ) . 
 = = Environment = = 
 The climate , and as a result , the flora and fauna , of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation . As elevations increase on the walls of the notch , climate and ecosystems change to those of increasingly northern occurrence . Biomes range from a low @-@ elevation northern hardwood forest at the base of Mount Washington to alpine @-@ Arctic vegetation near the summit comparable to vegetation found at the latitude of Labrador . 
 = = = Below 2500 ft . — Northern hardwood forest = = = 
 The lowest elevations of Pinkham Notch are occupied by a northern hardwood forest . This forest type is primarily deciduous and consists mostly of sugar maple , American beech , and yellow birch . There is also a proliferation of understory and forest floor plants ; common examples include wild sarsaparilla , painted trillium , <unk> , and Indian cucumber @-@ root . 
 The northern hardwood forest also contains the greatest diversity of animal life in the notch . Mammals include chipmunks , raccoons , white @-@ tailed deer , black bears , and moose . There are also a large number of birds in this forest ; frequently seen are red @-@ eyed vireos , hermit thrushes , and ovenbirds . Amphibians are also found in the northern hardwood forest . Red <unk> , the terrestrial stage of development for the red @-@ spotted newt , congregate in large numbers after heavy rains ; also present are American toads , spring peepers , and wood frogs . 
 At around 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) , species from higher forest zones begin to mix with the northern hardwoods in what is known as the " transition zone " . As elevation within this zone increases , species from the lower hardwood forest begin to drop out . By 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 760 m ) , yellow birch is the only deciduous species that remains , and the forest becomes a spruce @-@ fir forest . 
 = = = 2500 ft. to 4000 ft . — Spruce / fir forest = = = 
 As elevation increases , the forest is subjected to colder temperatures , increased moisture , and acidic , infertile soils . As a result , conifers , or " softwoods " become the dominant species . Two trees , red spruce and balsam fir , are present throughout this zone , with paper birch , striped maple and mountain ash present in its lower levels . Like the hardwood forest below it , the spruce @-@ fir forest also holds understory plants ; commonly found are wood sorrel , Indian pipes , Canada <unk> , and <unk> lilies . Fungi are also common in the moist environment . 
 Most of the animals in the spruce @-@ fir forest have ranges that extend into the balsam fir forest higher up . Warblers are abundant ; more than ten species exist in this forest type . Other common birds include brown @-@ capped chickadees , spruce grouse , and yellow @-@ capped woodpeckers . Mammals include the red squirrel and the pine marten . 
 = = = 4000 ft. to timberline — Balsam fir forest = = = 
 As elevation continues to increase , only the hardiest trees remain in the forest , which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir . Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce @-@ fir zone , however , can be found in this forest . Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations , and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them . 
 In the upper reaches of the balsam fir zone , winds and temperatures are extreme enough to force the trees into stunted , " bonsai @-@ like " shapes . Known as krummholz , from the German word for " crooked wood " , trees in this area are often bent into bizarre shapes by the combined effects of wind , temperature , and airborne ice particles . Branches that are perpendicular to the prevailing winds are often killed , leaving " flag trees " that point in the direction of the wind . Eventually , conditions become extreme enough to prevent any tree growth ; the elevation at which this occurs is known as tree line , and usually occurs at around 4 @,@ 500 ft ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) in the White Mountains , depending on wind exposure . 
 = = = Above timberline — The alpine zone = = = 
 On the highest slopes of the west wall of the notch , trees are unable to grow , and an " alpine zone " of alpine @-@ Arctic vegetation exists . Vegetation in this zone tends to be lichens , sedges or small , low @-@ lying plants that can resist the constant exposure to the wind . Most plants in this area are perennial ; the growing season is far too short to allow for annuals . 
 Alpine plants usually occur in communities spaced between barren talus slopes . Cushion @-@ shaped <unk> lapponica usually grows in communities in the windiest areas , and in less exposed sites sedge , heath , snowbank , and alpine bog communities can be found . 
 = = History = = 
 Pinkham Notch was originally a riverine , " V @-@ shaped " valley until the Laurentide Ice Sheet shaped it into its current form , a " U @-@ shaped " valley . This shaping occurred during the Wisconsinian Ice Age , 25 – 50 @,@ 000 years ago . The geology of the region became greatly altered by this event ; much of the weaker rock was stripped from the region , leaving only highly @-@ resistant mica schist . As the glaciers retreated , a layer of glacial till was deposited , including several glacial erratics . A notable glacial erratic in the area is Mount Washington 's Glen Boulder . 
 The notch first appears in recorded history in 1784 , when an expedition led by Jeremy Belknap camped in the notch before ascending to the summit of Mount Washington through Huntington Ravine . Pinkham Notch was far more isolated than neighboring Crawford Notch ; as a result , the first settler of Pinkham Notch came in 1827 , 43 years after habitation of Crawford Notch . The first settler , Hayes Copp , built a homestead in the then @-@ uninhabited area , near where the Dolly Copp campground stands today . Copp and his wife lived alone in the wilderness until Daniel Pinkham completed the first road through the notch between in 1836 , finally providing a link between the Copp homestead and civilization . In 1851 , a railroad was built to Gorham , and a hotel , the Glen House , was constructed to accommodate passengers . Mount Washington was the main attraction in the area ; a bridle path was constructed from the Glen House to hotels on the summit , which was later improved into what would become the Mount Washington Auto Road . Completion of the road in 1861 led to a massive increase in tourism . 
 Meanwhile , logging began in the Pinkham area . After almost total deforestation of the White Mountain region , the White Mountain National Forest was created in 1911 , and the Mount Washington area was added to the national forest in 1914 . With the preservation of the area , emphasis shifted from logging to recreation . The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a logging camp near the height @-@ of @-@ land into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921 . The Appalachian Trail was built through the visitor center , making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington . Meanwhile , ski trails began to be constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps on Wildcat Mountain , and the ski resort was opened in 1958 .

 Pinkham Notch is easily accessible by New Hampshire Route 16 . Numerous opportunities for recreation exist in the area . 
 = = = Hiking = = = 
 Mount Washington is a common objective , and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch . There are numerous trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club 's visitor 's center . Although trail distances seem short , the trip to the summit should not be underestimated ; most trail approaches involve at least 4 @,@ 000 vertical feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) of climbing , including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder @-@ strewn upper slopes . Weather changes very quickly , and one must be prepared for extreme conditions . The Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most popular trail in the notch , ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman Ravine . The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire , making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington Ravine , where there are several rock climbing opportunities . 
 On the other side of the notch , the Wildcat Range is a popular objective . The five summits can be reached via the Wildcat Ridge Trail ; the first two miles are extremely difficult , and require skill on short , yet exposed , rock scrambles . This part of the trail is frequently bypassed by following the ski area 's Polecat Trail to the summit of D Peak . 
 The Appalachian Trail , which extends over 2 @,@ 150 miles ( 3 @,@ 460 km ) from Georgia to Maine , runs along the Presidential Range before crossing the notch and ascending to the summits of the Wildcat Range .
