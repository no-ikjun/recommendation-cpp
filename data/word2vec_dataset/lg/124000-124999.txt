 Conway dissuades members of the fandom , and Anthrocon membership in particular , from responding to the mass media and news media , due in part to sensationalist coverage like the 2001 Vanity Fair article in which he was quoted . In 2003 he said his standard response to the media was : " Anthrocon is a private event held on private property . Its membership is not interested in being the subject of your documentary . " 
 However , Conway relaxed this stance with Anthrocon 's move to Pittsburgh in 2006 . While no television , magazine or tabloid representatives were present , several newspapers were invited to attend , and did , including the Pittsburgh Tribune @-@ Review , the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette , and the Pittsburgh City Paper , which printed both a preview and an extensive review . When local television station KDKA @-@ TV showed up , Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel . In November 2006 he gave a radio interview to Dublin 's <unk> . Anthrocon still retains tight control over media access , not only to the convention grounds but to the membership , and has official policy that forbids unmonitored dealings with unauthorized members of the media . 
 = = = Storyteller = = = 
 Conway styles himself " <unk> 's Storyteller " , making annual appearances at Anthrocon in what has come to be known as Uncle Kage 's Story Hour . The entertainment typically consists of four or five extended personal anecdotes . His stage name resulted from his first storytelling experience at ConFurence in 1994 , and derives from his fandom name <unk> Goro ( Shadow Bug Goro ) , a reference to <unk> . 
 Conway is regularly invited to tell his stories at other fan conventions , including I @-@ <unk> , Eurofurence , <unk> , and Camp Feral ! . Gross sales from recordings of his Story Hours were over US $ 2600 in 2004 ; no profit was realized , as the intention was to increase membership and awareness of Anthrocon . 
 = = = Auctioneer = = = 
 Conway 's first auction was at Albany Anthrocon 1997 . Since then , he has presided over auctions which have raised over US $ 66 @,@ 000 for a variety of local wildlife charities at Anthrocon alone . He has performed similar services at other fan conventions , including Midwest <unk> . Conway says his techniques are influenced by Phil <unk> and Joe Mayhew ; they include humor and appeals to pity , novelty and scarcity . 
 = = = Author = = = 
 While known within the fandom for his spoken storytelling , Conway is also the author of several short stories published in various works by <unk> Press . 
 In May 1998 , Conway was invited to write a story based on his interest in birds of prey , particularly the Red @-@ tailed Hawk . The result was " <unk> in the Head " , published December 1999 in Flights of Fantasy . He next contributed to the first issue of <unk> , a fanzine mixing historical fiction with interaction between humans and anthropomorphic animals . " The Secret of <unk> " took place in Nazi Germany at the end of World War II , and was published in June 2001 . He went on to write " The Good Bird of Nanking " and " It Takes A Fox " for subsequent issues of the series . 
 For <unk> # 5 — a magazine of dramatic fiction — Conway submitted " Six " , a previously @-@ written work " based on a true story " involving wildlife rehabilitation from his days as a Red Cross volunteer . The story , illustrated by <unk> , was nominated for " Best Anthropomorphic Short Story " in the 2002 Ursa Major Awards . Also nominated that year was Breaking the Ice : Stories from New Tibet , a collection set in and around a subarctic mining colony ; Conway 's contribution , " Dead End " , features a bartending vulture who provides an introduction to the harsh , dystopic world .

 In 2012 , Conway learned that Fernando 's , a local restaurant , was going to be closing down due to financial trouble . Fernando 's had welcomed Anthrocon guests and furries since Anthrocon moved to Pittsburgh . After putting word out on Twitter and YouTube , over $ 21 @,@ 000 was raised in donations to keep the restaurant in business .

 While in college , Conway was a member of the <unk> <unk> vocal music group , and the performing arts honor society Pi Nu Epsilon . He became a volunteer for the American Red Cross Disaster Service in 1989 , but quit in 1998 due to his perception of high @-@ level corruption in the organization . He was an Emergency Management Coordinator while residing in Malvern , Pennsylvania . 
 In March 1990 , Conway became an experimental bone marrow donor for Mark Stevenson , a 4 @-@ year @-@ old with Hunter syndrome . The operation – the first of its kind involving an unrelated donor – was a success , allowing Mark to live to 24 . Conway became an active volunteer for the National Marrow Donor Program , claiming to have helped add over 500 entries to their donor registry . 
 Since May 1996 , Conway has participated in the <unk> Network , a free questions @-@ and @-@ answers resource organized by the medical school of Washington University in St. Louis . While most active in the period 1997 – 2000 , he remains a member as of 2009 . 
 = Hurricane Gordon ( 1994 ) = 
 Hurricane Gordon was a long @-@ lived and catastrophic late @-@ season hurricane of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season . The twelfth and final tropical cyclone of the season , Gordon formed in the southwestern Caribbean on November 8 . Without strengthening , the storm made landfall on Nicaragua . Later on November 10 , the storm began to strengthen as it tracked further from land , and it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon , the seventh named storm that season . Gordon also made landfalls in Jamaica and Cuba while a minimal tropical storm . It entered the southwestern Atlantic while resembling a subtropical cyclone . By the time it entered the Gulf of Mexico , it was fully tropical again . Tropical Storm Gordon later crossed the Florida Keys , and turning to the northeast it made landfall in Fort Myers , Florida . Gordon strengthened after it re @-@ entered the Atlantic Ocean , becoming a hurricane on November 17 . It briefly threatened North Carolina while turning to the northwest , although it turned to the south and weakened . Gordon deteriorated into a tropical depression and struck Florida again at that intensity on November 20 . It turned to the north and dissipated the next day over South Carolina . 
 Gordon first caused flooding in northern Costa Rica that destroyed 700 houses and caused $ 30 million in damage . There were six deaths in the country and an additional two deaths in neighboring Panama . Upon affecting Jamaica , the storm was responsible $ 11 @.@ 8 million in damage and four deaths . Damage was heaviest in Haiti , after a prolonged southwesterly flow dropped 14 in ( 360 mm ) of rainfall in a 24 ‑ hour period . The rains resulted in extensive mudslides and flooding that disrupted transportation and damaged 10 @,@ 800 houses , with another 3 @,@ 500 destroyed . There were 1 @,@ 122 deaths in the country , partially due to deforested hills , and damage was estimated at $ 50 million . In neighboring Dominican Republic , there were five additional deaths , as well as flooding near its capital . In Cuba , Gordon caused $ 100 million in damage , and 5 @,@ 906 houses were damaged or destroyed . Due to large @-@ scale evacuations , there were only two deaths in the country . In Florida , the storm caused $ 400 million in damage ( 1994 USD , $ 639 million 2016 USD ) , much of it agricultural , and there were eleven deaths , eight of them direct . Gordon later affected North Carolina with high waves , causing beach erosion and destroying five houses . Overall damage was $ 594 million due to Gordon ( 1994 USD , $ 948 million 2016 USD ) . 
 International governments and agencies through the United Nations sent relief supplies and monetary assistance to Haiti , following Gordon 's devastating impact there . American soldiers were already stationed in the country to restore ousted Jean @-@ Bertrand Aristide to presidency . The troops helped in rescues and worked to restore a damaged road between Port @-@ au @-@ Prince and Jacmel . Despite the damage , the name was not retired . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Gordon were from a tropical wave in the southwestern Caribbean Sea , which developed a circulation north of Panama early on November 6 . It gradually organized , becoming Tropical Depression Twelve on November 8 offshore eastern Nicaragua . Proximity to land prevented strengthening , and early on November 10 it made landfall near Puerto Cabezas , Nicaragua . Shortly thereafter , an upper @-@ level trough turned the depression to the northeast , and late on November 10 it intensified into Tropical Storm Gordon after reaching open waters . The circulation of the cyclone was initially very broad , covering much of the western Caribbean Sea , and wind shear prevented significant strengthening . Early on November 13 , Gordon struck Jamaica near Kingston as a minimal tropical storm , and later that day made landfall near Guantánamo Bay , Cuba . Around the time of Gordon crossing Jamaica , an upper @-@ level trough spawned a low @-@ level disturbance over the central Bahamas . From surface synoptic reports , the National Hurricane Center estimates Tropical Storm Gordon rapidly crossed Cuba and became the dominant system between Cuba and the Bahamas , but other meteorologists believe Gordon dissipated and that a second cyclone became the dominant system . The resultant storm north of Cuba became much larger , spreading rain across much of Florida . 
 A ridge to the north turned Gordon to the west @-@ northwest , and by November 14 the cloud pattern resembled that of a subtropical cyclone , with little convection near and the strongest winds well @-@ removed from the center . The storm paralleled the northern coast of Cuba and gradually developed convection near the center . On November 15 , the broad center crossed the Florida Keys near Key West . An approaching trough turned Gordon to the northeast , bringing it ashore near Fort Myers , Florida on November 16 with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Tropical Storm Gordon crossed the Florida peninsula in about nine hours , emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Vero Beach . As it reached the Gulf Stream , a small but intense area of convection developed over the center , and after the Hurricane Hunters reported flight @-@ level winds in excess of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) , Gordon attained hurricane status late on November 17 about 245 miles ( 345 km ) southeast of Cape Fear , North Carolina . Shortly thereafter , it reached peak winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) , and the trough that had turned the hurricane to the north was replaced by a ridge . Gordon turned abruptly northwestward , and was briefly expected to cross the Outer Banks as a minimal hurricane . The hurricane turned to the south and south @-@ southeast , weakening into a tropical storm due to stronger shear and drier air . On November 19 , the storm turned to the southwest and later to the west . Gordon weakened into a tropical depression before striking Florida again near Cape Canaveral on November 20 . It later turned to the north and dissipated over South Carolina on November 21 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 When Gordon was approaching Jamaica on November 12 , a tropical storm watch , and later warning , was issued for the island . The same day , a tropical storm warning was issued for southeastern Cuba from Camagüey to Guantanamo . On November 13 , a tropical storm warning was issued for the southwest peninsula of Haiti , and later that day the same warning was issued for the Bahamas . Due to the storm , 65 @,@ 000 people evacuated to safer locations in Cuba . Schools were closed in New Providence and Grand Bahama due to the storm , and Nassau International Airport was briefly shut down . A flight between Havana and Miami was canceled . In Cuba , officials forced 36 @,@ 518 people to evacuate their homes , and workers also moved 68 @,@ 780 livestock . 
 After Gordon emerged into the Atlantic north of Cuba , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas , and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast ; this was extended to Bayport on the west coast and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching the Florida Keys . When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest , a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina / Virginia border . Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state 's Emergency Operations Center . In the Florida Keys , state parks were closed , which forced some campers to leave , and all schools were closed . On the mainland , University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed . Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of Kennedy Space Center . The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport , and nearly all flights were canceled to and from the Florida Keys . Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east @-@ central Florida . In North Carolina , officials suggested people in low @-@ lying areas to go to higher ground , but they did not issue evacuation orders . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Although Gordon was a tropical storm for most of its existence , it caused enormous damage and loss of life . The United Nations estimated death toll in Haiti was 1 @,@ 122 . Six deaths were reported in Costa Rica , five in the Dominican Republic , two in Jamaica , two in Cuba , and eight in Florida . Property damage to the United States was estimated at $ 400 million ( 1994 USD , $ 639 million 2016 USD ) . Property damage statistics for the other affected areas are not available , but were reportedly severe in both Haiti and Cuba . The high death toll from Gordon made it the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane David in 1979 , which killed thousands in the Dominican Republic . 
 = = = Central America = = = 
 The first location affected by Gordon was Central America , when it briefly moved over northeastern Nicaragua as a tropical depression . Severe localized flooding occurred in Nicaragua , Panama , and most significantly Costa Rica . There , several days of heavy rainfall damaged about 180 mi ( 300 km ) of roads and bridges , mostly in rural areas . In <unk> in the northern portion of the country , the rains damaged beans and rice crops . More than 700 homes were destroyed , leaving about 4 @,@ 000 people homeless . Nationwide , the system killed six people and caused $ 30 million in damage . In Panama , the floods killed two people . 
 = = = Jamaica = = = 
 While passing south of Jamaica , Gordon dropped heavy rainfall , which caused flooding in six parishes , mostly in Clarendon and Saint Catherine . The rains caused flooding and mudslides that blocked roads . Gordon left $ 11 @.@ 8 million in damage , mostly in Clarendon . About half of the overall damage was related to roads , and an additional quarter was due to crop damage . There were four deaths and two injuries in the country . Two of the deaths were drownings . 
 = = = Hispaniola = = = 
 The broad circulation of Gordon produced a persistent southerly flow across Hispaniola , causing orographic lift in mountainous regions . This caused a prolonged period of heavy rainfall , reaching 14 in ( 360 mm ) in Les Cayes in a 24 ‑ hour period , and over 9 in ( 230 mm ) in the same duration in the capital city , Port @-@ au @-@ Prince . In Jacmel , Gordon dropped 13 in ( 330 mm ) in about 12 hours . The rains resulted in flooding and landslides across the country . There was knee @-@ deep flooding in the shantytown of Cité Soleil , and in Jacmel , the rains increased levels along three rivers . There , the storm washed out the road connecting with Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , and three bridges were destroyed . In Jacmel , 725 houses were destroyed , forcing 1 @,@ 500 people to stay at shelters . Gordon left portions of southeastern Haiti without water access . About 10 @,@ 800 houses were damaged to some degree , and an additional 3 @,@ 500 homes were destroyed . About 1 @.@ 5 million people were directly affected in the country , mostly near Port @-@ au @-@ Prince and in the southern portion , and more than 89 @,@ 000 people were left homeless . In Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , about 20 @,@ 000 homes were flooded , and the bridge connecting the city with northern Haiti was also flooded . Overall damage in the country was estimated at $ 50 million . 
 The floods and mudslides killed many people in Haiti , although the exact total will likely never be known . On November 19 , officials reported 531 deaths , and by two days later the total was potentially as high as 2 @,@ 000 . On November 24 , the death toll reached 824 , and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on December 21 that Gordon killed 1 @,@ 122 people in the country . Most of the deaths occurred in Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , Jacmel , and Léogâne . Damage was heavier in Haiti than elsewhere along Gordon 's track due to poor infrastructure consisting of shacks on flood @-@ prone denuded hills . The country suffers large death tolls from many hurricanes , caused in part by human activity . Large @-@ scale deforestation left Haiti with about 1 @.@ 4 % of its forests as of 2004 , leaving denuded mountain slopes that allows rainwater to wash down unimpeded . The lack of tree cover contributed to the devastating floods that caused most of Gordon 's deaths . 
 In neighboring Dominican Republic , Gordon caused flooding and landslides that disrupted travel and communications to the interior portions of the country . Several slums around Santo Domingo flooded . The storm killed five people in the country . 
 = = = Cuba and Bahamas = = = 
 Shortly after moving over Jamaica , Gordon crossed over eastern Cuba . At Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , a station recorded 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) sustained winds , with gusts to 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) during a microburst . The winds were not representative of the storm , and Gordon 's landfall intensity was estimated at around 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) . The storm caused widespread power outages and forced several roads to close . Damage was heaviest in Guantánamo Province , where 9 mi ( 17 km ) of seawalls and two aqueducts were destroyed . The storm damaged or destroyed 43 bridges , damaged 1 @,@ 106 mi ( 1 @,@ 779 km ) of roads , and wrecked 16 @.@ 5 mi ( 26 @.@ 5 km ) of rail lines . About 3 mi ( 5 km ) of underground electrical cables were damaged . There was heavy agricultural damage in southeastern Cuba , estimated at about $ 45 million . Gordon damaged 7 @,@ 482 acres ( 3 @,@ 028 hectares ) of sugar cane fields and damaged or destroyed about 5 @.@ 5 million banana trees . About 100 @,@ 000 sacks of coffee were wrecked , amounting to $ 3 @.@ 5 million in damage , and 50 @,@ 000 litres of milk were ruined . While Gordon was paralleling northern Cuba , it produced high seas that caused flooding , including in Havana . Nationwide , the storm damaged 5 @,@ 750 houses and destroyed 156 others . The cost of damage and reconstruction of homes and roads was $ 47 @.@ 4 million , and there was an additional $ 9 @.@ 5 million in damage to public buildings . Gordon killed two people in the country , which was kept to a minimum due to evacuations , and damage totaled $ 102 million . Two people were injured at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base . The flooding from Gordon followed two other similarly damaging events in the preceding year . 
 Gordon also affected the nearby Bahamas , producing 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) sustained winds at Kemps Bay , Andros . 
 = = = Florida = = = 
 In the Florida Keys , wind gusts up to 49 mph ( 79 km / h ) caused minor damage to trees and motor homes . Intense rainbands caused flooding in low @-@ lying and poorly @-@ draining areas , mostly in the upper Florida Keys . High tides closed portions of U.S. 1 . In the Tampa Bay area , outer rainbands downed power lines and trees , one of which fell onto a car . 
 While Gordon was moving across southern Florida , Virginia Key reported sustained winds of 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) , which was the highest in the state . Gusts reached 83 mph ( 134 km / h ) at a location in southern Dade County . Similar to the Caribbean , the storm dropped heavy rainfall in southern Florida , with widespread areas reporting over 6 in ( 150 mm ) in the eastern portion of the state . Rainfall peaked at 16 @.@ 1 in ( 410 mm ) in <unk> . High waves from Gordon severely eroded beaches along the state 's eastern coastline , and damaged coral and artificial reef systems . Waves flooded coastal roads up to 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) deep in Miami Beach , and also damaged seawalls . Near Fort Lauderdale , the storm washed a 508 ft ( 154 m ) cargo ship aground less than 150 ft ( 45 m ) from the beach . Several other boats sank or were beached , which prompted 37 rescues . One woman was rescued after being swept 3 @,@ 000 ft ( 910 m ) off a fishing pier in Boynton Beach . Gordon spawned six tornadoes in the state , of which two did no damage and two caused minor damage . A tornado in Lake Worth damaged 39 homes and two businesses . The most damaging tornado was an F2 in southern Brevard County , which originated as a waterspout and moved onshore near Barefoot Bay . It moved through a mobile home community , destroying 62 homes and damaging 227 others to some extent ; damage from the tornado was estimated at $ 10 million . The same tornado injured 40 people , causing six to be hospitalized , and killed an elderly man who died due to head trauma . 
 Across Florida , Gordon 's winds damaged power lines and knocked down trees and traffic signals ; about 425 @,@ 000 people lost power due to the storm . The rains caused flooding in Dade and Collier counties , which damaged $ 275 million worth of crops , mostly to vegetables and sugar cane . In some locations , the crop damage was worse than during Hurricane Andrew in 1992 , due to fewer crops being planted when Andrew struck the state . Along Elliott Key , Gordon damaged the coral reef system to a greater extent than Andrew . Inland flooding damaged buildings due to fast @-@ rising water and roof collapses . In Volusia County , floods entered 1 @,@ 236 buildings , causing $ 26 million in damage . Flooding caused dozens of roads to close , some of which were washed out . In the Everglades , flooding killed several deer . Statewide , two people drowned in separate instances after driving into flooded areas . Three people drowned along beaches , including one man who died in a rip current while attempting to rescue his son . In Hillsboro Inlet , two people drowned after their boat was overturned by high waves . Throughout Florida , Gordon directly killed eight people , and injured 43 people . There were also three indirect deaths ; two were from traffic accidents , and one was related to a heart attack after a person pushed a stalled car in a flooded road . Statewide damage was estimated at $ 400 million ( 1994 USD , $ 639 million 2016 USD ) . 
 = = = Remainder of United States = = = 
 After affecting Florida , Gordon produced rainfall along much of the eastern United States , extending as far north as New Jersey . In North Carolina , rainfall peaked at 4 @.@ 96 in ( 126 mm ) in New Holland , and in Virginia the highest rainfall total was 5 @.@ 25 in ( 133 mm ) near Norfolk . Sustained winds in the Hatteras , North Carolina area peaked at 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) in Buxton . Just offshore at Diamond Shoal Light , a station reported 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 71 mph ( 114 km / h ) . The hurricane produced tides of 2 @.@ 7 ft ( 0 @.@ 82 m ) above normal in Frisco . 
 High waves and tides resulted in significant beach erosion along the Outer Banks . The waves closed several portions of North Carolina Highway 12 for up to four days , and also closed a portion of U.S. Route 70 in eastern Carteret County . Heavy dune damage occurred on Ocracoke Island . North of Hatteras Village , the high waves washed out 225 ft ( 69 m ) of dunes , and portions of the Outer Banks between Hatteras and Frisco were flooded up to 2 @.@ 5 ft ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) deep . The effects were similar to that of the 1991 Perfect Storm , although damage was lighter during Gordon . The hurricane destroyed five homes in Kitty Hawk , which were condemned after being previously damaged by Hurricane Emily in 1993 . Also in Kitty Hawk , the storm damaged 52 houses and 2 businesses . In Rodanthe , two homes sustained water damage . The cost of the storm in the state was estimated at $ 314 @,@ 000 . Effects further south in North Carolina were lesser , although serious beach erosion was reported . 
 Offshore , a family of four required rescue from the Coast Guard after their boat began filling with water in the midst of 17 ft ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) surf . A 49 ft ( 15 m ) sailboat was disabled about 115 mi ( 185 km ) offshore Norfolk , Virginia , and the crew of three were also rescued by the Coast Guard . The sailboat was sailing from Bermuda to Oxford , Maryland , but was halted after the engine failed , the anchor was ripped off , and the mainstay was torn . The interaction between Gordon and a ridge over New England produced coastal flooding in eastern Virginia . Tides reached 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) above normal in Virginia Beach , which washed away 100 ft ( 30 m ) of a fishing pier . The high tides caused road damage and minor housing damage .

 In Costa Rica , President José María Figueres declared a state of emergency due to flooding in that country . He sought $ 15 million in aid from the Inter @-@ American Development Bank . The country 's government handled relief efforts through its Red Cross and federal and non @-@ governmental organizations . The government of Cuba issued an appeal to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for financial assistance ; as a result , the agency provided $ 30 @,@ 000 , and the United Nations Development Programme provided $ 50 @,@ 000 . The government of Luxembourg sent $ 37 @,@ 000 worth of construction materials , and the European Union sent $ 443 @,@ 000 to the country . 
 On November 16 , the government of Haiti issued an appeal to the international community for assistance . In response , agencies through the United Nations donated $ 735 @,@ 000 , including 20 @,@ 000 water units and 3 @,@ 000 blankets . The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs flew 30 tons of supplies , financed by Italy and Luxembourg . The European Union donated about $ 3 @.@ 8 million to the country , and various countries sent about $ 1 @.@ 8 million in cash or the equivalent thereof in relief items . The Canadian government donated $ 485 @,@ 000 , and the government of Japan sent $ 400 @,@ 000 in aid . The government of France provided blankets , clothing , and tarpaulins , and the United States sent 5 @,@ 000 blankets . In the days after the storm , the Haitian Army and international workers made emergency repairs to the road between Jacmel and Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , which was permanently reopened on November 25 . The Haitian government provided $ 3 @.@ 2 million to repair damage and assist those affected by the storm . The government sent about $ 112 @,@ 000 to cities to provide for clearing roads , housing repairs , and for the funerals of storm victims . Workers from the United Nations set up relief work in Port @-@ au @-@ Prince . Assistance quickly reached the ravaged town of Jacmel , including 116 tons of food , 9 tons of medicine , and clothing . Six soldiers from the United States Special Forces rescued 35 Haitians using an inflatable boat . About 100 soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division assisted in relief operations in Jacmel , rescuing hundreds of people . About 12 @,@ 000 United States troops were already in the country when Gordon struck to restore democracy under ousted president Jean @-@ Bertrand Aristide . 
 Due to the crop damage in Florida , the price of vegetables across the United States rose . There were about 25 @,@ 000 insurance claims following the storm 's passage . 
 Despite the devastation in Haiti and the extensive damage in Cuba and Florida , Gordon was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization in Spring of 1995 . Member nations of the World Meteorological Organization must send a delegate to the annual meeting to formally submit a request for tropical cyclone name retirement ; for unknown reasons , Haiti did not send a delegate to the Spring 1995 meeting . The World Meteorological Organization issued an official statement crediting Jamaica and Cuba 's warning infrastructure for the low loss of life there from Gordon , and blaming Haiti 's lack of such a system for the large number of deaths there .

 Travis Takashi Ishikawa ( born September 24 , 1983 ) is an American professional baseball first baseman in the San Francisco Giants organization . He stands 6 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 91 m ) tall and weighs 220 pounds ( 100 kg ) . He bats and throws left @-@ handed . Previously , he has played for the San Francisco Giants , the Milwaukee Brewers , the Baltimore Orioles , and the New York Yankees . Ishikawa has also filled in as an outfielder at times in his career . 
 Ishikawa grew up in Washington State . He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft by the San Francisco Giants out of high school . He made his Major League debut with the Giants in 2006 , but it was not until 2009 that he made it to the major leagues full @-@ time . He started 2009 as the Giants ' first baseman but failed to produce offensively and was replaced part of the season by Ryan Garko . However , on defense he was third in the National League ( NL ) in fielding percentage . In 2010 , he served as a pinch @-@ hitter and defensive replacement for the Giants and won a World Series ring as the Giants won the 2010 World Series . Ishikawa was designated for assignment at the end of spring training in 2011 and spent the entire season in the minor leagues . 
 In 2012 , Ishikawa signed with the Milwaukee Brewers , who used him mainly as a pinch @-@ hitter and defensive replacement . Ishikawa spent most of 2013 in the minor leagues , though he played six games for the Baltimore Orioles and one game for the New York Yankees . In 2014 he made the Pittsburgh Pirates Opening Day roster . However his bat wasn 't as hot as it was during Spring Training so the Pirates traded for 1B Ike Davis from the New York Mets and Ishikawa was designated for assignment . He was re @-@ signed by his former team the San Francisco Giants in April and started for them in left field during the 2014 playoffs . On October 16 , 2014 , Ishikawa hit a walk @-@ off three @-@ run home run to give the Giants their third National League pennant in five years by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals . 
 = = High school years = = 
 Ishikawa attended Federal Way High School in Federal Way , Washington , where he lettered in baseball , leading his team to the Washington State Class 4A Title as a junior in 2001 and to the title game as a senior in 2002 . He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants . The Giants gave him a $ 955 @,@ 000 bonus to prevent him from attending Oregon State University . The bonus was the highest back then for a non @-@ first @-@ round player , cued on by the organization 's approaching signing deadline . The Giants could afford to pay a 21st @-@ round pick that much because their higher picks had signed quickly for routine bonuses .

Through July 26 , he batted .269 with seven home runs and 30 RBI . On July 27 , the Giants traded for Ryan Garko from the Cleveland Indians , intending for him to replace Ishikawa at first base and provide more offense than Ishikawa had . However , Garko struggled to produce offensively , and at the end of August Ishikawa began making most of the starts at first for the rest of the year . On August 25 , he snapped a 2 – 2 tie with a game @-@ winning three @-@ run eighth @-@ inning home run against Jon Rauch as the Giants defeated Arizona 5 – 4 .

However , the acquisition of José Guillén on August 13 moved Huff back to first base , which returned Ishikawa to a utility role . Giants ' manager Bruce Bochy said , " [ Ishikawa ] ' s done a nice job . " 
 Ishikawa ended up hitting .266 with three home runs and 22 RBI in 116 games ( 158 at @-@ bats ) for the season . He batted .315 as a pinch @-@ hitter , which ranked seventh in the NL .

 = Mycena adonis = 
 Mycena adonis , commonly known as the scarlet bonnet , is a species of fungus in the Mycenaceae family . Found in Asia , Europe , and North America , it produces small orangish to reddish inedible mushrooms with caps up to 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter , held by thin pinkish @-@ white stems reaching 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) long . The fungus prefers to grow in conifer woods and peat bogs , suggesting a preference for acidic environments . The appearance of several atypical fruitings of Mycena adonis on deciduous wood in the Netherlands in the late 1970s was attributed to increases in atmospheric pollution that raised the acidity of the wood substrate . Mushrooms resembling M. adonis include M. acicula , M. aurantiidisca , and M. rosella . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first named Agaricus adonis in 1792 by Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard , and placed in Mycena by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821 . Rolf Singer successively moved it to Hemimycena ( 1943 ) , then Marasmiellus ( 1951 ) . Singer later changed his mind about these placements , and his 1986 Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy , he considered the species a Mycena ; the binomials resulting from the prior generic transfers are synonyms . 
 The mushroom is commonly known as the " scarlet bonnet " . Samuel Frederick Gray called it the " Adonis high @-@ stool " in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British Plants , while Mordecai Cubitt Cooke named it the " delicate Mycena " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap initially has a sharply conic shape , but expands to a narrow bell @-@ shape or a broad cone in maturity , typically reaching 0 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter . The cap margin , which is initially pressed against the stem , is opaque or nearly so at first . It is scarlet red when fresh and moist , becoming orange or yellowish orange before losing moisture . The mushroom is hygrophanous , and fades to an orange buff color when dry . The flesh is thin , the same color as the cap , fragile , and without any distinctive taste or odor . The gills are ascending @-@ adnate ( the gills attach at much less than a right angle , appearing to curve upward toward stem ) or attached by a tooth , subdistant to close , with 14 – 16 gills reaching the stem . Additionally , there are two or three tiers of lamellulae — short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem . The gills are narrow , and yellowish or with a reddish tinge at first ; the margins are paler and the same color as the faces . The stem is 2 – 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) long and 1 – 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 0 – 0 @.@ 1 in ) thick , and roughly equal in width throughout . It is tubular , fragile , initially pruinose ( covered with a fine powder ) , polished and smooth with age , pale yellow , becoming whitish , with the base often dirty yellow or brownish . Mycena adonis mushrooms are inedible . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spores are narrowly ellipsoid , nonamyloid , and measure 6 – 7 by 3 – 3 @.@ 5 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored and measure 20 – 22 by 6 – 7 µm . The cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia ( cystidia found on the edges and faces , respectively , of the gills ) are abundant and similar in shape and markings , 40 – 58 by 10 – 15 µm , tapering somewhat on either end and usually with a long needle @-@ shaped neck ( which is branched in some ) . The cystidia are generally smooth , but when dried material is mounted in potassium hydroxide for observation under light microscopy , an amorphous substance apparently holds spores and debris around the neck or apex , making them appear encrusted . The flesh of the gill is very faintly vinaceous @-@ brown when stained in iodine . The cap flesh has a thin , poorly differentiated pellicle with a region of slightly enlarged cells beneath it ; the remainder is filamentous , and the filamentous portion stains vinaceous @-@ brown in iodine . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 There are several other mycenas with which Mycena adonis could be confused . M. acicula is typically a smaller mushroom with a deep orange @-@ red cap rather than the typical bright salmon @-@ pink color of M. adonis . Since the colors and sizes of M. acicula and M. adonis are similar , a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between them , with spore size and shape being different . M. strobilinoides can be distinguished from M. adonis by its orange cap and amyloid spores . M. aurantiidisca can be distinguished from M. adonis by it lack of scarlet to pinkish tones in the cap and lack of gelatinized cortical hyphae . Mycena oregonensis is differentiated from M. adonis by its orange to yellow cap and lack of scarlet to pinkish tones . M. <unk> has a smaller fruit body , wider spores , a less intensely colored and less conical cap , and grows on the decaying wood of elm , ash , and alder . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 The fruit bodies of Mycena adonis grow solitarily or in groups in conifer forests , and appear in the spring and autumn . The fruit bodies grow in groups or scattered on needle beds under spruce and hemlock in the wet coastal conifer forests , or in the higher mountains , where it is not uncommon in the spring and autumn months . In one instance , fruit bodies were found growing on the deciduous trees Spanish Maple ( Acer <unk> ) and willow ( Salix alba ) near Amsterdam , Holland . It was hypothesized that the bark of these trees had become more acid in recent years because of increasing atmospheric pollution ( specifically , increases in the levels of sulfuric and nitric acid from industrial smoke ) , providing a more suitable substrate for the fungus . 
 The fungus is found in western North America , and in 2007 , it was reported from the valley of the Ussuri River in the northeast of China . It is also found in Europe ( Britain , Germany , Holland Scotland ) and the Canary Islands . Mycena specialist Alexander H. Smith has found the species in Washington , Oregon , and California . 
 = Chi ( Chobits ) = 
 Chi ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> ) is a fictional character in the manga series Chobits and its anime adaptation . Chi is a Chobit , a type of personal computer called a persocom that is far more technologically advanced than regular persocoms , and who are said to possess true machine intelligence rather than relying on software programs like other persocoms . She is found by Hideki , a high school graduate who has no idea about her unique abilities or of her past . Over the course of the series Hideki tries to discover what type of persocom Chi is , being told that she is something special . He finds her a job , and has to deal with her being kidnapped at one point . Chi learns about the things around her and what it means to be in love . At the end of the series , Chi finds the person " just for her " , and her forgotten identity is revealed , causing Hideki to confront his feelings . 
 In two interviews describing the series Chi 's creators , CLAMP , said it would be much easier if computers could speak to you when they had errors . Chi is voiced by Rie Tanaka in the anime and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart . The manga and anime follow Hideki 's find of Chi and their relationship , but differ in the storyline . Chi 's critical reception has been mostly positive , with reviewers calling her " cute " . In addition to Chobits , she is also a crossover character in the series Tsubasa : Reservoir Chronicle and is referenced in other works . 
 = = Concept = = 
 In an interview when describing Chi 's character , CLAMP member Satsuki Igarashi stated " Lately we 've been saying that the easiest to understand is <unk> from ' Chobits . ' Errors occur with computers . Things like ' Although it 's fine to speak the instructions ' and ' Please fix this problem here ' might be spoken in a cute voice . " In addition , an explanation for Chobits 's plot was given by Igarashi who stated : " Back then , when our computer had problems all we would get were these inscrutable error messages . However , we had no idea what was wrong because it wouldn 't tell us any more " . CLAMP also describes Chobits as a variation of the " boy living with mysterious girl " genre . Chi 's design as a personal computer resulted from Ohkawa 's wish to increase the sense of " emotional discomfort " around becoming emotionally involved with something considered to be merely a lifeless machine . 
 The name " Chobi " , came from the name of a cat at the place of Nekoi 's former employment , which the group made into " Chobits " , as the characters Elda and Freya were twins . In the series , CLAMP had Chi 's creator , Ichiro Mihara ( a character from their shared universe work Angelic Layer ) , use the word " Chobi " to describe anything he thought was " small and hopelessly adorable " ; two Chobi ( the sisters Elda and Freya ) become " Chobits " .

 Chi first appears atop a trash pile in an alley where she is found by Hideki <unk> , a high school graduate who knows very little about computers or the androids known as " persocoms " ( personal computers ) that have become the fashionable item to have in the city . Unlike other persocoms , her activation switch is located in an unusual place : her crotch . She has difficulty communicating with Hideki at first ; the only word that she says is " chi " , which becomes her given name , but slowly she learns how to speak . Having no memory of her past life , she is taught by Hideki to perform simple tasks . Hideki 's neighbor Shinbo and computer prodigy Minoru determine that Chi is no ordinary persocom , and may be a legendary " Chobit " , possessing synthetic intelligence . 
 At one point Hideki considers having to take on a second job due to his poor financial state . He is eventually able to convince his former employer <unk> Ueda to hire Chi at his bakery during his anniversary sale . Chi eventually finds herself kidnapped by Yoshiyuki Kojima . Yoshiyuki initiates a program that he had created especially for Chi , which is designed to break through her firewalls , and when he embraces and gropes her , Freya intervenes by binding him with wires connected to Chi and releasing a powerful , concussive blast . Hideki and Shinbo find her , and Freya vanishes , causing Chi to collapse from the energy used . She recovers and briefly reunites with Hideki , before losing consciousness . Shinbo then forces Yoshiyuki to transfer his persocom Kotoko 's registration to Hideki to prevent Yoshiyuki from deleting her memories , so that a record of his kidnapping exists . 
 Hideki later learns that before he found Chi , her name was Elda . After Ichiro 's wife , Chitose Hibiya , noticed that Freya — the first Chobit who was created to be the daughter she and her husband could never have — was becoming increasingly depressed as time went by , Elda was created to be her younger sister to cheer her up . Freya , however , had fallen in love with Ichiro , and the emotional pain of her unrequited love and her wish to not disturb her parents ' happiness eventually caused her to severely malfunction . Elda took Freya 's program , which included her mind and memories , into herself to preserve her memory . Before losing her own memories as a result of her actions , Elda requested to be left alone outside , away from her family , so that she would not have the possibility of suffering the same fate as her sister . Her father then gifted her with a program which will delete the recognition programs of all persocoms if she fails to find her soulmate , while her mother authored the children 's book series A City with No People , a story within a story about the relationships between persocoms and people , to help Chi in her quest . 
 Towards the end of the series , Zima and Dita , persocom agents for the Japanese government who know the outcome of Chi 's special program , arrive at Hideki 's apartment . A minor scuffle ensues between Dita and Chi , before Zima restrains Dita , wishing to see the outcome of Hideki 's decision and ultimately too falling under Chi 's influence . Hideki confirms his love for Chi , only to find that Freya has taken control of her body . Learning that he that he can never engage in sexual intercourse with Chi without rebooting her systems , erasing everything that makes her a unique individual , Hideki states that he will love Chi regardless . Freya confirms that while Chi and herself are indeed the legendary Chobits , they possess neither sentience nor emotions , but rely on software programs just like every persocom . Again , Hideki stands by his love for Chi . Hideki declines her offer to tell him about Chi 's special ability , and Freya vanishes after imploring him to take care of her sister . Chi awakens , embracing Hideki . The series ends with Chi holding Hideki 's hand with visible rings Chi had chosen for the two of them . 
 = = = In the anime = = = 
 Chi 's character is voiced by Rie Tanaka , and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart . The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same , but they differ slightly . These differences include the events in the ending , other things such as describing Elda 's memory loss , and her special program . In the anime for example , it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda 's memories after her husband 's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya 's program in . Another difference is the special program that was placed into Elda in the anime , this program appears to have an alternate effect . If Chi finds the Person just for her , all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion . The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms , he viewed them all as his children . His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return , all his children would be able to share in this happiness by being able to feel emotions the way humans do . 
 In the anime , an organization known only as " The Syndicate " is aware of Chi and her special programming . Under the impression that something terrible will happen if her program executes successfully , they send two persocoms , Zima and Dita , to destroy her . Towards the end of the series Chi tells Hideki of her love , asking if it is <unk> . Hideki responds with a yes , and they embrace briefly before Chi 's program executes . Chi floats up to the roof of the apartment and begins to run her program . Hideki makes his way on to the roof to save her . Chi is able to complete her program but chooses not to . She retreats inside herself , and Freya takes control as Chitose Hibiya arrives on the rooftop . 
 Freya explains how she came to inhabit Chi 's body . She reveals that she and Chi merely switched places inside the body , but Chi has shut herself away and Freya cannot contact her .

 = Defender ( 1981 video game ) = 
 Defender is an arcade video game developed and released by Williams Electronics in February 1981 . A horizontally scrolling shoot ' em up , the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts . Development was led by Eugene Jarvis , a pinball programmer at Williams ; Defender was Jarvis ' first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids . 
 Defender was one of the most important titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games , selling over 55 @,@ 000 units to become the company 's best selling game and one of the highest @-@ grossing arcade games ever . Praise among critics focused on the game 's audio @-@ visuals and gameplay . It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis ' best contributions to the video game industry , as well as one of the most difficult video games . Though not the first game to scroll horizontally , it created the genre of purely horizontal scrolling shooters . It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations . 
 There were many ports to contemporary systems , most of them by either Atari , Inc. or its software label for non @-@ Atari platforms , Atarisoft . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Defender is a two @-@ dimensional side @-@ scrolling shooting game set on the surface of an unnamed planet . The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain , flying either to the left or right . A joystick controls the ship 's elevation , and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons . The object is to destroy alien invaders , while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction . Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship . Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level . Failing to protect the astronauts , however , causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants . Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet . Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks . A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy , or hit by an enemy projectile , or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong ( as they randomly do ) . After exhausting all ships , the game ends .

 Defender was Williams Electronics ' first attempt at developing a new video game ; the company 's earlier game was a Pong clone . The popularity of coin operated arcade games in 1979 spurred the company to shift its focus from pinball games to arcade games . The company chose Eugene Jarvis , who had a successful record of Williams pinball games , to head development . Larry DeMar , Sam Dicker , and Paul <unk> assisted Jarvis . At the time , Williams had a small staff and the management was unfamiliar with technology used for its electronic games . As a result , the staff was afforded a large amount of creative freedom . 
 = = = Initial development = = = 
 Space was a popular setting for video games at the time , and Jarvis felt the abstract setting would help obscure simple graphics that lacked realism . Initially , Jarvis spent 3 – 4 months developing color variations of Taito 's Space Invaders and Atari 's Asteroids . First inspired by Space Invaders , he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics . After spending a few weeks on the design , however , the team abandoned the idea , believing it lacked enjoyment . Development then shifted to emulating Atari 's Asteroids , but hardware differences between Asteroids and Defender 's proposed specifications were problematic . Asteroids displays vector graphics on a special monitor , while the staff planned to use pixel graphics on a conventional monitor . The team experimented with recreating the game with pixel graphics , but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal . 
 Believing their first attempts to be too derivative , the developers held brain storming sessions . During a session , they agreed that one of Asteroids 's favorable elements was its wrapping effect . They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting , and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed . The game 's environment was made longer than the screen , with the visible area scrolling horizontally . Expanding on the idea , they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90 degrees . By changing the orientation of Space Invaders ' design , the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally . Large asteroids , an element from Asteroids , were then added to the game world , but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment . Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right ; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie , however , convinced him the game should be able to scroll in either direction . 
 After six months of development , the team felt the game had not made enough progress . They examined other games and concluded that survival was a necessary component to implement . To achieve this , they devised enemies to present a threat , the first of which was the " Lander " . Jarvis enjoyed violent , action entertainment , and wanted the game to have those elements . However , he felt the action should have a reasonable objective . Inspired by the 1960s television show The Defenders , Jarvis titled the game Defender , reasoning that the title helped justify the violence . He added astronauts to expand on the space theme and give players something to defend while they shot enemies . The element of flying over a <unk> was added after a brainstorming session between Jarvis and Ritchie . The landscape is depicted as a line only a pixel wide , primarily because the hardware was not powerful enough to generate anything more detailed . 
 = = = Later development = = = 
 By July , development was behind schedule and Jarvis 's superior began to pressure him to finish the game in time for an upcoming trade show , the AMOA , in September . Jarvis spent several weeks creating the astronauts , which his boss felt should be omitted if the process didn 't speed up . The pressure frustrated him to the point he considered resigning . Around that time , a new programmer named Sam Dicker was hired . He assisted programming the game and added visual and audio effects . For example , Dicker implemented a particle effect algorithm to generate unique explosions for destroyed enemies . The new elements re @-@ invigorated Jarvis , who felt the project began to show promise . 
 Development then shifted focus to the enemies . Landers were given the ability to capture humans , and a new enemy was devised from the mechanic : " Mutants " , captured humans that had turned hostile . The Mutants added a rescue element to the game that Jarvis believed made it more interesting to players and encouraged them to continue playing . The element of making a " comeback " from a dire situation was applied to the planet as well . Jarvis felt it mimicked the ups and downs of real life . " Bombers " , enemies which release floating bombs on the screen , were added next . More enemies were added to create different gameplay elements . " <unk> " and " Pods " were designed to attack the spaceship as opposed to the astronauts . " <unk> " were included to add pressure to the player by preventing them from lingering . The enemies quickly follow the spaceship to collide with it , and were based on a similar enemy in Asteroids . 
 By September , the game was still unfinished , and almost every Williams programmer assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show . The evening before the trade show , the arcade cabinets were delivered for display . The developers , however , forgot to create an attract mode — an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play — for the game , and began working on it that night . Early the next morning , the team created the final <unk> chips for the mode and installed them in cabinets . The chips , however , did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem . Once the attract mode was operational , Jarvis and the team returned to their homes to prepare for the show . After the show , the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely . The display model featured five levels , which the team felt was more than enough because of the game 's difficulty . Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis 's score of 60 @,@ 000 points seemed unbeatable to them . The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated . 
 = = = Hardware = = = 
 The game features amplified monaural sound and pixel graphics on a CRT monitor . A Motorola <unk> central processing unit handles the graphics and gameplay , while a Motorola 6800 microprocessor handles the audio . A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game 's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet . The cabinet artwork is stenciled on the wooden frame . 
 Development started by focusing on the game 's hardware . The staff first debated what type of monitor to use : black and white or color . They reasoned that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor . The developers estimated that the game would require 4 colors , but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16 colors . At the time , the designers believed that was more than they would ever need for a game . The monitor 's resolution is 320 × 256 , an expansion from the then industry standard of 256 × 256 . The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game 's presentation . Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics , but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language . The switch allowed them to display more on @-@ screen objects at a lower cost . 
 The game 's control scheme uses a two @-@ way joystick and five buttons . Jarvis designed the controls to emulate both Space Invaders and Asteroids simultaneously . The player 's left hand manipulates the joystick similar to Space Invaders and the right hand pushes buttons similar to Asteroids . The button functions also use a similar layout to Asteroids , with the button to shoot projectiles and accelerate on the far right and left , respectively . Jarvis reasoned that players were accustomed to the control schemes of past games , and felt altering past designs would prove difficult for them . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Initially , the game was slow to gain popularity . Defender did not attract much attention at the 1980 AMOA show . In retrospect , Jarvis believed many passersby were intimidated by its complexity . The game , however , was well received in arcades , and crowds gathered around the cabinet during its first nights of play testing . The success spurred Williams to release a cocktail version as well . Defender eventually became Williams ' best selling arcade game , with over 55 @,@ 000 units sold worldwide . By 2004 , the game was a popular collector 's item ; the upright cabinets were common , while the cocktail models were more rare . Since its release , it has become one of the highest grossing arcade games ever , earning over US $ 1 billion . Williams employee Larry Demar was surprised at the game 's popularity , stating that it was the only game he 'd seen able to earn that quantity of quarters . Six months after its release , the game was one of the top earners in the United States video game industry . Mark Stearny of <unk> magazine called Defender the most successful game in 1981 , commenting that it outperformed Pac @-@ Man . 
 The game garnered praise for its graphics , audio , and gameplay features . Gamespy 's David Cuciz lauded Defender 's challenging gameplay , commenting that it is representative of what other games should be . He described the graphics as " beautiful " , citing the varied sprites and flashing explosions . Matt Barton and Bill Loguidice of Gamasutra stated the audio @-@ visuals and gameplay 's depth balanced the excessive difficulty . They praised the game 's " catch and rescue " feature , as well as the minimap . Cuciz also praised the minimap , stating that the game is impossible without it and that it allows players to plan strategies . Author John Sellers praised the audio @-@ visuals and the connection between the game 's plot and gameplay . At the time of its release , Stan <unk> , director of marketing at then competitor Midway Manufacturing , described the game as " amazing " . In 2008 , Guinness World Records listed it as the number six arcade game in technical , creative , and cultural impact . That same year , Retro Gamer rated the game number ten on their list of " Top 25 Arcade Games " , citing it as a technical achievement and a difficult title with addictive gameplay . Also in 2008 , Edge ranked Defender the sixth best game from the 1980s . The editors described its design as very " elegant " despite a lack of narrative and characters . 
 Defender is often described as one of the most difficult games in the industry . Softline in 1983 wrote that it " remains one of the hardest arcade games ever developed . Initial attempts lasting less than ten seconds are not uncommon for novices " . GameDaily in 2009 rated Defender the ninth most difficult game , citing the attack and rescue gameplay . Author Steven L. Kent called it " one of the toughest games in arcade history " . He also stated that novice players typically are able to play only a few seconds , and that enthusiasts saw proficiency at the game as a " badge of honor " . David Cuciz echoed similar comments . Sellers described Defender 's difficulty as " humbling " , saying that few could play it with proficiency . He further stated , however , that players would continue to play despite the difficulty . Author David Ellis attributes the game 's success to its challenging design . Its difficulty is often attributed to its complex control scheme . Edge magazine called Defender " one of the most difficult @-@ to @-@ master " games , describing its controls as " daunting " . Retro Gamer writer Craig Grannell called the game and controls " ruthless " and " complex " respectively . 
 In 1983 Softline readers named the Atari 8 @-@ bit version fifth on the magazine 's Top Thirty list of Atari programs by popularity . The magazine was more critical , however , stating that " The game 's appeal does not justify its unreasonable cost " of being shipped on cartridge .

 Players have competed to obtain the highest score at the game and the longest play time on a single credit . Competitive playing for the longest play time was popularized by Mario Suarez from Atlantic City , who played Defender for over 21 and half hours in 1982 at the Claridge Casino Hotel in Atlantic City . It was authenticated by the Casino / hotel and the many witnesses that watched along with the Press of Atlantic City ; the media attention spurred other players to attempt the same feat . Expert players exploited software bugs to extend the length of their play time . Defender was the focus of the first Twin Galaxies video game contest . Players in 32 cities simultaneously competed the weekend of April 3 – 4 , 1982 . Rick Smith was the victor with a score of 33 @,@ 013 @,@ 200 which took 38 hours . One bug , related to how the game keeps track of scoring , allows players to earn a large number of " extra lives " . Players can then use the extra lives to leave the game unattended while they rest . Other bugs allow the ship to avoid damage from the enemies , also prolonging the length of play . 
 Professor Jim Whitehead listed Defender as the first horizontally scrolling shooting game , and describes it as a breakthrough title for its use of full 2D motion , multiple goals , and complex gameplay that provides players with several methods to play . James Hague of <unk> Games called Defender a landmark title from the 1980s . Stearny said that the game 's use of scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen . Cuciz stated that Defender 's use of scrolling introduce the " first true ' gaming environment ' " . He further said that though the game 's minimap feature had been introduced before , Defender integrated it into the gameplay in a more essential manner . Stearny described it as the most important space game in the early 1980s . He commented that its realism and technological advances pushed developers to create more popular games , citing <unk> and Phoenix as examples . Vince listed the game as a classic title that introduced new technology , specifically scrolling . Ellis stated that prior to Defender , companies designed video games to have a balanced challenge . They believed games should be easy enough to attract players , but difficult enough to limit play time to a few minutes ; anything too challenging would dissuade players . Loguidice and Barton commented that Defender 's success , along with Robotron : 2084 , illustrated that video game enthusiasts were ready for more difficult games , which spurred developers to create more complex game designs . 
 Jarvis 's contributions to the game 's development are often cited among his accolades . Author John Vince considered him as one of the originators of " high @-@ action " and " reflex @-@ based " arcade games , citing Defender 's gameplay among other games designed by Jarvis . Ellis stated that Jarvis established himself as an early " hard @-@ core " designer with Defender . In 2007 , IGN listed Eugene Jarvis as a top game designer whose titles ( Defender , Robotron : 2084 and Smash TV ) have influenced the video game industry . Barton and Loguidice stated that the game helped establish Williams and Jarvis as key figures in the arcade game industry . Sellers echoed similar comments . After the success of Defender , Williams expanded their business by building a new facility and hired more employees . Before the expansion , Jarvis could work in isolation . But the influx of people created an environment he was unhappy with . He left Williams along with DeMar to found their own development company , Vid Kidz . The company served as a consulting firm to Williams and developed two games for them . 
 = = = Remakes and sequels = = = 
 The success of Defender prompted Williams to approach Vid Kidz , who originally wanted to create a new game . DeMar , however , suggested creating an enhanced version of Defender to meet Williams ' four @-@ month deadline . Vid Kidz titled the game Stargate , and developed it as a sequel to Defender . It features new elements and improved the original 's performance . Some home ports of Stargate were released under the title Defender II for trademark purposes . 
 Williams released a Defender @-@ themed pinball machine in 1982 . It has many elements from the original game : sound effects , enemies , waves , and weapons . Williams produced less than 400 units , which have become rare machines . 
 Midway 's 1991 Strike Force is an arcade update to Defender in the same way that Smash TV is an update to Robotron : 2084 . Jarvis and DeMar assisted with the game , which was programmed by Todd Allen and Eric <unk> . The game was not widely distributed . 
 Atari released Defender 2000 in 1995 for the Atari Jaguar console . It written by Jeff Minter who had previously updated Tempest as Tempest 2000 . 
 A 2002 remake , published simply as Defender , features 3D graphics and a third @-@ person viewpoint . It was released for the Xbox , Game Cube , and PlayStation 2 . 
 <unk> versions of Defender have been included in various home compilations , such as Williams Arcade 's Greatest Hits .

 Home games that copied Defender 's design include Gorgon for the Apple II ( 1981 ) , Repton for the Apple II ( 1983 ) , Defender 64 for the Commodore 64 ( 1983 ) , <unk> for the Atari 8 @-@ bit family ( 1984 ) , Guardian for the Commodore 64 ( 1984 ) , and Planetoid for the BBC Micro ( 1984 ) . 
 Video game designer Jeff Minter based several of his games on Defender 's design . 
 Other games built upon the design elements of Defender , especially protecting people or vehicles along the ground in a horizontally scrolling world , such as Protector II for the Atari 8 @-@ bit family ( 1982 ) , Chopper Command for the Atari 2600 ( 1982 ) , and Choplifter for the Apple II ( 1982 ) .

Other artists to have used sound effects from Defender include Aphex Twin ( on " Mt Saint Michel + Saint Michaels Mount " and " <unk> Bouncing Ball " ) , and Limp Bizkit ( used to censor swearing on the clean version of " My Generation " ) . The game figured prominently and somewhat incongruously in the music video for the Sheena Easton song " Almost Over You " . 
 In 2004 , Tim Waggoner authored a novel called " <unk> " based on the video game . 
 Defender and other Midway properties appear in the Toy @-@ to @-@ Game title Lego Dimensions . The ship from Defender plays a role in the final battle against the game 's villain Lord <unk> . 
 = New York State Route 474 = 
 New York State Route 474 ( NY 474 ) is a state highway located entirely within Chautauqua County in the westernmost corner of New York in the United States . It begins at the section of the Pennsylvania state line that runs north – south and runs eastward , initially paralleling the state line before taking a more northeasterly alignment toward Chautauqua Lake . The route ends adjacent to the lake at a junction with NY 394 in the town of Busti . NY 474 was originally designated as New York State Route 74 in 1930 before being renumbered to NY 474 c . 1973 . The route continues westward into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route 474 ( PA 474 ) , which was assigned in the 1980s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 474 begins at the Pennsylvania state line in the town of French Creek as a continuation of PA 474 , which in turn begins a short distance west of the state line in Wattsburg , Pennsylvania . NY 474 heads east through rural southwest Chautauqua County , briefly paralleling French Creek to the hamlet of Marvin before intersecting and briefly overlapping with NY 426 through the small hamlet of Cutting . NY 474 exits Cutting and continues on an easterly track into the town of Clymer and the hamlet of the same name , where it meets County Route 15 ( CR 15 ) , a local road leading from the Pennsylvania state line ( where the road continues south to Corry ) north to Sherman in the center of the community . 
 East of the hamlet of Clymer , NY 474 turns to the northeast , paralleling an old railroad bed to the community of North Clymer , where NY 474 intersects the southern terminus of NY 76 . Outside of North Clymer , the route returns to an east – west alignment prior to entering the town of Harmony and the village of Panama ( intersecting CR 33 in the latter ) in quick succession . NY 474 continues on , passing through the Harmony hamlet of <unk> and the North Harmony community of Ashville before terminating at NY 394 just west of the Lakewood village limits in the town of Busti .

 All of what is now NY 474 was originally designated as part of NY 74 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 74 also initially continued east from Lakewood to Jamestown by way of modern NY 394 . The remainder of what is now NY 394 from Mayville south to Lakewood was designated as NY 17J . In the mid @-@ 1930s , NY 17J was extended eastward along NY 74 to rejoin NY 17 at Washington Street in Jamestown . The overlap was eliminated in the mid @-@ 1940s when NY 74 was truncated to Ashville . NY 74 remained unchanged until c . 1973 when it was renumbered to NY 474 . The change in number allowed for the NY 74 designation to be used for the westward continuation of Vermont Route 74 in Essex County . The short continuation of NY 474 west to Wattsburg , Pennsylvania , was designated as PA 474 in the 1980s .

 = Hurricane Florence ( 2000 ) = 
 Hurricane Florence attained Category 1 intensity on three separate occasions in mid @-@ September 2000 . The tenth tropical cyclone and sixth named storm of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season , Florence developed on September 20 from a cold front to the southwest of Bermuda . Initially a subtropical cyclone , it quickly organized , attaining hurricane status twice in a two @-@ day period before weakening while remaining nearly stationary . Florence accelerated northeastward , reaching peak winds as a hurricane after passing near Bermuda . On September 17 , the storm was absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone . Hurricane Florence threatened Bermuda during its third time at hurricane intensity , bringing tropical storm force winds to the island but causing no reported damage . However , three deaths in North Carolina were blamed on rip currents triggered by the hurricane on September 12 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 During the first week of September , a cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States and stalled over the Atlantic Ocean . By September 8 , a weak frontal wave began developing along the cold front . Late on September 9 , convection increased over the broad low pressure area , and the overall system intensified beneath an upper @-@ level low . Subsequently , the system abandoned its frontal features as its appearance became more circular . With persistent but limited convection near and to the west of the center , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) estimated the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 10 about 375 mi ( 604 km ) west @-@ southwest of Bermuda ; it was considered subtropical because the upper @-@ circulation was believed to have been cold @-@ core . Operationally , advisories on the system were not initiated until 21 hours later . 
 Subsequent to developing , deep convection began developing and increasing around the center . On September 11 , an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit temperature cross @-@ section analysis indicated the system developed a warm thermal core ; as a result , it was re @-@ classified as Tropical Depression Ten . Convection continued increasing , and it intensified to tropical storm status by 1200 UTC . Operationally , it was considered a tropical depression , and significant strengthening was not expected . However , reports from Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of tropical storm force winds , and as a result the National Hurricane Center named the cyclone Florence . The storm continued quickly intensifying , and with the Hurricane Hunters reporting flight @-@ level winds of over 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) , it was estimated Florence attained hurricane status late on September 11 , or just six hours after the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories on the storm . The strongest winds were confined to a very small area near the edge of the convection . Initially , the hurricane was tracking west @-@ southwestward , steered by a mid @-@ level ridge to its northwest . 
 On September 12 , the entrainment of drier air weakened Florence to tropical storm status . At the same time , its motion became nearly stationary as a ridge to its southeast weakened steering currents . An eye developed in the center of the cyclone , and Florence again attained hurricane status late on September 12 . Cooler water temperatures caused the hurricane to again weaken to tropical storm status on September 13 . The next day , increased vertical wind shear accelerated the weakening , leaving its cloud pattern disorganized . An approaching short @-@ wave trough turned Florence to the east @-@ southeast and later to the east @-@ northeast as its forward motion increased . Convection increased near the center as the overall structure improved . Based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters , Florence was upgraded to hurricane status on September 16 about 200 mi ( 320 km ) southwest of Bermuda . Later that day , the hurricane passed about 75 mi ( 120 km ) northwest of Bermuda , its closest approach . Late on September 16 , Florence reached peak winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) as an eyewall became apparent . Cooler waters weakened the hurricane to tropical storm status by September 17 as its motion accelerated further due to the approaching trough . Later that day , Florence was absorbed by the extratropical storm associated with the trough about 80 mi ( 130 km ) south of Cape Race on the island of Newfoundland . 
 = = Impact and naming = = 
 Early in its duration , Hurricane Florence produced large swells that affected the East Coast of the United States . Rip currents caused three deaths due to drowning in North Carolina , all in the southern portion of the state . Seven other people needed rescue , and at least two beaches were closed . Florence contributed to a locally high number of rip current @-@ related deaths in 2000 ; in response , the National Weather Service office in Wilmington implemented a new rip current warning system for the summer of 2001 . 
 On September 14 , the government of Bermuda issued a tropical storm watch for the island ; it was upgraded to a tropical storm warning the next day and later to a hurricane warning . The island endured sustained winds of 41 mph ( 67 km / h ) , gusting to 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) . Rainfall at L.F. Wade International Airport accumulated 0 @.@ 47 in ( 12 mm ) . Later , the remnants of Florence produced significant rainfall , peaking at 2 @.@ 26 in ( 57 @.@ 5 mm ) , along Newfoundland 's Avalon Peninsula . Waves up to 16 ft ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) high churned the waters off the east coast of the island . 
 = John Cooke ( Royal Navy officer ) = 
 John Cooke ( <unk> – 21 October 1805 ) was an experienced and highly regarded officer of the Royal Navy during the American War of Independence , the French Revolutionary Wars and the first years of the Napoleonic Wars . Cooke is best known for his death in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with French forces during the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . During the action , his ship HMS Bellerophon was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French ship of the line Aigle . Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee , but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of Aigle . 
 Aside from his death , remarkably little is known of Cooke 's circumstances . Even his date of birth is unclear , and unlike many of his fellow officers , Cooke was never a notable society figure . He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him . Memorials to him were placed in St Paul 's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at St. Mary , Whitechapel , the second son of Francis Cooke , an Admiralty clerk , and his wife Margaret . John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the cutter HMS Greyhound under Lieutenant John Bazely , before going ashore to spend time at Mr <unk> 's naval academy at Greenwich . He was entered onto the books of one of the royal yachts by Sir Alexander Hood , who would become an enduring patron of Cooke 's . In 1776 he obtained a position as a midshipman on the ship of the line HMS Eagle , aged thirteen . Cooke served aboard Eagle , the flagship of the North American Station , during the next three years , seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard . Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778 , when Eagle was closely engaged with American units ashore . He distinguished himself in the assault , causing Admiral Lord Howe to remark " Why , young man , you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age . " On 21 January 1779 , Cooke was promoted to lieutenant and joined HMS Superb in the East Indies under Sir Edward Hughes , but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill @-@ health . 
 Cooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying , before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90 @-@ gun HMS Duke under Captain Alan Gardner . Cooke saw action at the Battle of the Saintes , at which Duke was heavily engaged . He remained with Gardner following the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783 , bringing an end to the American War of Independence , and served as his first @-@ lieutenant aboard his next command , the 50 @-@ gun HMS Europa . Gardner became commodore at Jamaica , flying his broad pennant aboard Europa and retaining Cooke as his first @-@ lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home . He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the Spanish Armament in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron , Sir Alexander Hood , to be third @-@ lieutenant of his flagship , the 90 @-@ gun HMS London . When the crisis passed without breaking into open war , London was paid off and Cooke went ashore . 
 = = Frigate command = = 
 With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793 , Cooke rejoined Hood and became first @-@ lieutenant of his new flagship , the 100 @-@ gun HMS Royal George , part of the Channel Fleet . On 21 February 1794 , Cooke was promoted to commander and given his first independent command , the small fireship HMS Incendiary . Three months later , Incendiary was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 , relaying Lord Howe 's signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse . On 1 June 1794 , Cooke was a witness to the battle of the Glorious First of June , although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat . In the action 's aftermath , Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet , becoming a post captain on 23 July 1794 . For a year , Cooke was stationed off Newfoundland as flag captain to Sir James Wallace aboard the 74 @-@ gun HMS Monarch , before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28 @-@ gun HMS Tourterelle . Cooke accepted , but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies , he resigned it , having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him . 
 Instead in early 1796 he took command of the 36 @-@ gun frigate HMS Nymphe . Nymphe was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year , and on 9 March 1797 was in company with HMS St Fiorenzo when they encountered the returning ships of a short @-@ lived French invasion attempt of Britain that had been defeated at Fishguard in Wales . The French ships attempted to escape into Brest , but were hunted down by the British , who forced the surrender of Résistance and Constance in turn after successive short engagements . Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat , and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy , bringing prize money to Cooke and his crew . 
 Despite this success , Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship . This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest , when Nymphe became embroiled in the Spithead mutiny . Cooke attempted to assist Admiral John Colpoys at the mutiny 's outbreak , and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship . Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny , although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate HMS Amethyst in preparation for the Anglo @-@ Russian invasion of the Batavian Republic . During the invasion , Amethyst conveyed the Duke of York to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign 's collapse . 
 Cooke was involved in operations in Quiberon Bay during the remainder of 1799 , and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of Ferrol . During this time , Amethyst captured six French merchant ships and small privateers . During 1801 , Cooke participated in the capture of the French frigate Dédaigneuse off Cape Finisterre , helping Samuel Hood Linzee and Richard King chase her down on 26 January . Amethyst was not heavily engaged with Dédaigneuse and received no damage , but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized . Dédaigneuse was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS Dedaigneuse . Shortly afterwards , Cooke captured the Spanish ship Carlotta and the French privateer Général Brune in the same area . 
 = = Trafalgar = = 
 With the Peace of Amiens , Cooke briefly retired on half @-@ pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 . Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral Sir William Young at Plymouth , but Cooke tactfully refused , instead applying for active service . He received command of HMS Bellerophon on 25 April 1805 . In May , after the large combined French and Spanish fleet , under Admiral Pierre @-@ Charles Villeneuve escaped from Toulon , beginning the Trafalgar Campaign , Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood . The squadron arrived off Cadiz on 9 June and Collingwood detached Bellerophon and three other ships to blockade Cartagena under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton . When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August , Collingwood recalled Bickerton 's force and mounted a blockade of the port . Collingwood was reinforced with more ships , and was later superseded by Nelson . Cooke was heard to say at this time that " To be in a general engagement with Nelson would crown all my military ambition " . Nelson had Villeneuve 's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape . 
 The Franco @-@ Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805 , but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October . Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions ; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in HMS Royal Sovereign . Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood 's line , and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet . Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant William Pryce Cumby and his master Edward Overton of Nelson 's orders , in case he should be killed . 
 Bellerophon was soon closely engaged with the French , breaking through the enemy line and closing with Aigle . As with the other French ships in the fleet , Aigle 's rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers , who kept up a steady fire on Bellerophon and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship 's deck . Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck , where Cooke , Cumby and Overton stood . Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat , which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship 's captain to French snipers . Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented , but replied " It is too late to take them off . I see my situation , but I will die like a man " . It was reported that Cooke was killed by sniper fire , command being then taken by the First Lieutenant who mustered the top @-@ side crew in the tween @-@ deck and prepared to repel any boarders ; the ship 's guns were then elevated to fire on the French gathered for boarding and this suggests that boarding was prevented . 
 As the action continued , the Captain Pierre @-@ Paul <unk> of Aigle ordered his crew to board and seize Bellerophon , hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew . Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower @-@ deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead , and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto Bellerophon 's quarterdeck , shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with the men behind him . Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below , passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder . The badly wounded ship 's quartermaster was also present , and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee . Cumby 's charge cleared the French from the deck of Bellerophon , and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck , two musket balls lodged in his chest . Cooke 's last words had been " Let me lie quietly a minute . Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike . " 
 Cumby took charge of the battered Bellerophon , directing her fire into Aigle and ultimately forcing the French ship 's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels . Bellerophon had suffered grievously , losing 27 dead and 127 wounded . Although Aigle was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle , Bellerophon survived , primarily due to Cumby 's leadership . He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action . Cooke 's body was buried at sea the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from Bellerophon . 
 = = Family and legacy = = 
 Cooke 's death , as with those of George Duff and Admiral Nelson himself , was widely mourned in Britain . Cooke 's widow Louisa and their eight @-@ year @-@ old daughter were given numerous awards and presents , including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action , and a large silver vase presented by Lloyd 's Patriotic Fund . At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew 's Church in <unk> St Andrew in Wiltshire , close to the family home . The plaque commemorates Cooke 's life and death and also that of his wife . A memorial was also raised to him in St Paul 's Cathedral . Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming , including from the future explorer John Franklin , who had served on Bellerophon at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was " very gentlemanly and active . I like his appearance very much . " A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the National Maritime Museum . 
 Cooke had married Louisa , née Hardy , on 15 June 1790 at St Leonard 's , Shoreditch . Louisa was the fourth daughter of Josiah Hardy , the former Governor of New Jersey , and later consul at Cadiz . They had a single daughter together , born on 26 January 1797 at Stoke Damerel . Louisa died at Cheltenham on 5 February 1853 aged 96 . 
 = House of Lords Act 1999 = 
 The House of Lords Act 1999 ( c . 34 ) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that was given Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 . The Act reformed the House of Lords , one of the chambers of Parliament . For centuries , the House of Lords had included several hundred members who inherited their seats ; the Act removed such a right . However , as part of a compromise , the Act did permit ninety @-@ two hereditary peers to remain in the House on an interim basis . Another ten were created life peers to enable them to remain in the House . 
 The Act decreased the membership of the House from 1 @,@ 330 in October 1999 to 669 in March 2000 . As another result of the Act , the majority of the Lords were now life peers , whose numbers had been gradually increasing since the Life <unk> Act 1958 . As of August 2012 , there were 825 Peers , of whom 26 were senior Church of England bishops , whose determination is governed by the Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to the 16th century , the Lords was the stronger of the two houses of Parliament . A process of gradual evolution combined with such moments of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the political control of England , first from the Crown to the House of Lords and then to the House of Commons . The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars , dethrone two Kings , and gradually reduce the power of the Lords . Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999 the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to block , or veto , adoption of most bills ; at most it could delay bills for one year . Furthermore , the Commons has absolute power when it comes to money bills . 
 After eighteen years of Conservative rule , the Labour party led by Tony Blair won a landslide victory at the 1997 general election , in the process inflicting the biggest defeat for the Conservatives since 1832 . The Labour Party had for years endorsed abolition of the unelected House of Lords in its election platforms , though since 1992 this had changed to a policy of reforming the House instead . 
 During the 20th century Liberal and Labour governments proposed many bills that were opposed by the House of Lords , which had been dominated by Conservatives since the 1890s , leading to delay and where proposed before elections , their dropping from the legislative agenda . In the first year of the Blair government , the Lords passed back Government bills 38 times . The rejection considered the most contentious was of the European Elections Bill , against which the Lords voted five times . Blair stated that the Conservatives were using the hereditary peers to " frustrate " and " overturn the will of the democratically elected House of Commons " . Here Blair found an opportunity to implement one of Labour 's campaign promises , reforming the Lords . 
 On 24 November 1998 , in opening the second session of Parliament , the Queen delivered her annual Speech from the Throne ; the Speech is written for her by the ruling party and outlines that party 's legislative agenda for the upcoming year . In it , she suggested that her Government ( i.e. the ruling Labour Party ) would pursue a reform of the House of Lords . These remarks were followed by shouts of " Hear ! Hear ! " from supportive Labour Members of Parliament , and by similar shouts of " Shame ! Shame ! " from Conservative peers ; such outbursts were unprecedented , for the Queen 's Speech is with few exceptions heard by a silent Parliament . 
 = = The House of Lords Bill = = 
 The House of Lords Bill was expected to face a tough fight in the House of Lords . Several Lords threatened to disrupt the Government 's other bills if they continued with the plan to abolish the <unk> ' right to sit in the House of Lords . The Earl of Onslow , for instance , said , " I 'm happy to force a division on each and every clause of the Scotland Bill . Each division takes 20 minutes and there are more than 270 clauses . " Lords had plenty of other means by which they could obstruct the Government 's programme . 
 Lord Randall put forward the idea of phasing out the hereditary peers by disqualifying their heirs . 
 Baroness Jay reminded the House that under the Salisbury Convention they could not block the bill . 
 In order to convince some peers to vote for reform , Tony Blair announced that he would compromise by allowing a number of hereditary peers to remain in the House of Lords on an interim basis . On 2 December 1998 , the Conservative Leader of the Opposition , William Hague , rose in the House of Commons to attack Blair 's plans . He suggested that Blair 's changes indicated his lack of principles , claiming that Blair wanted to turn the House of Lords into a " House of <unk> " . Hague further suggested that the Conservative Party would never agree to such constitutional reforms that were " based on no comprehensive plan or principle . " Hague 's remarks backfired when Blair revealed that the Conservative Party in the House of Lords , rather than oppose his reforms , would definitely support them , and that he had done a secret deal with the Conservative leader in the House of Lords , Viscount Cranborne . Hague immediately removed Cranborne from office , but , in protest , several Conservative Lords who held front @-@ bench positions resigned . 
 On 19 January 1999 , the Leader of the House of Commons , Margaret Beckett , introduced the House of Lords Bill into the House of Commons . The House of Commons passed the bill by a vote of 340 to 132 on 16 March . The next day it was presented to the House of Lords , where debate on the bill was far longer . One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so @-@ called Weatherill Amendment , named for the Lord Weatherill , the former Speaker of the House of Commons . The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne , and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of the House of Lords . 
 Several controversies relating to the technicalities of the bill were brought up in the House of Lords . One issue regarded the language used in clauses 1 to 7 , which was described by Lord Mayhew of Twysden as " uncertain in its effects and would leave the position of most hereditary Peers uncertain if the Bill was enacted . " A second issue was related to the Acts of Union 1707 uniting Scotland and England into the Kingdom of Great Britain . After lengthy debates , both matters were referred to the House of Lords Committee on Privileges . 
 Under the Acts of Union 1707 , Scottish Lords would be entitled to elect 16 representative peers to sit on their Lordships ' behalf in the House of Lords . In 1963 , the Peerage Act was passed , allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House , not just 16 of them . It was felt that removing all Scottish representation would breach the Articles . The Government , however , responded that the Articles did envisage a change in the election of representative peers . It was argued that some portions of the Treaty were entrenched , while others were not . For instance , Scotland and England were united " forever , " the Scottish Court of Session was to " remain in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted , " and the establishment of the Church of Scotland was " effectually and unalterably secured . " However , it was suggested , the election of Scottish representative peers was not entrenched , and therefore could be amended . Furthermore , the Government argued that Parliament was entirely sovereign and supreme , and could at its will change the Articles of Union . For example , the Treaty of Union joining Great Britain and Ireland required that the two nations be united " forever " . Nonetheless , in 1922 , by an Act of Parliament , most of Ireland was made independent as the Irish Free State . Thus , even entrenched clauses were argued to be open to amendment by the authority of Parliament . The Committee agreed and reported to the House on 20 October 1999 that the Bill was indeed lawful in this regard . 
 After the Committee 's first and second reports were considered , the Lords passed the bill 221 to 81 on 26 October 1999 . During the session , Charles Beauclerk , son of a hereditary peer , launched a protest at the constitutional implications of the bill from the <unk> , and was ejected from the chamber . Once the Lords settled the differences between their version of the bill and the Commons version thereof , the Bill received Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 and became an Act of parliament . The Act then came into force the same day . 
 = = Membership of the House of Lords = = 
 The House of Lords Act 1999 provides firstly that " No @-@ one shall be a member of the House of Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage . " ( The Act treats the Principality of Wales and the Earldom of Chester as hereditary peerages , though those titles , granted normally to the heir @-@ apparent , are never inherited . ) The Act then provides that 92 peers , including the Earl Marshal , the Lord Great Chamberlain and 90 other peers elected in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House , would be excepted from the exclusion of hereditary peers , and that after the first session of the next Parliament , whenever one of these seats fell vacant , the Lords would have to proceed to a by @-@ election . The Act also provided that a hereditary peer would be entitled to vote in elections for , and sit in , the House of Commons , unless he or she was a member of the House of Lords . Previously , hereditary peers had been constitutionally disqualified from being electors to , or members of , the House of Commons . The first hereditary peer to gain a seat in the Commons under this provision was John Thurso . 
 The Act prevents even hereditary peers who are the first to hold their titles from sitting automatically in the House of Lords . The Government did agree , however , to give life peerages ( the titles of which are indicated in parentheses ) to four such new hereditary peers : Toby Austin Richard William Low , 1st Baron Aldington ( Baron Low ) , Frederick James Erroll , 1st Baron Erroll of Hale ( Baron Erroll of Kilmun ) , Francis Aungier Pakenham , 7th Earl of Longford , 1st Baron Pakenham ( Baron Pakenham of Cowley ) and Antony Armstrong @-@ Jones , 1st Earl of Snowdon ( Baron Armstrong @-@ Jones ) . Additionally , life peerages were created for former Leaders of the House of Lords : John Julian <unk> , 2nd Baron <unk> ( Baron <unk> ) , Peter Alexander Rupert <unk> , 6th Baron Carrington ( Baron <unk> of Upton ) , Robert Gascoyne @-@ Cecil , Viscount Cranborne ( Baron Gascoyne @-@ Cecil ) , George Patrick John Rushworth Jellicoe , 2nd Earl Jellicoe ( Baron Jellicoe of Southampton ) , Malcolm Shepherd , 2nd Baron Shepherd ( Baron Shepherd of Spalding ) and David James George Hennessy , 3rd Baron Windlesham ( Baron Hennessy ) . 
 Life peerages were also offered to members of the royal family with new hereditary peerages , but declined ( as it would have meant they would hold seats in the House of Lords ) : Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh ; Charles , Prince of Wales ; Prince Andrew , Duke of York ; and Prince Edward , Earl of Wessex . The Dukes of Gloucester and Kent had both inherited their titles from their fathers , the first dukes . 
 = = = First election to the House of Lords = = = 
 Before the granting of Royal Assent , the Lords had adopted a Standing Order making provision for the election of peers . The Order provided that there be elected : 
 Two Labour peers 
 Three Liberal Democrat peers 
 Twenty @-@ eight <unk> peers 
 Forty @-@ two Conservative peers 
 Fifteen peers , to serve as Deputy Speakers and in other offices , by the entire House of Lords 
 The elections for officers of the House were held on 27 and 28 October 1999 , while those for peers elected by party were held on 3 and 4 November ; the results were proclaimed to the House on 29 October and 5 November . Voters were required to rank in order of preference , on a ballot prepared by the Clerk of the Parliaments , as many candidates as there were places to be filled . The candidates receiving the greatest number of votes ( without regard to the ranking on the ballots , so in effect block voting ) were declared elected . Only if there were ties would the ranking be examined . Thereafter , until November 2002 , if a vacancy occurred , the next @-@ highest vote @-@ getter ( the rankings being examined , again , only in the case of ties ) in the original election would fill the seat . This procedure was used on two occasions . 
 = = = Subsequent by @-@ elections = = = 
 Since November 2002 , by @-@ elections have been held to fill vacancies . Two by @-@ elections were held in 2003 , one in 2004 , four in 2005 , one in each of 2007 , 2008 and 2009 , two in 2010 , four in 2011 , two in 2013 , four in 2014 and six in 2015 . Voting is by preferential voting , with peers ranking the candidates in order of preference . As many or as few preferences as desired may be indicated . To win the election , a peer must receive a majority of first preference votes . If no candidate receives such a majority , the candidate with the fewest number of first preference votes is eliminated , with each of his votes being redistributed according to the second preference marked on the ballot ( see Instant @-@ runoff voting ) . The process is continued until one candidate receives a majority . 
 = = Labour proposals to remove remaining hereditary peers = = 
 The Labour Government expected eventually to present a bill for a second stage of House of Lords reform , thus removing the remaining 92 hereditary peers ; the history of such attempts between 1997 and 2009 is set out in a report in The Guardian . Proposals called The House of Lords : Reform were published by order of the House on 1 January 2007 , with a foreword by Jack Straw . In 2009 , Labour introduced the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill , which would have ended the by @-@ elections to fill vacancies for hereditary peers , thereby removing them through attrition . However , in order to ensure the passage of the bill through Parliament before the 2010 general election , this clause was dropped from the bill entirely , along with other clauses relating to the exclusion and suspension of peers from the House of Lords . 
 = = Proposals in 2012 for elections to most seats in the Lords = = 
 In August 2012 , the coalition government of David Cameron and Nick Clegg dropped plans to reform the House of Lords by making it mostly elected and slashing its size . Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg spearheaded the push to bring in the changes . The government wanted four @-@ fifths of members of a reformed House of Lords to be elected . They would have served 15 @-@ year terms of office , after which they could not run for re @-@ election . The number of peers was to be almost halved , from 826 to 450 . The chamber would have kept the title of House of Lords , after names like Senate and Reformed House were rejected . Peers were each to represent a specific region of the United Kingdom , as constituted for the election of Members of the European Parliament . One @-@ third of seats would have been filled by elections held every five years . Of the remaining 90 members , 12 — rather than the current 26 — would have been Church of England bishops . The remainder were to continue to be appointed , and all hereditary peers were to be removed . The government had scheduled passage of its bill for the spring of 2013 , and the elections were to have taken place in 2015 , but the effort stalled when in July 2012 , 91 Conservatives in the Commons , including Jacob Rees @-@ Mogg , rebelled against the government in a vote on how to timetable the House of Lords Reform Bill .

 Mega Man 6 , known in Japan as Rockman 6 : Shijō <unk> no Tatakai ! ! ( <unk> <unk> ! ! , Rokkuman Shikkusu Shijō <unk> no Tatakai ! ! , lit . " Rockman 6 : The Greatest Battle Ever ! ! " ) , is a action @-@ video game developed by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . It is the sixth installment in the original Mega Man series and was originally released in Japan on November 5 , 1993 and in North America the following March . It was included in the Mega Man Anniversary Collection released in 2004 . Its first PAL region release was June 11 , 2013 for the 3DS Virtual Console , nearly twenty years after the game 's first release . 
 The story of Mega Man 6 opens during a competitive robot fighting tournament with entrants from all around the globe . A villainous figure known as " Mr. X " announces he has reprogrammed the eight powerful contestants with intent to use them for taking over the world . The game 's robotic protagonist Mega Man , who was sent to oversee the tournament , springs into action to foil X 's plot . A standard action @-@ platformer , Mega Man 6 plays nearly identically to its five predecessors with a few added features such as stages with alternate pathways and new Rush adaptors . 
 Mega Man 6 is the first game in the series to receive character design input from fans outside Japan . This late @-@ era game was also the last in the series released on Nintendo 's 8 @-@ bit console . Due to the declining support of the NES and the growing presence of the newer and more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) , Capcom decided not to publish Mega Man 6 in North America . The North American version of Mega Man 6 was released by Nintendo of America instead . Critical reviews favored the game 's comparable presentation and use of the established gameplay model from preceding chapters in the series , though nearly all judged it a redundant sequel . 
 While the first five Mega Man games are available on the Wii 's Virtual Console , this game is absent from the Wii Shop Channel ; however the game was released via the 3DS Virtual Console in Japan and Europe , with North America on June 20 , 2013 . It was also released via the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on May 14 , 2014 , in Europe on July 24 , 2014 and in North America on August 21 , 2014 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mega Man 6 's story takes place after the events of Mega Man 5 . To counter Dr. Wily 's repeated attacks , the Global Robot Alliance was formed , and one year later the " First Annual Robot Tournament " is held in order to determine the world 's strongest peacekeeping robot . The tournament is hosted by a man known only as " Mr. X " , the leader of the mysterious " X Foundation " and many strong robots participate . Dr. Light , a pacifist , decides not to enter the competition , but sends the robotic hero Mega Man to supervise it . Before the event can begin , however , Mr. X announces that he has reprogrammed eight of the strongest contestants to do his bidding in taking over the world : Blizzard Man , Centaur Man , Flame Man , Knight Man , Plant Man , Tomahawk Man , Wind Man , and Yamato Man , and tells Mega Man he had been manipulating Dr. Wily from the beginning . Following this , Mega Man and Rush set out to put an end to Mr. X 's plan . Mega Man destroys the eight Robot Masters , then makes his way to Mr. X 's fortress . The villain is beaten and quickly reveals himself as none other than a disguised Dr. Wily . The evil scientist flees to a new fortress stronghold where Mega Man pursues and defeats him again . The game ends with Dr. Wily finally brought to justice and sent to prison .

 The gameplay in Mega Man 6 is largely similar to its five NES counterparts . The player takes control of Mega Man to complete a series of side @-@ scrolling platform stages littered with smaller robot enemies and occasional larger mini @-@ bosses . The player 's primary method of attack is the " Mega Buster " cannon , which can be charged for more powerful shots . At the end of each of the initial eight stages is a boss battle , where the player inherits that Robot Master 's unique " Master Weapon " if successful . These eight levels can be completed in any order , although all Robot Masters are weak to a specific Master Weapon , adding an element of strategy to the order chosen by the player . The player 's health is represented by a gauge that can be refilled by picking up energy pellets . Extra lives , reserve energy tanks , and pellets that refill Master Weapon power can also be found throughout each level . Mega Man 6 introduces the " Energy <unk> " , which automatically refills the weapon with the lowest energy when picking up Master Weapon power . 
 Previous Mega Man games typically allowed the player to call on the transformable dog Rush or use other support items in order to traverse difficult or otherwise inaccessible parts of a stage . Mega Man 6 instead features a pair of " Rush <unk> " that fuse Mega Man and Rush into special forms . The first , " Jet Mega Man " , lets the player fly upward or hover for a brief period of time , but prevents the use of charge shots . The second , " Power Mega Man " , utilizes a powerful , short @-@ range punch attack for destroying large blocks . The player cannot slide when using either adapter . Mega Man 6 also presents less linear ways to complete the stages than in previous entries in the series . There are two pathways in many of the stages that lead to boss rooms , but the player is often required to use one of the Rush adaptors to begin an alternate route . Although either one will clear the stage , only one of them will give the player a letter circuit board for assembling the helper bird Beat . Collecting all four parts will allow the player to call on Beat to attack enemies .

 Mega Man 6 was developed at the same time as the franchise 's first spin @-@ off , Mega Man X for Nintendo 's newer console , the Super Nintendo Entertainment System . Series artist Keiji Inafune , credited as " Inafking " , stated that having a video game franchise with six titles is very rare , and one of the advantages to this is that players expect certain aspects of each game to be repeated in the next . After having implemented so many different mechanics to the gameplay of past entries , Inafune thought that Rush adaptor assembly was inevitable . The artist struggled with the adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic . According to Inafune , " If you think about it , they shouldn 't be able to combine like this . It would be awkward if parts of Rush like his neck were left over after they combined , so what was I supposed to do ? " 
 The Robot Masters featured in some of the previous Mega Man games were the result of design contests held in Japan , in which fans of the series would submit their character ideas to Capcom . Keeping with the tradition , Japan held a design contest for Mega Man 6 . After the release of Mega Man 5 , the magazine Nintendo Power held a similar contest in North America . Only eight out of the more than 200 @,@ 000 worldwide character submissions for Mega Man 6 were accepted for the game . Six of the Robot Masters were designed by Japanese fans , while the remaining two ( Knight Man and Wind Man ) were designed by North American fans who entered the Nintendo Power contest . The North American cover of the game pays homage to the two designers by featuring their Robot Masters on it . Inafune admitted that it was stressful when the last characters being designed for the game were not meeting with the development team 's schedule . He concluded , " For having hit a lot of roadblocks , I feel like we got a lot done for 6 . The theme for our designs was ' The world is our stage , ' and I really enjoyed bringing what I felt was the unique flavor of different countries into the game .

 A few months after the publication of Mega Man 5 , Capcom announced the sixth installment in the original series , as well as Mega Man Soccer and Mega Man X for the SNES , making Mega Man 6 the last title in the franchise to be released on the 8 @-@ bit NES . Capcom chose not to publish the game outside Japan . Instead , Nintendo of America published it in March 1994 . Before the NES era in North America was about to end , Nintendo of America made a plan to help sell it along with <unk> 's Revenge : <unk> II and the NES version of Wario 's Woods , which were also published by Nintendo in North America during the same time . Their plan was to release the top @-@ loading NES @-@ 101 for a retail price of $ 49 @.@ 99 to attract consumers to buying the updated version of the original NES along with one or more new titles for the console , including Mega Man 6 . The game was also showcased alongside Mega Man X at the 1994 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . 
 Mega Man 6 was re @-@ released for the PlayStation in 1999 as part of the Rockman Complete Works series exclusive to Japan . This version of the game features a number of extras including remixed music , artwork galleries , and a " navi mode " to help guide players . A port of the Complete Works edition was released on the North American @-@ exclusive Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube in 2004 and Xbox in 2005 .

 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Mega Man 6 has enjoyed a favorable reception from gaming publications and websites . The graphics , play control , challenge level , and added power @-@ ups were generally praised . GamePro was impressed with some of the newer enemies and larger mid @-@ stage bosses , but was displeased with the game 's recycling of Master Weapons seen in previous Mega Man games . Overall , the magazine described the graphics , audio , and level design in Mega Man 6 as standard fare for the franchise and called the game a " rock of reliable NES fun " in a series that is as " predictable as the tide " . Destructoid editor Tony Ponce considered Mega Man 6 the best game in the entire series . He argued that the game " was retro before retro was cool " due to Capcom 's decision to develop it as a higher profile game on the NES during the era of fourth generation consoles . He also expressed appreciation for its music , introductions for each Robot Master , and the use of branching pathways in each level , among many other reasons . Nintendo Power listed Mega Man 6 as the best NES game of 1993 , stating , " His sixth NES adventure , in which he uses two new , Special Power @-@ Ups , might just be his best " . Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack also appreciated these innovations and regretted missing out on the game when it was first released . Mega Man 6 is listed by IGN as the 58th best game on the NES . The writers summarized , " Mega Man 6 is considered by many to be the last worthwhile NES release in the catalog , and though that 's not saying much when looking at the title 's contemporaries , Mega Man 6 is still as good as it gets in many respects . " 
 Mega Man 6 is occasionally seen as " redundant " to the series . GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer labeled Mega Man 6 the " cheesiest " among the NES titles : " If you 're looking for mega @-@ laughs , you might want to try this one out . " 1UP.com contributors likewise found that the game 's " inane " storyline and villains both insult fans of the series and outweigh the game 's good soundtrack and interesting power @-@ ups . The four members of the Electronic Gaming Monthly review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding the game 's familiar 8 @-@ bit presentation and its addition to the already repetitive nature of the series . One reviewer commented , " OK , Mega Man was fun and original back in the days when the letters ' N E S ' meant something . Now the game is just getting redundant . Oh sure , Mega Man may learn a few new tricks here and there but this series has to end soon . " 
 Elements of the game made their way into the Mega Man series from Archie Comics prior to it going on indefinite hiatus . Some notable liberties were taken , such as introducing a creator character for Plant Man , Dr. Pedro <unk> , and introducing the X Foundation @-@ renamed the X Corporation @-@ at the conclusion of the Mega Man 3 adapt . The latter concept notably featured Mr. X as a separate character from Dr. Wily and as a future version of Xander Payne , a character exclusive to the comics who became involved in time travel after being part of an anti @-@ robot extremist group known as the Emerald Spears . A view of the events of Mega Man 6 in the series ' final issue prior to the hiatus hinted as Xander 's overthrow and Wily 's seizure of his resources and alias . The X Corporation 's resources also provide Wily with the means of laying the groundwork for other schemes , including the abduction of Kalinka Cossack leading into Mega Man 4 . Its membership was shown to include numerous identically costumed grunts and Madame Y , a character based on an " alternate universe " concept by Mega Man artist Hideki Ishikawa .

 The Sahifah is one of the major sources of Shia belief and has attracted the attention of Shia and Sunni scholars such as Ibn <unk> , Sheikh <unk> , and Abu Hanifa . It contains hadiths on various topics including the invocation of Allah ; the importance of praying five times a day and of saying the prayer for the dead ; the excellence of the household of Muhammad , of the believer , of good manners , of the names Muhammad and Ahmad , of various foods , fruits , and ointments , of obeying parents , of strengthening the bonds of kinship , and of jihad ; a warning against cheating , backbiting , or tattling ; and other miscellaneous traditions .

 The book was allegedly first written by Abdallah ibn Aḥmad ibn Amer , who said he had heard its contents from his father Aḥmad ibn Amer , who said he had heard them from Ali al @-@ Ridha in Medina in 194 AH ( 809 @-@ 10 CE ) . Abdallah ibn Aḥmad ibn Amer was subsequently recognized as a credible narrator of hadith by <unk> , one of the important Shia scholars . 
 The version printed in Cairo by al @-@ Ma <unk> Press in the year 1340 AH ( 1921 – 1922 ) begins with the following chain of authorities : Its editor al- ' <unk> ' Abd al @-@ <unk> ' stated he received its contents on the authority of Sheikh ' Abd al @-@ <unk> ' , who received it from Imam al @-@ <unk> ibn Mohammed , who received it from Sheikh al @-@ Sayyid <unk> al @-@ Dīn ibn ' Abd Allah , who received it from al @-@ Sayyid Ahmed ibn ' Abd Allah al @-@ <unk> , who received it from Imam al @-@ <unk> ibn Mohammed ibn Sulayman , who received it from Imam al @-@ Mahdi Ahmed ibn Yahya , who received it from Sulayman ibn Ibrahīm ibn ' Umar al- ' Alawi , who received it from his father Ibrahīm , who received it from Rida ' al @-@ Dīn Ibrahīm ibn Mohammed al @-@ Tabari , who received it from Imam Najm al @-@ Dīn al @-@ <unk> , who received it from al @-@ Hafiz Ibn ' Asakir , who received it from Zahir al @-@ <unk> , who received it from al @-@ Hafiz al @-@ <unk> , who received it from Abu al @-@ Qasim al @-@ Mufassir , who received it from " Ibrahīm ibn <unk> 'ra " ( by mistake in text " Ju 'da ' , who received it from Abu al @-@ Qasim ' Abd Allah ibn Ahmed ibn ' Amir al @-@ Ta 'i in Basra , who received it from Ali al @-@ Ridha , who claimed his father <unk> claimed his father Ja 'far claimed his father Muhammad claimed his father ' Ali claimed his father Husayn claimed his father ' Ali , son of Abū <unk> , had heard or witnessed its contents in the company of the Prophet Muhammad . 
 = = Context = = 
 The principal narrator of the work was Abdallah ibn Aḥmad ibn Amer , who retells the words of Ali al @-@ Ridha with each entry beginning with a variation of " Through his chain of authorities , he said " . His father , who was said to have related these words to him , was killed at the Battle of Siffin . The family were descendants of Wahb ibn Amer who was killed with Husayn , son of Ali , at the Battle of Karbala . 
 Ali al @-@ Ridha was born around 151 AH ( 768 – 769 ) although possibly as late as 159 AH ( 775 – 76 ) , to the Imam Musa al @-@ Kadhim and one of his slaves , probably Nubian . His father died in a Baghdadi prison in Rajab , 183 AH ( September , 799 ) , during the caliphate of Harun al @-@ Rashid , one of the Abbasid dynasty . Ali al @-@ Ridha succeeded to his father 's property but not fully to his title . He began to teach and issue fatwas from the mosque in Medina , where he lived , but the caliphs did not confirm his title and many of his father 's trustees withheld their support ( and tithes ) under the pretense that his father would soon return as the Mahdi . Following Harun 's death in 809 , a civil war broke out between his sons Al @-@ Amin and Al @-@ Ma 'mun . Al @-@ Amin was beheaded in September 813 during the Siege of Baghdad but his followers continued their resistance under local governors or in favor of Al @-@ Ma 'mun 's uncle as late as 827 . 
 The death of Al @-@ Amin permitted Ali al @-@ Ridha greater opportunity to teach . In 200 AH ( 815 – 816 ) , Ali al @-@ Ridha was invited or forced by Al @-@ Ma 'mun to quit his home and estates in Medina and leave for the imperial capital in Khorasan . Al @-@ Ma 'mun proclaimed him as the new Imam throughout the empire upon his arrival at Merv in 201 AH ( 817 ) . He went further and named Ali al @-@ Ridha as his crown prince and successor to the caliphate . Following the assassination of the imperial vizier and during a relocation of the capital back to Baghdad , Ali al @-@ Ridha died suddenly , most probably on the last day of <unk> , 203 AH ( September , 818 ) . Most sources accuse Al @-@ Ma 'mun of having poisoned him .

 = Battle of Solachon = 
 The Battle of Solachon was fought in 586 CE in northern Mesopotamia between the East Roman ( Byzantine ) forces , led by Philippicus , and the Sassanid Persians under Kardarigan . The engagement was part of the long and inconclusive Byzantine – Sassanid War of 572 – 591 . The Battle of Solachon ended in a major Byzantine victory which improved the Byzantine position in Mesopotamia , but it was not in the end decisive . The war dragged on until 591 , when it ended with a negotiated settlement between Maurice and the Persian shah Khosrau II ( r . 590 – 628 ) . 
 In the days before the battle , Philippicus , newly assigned to the Persian front , moved to intercept an anticipated Persian invasion . He chose to deploy his army at Solachon , controlling the various routes of the Mesopotamian plain , and especially access to the main local watering source , the Arzamon river . Kardarigan , confident of victory , advanced against the Byzantines , but they had been warned and were deployed in battle order when Kardarigan reached Solachon . The Persians deployed as well and attacked , gaining the upper hand in the centre , but the Byzantine right wing broke through the Persian left flank . The successful Byzantine wing was thrown into disarray as its men headed off to loot the Persian camp , but Philippicus was able to restore order . Then , while the Byzantine centre was forced to form a shield wall to withstand the Persian pressure , the Byzantine left flank also managed to turn the Persians ' right . Under threat of a double envelopment , the Persian army collapsed and fled , with many dying in the desert of thirst or from water poisoning . Kardarigan himself survived and , with a part of his army , held out against Byzantine attacks on a hillock for several days before the Byzantines withdrew . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 572 the Byzantine ruler Justin II ( reigned 565 – 578 ) refused to renew the annual payments to Sassanid Persia that had been part of the peace agreement concluded by his uncle , Justinian I ( r . 527 – 565 ) and the Persian shah Khosrau I ( r . 531 – 579 ) in 562 . This marked the culmination of the progressive deterioration of Byzantine – Persian relations over the previous years , which manifested itself in diplomatic and military manoeuvring in their geopolitical periphery . Thus the Byzantines initiated contacts with the Central Asian Göktürks for a joint effort against Persia , while the Persians intervened in Yemen against the Christian <unk> , allies of Byzantium . Justin furthermore regarded the annual tribute as an indignity unworthy of Romans , and used the outbreak of a major revolt in Persian Armenia in 571 – 572 as a pretext for refusing to continue the payments . 
 Justin 's refusal was tantamount to a declaration of war , the fourth fought between the two great powers of Late Antiquity in the 6th century . After initial Persian successes such as the capture of Dara , the conflict proved inconclusive and became a drawn @-@ out affair , with Byzantine victories followed by Persian successes , intermittent negotiations , and temporary truces . In 582 , Maurice ( r . 582 – 602 ) , who had served as a general in the war , ascended to the Byzantine throne at Constantinople ; by that time , the Persians had gained the upper hand in Mesopotamia through their capture of Dara in 574 , while the Byzantines prevailed in Arzanene . 
 = = Initial moves and dispositions = = 
 Following the failure of another round of peace negotiations , about which little is known , Maurice appointed his brother @-@ in @-@ law Philippicus as the commander @-@ in @-@ chief for the Mesopotamian front ( magister militum per Orientem ) in 584 . Philippicus raided the region around the major Persian fortress of Nisibis in 584 , while in 585 he raided in Arzanene . The Persian commander , Kardarigan — " black hawk " , an honorific title rather than a proper name — responded with an unsuccessful siege of Philippicus ' main base , <unk> . 
 In spring 586 Maurice rejected new Persian proposals involving the conclusion of peace in exchange for renewed payments in gold . The contemporary historian Theophylact Simocatta reports that Philippicus ' army was eager to confront the Persians in battle , and the Byzantine commander marched south from his base at Amida , crossed the Arzamon river ( modern <unk> in south @-@ east Turkey and north @-@ east Syria ) to its eastern bank and advanced some 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) east to the plain of Solachon , where he pitched his camp . This position , south of the fortresses of <unk> and Dara , allowed Philippicus ' army to control the passage of the Arzamon river and forced the Persian army under Kardarigan to advance across the waterless plain , away from their supply routes , before meeting the Byzantine force . 
 On the Persian side , Kardarigan was also eager to fight and confident of victory . He arranged to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops in case the Byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to the Arzamon , and had allegedly prepared iron bars and chains for the prisoners he would take . His movements , however , were detected when the Byzantines ' Arab foederati captured a few of his men , allowing Philippicus to prepare his forces . This early warning was of particular importance since Kardarigan intended to attack on Sunday , a day of rest for the Christian Byzantines . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Both armies appear to have been composed exclusively of cavalry , comprising a mix of lancers and horse @-@ archers , possibly with a few cataphract units included . When Philippicus ' scouts reported the Persians ' approach , he positioned his men on elevated ground facing the direction from which the Persian army advanced , with his left flank protected by the foothills of Mount <unk> . The Byzantines appear to have been arranged in a single battle line with three divisions . The left division was commanded by <unk> , the dux of Phoenice <unk> , and included a Hunnic contingent of horse @-@ archers under <unk> . The centre was commanded by the general Heraclius the Elder , later Exarch of Africa and father of Emperor Heraclius ( r . 610 – 641 ) , while the right wing was commanded by the <unk> Vitalius . This arrangement was also adopted by the Persians as soon as they came into view of the Byzantine army . On the Persian side , the right division was under <unk> , the centre under Kardarigan himself , and the left wing under Kardarigan 's nephew , <unk> . Unlike the Persian general , Philippicus remained with a small force at some distance behind the main battle line , directing the battle . 
 After a short halt to leave their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly advanced on the Byzantines , shooting arrows as they approached . The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy . On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious , his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line . At this point , however , disaster threatened as many of Vitalius ' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp , intending to loot it . Philippicus , however , saw what had happened and reacted quickly . He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards , Theodore <unk> , and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself . The ruse worked : the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians , who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back . 
 To counter this , Philippicus ordered the men of the central division to dismount and form a shield @-@ wall with their lances projecting from it ( the <unk> formation ) . It is not clear what happened next , but apparently the Byzantine archers shot at the Persians ' horses , breaking their momentum . At the same time , the Byzantine left managed to launch a successful counter @-@ thrust which drove back the opposing Persian right in disarray . Soon the Persian right broke and fled , pursued by the Byzantines . With both wings having disintegrated , the Persian centre was now subjected to an attack from the reformed Byzantine right , which drove them towards the area once occupied by the Persian right . Outnumbered and attacked from several sides , the Persians soon began to break and flee . 
 The defeated army suffered greatly , not only from the Byzantine pursuit , but also due to lack of water : before the battle , Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground , trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon . In addition , the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since , according to Simocatta , Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives . Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank too much water from wells after their ordeal . Kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks . Finally , after three or four days , the Byzantines , not aware that the enemy commander was there , abandoned the effort . Kardarigan thus escaped , although his men suffered further casualties in the process , up to a thousand according to Simocatta , from Byzantine patrols . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the battle Philippicus rewarded the soldiers who had distinguished themselves and divided the spoils of the defeated Persians among them . He then proceeded to invade Arzanene again . However , his attempt to capture the fortress of <unk> was thwarted when Kardarigan arrived with reinforcements . The Byzantine army retreated to the fortress of <unk> , fighting rear @-@ guard actions with the shadowing Persians . 
 The victory of Solachon allowed the Byzantines to regain the upper hand in the region of the Tur Abdin and , in its aftermath , they began to re @-@ establish their control over the region around Dara . The war continued for a few years without a decision until the revolt of Bahram Chobin caused the rightful Persian shah , Khosrau II ( r . 590 – 628 ) , to find refuge in Byzantine territory . A joint expedition restored him to his throne and a peace treaty was concluded in 591 that left most of Armenia in Byzantine hands .

Dejected and demoralized , he stops in the deserted lab to eat the pizza while outside the whole world is getting ready to celebrate the beginning of New Year . At midnight , Fry falls into an open cryonic tube and is frozen as it immediately activates . He is defrosted on Tuesday , December 31 , 2999 , in what is now New New York City . He is taken to a fate assignment officer named Leela , a purple @-@ haired cyclops . To his misfortune , Fry is assigned the computer @-@ determined permanent career of delivery boy , and flees into the city when Leela tries to implant Fry 's career chip designating his job . 
 While trying to track down his only living relative , Professor Farnsworth , Fry befriends a suicidal robot named Bender . As they talk at a bar , Fry learns that Bender too has deserted his job of bending girders for suicide booths . Together , they evade Leela and hide in the Head Museum , where they encounter the preserved heads of historical figures . Fry and Bender eventually find themselves underground in the ruins of Old New York . 
 Leela finally catches Fry , who has become depressed that everyone that he knew and loved is dead and tells her that he will accept his career as a delivery boy . Leela sympathizes with Fry — she too is alone , and hates her job — so she quits and joins Fry and Bender as job deserters . The three track down Professor Farnsworth , founder of an intergalactic delivery company called Planet Express . With the help of Professor Farnsworth , the three evade the police by launching the Planet Express Ship at the stroke of midnight amid the New Year 's fireworks . As the year 3000 begins , Farnsworth hires the three as the crew of his ship . Fry inquires at what his job is , and learns that he will be a delivery boy . Fry , ironically , cheers at his new job .

 While the plot of the episode stands on its own , it also sets up much of the continuing plot of the series by including Easter eggs for events that do not occur until much later : as Fry falls into the freezer , the scene shows a strange shadow cast on the wall behind him . It is revealed in " The Why of Fry " that the shadow belongs to Nibbler , who intentionally pushes Fry into the freezer as part of a complex plan to save Earth from the <unk> in the future . Executive producer David X. Cohen claims that from the very beginning the creators had plans to show a larger conspiracy behind Fry 's journey to the future . In the movie Futurama : Bender 's Big Score , it is revealed that the spacecraft seen destroying the city while Fry is frozen are piloted by Bender and those chasing him after he steals the Nobel Peace Prize . 
 At the end of the episode , Professor Farnsworth offers Fry , Leela and Bender the Planet Express delivery crew positions . The professor produces the previous crew 's career chips from an envelope labeled " Contents of Space Wasp 's Stomach " . In a later episode , " The Sting " , the crew encounters the ship of the previous crew in a space beehive . When discussing this discontinuity in the episode commentary , writer of " The Sting " Patric <unk> states " we made liars out of the pilot " . 
 This episode introduces the fictional technology that allows preserved heads to be kept alive in jars . This technology makes it possible for the characters to interact with celebrities from the then @-@ distant past , and is used by the writers to comment on the 20th and 21st centuries in a satirical manner . 
 = = Production = = 
 In the DVD commentary , Matt Groening notes that beginning any television series is difficult , but he found particular difficulty starting one that took place in the future because of the amount of setup required . As a trade off , they included a lot of Easter eggs in the episode that would pay off in later episodes . He and Cohen point these out throughout the episode . The scene where Fry emerges from a cryonic tube and has his first view of New New York was the first 3D scene worked on by the animation team . It was considered to be a defining point for whether the technique would work or not . 
 Originally , the first person entering the pneumatic tube transport system declared " J.F.K. , Jr . Airport " as his destination . After John F. Kennedy , Jr . ' s death in the crash of his private airplane , the line has since been redubbed on all subsequent broadcasts and the DVD release to " Radio City Mutant Hall " ( a reference to Radio City Music Hall ) . The original version was heard only during the pilot broadcast and the first rerun a few months later . Although the original line is still used on repeat broadcasts in the UK on Satellite channel Sky One . ( The Region 2 DVD has the redubbed line ) . According to Groening , the inspiration for the suicide booth was the 1937 Donald Duck cartoon , " Modern Inventions " , in which the Duck is faced with — and nearly killed several times by — various push button gadgets in a Museum of the Future . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 In their original pitch to Fox , Groening and Cohen stated that they wanted the futuristic setting for the show to be neither " dark and drippy " like Blade Runner , nor " bland and boring " like The Jetsons . They felt that they could not make the future either a utopia or a dystopia because either option would eventually become boring . The creators gave careful consideration to the setting , and the influence of classic science fiction is evident in this episode as a series of references to — and parodies of — easily recognizable films , books and television programs . In the earliest glimpse of the future while Fry is frozen in the cryonic chamber , time is seen passing outside the window until reaching the year 3000 . This scene was inspired by a similar scene in the film The Time Machine based on H.G. Wells ' novel . When Fry awakens in the year 2999 , he is greeted with Terry 's catchphrase " Welcome to the world of tomorrow " . The scene is a joke at the expense of Futurama 's namesake , the Futurama ride at the 1939 World 's Fair whose tag line was " The World of Tomorrow " . Dick Clark made a cameo as a head in a jar , hosting Dick Clark 's New Year 's Rockin ' Eve 3000 . 
 In addition to the setting , part of the original concept for the show was that there would be a lot of advanced technology similar to that seen in Star Trek , but it would be constantly malfunctioning . The automatic doors at Applied <unk> resemble those in Star Trek : The Original Series ; however , they malfunction when Fry remarks on this similarity . In another twist , the two policemen who try to arrest Fry at the head museum use weapons which are visually similar to lightsabers used in the Star Wars film series ; however , they are functionally more similar to nightsticks . The interaction between the characters was not overlooked . The relationship formed between Fry and Bender in this episode has been compared to the relationship between Will Robinson and the robot in Lost in Space . 
 Although both Futurama and The Simpsons were created by Matt Groening , overt references to the latter are mostly avoided in Futurama . One of the few exceptions to this rule is the appearance of Blinky , a three @-@ eyed orange fish seen on The Simpsons , as Fry is going through the tube . A running gag of the series is Bender 's fondness for Olde Fortran malt liquor , named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran . The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so closely associated with the character that he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA wind @-@ up toy and the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 In a review by Patrick Lee in Science Fiction Weekly based on a viewing of this episode alone , Futurama was deemed not as funny as The Simpsons , particularly as " the satire is leavened with treacly sentimental bits about free will and loneliness " . The episode was rated as an " A- pick " and found to " warrant further viewing " despite these concerns . Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette noted that although the episode contained the same skewed humor as The Simpsons , it was not as smart and funny , and he attributed this to the large amount of exposition and character introduction required of a television series pilot , noting that the show was " off to a good start " . Andrew Billen of the New Statesman found the premise of the episode to be unoriginal , but remained somewhat enthusiastic about the future of the series . While he praised the humorous details of the episode , such as the background scenes while Fry was frozen , he also criticized the show 's dependence on in @-@ jokes such as Groening 's head being present in the head museum . 
 In its initial airing , the episode had " unprecedented strong numbers " with a Nielsen rating of 11 @.@ 2 / 17 in homes and 9 @.@ 6 / 23 in adults 18 – 49 . The Futurama premiere was watched by more people than either its lead @-@ in show ( The Simpsons ) or the show following it ( The X @-@ Files ) , and it was the number one show among men aged 18 – 49 and teenagers for the week . The episode was ranked in 2006 by IGN as number 14 in their list of the top 25 Futurama episodes . 
 = Boys Don 't Cry ( film ) = 
 Boys Don 't Cry is a 1999 American romantic drama film directed by Kimberly Peirce and co @-@ written by Peirce and Andy Bienen . The film is a dramatization of the real @-@ life story of Brandon Teena , an American trans man played in the film by Hilary Swank , who adopts a male identity and attempts to find himself and love in Nebraska but falls victim to a brutal hate crime perpetrated by two male acquaintances . The film also stars Chloë Sevigny , Peter Sarsgaard , Brendan Sexton III , and Alicia Goranson . After reading about the murders while in college , Peirce researched the case and worked on the screenplay for almost five years . Peirce was inspired by All She Wanted , a 1996 book about the killing written by Aphrodite Jones ; however , she chose to focus the story of the film on the relationship between Brandon and his girlfriend Lana Tisdel . Many actors sought the lead role during a three @-@ year casting process before Swank was cast . Swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to Teena 's . Sevigny initially auditioned for the role of Brandon , but Peirce could not picture her playing a man , so she was ultimately cast as Teena 's girlfriend Lana . Most of the film 's characters were based on real @-@ life people ; others were composites . 
 Filming occurred during October and November 1998 in the Dallas , Texas area . The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City , Nebraska , where the real @-@ life events had taken place ; however , budget constraints meant that principal photography had to occur in Texas . The film 's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced by a variety of styles , including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese , while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country , blues , and rock music from the film . The film 's themes , which have been explored by many scholars , include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships , the causes of violence against LGBT people , transgender people and the gender binary , and the relationship among social class , race , and gender . 
 The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 8 , 1999 , before appearing at various other film festivals . Distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures , the film received a limited release in the United States on October 22 , 1999 , and it performed well at the North American box office , gaining three times its production budget by May 2000 . The film received overwhelming acclaim from critics . It was widely lauded as one of the best films of the year ; praise focused on the lead performances by Swank and Sevigny as well as the film 's depiction of its subject matter . However , some people who had been involved with Brandon in real life criticized the film for not portraying the events accurately . Boys Don 't Cry was nominated for multiple awards ; at the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000 , Swank was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress and Sevigny was nominated for Best Supporting Actress . The pair were also nominated at the 57th Golden Globe Awards , with Swank winning the Best Actress – Drama award . Boys Don 't Cry , which dealt with controversial issues , was initially assigned an NC @-@ 17 rating but was later reclassified to an R rating . It was released on home video in September 2000 .

 Brandon Teena was a trans man who was raped and murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993 , when he was 21 . Kimberly Peirce , at the time a Columbia University film student , became interested in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna <unk> . Peirce became engrossed in Brandon 's life and death ; she said , " the minute I read about Brandon , I fell in love . With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy , the fact that he did it with no role models . The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me . " The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest . Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon 's life as part of what eventually causes his death . She admired Brandon 's audacity , ability to solve complicated problems , and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality . 
 Peirce wanted to tell the story from Brandon 's perspective . She was familiar with Brandon 's desire to wear men 's clothing : " I started looking at all the other coverage and a great deal of it was sensational . People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people . Where to me , I knew girls who had passed as boys , so Brandon was not some weird person to me . Brandon was a very familiar person . " Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case , believing the American public were generally misinformed : she said , " People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that 's really dangerous , especially with this culture of violence that we live in " . Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title Take It Like a Man . 
 The project drew interest from various production companies . Diane Keaton 's production company , Blue Relief , showed interest in the screenplay in the mid @-@ 1990s . Initially , the film was to be largely based on Aphrodite Jones ' 1996 true crime book All She Wanted , which told the story of Brandon 's final few weeks . Earlier drafts of the script incorporated scenes featuring Brandon 's family background , including his sister Tammy and mother Joann , as well as some of Teena 's ex @-@ girlfriends . However , Peirce modified the script to fit her vision to focus on the relationship between Brandon and his 19 @-@ year @-@ old girlfriend Lana Tisdel , which Peirce termed a " great love story " , in contrast to All She Wanted , which did not place an emphasis on the relationship . To fund the writing and development of the project , Peirce worked as a paralegal on a midnight shift and as a 35mm film projectionist ; she also received a grant from New York Foundation for the Arts . The project attracted the attention of producer Christine Vachon , who had seen a short film Peirce had made for her thesis in 1995 . IFC Films , Hart Sharp Entertainment , and Killer Films , Vachon and Eva Kolodner 's production company , provided financing for the project . IFC contributed roughly $ 1 million , but the film 's eventual budget remained under $ 2 million . Peirce co @-@ wrote the screenplay with Andy Bienen . They worked together for 18 months on the final drafts and were careful not to " mythologize " Brandon ; the aim was to keep him as human as possible . In the editing stage of the script , Peirce sent the draft to Fox Searchlight Pictures , which agreed to produce and distribute the film while giving Peirce artistic license . 
 Prior to filming , Peirce researched the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case . She immersed herself in the information available about the murder , including trial transcripts . She met Lana Tisdel at a convenience store and interviewed her at Tisdel 's home . Tisdel , who began dating Brandon just two weeks before he was murdered , was 19 @-@ years @-@ old at the time of the murders and lived in Falls City with her mother . Peirce also interviewed Tisdel 's mother and Brandon 's friends . However , she was unable to interview Brandon 's mother or any of his biological family . Much factual information , including Nissen being a convicted arsonist , was incorporated into Boys Don 't Cry . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The filmmakers retained the names of most of the case 's real @-@ life protagonists , but the names of several supporting characters were altered . For example , the character of Candace was named Lisa Lambert in real life . The casting process for Boys Don 't Cry lasted almost four years . Drew Barrymore was an early candidate to star in the film . Peirce scouted the LGBT community , looking mainly for masculine , lesbian women for the role of Brandon Teena . Peirce said the LGBT community was very interested in the project because of the publicity surrounding the murder . High @-@ profile actors avoided Peirce 's auditions at the request of their agents because of the stigma associated with the role . At one point , the project was nearly abandoned because Peirce was not satisfied with most of the people who auditioned . In 1996 , after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected , the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project . Swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition . During her audition , Swank , who was 22 , lied to Peirce about her age . Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age . When Peirce later confronted her about her lie , Swank responded , " But that 's what Brandon would do " . Swank 's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her ; Peirce said she did not want a " known actor " to portray Teena . In addition , Peirce felt that Swank 's audition was " the first time I saw someone who not only blurred the gender lines , but who was this beautiful , androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants , who smiled and loved being Brandon . " 
 Peirce required that Swank " make a full transformation " into a male . Immediately after being cast , Peirce took Swank to a hairdresser , where her lower @-@ back length hair was cut and dyed chestnut brown . When she saw her then @-@ husband , Chad Lowe , again , he barely recognized her . Swank prepared for the role by dressing and living as a man for at least a month , including wrapping her chest in tension bandages and putting socks down the front of her trousers as Brandon Teena had done . Her masquerade was convincing ; Swank 's neighbors believed the " young man " coming and going from her home was Swank 's visiting brother . She reduced her body fat to seven percent to accentuate her facial structure and refused to let the cast and crew see her out of costume . Swank earned $ 75 per day for her work on Boys Don 't Cry , totaling $ 3 @,@ 000 . Her earnings were so low that she did not qualify for health insurance . 
 For the role of Brandon 's girlfriend , Lana Tisdel , Peirce had envisioned a young Jodie Foster . The role was also offered to Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Polley . Peirce ultimately decided to cast Chloë Sevigny based on her performance in The Last Days of Disco ( 1998 ) . Sevigny had auditioned for the role of Brandon , but Peirce decided Sevigny would be more suited to playing Lana because she could not picture Sevigny as a man . 
 " There 's a moment in The Last Days of Disco when Chloë does this little dance move and flirts with the camera , " she says . " She has this mix of attractiveness , flirtation and sophistication that she gives you , but then takes away very quickly so that you want more : you want to reach into the screen and grab her . When I saw that , and her confidence and wit , I thought : if she could flirt with Brandon and the audience in that way , that 's exactly what we need for Lana . I said to her , ' Will you please audition to play Lana ? ' She said , ' No . ' And I said , ' OK , you can have the role . ' " 
 Sevigny dyed her hair red for the role to match Lana 's strawberry blonde hair . Peirce later said , " Chloë just surrendered to the part . She watched videos of Lana . She just became her very naturally . " 
 Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter , Lana 's former boyfriend , who raped and murdered Teena . Sarsgaard was one of the first choices for the role . He later said he wanted his character to be " likable , sympathetic even " , because he wanted the audience " to understand why they would hang out with me . If my character wasn 't necessarily likable , I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren 't going to have a dull time if you were with him . " In another interview , Sarsgaard said he felt " empowered " by playing Lotter . In an interview with The Independent , Sarsgaard said , " I felt very sexy , weirdly , playing John Lotter . I felt like I was just like the sheriff , y 'know , and that everyone loved me . " Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role . Peirce cast Alicia Goranson , known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne , as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert . Like Sevigny , Goranson had initially auditioned for the lead role . 
 = = = Principal photography = = = 
 Initially , Boys Don 't Cry was scheduled to film for thirty days . However , principal photography for the film lasted from October 19 to November 24 , 1998 . The small budget dictated some of the filming decisions , including the omission of some incidents to speed up the overall pacing . Timing constraints and Peirce 's visions relating to the plot limited what could be achieved with the narrative . For example , the film portrays a double murder when in actuality a third person , Phillip DeVine — a black disabled man — was also killed at the scene . At the time , he had been dating Lana Tisdel 's sister , Leslie , who was omitted from the story . Boys Don 't Cry was primarily filmed in Greenville , Texas , a small town about 45 mi ( 72 km ) northeast of Dallas . Most of the incidents in the case took place in Falls City , Nebraska , but budget constraints led the filmmakers to choose locations in Texas . Peirce initially wanted to shoot in Falls City , but Vachon told her that filming there would not be possible . Afterwards , the film was going to be shot in Omaha , Nebraska , but Peirce felt that " none of [ the places ] looked right . " In addition , Peirce also scouted filming locations in Kansas and Florida before deciding on Texas . One of Peirce 's main goals was for the audience to sympathize with Brandon . On the film 's DVD commentary track , Peirce said , " The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it . I wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place , this character , so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon 's own mind and would not think he was crazy , would not think he was lying , but would see him as more deeply human " . 
 Some scenes in Boys Don 't Cry required emotional and physical intensity ; these were allocated extended periods of filming . The scene in which Brandon , at the wishes of his friends , bumper @-@ skis on the back of a pickup truck , was delayed when a police officer , just arriving at a shift change , required a large lighting crane to be moved from one side of the road to the other . The scenes took six hours to shoot and were filmed at sunrise , resulting in a blue sky being seen in the background . There were some technical complications : some of the filming equipment got stuck in mud , and radio wires in some of the scenes conflicted with the sound production . Swank required a stunt double for a scene in which she falls off the back of a truck . Teena 's rape scene was given an extended filming time ; Sexton , who portrayed one of the attackers , walked away in tears afterward . Swank found portraying her character daunting and felt the need to " keep a distance " from the reality of the actual event . When scenes became difficult , Swank requested the company of her husband on set . At times , Peirce worked for seventeen hours a day in order to complete more work , but the other crew members told her that this was taking up potential nighttime filming hours . 
 = = = Cinematography = = = 
 Peirce , who had originally sought a career in photography before moving into filmmaking , applied techniques she had learned into the film . She described the film 's mood as " artificial night " . Director of Photography Jim Denault showed her the work of photographer Jan Staller , whose long @-@ exposure night photography under artificial lighting inspired Denault to avoid using " moonlight " effects for most of the film . As a way to further incorporate the sense of artificial night , John Pirozzi , who had been experimenting with time @-@ lapse photography using a non @-@ motion @-@ controlled moving camera , was invited to create the transition shots seen throughout the film . 
 The film 's visual style depicts the Midwestern United States in a " withdrawn " , dark and understated light to give a " surreal " effect . Denault shot Boys Don 't Cry in flat , spherical format on 35 mm film using Kodak Vision film stock . The film was shot with a Moviecam Compact camera fitted with Carl Zeiss super speed lenses . For the scene in which Brandon is stripped , a hand @-@ held camera was used to give a sense of subjectivity and intimacy . 
 The use of low natural light and heavy artificial light is illustrated early in the film in the opening roller rink scene in which Brandon pursues his first relationship with a young woman . For this scene , Peirce used a three @-@ shot method similar to that used in a scene in The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) in which Dorothy leaves her house and enters Oz . The scene consists of a three @-@ shot sequence meant to symbolize Brandon 's metaphorical " entrance to manhood " , or Brandon 's social transition from a woman to a man . Some scenes were given a prolonged shooting sequence to induce a feeling of hallucination . An example is the sequence in which Brandon and Lana first have sex , followed by a shot of her , Brandon , Candace , and Kate driving in a car against a city skyline backdrop . The scene in which John and Tom strip Brandon was filmed with three cameras due to time constraints , even though Peirce wanted six cameras to film it . The scene took an hour and a half to film in total . 
 Peirce drew inspiration from the filming style of John Cassavetes and the early work of Martin Scorsese , and she incorporated neo @-@ realist techniques into the film . She was also influenced by a second style of work — the " magical " films of Michael Powell and Kenji Mizoguchi . The former style is used when Brandon joins the social circle of John , Tom , Lana and her mother , while the latter is used when Brandon and Lana begin to depart from that life . The film was also influenced by Bonnie and Clyde ( 1967 ) . Peirce incorporated influences from Raging Bull ( 1980 ) by opening the film with a shot of Brandon traveling along a highway , as seen from the character 's imaginative or dream perspective , similar to the beginning of Raging Bull . When a character expresses a dream or hopeful assertion , Peirce cuts to an " eerily lit " dream landscape . The Pawnbroker ( 1964 ) inspired the cinematography and editing of Brandon 's rape scene , particularly in its use of fast cutting . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Because the film is set in the rural Midwestern United States , the Boys Don 't Cry soundtrack album features a compilation of country , blues and rock music . Nathan Larson and Nina Persson of The Cardigans composed an instrumental version of Restless Heart 's 1988 country @-@ pop song " The Bluest Eyes in Texas " , a variation of which was used as the film 's love theme and score . The song itself is heard during a karaoke scene , sung by Sevigny 's character , and at the end of the film . The title of the film is taken from the song of the same name by British rock band The Cure . An American cover of the song , sung by Nathan Larson , plays in the background in the scene in which Lana bails Brandon out of jail and during one of their sex scenes . However , the song is not included on the released soundtrack . Songs by Lynyrd Skynyrd ( " Tuesday 's Gone " ) , Paisley Underground band Opal ( " She 's a Diamond " ) and The Charlatans ( " <unk> Blues " ) also appear in the film , as do cover versions of other songs . The soundtrack was released on November 23 , 1999 , by Koch Records . " The Bluest Eyes in Texas " was played when Hilary Swank went onstage to receive her Academy Award for Best Actress in 2000 . The song also plays over the film 's end credits . 
 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 Boys Don 't Cry has been widely discussed and analyzed by scholars and others . Roger Ebert described the film as a " romantic tragedy " embedded in a working class American setting , calling it " Romeo and Juliet set in a Nebraska trailer park " . Philosopher Rebecca Hanrahan argued that the question of identity — particularly Brandon 's — is alluded to frequently in Boys Don 't Cry and that Peirce poses the nature of identification and self as the film 's main question . Journalist Janet Maslin said the film is about accepting identity , which in turn means accepting the fate predisposed for that identity . Paula <unk> called the film a " bold cautionary tale " ; she regarded the film as a negative , dismal depiction of Midwestern America , writing that " [ Peirce 's film has ] captured the mystique and eerie loneliness " and " isolation of the Midwest , with its dusty desolation and nowhere @-@ to @-@ go frustration that propels people to violence and despair " . 
 Christine Vachon , the film 's executive producer , said , " It 's not just about two stupid thugs who killed somebody . It 's about these guys whose world is so tenuous and so fragile that they can 't stand to have any of their beliefs shattered " , referring to John and Tom 's views of their lives , Brandon 's aspirations and his biological sex . Along with other turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ millennium films such as In the Company of Men ( 1997 ) , American Beauty ( 1999 ) , Fight Club ( 1999 ) , and American Psycho ( 2000 ) , Vincent Hausmann said Boys Don 't Cry " raises the broader , widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis " . Jason Wood said the film , together with Patty Jenkins 's Monster ( 2003 ) , is an exploration of " social problems " . 
 = = = Romantic and platonic relationships = = = 
 Several scholars commented on the relationship between Brandon and Lana as well as Brandon 's relationship to John and Tom . Carol Siegel regarded the film as a thematically rich love story between two ill @-@ fated lovers , similarly to Romeo and Juliet . Judith Halberstam ( or Jack Halberstam ) attributed Boys Don 't Cry 's success to its ostensible argument for tolerance of sexual diversity by depicting a relationship between two unlikely people . This tragic aspect of the love story led Halberstam to compare Brandon and Lana 's relationship and subsequent drama to classic and modern romances including Romeo and Juliet , often using the term star @-@ crossed lovers . In the Journal for Creativity in Mental Health , <unk> Veronique Aguilar discussed Brandon 's ability to create interpersonal relationships in the film . She opined that Brandon wanted to create close relationships , but he could not due to his transgender status until he became close with Lana . " Although Brandon is able to make a brief but authentic connection with Lana , he continues to experience a sense of aloneness in the world . He consistently faces a sense of fear related to the power @-@ over dynamics that he and others who are transsexual face … Brandon experiences the central relational paradox , in which he yearns for connection ; however , due to the real threat he faces , he is unable to make that connection . " 
 Myra Hird , in the International Feminist Journal of Politics , argued that John and Brandon exemplify two different and contrasting types of masculinity , and that Brandon 's version is preferred by the film 's female characters , comparing them to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jimmy Stewart , respectively . " Throughout the film , John offers the viewer a typified narrative of heteronormative masculinity . [ … ] Against this hegemonic masculinity , Brandon offers a masculinity reminiscent of a by @-@ gone era of chivalry . " Furthermore , she contended that John was threatened by Brandon 's version of masculinity . " Gender boundaries are taken extremely seriously in Western society , and Boys Don 't Cry depicts how intensely threatened John and Tom are by Brandon 's superior portrayal of a masculinity ' schedule ' . John cannot abide Brandon 's desire , and clear ability , to access male privilege , and his reaction is to force Brandon to be female through the act of rape . "

 Other commentators discussed the more complex psychological causes of Brandon 's murder . Halberstam commented on the complicated causes of the murder , and whether it was due to transphobia or homophobia : " Ultimately in Boys [ Don 't Cry ] , the double vision of the transgender subject gives way to the universal vision of humanism , the transgender man and his lover become lesbians and the murder seems instead to be the outcome of vicious homophobic rage . " Ebert called the film a " sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame " . In the same journal , Julianne Pidduck commented on the film 's rape and murder scenes , " Effectively , the viewer is asked to experience the rape from the victim 's point of view . The film invites political , emotional and corporeal allegiances linked to known and imagined risk , especially for female and / or queer viewers . An allegiance with Brandon 's outsider status aligns the viewer with Brandon 's initial exhilaration at his transgressive success as a boy , drawing us through to the film 's disturbing finale . "

 Many scholars addressed the various performances of gender by the characters in the film ; Moss and Lynne <unk> offered a psychoanalytic analysis , calling the film a " case report " that " presents [ Brandon 's ] transsexual inclinations as a series of euphoric conquests " and " focuses on a range of anxious reactions to her [ sic ] transsexuality . [ … ] or a case not for what they might reveal about female hysteria , but for what they might reveal about misogyny " . Elaborating on the themes of the film , they wrote : 
 In her film , Pierce [ sic ] inserts the unconventional problems of transsexuality into a conventional narrative structure . Throughout the film Brandon is presented as a doomed , though beguiling and beautiful rascal , recognizably located in the lineage of well @-@ known cinematic bad @-@ boys like James Dean , Steve McQueen , and Paul Newman . Like these predecessors , Brandon 's heroic stature derives from her [ sic ] unwillingness to compromise her [ sic ] identity … Pierce [ sic ] presents Brandon 's struggles against biological determinism as the struggles of a dignified renegade . 
 Brenda Cooper , in Critical Studies in Media Communication , argued that the film " can be read as a liberatory narrative that queers the centers of heteronormativity and hegemonic masculinity by privileging female masculinity and celebrating its differences from heterosexual norms . " She argued that the film challenged heteronormativity by criticizing the concept of the American Heartland , by presenting problems with heterosexual masculinity and its internalised aggression , by " centering female masculinity " , and blurring gender boundaries . Later on in the same essay , she commented that Brandon both embodied and rejected traditional masculinity , providing a new outlook on what it means to be a man which excited and thrilled the women in the film : " Brandon ’ s performance of masculinity , however , can be interpreted as operating on two levels in the narratives : When Brandon tries to establish his male identity with his new buddies , he imitates the kind of overly aggressive macho machismo that John and Tom represent . But Lana falls for Brandon because of his version of masculinity , which contradicts and challenges traditional assumptions about what it takes to be a man and to please a woman . Brandon ’ s articulation of manhood effectively mocks sexist masculine ideals and appropriates the codes of normative masculinity . " Michele Aaron , in Screen , claimed that the film was primarily centered on " the spectacle of transvestism " and that the film as a whole was " a tale of passing " . 
 Jennifer Esposito wrote that " We watch onscreen as Brandon binds his breasts , packs a dildo , fixes his hair in a mirror . His masculinity is carefully scripted . John and Tom … are never shown preparing for masculinity . They are already masculine . " Melissa Rigney argued that the film defied traditional portrayals of transgender characters by not confining Brandon to certain stereotypes . " On the surface , Boys Don 't Cry appears to hold the potential of rendering gender in excess : the figure of Brandon Teena can be read variously as butch , male , lesbian , transgender , transsexual , and heterosexual . [ … ] Although female masculinity comes to the forefront in this film , I argue that the film attempts to subsume the transgressive potential of the gender outlaw within a lesbian framework and narrative , one that reduces and , ultimately , nullifies Brandon 's gender and sexual excess . " In contrast , Annabelle Wilcox opined that the film primarily reinforced the gender binary by showing that " Brandon 's body is branded by such rhetoric and representation , and is assumed to be a site of ' truth ' that closes the question that being transgender poses for subjectivity , gender , and sexuality . " She also went on to note that many film critics either disregarded Brandon 's male identity or used female pronouns when referring to him . Rachel Swan , writing for Film Quarterly , wrote that Brandon 's masculinity was often contrasted with Lana 's femininity as a means of illustrating the two sides of the gender binary . In addition , she regarded John and Tom 's rape of Brandon as an attempt to psychologically castrate him . 
 In another piece , Halberstam compared the media portrayal of Brandon to that of Billy Tipton , a jazz musician who no one knew was transgender until the post @-@ mortem discovery that he was assigned female at birth . She wrote , " On some level Brandon 's story , while cleaving to its own specificity , needs to remain an open narrative — not a stable narrative of FTM transsexual identity nor a singular tale of queer bashing , not a cautionary fable about the violence of rural America nor an advertisement for urban organizations of queer community ; like the narrative of Billy Tipton , Brandon 's story permits a dream of transformation . " Christine Dando argued that " masculinity is associated with outside and femininity with interior spaces . " 
 = = = Social class and race = = = 
 Lisa Henderson commented on the intersection between social class and gender in the film , particularly Brandon 's working @-@ class status : " My reading of Boys [ Don 't Cry ] through the lens of class representation is not born of a univocal search for so @-@ called positive images , but I do recoil at what appears to me to be a new instalment in a long history of popular images of working @-@ class pathology . [ … ] But that is not the whole story . Within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening night @-@ time light , characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love , acceptance and a better life . " Jennifer Devere Brody commented on the film 's exclusion of Philip DeVine , a disabled African @-@ American man who was another victim of the shooting . " Perhaps one can only speculate about the motivations behind this decision . But the effects are familiar ones in the history of racist representations . The erasure of DeVine from the narrative places the white female bodies as the only true victims of crime ; and the film 's inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates the myth of the black man as always already a perpetrator of crime . " Regarding Devine , Halberstam wrote , " Peirce perhaps thought that her film , already running close to two hours , could not handle another subplot , but the story of Philip DeVine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender , race , sexuality , and class that was enacted in the heartland . Race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white , Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine 's story from Boys Don 't Cry , Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race , consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion . " 
 = = = Culture of the Midwestern United States = = = 
 Several authors commented on the possible impact that the film 's setting of Falls City , Nebraska , located in the Midwestern United States , could have had on the film 's plot . Maslin called Boys Don 't Cry a tale of a trapped , small town character 's search for life beyond the rural existence and the high price he pays for his view of the " American dream " . Regarding the film 's portrayal of Nebraska , Halberstam wrote , " The landscape of Nebraska then serves as a contested site upon which multiple narratives unfold , narratives indeed which refuse to collapse into simply one story . Some of these narratives are narratives of hate , some of desire ; others tell of ignorance and brutality ; still others of isolation and fear ; some allow violence and ignorant prejudices to become the essence of white poor rural identity ; still others provoke questions about the deployment of whiteness and the regulation of violence . " 
 Christina Dando wrote that the typical portrayal of the Midwest as a " frontier " area did not come through in the film until the setting switched from Lincoln to Falls City : " The flat landscape , the spacious sky , the home , evoke two different Plains time periods familiar to many Americans through historic photographs : the early settlement process … and 1930s Farm Security Administration photographs . It is virtually timeless . There is also a sense of both place and <unk> . While the landscape is distinctively Plains , it could be described as nowhere . " She went on to argue that the setting is not only conveyed visually , but also through the characters ' homes . " While there is no trailer park in Falls City , Brandon 's community there occupies the margin : Candace and Lana 's homes appear to be on the outskirts of town , or even outside of town . There are no complete families , only the family that that has been created . The men appear to have no homes , relationally or physically : none are shown to have family . Speaking about the film 's cinematography and the relation to its themes : 
 The Plains frontier landscape as it is constructed in Boys Don 't Cry is dark , literally and figuratively . Most of the scenes are set at night , utilizing night Plains skies with time @-@ lapse clouds , heightening the isolation . Film frames of placeless and timeless . The community also is dark . It is marginal , just managing to get along , and in the end deadly . While the classic Western dichotomy of men associated with exteriors and women with interiors is apparent , so too is Brandon 's border @-@ crossing . He appears to be able to easily handle both landscapes , yet belong to neither . 
 Dando compared the film to other tragic books and films that have been set on the Great Plains , including My Ántonia , Giants in the Earth , The Grapes of Wrath , In Cold Blood , and Badlands , writing that unlike the other works , " Brandon is [ a ] character who truly crosses frontiers . "

 Boys Don 't Cry aired in Canada at the Toronto International Film Festival ( TIFF ) in September 1999 . It premiered in the U.S. at the New York Film Festival on October 8 , 1999 , to critical acclaim . It was shown at the Reel Affirmations International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in early October , where it won further praise and appeared at the Venice International Film Festival . Boys Don 't Cry was given a special screening in snippets at the Sundance Film Festival . At that time , the film was still called Take It Like a Man . The film received a limited release theatrically on October 22 , 1999 , in the U.S. , where it was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures , a subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox that specializes in independent films . Initially , many viewers complained via email to Peirce that the film was not being shown near them , as the film was only being shown on 25 screens across the country . However , this number increased to nearly 200 by March 2000 . The film grossed $ 73 @,@ 720 in its opening week . By December 5 , the film had grossed in excess of $ 2 million .

 Critics lauded Boys Don 't Cry in 1999 , with many calling it one of the best films of the year . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 88 % of 75 professional critics gave the film a positive review ; the site consensus is that " Hilary Swank 's acclaimed performance pays fitting tribute to the tragic life of Brandon Teena " . Another review aggregator , Metacritic , gave the film an 86 of 100 , indicating " universal acclaim " . One reviewer said the film was a " critical knockout " . 
 Critics often praised the performances by Swank and Sevigny ; Peter Travers said the pair " give performances that burn in the memory " , and The Film Stage termed Swank 's performance " one of the greatest " Best Actress Oscar @-@ winning performances . Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded the lead acting performances of Swank , Sevigny , <unk> , and Sexton III , writing , " It may be the best @-@ acted film of the year " . Online film reviewer James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four ; he highlighted the performances of Swank and Sevigny as the film 's greatest success and likened the film 's intensity to that of a train wreck . Berardinelli wrote that Swank " gives the performance of her career " and that " Sevigny 's performance is more conventional than Swank 's , but no less effective . She provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film . " Emanuel Levy of Variety Magazine called the acting " flawless " and concluded that the " stunningly accomplished " and " candid " film could be " seen as a Rebel Without a Cause for these culturally diverse and complex times , with the two misfits enacting a version of the James Dean — Natalie Wood romance with utmost conviction , searching , like their ' 50s counterparts , for love , self @-@ worth and a place to call home " . Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post said the performances are of such " luminous humanity that they break your heart " . Premiere listed Swank 's performance as one of the " 100 Greatest Performances of All Time " . Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called Swank a " revelation " and wrote , " by the end , her Brandon / Teena is beyond male or female . It 's as if we were simply glimpsing the character 's soul , in all its yearning and conflicted beauty . " 
 Other reviewers were positive towards the way Boys Don 't Cry portrayed its subject <unk> and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times listed Boys Don 't Cry as one of the five best films of 1999 , saying , " this could have been a clinical movie of the week , but instead it 's a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame " . Janet Maslin of The New York Times said the film was " stunning " and gave it four stars out of four stars . Maslin said , " unlike most films about mind @-@ numbing tragedy , this one manages to be full of hope " . Kenneth Turan of The Los Angeles Times praised the lack of romanticization and dramatization of the characters , and wrote , " Peirce and Bienen and the expert cast engage us in the actuality of these rootless , hopeless , stoned @-@ out lives without sentimentalizing or romanticizing them " and that " Boys Don 't Cry is an exceptional — and exceptionally disturbing film " . Mike Clarke of USA Today commended Peirce 's depth of knowledge of the case and the subject matter , writing , " Peirce seems to have researched her subject with grad @-@ school @-@ thesis intensity " . 
 Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote , " Boys Don 't Cry not only revisits the crime , but convinces us we 're being taken inside it " . Stephanie Zacharek of Salon gave a positive review , singling out the directing and acting . She wrote , " Peirce ... covers an extraordinary amount of territory , not just in terms of dealing with Brandon ’ s sexual @-@ identity and self @-@ fulfillment issues , but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him " . Zacharek described Swank 's performance as " a continual revelation " and Sevigny 's performance as " transformative " . She said , " When Brandon dies , " Boys Don ’ t Cry " reaches an emotional intensity that ’ s almost operatic . The saddest thing , though , is seeing Sevigny ’ s Lana crumpled over his corpse — the way she plays it , you know that when Brandon went , he took a part of her with him , too " . David Edelstein of Slate was also very positive towards the film , calling it " a meditation on the irrelevance of gender . " He went on to praise Swank , Sevigny , and Sarsgaard in their roles , especially Sevigny , writing that she " keeps the movie tantalizing " . 
 The film was not without detractors , who focused on the film 's portrayal of Brandon and his actions . Richard Corliss of Time magazine was one of the film 's negative reviewers ; he wrote , " the film lets down the material . It 's too cool : all attitude , no sizzle " . Peter Rainer of New York Magazine compared the film unfavorably with Rebel Without a Cause ( 1954 ) , calling it a " transgendered " version , elaborating that the film " could have used a tougher and more exploratory spirit ; for Peirce , there was no cruelty , no derangement in Brandon 's impostures toward the unsuspecting . " In 2007 , Premiere ranked the film on its list of the " The 25 Most Dangerous Movies " . 
 The film was generally well @-@ received by the LGBT community . Boys Don 't Cry 's release came a year after the murder of a homosexual teenager , Matthew Shepard , which occurred October 12 , 1998 . The murder sparked additional public interest in hate crime legislation in America and in Brandon Teena , and increased public interest in Boys Don 't Cry . Cooper wrote that Boys Don 't Cry " is perhaps the only film addressing the issue of female masculinity by a self @-@ described queer filmmaker to reach mainstream audiences and to receive critical acclaim and prestigious awards . " However , Noelle Howey , writing for Mother Jones , wrote that despite the critical acclaim , relatively few critics understood what she perceived as the main point of the film — Brandon being a victim of trans bashing . Howey said , " Even a cursory glance at reviews of " Boys Don 't Cry " reveals that while most critics admired the film , few absorbed its main point : that Brandon Teena was a biological girl who felt innately that she was a man . Most of the media instead cast Teena as a Yentl for the new millennium , rather than a victim of anti @-@ transgender bigotry . " 
 = = = = Factual accuracy = = = = 
 The accuracy of Boys Don 't Cry was disputed by real @-@ life people involved in the murder . The real Lana Tisdel declared her dislike for the film ; she said Brandon never proposed to her and that when she discovered the truth about Brandon 's sex , she ended the relationship and left him . Tisdel disliked the way she was portrayed in the film , and called the film the " second murder of Brandon Teena " . Before the film 's theatrical release , Lana Tisdel sued the film 's producers , claiming that the film depicted her as " lazy , white trash and a skanky snake " and that her family and friends had come to see her as " a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder " . Tisdel said the film falsely portrayed her continuing her relationship with Teena after she discovered he was transgender . Tisdel settled her lawsuit against Fox Searchlight for an undisclosed sum . Sarah Nissen , cousin of perpetrator Marvin Nissen , was also critical of the film , saying , " There 's none of it that 's right . It was just weird . " Leslie Tisdel , Lana 's sister , called the film " a lie of a movie " . Leslie was not included in the film , and her ties with the third victim , Phillip DeVine , were omitted due to storyline constraints . 
 Lana Tisdel 's potential involvement in the rape and murder of Brandon Teena was also highlighted . Various people involved in the case , particularly Brandon 's family , have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders , or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance . Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel 's motives came from Tom Nissen , who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present at the time of the murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon , Lambert and DeVine were staying . When nobody answered the door , Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out . Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case — the residing judge considered most of Nissen 's claims as nothing more than hearsay . Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon 's murder , she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert 's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered . Unlike Tisdel 's own evidence and the admissions presented in court , Boys Don 't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene , albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up . 
 = = = Awards and nominations = = = 
 The film won a variety of awards , most of which went to Swank for her performance . Swank won a Best Actress Oscar while Sevigny received a nomination in the category of Best Supporting Actress . From the Hollywood Foreign Press , the film received two Golden Globe nominations in the same two categories ( Best Actress , Best Supporting Actress ) for Swank and Sevigny , winning Best Actress . Swank and Sevigny both received Best Actress Awards from the New York Film Critics Circle , the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and an Independent Spirit Award . The film won three awards at the Boston Society of Film Critics Awards ; Best Actress ( Swank ) , Best Supporting Actress ( Sevigny ) and Best Director ( Peirce ) . Swank and Sevigny won Satellite Awards for their performances , and the film was nominated in two categories ; Best Picture ( Drama ) and Best Director . It was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures . 
 The family of Brandon Teena criticized Swank for her repeated use of the male gender pronoun " he " in her Oscar acceptance speech . Teena 's mother JoAnn Brandon said her child 's transgenderism was a defense mechanism that was developed in response to childhood sexual abuse , rather than being an expression of Teena 's gendered sense of self . She said , " She pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her " . Despite the criticism , Kevin <unk> , writing for Out , defended Swank 's acceptance speech ; he said , " Swank deserves a place in the great acceptance speech canon for being bold , not only as an actress , but as an award winner " . 
 = = = Rating and home media = = = 
 Boys Don 't Cry garnered significant attention for its graphic rape scene . The film was initially assigned an NC @-@ 17 rating from the MPAA ; the content was toned down for the U.S. release , where it was rated R. Peirce was interviewed for a 2005 documentary titled This Film Is Not Yet Rated , which discussed the film 's problems with the MPAA , particularly the censoring of the sex scenes . The portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the MPAA and had to be trimmed to avoid the NC @-@ 17 rating . Both the Australian and European version are more explicit , particularly the first rape . Peirce was angry because the MPAA wanted the sex scene between Brandon and Lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene . 
 Boys Don 't Cry was first released on home video by Fox Searchlight Pictures in September 2000 apart of a " Premiere Series " , preceded by a DVD release in April 2000 in the United States and Canada . The DVD 's special features included a commentary by Kimberly Peirce and a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes featurette containing interviews with Peirce , Swank and Sevigny ; there was also a theatrical trailer and three television trailers .

 These Days : Live in Concert is a live album by Australian alternative rock band Powderfinger , released as a CD on 6 September 2004 , and as a two disc DVD on 4 October 2004 . 
 The album consists of songs performed by Powderfinger in concerts at Sydney Entertainment Centre , and Fox Studios in Sydney . Most of the songs performed are from Powderfinger 's prior studio album ; Vulture Street . These Days : Live in Concert earned a mixed response from reviewers ; some enjoyed the energy and flair of the live performances , while others disliked the lack of dynamism . 
 = = Production = = 
 These Days : Live in Concert disc one was directed by Gregor Jordan , who the band had first encountered when he requested they write " These Days " for his film Two Hands . Bernard Fanning also worked with Jordan on the film Ned Kelly in 2003 . The band chose Jordan because they did not want to present These Days : Live in Concert as " just straight @-@ up live concert footage " , but instead wanted to present it from a different angle . Jordan agreed , and believed that the band being a successful rock group from Brisbane was an interesting angle to work from . 
 Disc one of These Days : Live in Concert was recorded by Powderfinger during sellout performances at Sydney Entertainment Centre , and featured live performances of 14 songs , including nine singles . The footage on the disc was shot over two nights . Disc two " low key " was directed by Bernie <unk> of Channel V , and was recorded at Sydney 's Fox Studios . The disc contained mostly acoustic performances by the band , and included a cover of " Inner City Blues " by Rodriguez . 
 The band 's live performances at large venues such as the Sydney Entertainment Centre was criticised by some fans , as the band had previously stated they disliked playing to large crowds . Drummer Jon Coghill said he was not bothered by the comments , as the band ( other than guitarist Ian Haug ) generally did not take much note of such critique .

 These Days : Live in Concert entered the ARIA charts at # 2 19 September 2004 , and spent a total of 8 weeks in the chart , exiting on 7 November 2004 . The CD version was certified " Gold " by ARIA , while the DVD version was certified " Double Platinum " in the same year . 
 These Days : Live in Concert received a mixed response from reviewers . Sputnikmusic reviewer James Bishop approved of the album , giving it a score of 4 / 5 , and summarising " Powderfinger deliver a live show that 's as entertaining as it is surprising " . Bishop praised numerous performances on disc one , calling " Rockin ' Rocks " " a great introduction to their arena spectacular " , describing the almost instrument @-@ free performance of " These Days " as " one of the most heart @-@ wrenching moments they ’ ve ever recorded " , and calling " Thrilloilogy " " the quintessential live Powderfinger track " . Bishop also enjoyed disc two , lauding the acoustic performances of " Sunsets " and " Love Your Way " , and describing b @-@ side " Rita " as " an absolute hit as usual " . 
 Jeff Crawford , of Adelaide newspaper The Messenger disagreed with Bishop , giving the album three stars , and stating " Gregor Jordan 's concert film makes the most of Powderfinger 's strengths but can 't disguise their lack of dynamism , while the interviews are hardly insightful " . He called Fanning 's solo on " These Days " the highlight of the album .

 Huangshan ( Chinese : <unk> ) , is a mountain range in southern Anhui province in eastern China . Vegetation on the range is thickest below 1 @,@ 100 meters ( 3 @,@ 600 ft ) , with trees growing up to the treeline at 1 @,@ 800 meters ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) . 
 The area is well known for its scenery , sunsets , peculiarly @-@ shaped granite peaks , Huangshan pine trees , hot springs , winter snow , and views of the clouds from above . Huangshan is a frequent subject of traditional Chinese paintings and literature , as well as modern photography . It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and one of China 's major tourist destinations . Huangshan is also the famous place for Chinese teas of high quality , such as Huangshan <unk> , <unk> Black , and Blooming Tea . 
 = = Physical description = = 
 Huangshan is known for its sunrises , pine trees , " strangely jutting granite peaks " , hot springs , winter snow , and views of clouds touching the mountainsides for more than 200 days out of the year . 
 The Huangshan mountain range has many peaks , some more than 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 250 feet ) high . The three tallest and best @-@ known peaks are Lotus Peak ( Lian Hua Feng , 1 @,@ 864 m ) , Bright Summit Peak ( Guang Ming Ding , 1 @,@ 840 m ) , and Celestial Peak ( Tian Du Feng , literally Capital of Heaven Peak , 1 @,@ 829 m ) . The World Heritage Site covers a core area of 154 square kilometres and a buffer zone of 142 square kilometres . The mountains were formed in the Mesozoic , approximately 100 million years ago , when an ancient sea disappeared due to uplift . Later , in the Quaternary Period , the landscape was shaped by the influence of glaciers . 
 The vegetation of the area varies with elevation . <unk> forests cover the landscape below 1 @,@ 100 meters . Deciduous forest stretches from 1 @,@ 100 meters up to the tree line at 1 @,@ 800 meters . Above that point , the vegetation consists of alpine grasslands . The area has diverse flora , where one @-@ third of China 's bryophyte families and more than half of its fern families are represented . The Huangshan pine ( Pinus <unk> ) is named after Huangshan and is considered an example of vigor because the trees thrive by growing straight out of the rocks . Many of the pine trees in the area are more than a hundred years old and have been given their own names ( such as the Ying Ke Pine , or Welcoming @-@ Guests Pine , which is thought to be more than 1500 years old ) . The pines vary greatly in shape and size , with the most crooked of the trees being considered the most attractive . Furthermore , Huangshan 's moist climate facilitates the growing of tea leaves , and the mountain has been called " one of China 's premier green tea @-@ growing mountains . Mao feng cha ( " Fur Peak Tea " ) , a well @-@ known local variety of green tea , takes its name from the downy tips of tea leaves found in the Huangshan area . 
 The mountaintops often offer views of the clouds from above , known as the Sea of Clouds ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) or " Huangshan Sea " because of the cloud 's resemblance to an ocean , and many vistas are known by names such as " North Sea " or " South Sea . " One writer remarked on the view of the clouds from Huangshan as follows : 
 To enjoy the magnificence of a mountain , you have to look upwards in most cases . To enjoy Mount Huangshan , however , you 've got to look downward . 
 The area also is host to notable light effects , such as the renowned sunrises . Watching the sunrise is considered a " mandatory " part of visiting the area . A phenomenon known as Buddha 's Light ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) is also well @-@ known and , on average , Buddha 's Light only appears a couple of times per month . In addition , Huangshan has multiple hot springs , most of them located at the foot of the Purple Cloud Peak . The water stays at 42 ° C all year , and has a high concentration of carbonates . The waters are said to help prevent skin , joint , and nerve illness . 
 = = History = = 
 Huangshan was formed approximately 100 million years ago and gained its unique rock formations in the Quaternary Glaciation . 
 During the Qin Dynasty , Huangshan was known as <unk> ( Mount Yi ) . In 747 AD , its name was changed to Huangshan ( Mount Huang ) by imperial decree ; the name is commonly thought to have been coined in honor of Huang Di ( the Yellow Emperor ) , a legendary Chinese emperor , and the mythological ancestor of the Han Chinese . One legend states that Huangshan was the location from which the Yellow Emperor ascended to Heaven . Another legend states that the Yellow Emperor " cultivated moral character and refined Pills of Immortality in the mountains , and in so doing gave the mountains his name . The first use of this name " Huangshan " often is attributed to Chinese poet Li Bai . Huangshan was fairly inaccessible and little @-@ known in ancient times , but its change of name in 747 AD seems to have brought the area more attention ; from then on , the area was visited frequently and many temples were built there . 
 Huangshan is known for its stone steps , carved into the side of the mountain , of which there may be more than 60 @,@ 000 throughout the area . The date at which work on the steps began is unknown , but they have been said to be more than 1 @,@ 500 years old . 
 Over the years , many scenic spots and physical features on the mountain have been named ; many of the names have narratives behind them . For example , one legend tells of a man who did not believe the tales of Huangshan 's beauty and went to the mountains to see them ; almost immediately , he was converted to the same view . One of the peaks he is said to have visited was named <unk> ( <unk> ) , roughly meaning " start to believe . " 
 In 1982 , Huangshan was declared a " site of scenic beauty and historic interest " by the State Council of the People 's Republic of China . It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990 for its scenery and for its role as a habitat for rare and threatened species . 
 In 2002 , Huangshan was named the " sister mountain " of Jungfrau in the Swiss Alps . 
 = = Artistic and scientific inspirations = = 
 Much of Huangshan 's reputation derives from its significance in Chinese arts and literature . In addition to inspiring poets such as Li Bai , Huangshan and the scenery therein has been the frequent subject of poetry and artwork , especially Chinese ink painting and , more recently , photography . Overall , from the Tang Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty , more than 20 @,@ 000 poems were written about Huangshan , and a school of painting named after it . The mountains also have appeared in modern works . James Cameron , director of the 2009 film Avatar , cited Huangshan as one of his influences in designing the fictional world of that film . 
 The area also has been a location for scientific research because of its diversity of flora and wildlife . In the early part of the twentieth century , the geology and vegetation of Huangshan were the subjects of multiple studies by both Chinese and foreign scientists . The mountain is still a subject of research . For example , in the late twentieth century a team of researchers used the area for a field study of Tibetan macaques , a local species of monkey . 
 = = Tourism = = 
 Having at least 140 sections open to visitors , Huangshan is a major tourist destination in China . The city changed its name to Huangshan in 1987 in order to promote Huangshan tourism . In 2007 , for instance , more than 1 @.@ 5 million tourists visited the mountain . The foot of the mountain is linked by rail and by air to Shanghai , and also is accessible from cities such as Hangzhou and <unk> . 
 As of 1990 , there were more than 50 kilometers of footpaths providing access to scenic areas for visitors and staffers of the facilities . Today there are also cable cars that tourists may use to ride directly from the base to one of the summits . Throughout the area there are hotels and guest houses that accommodate overnight visitors , many of whom hike up the mountains , spend the night at one of the peaks to view the sunrise , and then descend by a different route the next day . The area is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration . 
 The hotels , restaurants , and other facilities at the top of the mountain are serviced and kept stocked by porters who carry resources up the mountain on foot , hanging their cargo from long poles balanced over their shoulders or backs .

 Huangshan has an oceanic climate ( Cfb ) according to the Köppen climate classification . Its elevation makes it colder and wetter than the rest of Anhui .

 = M21 Mortar Motor Carriage = 
 The M21 Mortar Motor Carriage ( MMC ) was a self @-@ propelled artillery mount on a half @-@ track chassis used by the United States Army during World War II . It was equipped with an 81 mm M1 mortar and an air @-@ cooled M2 Browning machine gun . It was produced by the White Motor Company in 1944 . Only 110 examples were produced . 
 It mainly served on the Western Front in Normandy , and Southern France , and then later in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge . It was deemed to have been outclassed in 1945 when the 81 mm M1 mortar was found to have insufficient power to provide effective artillery support . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The specifications for the M21 are similar to the specifications for the M3 Half @-@ track . The vehicle was 20 ft 9 in ( 6 @.@ 32 m ) long , 6 ft 5 in ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) wide , and 7 ft 5 in ( 2 @.@ 26 m ) high with a wheelbase of 135 @.@ 5 in ( 3 @.@ 44 m ) . The suspension for the front wheels were leaf springs and track 's suspension used a vertical volute spring . Powered by a White 160AX , 128 hp ( 95 kW ) , 386 in3 ( 6 @,@ 330 cc ) , 6 @-@ cylinder petrol engine with a compression ratio of 6 @.@ 3 : 1 , the M21 could reach up to 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) on a road . The fuel capacity was 60 US gal ( 230 l ) and the vehicle had a range of 150 mi ( 240 km ) . It had a power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio of 15 @.@ 8 hp / ton with the vehicle weighing nine tons . 
 = = Design = = 
 The M21 had a different layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC , as it was the replacement of the M4 . The major difference , was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half @-@ tracks ( the M4 was based on the M2 Half @-@ track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half @-@ track ) . The major difference was the location and direction of the mortar ( the M4 's mortar was rear @-@ facing and was near the back , while the M21 's mortar was front @-@ facing and was closer to the front ) . 
 The mortar was able to traverse 30 ° either side and elevate from 40 to 80 ° . If required , it could be de @-@ mounted from the vehicle and fired from the ground . In addition , there was a pedestal mount at the rear for a .50 cal ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) M2 heavy machine gun . 
 = = Development = = 
 The M4 was developed to meet the need for a specialized mortar carrier based on the M2 Half Track Car , which the M21 soon replaced . The initial M4 was designed to carry a mortar . In emergencies , the mortar could be fired from the vehicle . The improved M4A1 had a reinforced floor so that the mortar could be fired from the vehicle , but the mounting faced to the rear and lacked traverse . This caused problems when the troops who operated the mortar mounted the vehicle , so the US 2nd Armored Division relocated the mortars so that they could fire from the front . 
 The Ordnance Department followed suit and a new 81 mm MMC , the T19 MMC , was created , which was based on the M3 Half @-@ track . The T19 went through its developmental trials , which were completed in July 1943 , and the vehicle was later standardized as the M21 MMC . Unlike the M4 mortar carriage , which was based on the M2 Half Track Car , the M21 was based on the M3 Half @-@ track with a longer and roomier rear . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The M21 served on the Western Front , seeing action in Normandy and in southern France , before later being used during the Battle of the Bulge , the Battle of Belgium , Operation Market Garden , and the invasion of Germany from the west . The M21 served with the US 3rd , 1st , and 7th Armies during the campaign in France , and the 2nd Armored Division , which developed it . In addition , 57 examples were leased to Free French forces . By 1945 , it was declared obsolete , due to the insufficient power of the 81 mm mortar as an artillery piece . 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 Standard US tank and armored infantry battalions had a mortar platoon equipped with either <unk> or the older M4 <unk> . The M21 was used mainly to illuminate targets at night or provide indirect fire support to the infantry . The usage was uncommon because the White Motor Company was only able to produce 110 <unk> in 1944 . 
 = Choor Singh = 
 Choor Singh Sidhu ( 19 January 1911 – 31 March 2009 ) , known professionally as Choor Singh , was a judge of the Supreme Court of Singapore and , particularly after his retirement from the bench , a philanthropist and writer of books about Sikhism . Born to a family of modest means in Punjab , India , he came to Singapore at four years of age . He completed his secondary education in the top class at Raffles Institution in 1929 , then worked as a clerk in a law firm before becoming a civil servant in the Official Assignee 's office . 
 Encouraged by the Assistant Official Assignee , James Walter Davy Ambrose ( who was later appointed a High Court Judge ) , to study law , Choor Singh enrolled as an external student at the University of London , passing the matriculation examination and intermediate LL.B. examination . In 1948 he was appointed a coroner , and the following year was elevated to the post of magistrate , becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya . Following law studies at Gray 's Inn on a government scholarship , he became a Barrister @-@ at @-@ Law in 1955 . He was appointed a district judge in 1960 and a judge of the Supreme Court in 1963 . Especially noted for his criminal judgments , Singh was the first Singapore judge to impose the death penalty on a woman . 
 Following his retirement in 1980 , Choor Singh continued his close involvement in Indian and Sikh affairs . One of the young Sikhs who founded the Singapore Khalsa Association in 1931 , he served as its patron and honorary chairman of its board of trustees . He also contributed to educational charities and causes , both Sikh and non @-@ Sikh , and wrote several books on Sikhism . In 1994 , the Sikh community bestowed on him its highest honour by inviting him to lay the foundation stone for the new Gurdwara Sahib building at the Gurdwara Khalsa <unk> Sabha at 18 Niven Road . 
 = = Childhood , education and early career = = 
 Choor Singh Sidhu was born in <unk> , Punjab , in India , on 19 January 1911 . He came to Singapore at the age of four years with his mother and sister to join his father , who was already employed there as a night watchman in a <unk> near Boat Quay by the Singapore River . He attended Pearl 's Hill Primary School and Outram Road School , at various stages walking 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) to school , sleeping along a five foot way , bathing at a roadside pump and studying at night under a street lamp . He completed his secondary education and took the Senior Cambridge examination at Raffles Institution in the top class in 1929 . There , he was a classmate of David Marshall , the first Chief Minister of Singapore ; they became good friends . Initially unemployed between 1930 and 1934 due to the Great Depression , he subsequently worked for three years as a clerk in the law firm of <unk> & <unk> for a monthly salary of 20 Straits dollars . Thereafter , he joined the Government Clerical Services for 60 Straits dollars a month and was posted to the Official Assignee 's office , which was in charge of administering the estates of bankrupt persons . 
 The Assistant Official Assignee , James Walter Davy Ambrose ( later a High Court Judge ) , advised Choor Singh to study law . Singh read law books in his leisure time and began saving money to study law in England . This proved to be unnecessary ; following a change in the rules , he was able to enrol as an external student at the University of London and passed the matriculation examination and , in 1948 , the intermediate LL.B. examination . However , he could not be called to the Bar as a barrister as he did not have time to keep the required dining terms . On 20 May 1948 , he was appointed a coroner . In December 1949 , Singh was elevated to the post of magistrate , becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya . He continued his law studies at Gray 's Inn , and in 1953 was granted leave on a government scholarship to dine at Gray 's Inn . After making four trips in two years , he became a Barrister @-@ at @-@ Law in 1955 . In 1958 , he was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance . 
 Choor Singh was one of the founding members of the Sri Guru Nanak Sat Sang Sabha ( the Congregation of Sri Guru Nanak 's Company ) , registered on 26 June 1953 . The Gurdwara Sri Guru Nanak Satsang Sabha in Katong was built for this congregation in 1969 . 
 = = Judicial career = = 
 On 11 July 1960 , Choor Singh became a district judge . In that year , he also published a book called Gaming in Malaya on the Common Gaming Houses Ordinances of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore . On 28 August 1963 , he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court . 
 During Singh 's 17 @-@ year career on the bench , 105 of his judgments were reported in the law reports . Particularly noted for his criminal judgments , he was known as " the Hanging Judge " for handing down a large number of capital sentences . He was the first judge in Singapore to impose the death penalty on a woman , Mimi Wong , a cabaret singer who murdered her Japanese lover 's wife in 1970 . In a 1996 interview with The Straits Times , he said : " I 'm satisfied that I 've made no mistake and that I 've done my duty according to the law . " All the five judgments he wrote as a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal were upheld by the Privy Council , then Singapore 's highest appellate court . 
 In an oral history interview , Singh said that one of the murder trials that he had presided over , the " Body in the Box " case , led to the abolition of jury trials in Singapore criminal cases . Following the trial of a young man , Freddy Tan , for the murder of his friend whose decomposed body was found stuffed into a box , Singh agreed with the jury to convict Tan of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentence him to life imprisonment . However , he later learnt that in the jury room a bullying Dutch juror had wanted to impose the death penalty , but because the other jurors disliked his attitude they voted to impose a lower verdict on Tan . The father of the deceased felt an injustice had been done and went to see the Prime Minister , Lee Kuan Yew . Lee then sent for Singh , and Singh informed him of what had happened with the jurors . Lee asked Singh , " Well what do you think . Shall I abolish the jury ? " Singh replied that if he had tried Tan without a jury , he would have convicted him of murder without hesitation . Following a public inquiry , jury trials were abolished for all criminal cases in 1969 . 
 Between 1967 and 1979 , Singh was also Commissioner of the Land Acquisition Appeals Board . In 1972 , in the case of Gian Singh & Co . Ltd. v. Banque de L <unk> , Singh wrote a dissenting opinion – uncommon in Singapore – when sitting in the Court of Appeal with Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin and Justice Tan Ah Tah . An honorary member of the Law Society of Singapore , he retired as a judge on 30 November 1980 . 
 = = Later years = = 
 Impatient with nothing to do following his retirement , for about four and a half years from 1981 Choor Singh acted as a personal consultant for Tan Chin Tuan , the Chairman of the Oversea @-@ Chinese Banking Corporation ( OCBC ) , and other companies in the OCBC group such as Great Eastern Life and Overseas Assurance Corporation . For many years , Singh was chairman of both the Probation Committee which supervises the work of probation officers , and the Detention Board , and vice @-@ president of the National Kidney Foundation Singapore . He was also a member of the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and the Disciplinary Committee for advocates and solicitors . 
 Choor Singh participated as the chairman of a disciplinary committee set up to investigate complaints against a lawyer named Kalpanath Singh in 1989 . After making a report at the end of proceedings where cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action against Kalpanath Singh was found , Choor Singh was made the respondent to a motion for an order of certiorari filed by Kalpanath Singh in the High Court , where serious allegations that Choor Singh had shown bias against him in that he had : 
 threatened or warned a material witness before that witness had given evidence ; 
 He had indicated he had made his mind up about the veracity of the witness before that witness had given evidence , and before submissions had been made by counsel on behalf of the applicant at the hearing by the disciplinary committee ; and 
 questioned a material witness about his veracity and motives as a witness other than during the hearing and in the presence of the applicant and his counsel . 
 It was found that Choor Singh had two private contacts with a material witness in the course of the disciplinary proceedings , even though it is a well @-@ established rule that a decision @-@ maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel . The High Court found that there was no actual bias , but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry . The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias . On this basis , the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee . The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath ( 1992 ) . 
 A keen cricketer when younger , Singh learned to play golf and took up gardening . He also continued his close involvement with Indian and Sikh affairs . One of the young Sikhs who founded the Singapore Khalsa Association in 1931 , and having been its president in the 1960s , he served as its patron and honorary chairman of the board of trustees . He was also a patron of the Singapore Indian Association and a trustee of the Sikh Welfare Council , He also wrote several books on Sikhism , including Bhai Maharaj Singh : Saint @-@ soldier of the Sikh Faith ( 1991 ; later edition , 1999 ) , The Sikh Gurus ( 1991 ) , Understanding Sikhism ( 1994 ; later edition , 2001 ) and Who is a Sikh ? ( 2004 ) . Associate Professor Dr. Kirpal Singh , a writer and literary editor with the Singapore Management University , penned in the foreword to the 2001 edition of Understanding Sikhism that Singh had managed " to ' engage ' the reader through the strategy of writing simply , honestly and without any pretense " . 
 Placing great importance on learning , Singh contributed to Sikh educational charities and other educational causes . He was a trustee of the Singapore Sikh Education Foundation that was inaugurated in 1990 to teach Punjabi to children , and a life member of the Singapore Indian Education Trust which provides financial assistance to Singaporean Indians for their education . As Chairman of the Sikh Advisory Board , he persuaded the Government to allow the use of government school buildings for the teaching of the Punjabi language . Classes were conducted by the Sri Guru Nanak Satsang Sabha at two schools on Saturday mornings , and were attended by about 400 Sikh children . 
 On 18 January 1999 , to celebrate his 88th birthday the next day , Singh donated S $ 25 @,@ 000 to the National Institute of Education . About $ 15 @,@ 000 was used to establish the Justice Choor Singh Gold Medal , which is awarded to the best student teacher in education studies with a distinction in practicum in the final examination for the Postgraduate Diploma in Education ( Primary or Secondary ) programme . The remaining $ 10 @,@ 000 went towards funding a research project on the Sikh community 's contributions to education . In 2001 , he donated $ 140 @,@ 000 to the Singapore Management University 's Centre for Cross @-@ Cultural Studies . 
 The Sikh community bestowed its highest honour on Singh on 14 August 1994 by inviting him to lay the foundation stone for the new Gurdwara Sahib building at the Gurdwara Khalsa <unk> Sabha at 18 Niven Road . In August 1996 , the Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong presented him with one of the inaugural Sikh Community Service Awards awarded by the Singapore Khalsa Association in recognition of his contributions to the community . 
 For two years before his death , Singh had found it difficult to walk . He died in his bed on 31 March 2009 aged 98 . Pre @-@ deceased by his wife , Bhagwan Kaur , in 2004 , he left behind two sons , Duleep Singh Sidhu and Dr. <unk> Singh Sidhu , and a daughter , <unk> Kaur Sidhu . The following self @-@ written epitaph was published in his obituary notice in The Straits Times on 1 April 2009 :

 I leave now as ordained by my fate ,

 = Rumination syndrome = 
 Rumination syndrome , or <unk> , is an under @-@ diagnosed chronic motility disorder characterized by effortless regurgitation of most meals following consumption , due to the involuntary contraction of the muscles around the abdomen . There is no retching , nausea , heartburn , odour , or abdominal pain associated with the regurgitation , as there is with typical vomiting . The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants , young children , and people with cognitive disabilities ( the prevalence is as high as 10 % in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities ) . Today it is being diagnosed in increasing numbers of otherwise healthy adolescents and adults , though there is a lack of awareness of the condition by doctors , patients and the general public . 
 Rumination syndrome presents itself in a variety of ways , with especially high contrast existing between the presentation of the typical adult sufferer without a mental disability and the presentation of an infant and / or mentally impaired sufferer . Like related gastrointestinal disorders , rumination can adversely affect normal functioning and the social lives of individuals . It has been linked with depression . 
 Little comprehensive data regarding rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness and are often misdiagnosed due to the number of symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus , such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa . These symptoms include the acid @-@ induced erosion of the esophagus and enamel , halitosis , malnutrition , severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite . Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion , and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia . 
 Diagnosis of rumination syndrome is non @-@ invasive and based on a history of the individual . Treatment is promising , with upwards of 85 % of individuals responding positively to treatment , including infants and the mentally handicapped . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Rumination syndrome is a condition which affects the functioning of the stomach and esophagus , also known as a functional <unk> disorder . In patients that have a history of eating disorders , Rumination syndrome is grouped alongside eating disorders such as bulimia and pica , which are themselves grouped under non @-@ psychotic mental disorder . In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability , Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an eating disorder , because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of eating disorders . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 While the number and severity of symptoms varies among individuals , repetitive regurgitation of undigested food ( known as rumination ) after the start of a meal is always present . In some individuals , the regurgitation is small , occurring over a long period of time following ingestion , and can be <unk> and swallowed . In others , the amount can be bilious and short lasting , and must be expelled . While some only experience symptoms following some meals , most experience episodes following any ingestion , from a single bite to a massive feast . However , some long @-@ term patients will find a select couple of food or drink items that do not trigger a response . 
 Unlike typical vomiting , the regurgitation is typically described as effortless and unforced . There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion , and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile . 
 Symptoms can begin to manifest at any point from the ingestion of the meal to 120 minutes thereafter . However , the more common range is between 30 seconds to 1 hour after the completion of a meal . Symptoms tend to cease when the <unk> contents become acidic . 
 Abdominal pain ( 38 @.@ 1 % ) , lack of fecal production or constipation ( 21 @.@ 1 % ) , nausea ( 17 @.@ 0 % ) , diarrhea ( 8 @.@ 2 % ) , bloating ( 4 @.@ 1 % ) , and dental decay ( 3 @.@ 4 % ) are also described as common symptoms in day @-@ to @-@ day life . These symptoms are not necessarily prevalent during regurgitation episodes , and can happen at any time . Weight loss is often observed ( 42 @.@ 2 % ) at an average loss of 9 @.@ 6 kilograms , and is more common in cases where the disorder has gone undiagnosed for a longer period of time , though this may be expected of the nutrition deficiencies that often accompany the disorder as a consequence of its symptoms . Depression has also been linked with rumination syndrome , though the effects of it on rumination syndrome are unknown . 
 Acid erosion of the teeth can be a feature of rumination , as can halitosis ( bad breath ) . 
 = = Causes = = 
 The cause of rumination syndrome is unknown . However , studies have drawn a correlation between hypothesized causes and the history of patients with the disorder . In infants and the cognitively impaired , the disease has normally been attributed to over @-@ stimulation and under @-@ stimulation from parents and caregivers , causing the individual to seek self @-@ gratification and self @-@ stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli . The disorder has also commonly been attributed to a bout of illness , a period of stress in the individual 's recent past , and to changes in medication . 
 In adults and adolescents , hypothesized causes generally fall into one of either category : habit @-@ induced , and trauma @-@ induced . Habit @-@ induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation ( magicians and professional <unk> , for example ) , which though initially self @-@ induced , forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control of the affected individual . Trauma @-@ induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury ( such as recent surgery , psychological distress , concussions , deaths in the family , etc . ) , which preceded the onset of rumination , often by several months . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Rumination syndrome is diagnosed based on a complete history of the individual . Costly and invasive studies such as <unk> <unk> and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in misdiagnosis . Based on typical observed features , several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome . The primary symptom , the regurgitation of recently ingested food , must be consistent , occurring for at least six weeks of the past twelve months . The regurgitation must begin within 30 minutes of the completion of a meal . Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it . The symptoms must stop within 90 minutes , or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic . The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction , and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease . 
 In adults , the diagnosis is supported by the absence of classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system . Supportive criteria include a <unk> that does not taste sour or acidic , is generally odourless , is effortless , or at most preceded by a belching sensation , that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation , and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn . 
 Patients visit an average of five physicians over 2 @.@ 75 years before being correctly diagnosed with rumination syndrome . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 Rumination syndrome in adults is a complicated disorder whose symptoms can mimic those of several other <unk> disorders and diseases . <unk> nervosa and gastroparesis are especially prevalent among the misdiagnoses of rumination . 
 <unk> nervosa , among adults and especially adolescents , is by far the most common misdiagnosis patients will hear during their experiences with rumination syndrome . This is due to the similarities in symptoms to an outside observer — " vomiting " following food intake — which , in long @-@ term patients , may include ingesting copious amounts to offset malnutrition , and a lack of willingness to expose their condition and its symptoms . While it has been suggested that there is a connection between rumination and bulimia , unlike bulimia , rumination is not self @-@ inflicted . Adults and adolescents with rumination syndrome are generally well aware of their gradually increasing malnutrition , but are unable to control the reflex . In contrast , those with bulimia intentionally induce vomiting , and seldom re @-@ swallow food . 
 <unk> is another common misdiagnosis . Like rumination syndrome , patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal . Unlike rumination , gastroparesis causes vomiting ( in contrast to regurgitation ) of food , which is not being digested further , from the stomach . This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested , preceded by nausea and retching , and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Rumination syndrome is a poorly understood disorder , and a number of theories have speculated the mechanisms that cause the regurgitation , which is a unique symptom to this disorder . While no theory has gained a consensus , some are more notable and widely published than others . 
 The most widely documented mechanism is that the ingestion of food causes gastric distention , which is followed by abdominal compression and the simultaneous relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) . This creates a common cavity between the stomach and the oropharynx that allows the partially digested material to return to the mouth . There are several offered explanations for the sudden relaxation of the LES . Among these explanations is that it is a learned voluntary relaxation , which is common in those with or having had bulimia . While this relaxation may be voluntary , the overall process of rumination is still generally involuntary . Relaxation due to intra @-@ abdominal pressure is another proposed explanation , which would make abdominal compression the primary mechanism . The third is an adaptation of the belch reflex , which is the most commonly described mechanism . The swallowing of air immediately prior to regurgitation causes the activation of the belching reflex that triggers the relaxation of the LES . Patients often describe a feeling similar to the onset of a belch preceding rumination . 
 = = Treatment and prognosis = = 
 There is presently no known cure for rumination . Proton pump inhibitors and other medications have been used to little or no effect . Treatment is different for infants and the mentally handicapped than for adults and adolescents of normal intelligence . For adults and adolescents , Biofeedback and relaxation techniques , to be practice after eating or whenever regurgitation occurs , has proven to be most effective . Among infants and the mentally handicapped , behavioral and mild aversive training has been shown to cause improvement in most cases . Aversive training involves associating the ruminating behavior with negative results , and rewarding good behavior and eating . Placing a sour or bitter taste on the tongue when the individual begins the movements or breathing patterns typical of his or her ruminating behavior is the generally accepted method for aversive training , although some older studies advocate the use of pinching . In patients of normal intelligence , rumination is not an intentional behavior and is habitually reversed using diaphragmatic breathing to counter the urge to regurgitate . Alongside reassurance , explanation and habit reversal , patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period . A similar breathing pattern can be used to prevent normal vomiting . Breathing in this method works by physically preventing the abdominal contractions required to expel stomach contents . 
 Supportive therapy and diaphragmatic breathing has shown to cause improvement in 56 % of cases , and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30 % in one study of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments . Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better . Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting in the past have a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior . The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful . Most infants grow out of the disorder within a year or with aversive training . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Rumination disorder was initially documented as affecting newborns , infants , children and individuals with mental and functional disabilities ( the cognitively handicapped ) . It has since been recognized to occur in both males and females of all ages and cognitive abilities . 
 Among the latter , it is described with almost equal prevalence among infants ( 6 – 10 % of the population ) and institutionalized adults ( 8 – 10 % ) . In infants , it typically occurs within the first 3 – 12 months of age . 
 The occurrence of rumination syndrome within the general population has not been defined . Rumination is sometimes described as rare , but has also been described as not rare , but rather rarely recognized . The disorder has a female predominance . The typical age of adolescent onset is 12 @.@ 9 , give or take 0 @.@ 4 years ( ± ) , with males affected sooner than females ( 11 @.@ 0 ± 0 @.@ 8 for males versus 13 @.@ 8 ± 0 @.@ 5 for females ) . 
 There is little evidence concerning the impact of hereditary influence in rumination syndrome . However , case reports involving entire families with rumination exist . 
 = = History = = 
 The term rumination is derived from the Latin word <unk> , which means to chew the cud . First described in ancient times , and mentioned in the writings of Aristotle , rumination syndrome was clinically documented in 1618 by Italian anatomist <unk> ab <unk> , who wrote of the symptoms in a patient of his . 
 Among the earliest cases of rumination was that of a physician in the nineteenth century , Charles @-@ Édouard Brown @-@ Séquard , who acquired the condition as the result of experiments upon himself . As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods , the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string , then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents . As a result of these experiments , the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex . 
 Numerous case reports exist from before the twentieth century , but were influenced greatly by the methods and thinking used in that time . By the early twentieth century , it was becoming increasingly evident that rumination presented itself in a variety of ways in response to a variety of conditions . Although still considered a disorder of infancy and cognitive disability at that time , the difference in presentation between infants and adults was well established . 
 Studies of rumination in otherwise healthy adults became decreasingly rare starting in the 1900s , and the majority of published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter . At first , adult rumination was described and treated as a benign condition . It is now described as otherwise . While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more people come forward with their symptoms , awareness of the condition by the medical community and the general public is still limited .

 The chewing of cud by animals such as cows , goats , and giraffes is considered normal behavior . These animals are known as ruminants . Such behavior , though termed rumination , is not related to human rumination syndrome , but is ordinary . Involuntary rumination , similar to what is seen in humans , has been described in gorillas and other primates . 
 = Lactarius argillaceifolius = 
 Lactarius argillaceifolius is a species of fungus in the Russulaceae family . The mushrooms produced by the fungus have convex to flattened drab lilac @-@ colored caps that are up to 18 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) wide . The cream @-@ colored gills are closely spaced together and extend slightly down the length of the stem , which is up to 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) long by 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) thick . The mushroom produces an off @-@ white latex when injured that stains the mushroom tissue brownish . 
 The species is found in eastern North America , with a range extending from Canada to northeastern Mexico . It has also been found in pine plantations in Brazil , where it is probably an introduced species . Lactarius trivialis is a European counterpart that is similar in appearance . In addition to its distribution , it can be distinguished from L. argillaceifolius by differences in preferred habitat and color differences in the gills , cap , and latex . The L. argillaceifolius variety megacarpus , a larger form with caps up to 27 cm ( 11 in ) wide , occurs under coast live oak and tanoak in the Pacific Coast states and Baja California . Variety dissimilis , described on the basis of a single specimen from South Carolina , differs from the main form in the microscopic structure of the cap cuticle . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 The species was first described by American mycologists Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in their 1979 monograph on the North American species of Lactarius . The type specimen — collected by Smith from Oak Grove , Livingston County , Michigan , in July 1972 — is housed at the University of Michigan Herbarium . Hesler and Smith simultaneously published the varieties dissimilis and megacarpus , collected from South Carolina and California , respectively . The variety megacarpus is commonly known as the " vulgar milkcap " . 
 Smith and Hesler classified L. argillaceifolius in subgenus <unk> , in stirps <unk> . This grouping of related species , which includes L. <unk> , is characterized by the gelatinous cuticle of the stem . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is 4 – 18 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 7 @.@ 1 in ) wide , and initially convex to broadly convex before flattening out with a depressed center . The cap margin is curved inward , and often remains that way into maturity . The cap surface is covered with fine soft hairs when young , but later becomes smooth ; it is slimy and sticky when wet . The color of the cap ranges from lilac @-@ brown when young , fading to lilac @-@ tan or pale lilac @-@ gray and eventually to pale tan or pinkish @-@ buff at the center . The gills are attached to slightly decurrent ( extending somewhat down the length of the stem ) , broad , and packed together closely . They are cream @-@ colored when young , and later develop pinkish tones near the margin . In maturity , they become flushed with brownish @-@ orange . The color stains buff to olive @-@ brown to dark brown when bruised . 
 The stem is 6 – 9 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) long by 1 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 4 in ) thick , and nearly equal in width throughout or tapering downward . Its surface may be slimy or dry , depending on the moisture in the environment . It is whitish , but in age becomes spotted with brownish stains . The flesh is firm , and white to buff . Its odor is not distinctive , while its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid . The latex is creamy @-@ white on initial exposure , and stains the gills grayish @-@ brown to dark brown or olive @-@ brown ; its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid . Older fruit bodies tend to have less abundant and weaker @-@ tasting latex . The spore print is pinkish @-@ buff . The edibility of L. argillaceifolius is unknown . The cap surface will turn yellow to orange when a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide is applied . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spores are roughly spherical to broadly elliptical , and measure 7 – 11 by 7 – 8 µm . They are ornamented with warts and ridges that sometimes form a partial reticulum ( a pattern of interconnected ridges ) , with prominences up to 1 µm high . The spore are hyaline ( translucent ) and amyloid , meaning that they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent . The cap cuticle of young specimens is made of a tissue type known an ixotrichoderm , which contains gelatinized hyphae of different lengths arranged in roughly parallel fashion . As the mushroom matures , the cap cuticle gradually becomes an <unk> — characterized by branching , entangled , gelatinous hyphae . The basidia ( the spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , and measure 45 – 52 by 9 – 10 @.@ 5 µm . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) are abundant , and relatively long — between 60 – 140 µm long by 6 – 14 µm thick . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) measure 32 – 67 by 6 – 9 µm .

 Lactarius argillaceifolius var. dissimilis , a variety reported from South Carolina , is nearly identical in appearance , but it has white latex that tastes bitter then acrid . The structure of the cap cuticle differs from the nominate variety in that it has dextrinoid ( staining yellowish or reddish brown with Meltzer 's reagent ) incrustations on the hyphae . The variety megacarpus has a larger cap ( up to 27 cm ( 11 in ) wide with flesh that is up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick ) , and white and unchanging latex with an acrid taste . Its stem measures 16 to 20 cm ( 6 @.@ 3 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) long by 4 to 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) wide near the top . Microscopically , the spores of var. megacarpus are more reticulate than the nominate variety . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Lactarius trivialis is a European species that is similar in appearance to L. argillaceifolius , and they are often confused for each other . L. trivialis can be distinguished by gills that stain brown when exposed to the latex , and a preference for growing in <unk> and birch @-@ rich boreal and subalpine forests . Variety megacarpus may be confused with L. pallescens , a smaller paler @-@ colored species with latex that stains gills lilac rather than brown . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Like all Lactarius species , L. argillaceifolius is mycorrhizal . The fruit bodies of Lactarius argillaceifolius grow scattered or in groups on the ground under hardwoods , especially oak , from July to October . It is often one of the first mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory . The fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long @-@ lasting . The species is found from eastern Canada south to Florida , and west to Minnesota and Texas . It is common in northeast Mexico . The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil ( state of Santa Catarina ) growing in association with pine ( Pinus elliottii ) plantations , where it has probably been introduced with pine seedlings brought by settlers . L. argillaceifolius var. megacarpus has been collected from Baja California , California , Oregon , and Washington , where it grows in association with coast live oak and tanoak .

 Jeffrey Pollack ( born circa 1965 ) is a sports business consultant and former Commissioner of the World Series of Poker . He was educated at Northwestern University , The Graduate School of Political Management and the University of Massachusetts Amherst . Pollack later completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard University . After a brief career in politics , Pollack moved into the industry of sports business where he ’ s held executive roles with the NBA , NASCAR , and the World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) . 
 Pollack was listed on the first of Sports Business Journal 's " 40 Under 40 " and twice to The Sporting News 100 . He has also won two Emmy Awards . Pollack is married , and resides in both Los Angeles and Las Vegas . His half @-@ brother is Gary Bettman , the Commissioner of the National Hockey League . 
 In 2011 , Pollack launched Federated Sports + Gaming ( FS + G ) and the Epic Poker League , where he served as Executive Chairman . Within a year , FS + G had filed bankruptcy . 
 In early 2015 , Pollack was hired as special advisor to the San Diego Chargers . 
 = = Education and Early career = = 
 Pollack received his undergraduate degree in journalism from Northwestern University , in addition to two master 's degrees . The first master 's was from The Graduate School of Political Management and his second was in sports management from the University of Massachusetts Amherst . Pollack subsequently completed the Advanced Management Program at Harvard University . 
 Initially , Pollack ’ s career led into politics . A summer internship with the American Jewish Congress prompted a one @-@ year role with the AJC . He worked as a lobbyist on legislation that would permit religious headwear for active military personal in noncombat settings . Pollack then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates , a leading political public relations firm . He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early @-@ 1990s . The inception of Pollack ’ s career in sports business occurred in 1992 when he realized — while flying from LA to New York — that there was a niche to fill in the industry . 
 In February 1994 , at the age of 29 , Pollack founded The Sports Business Daily . It was the first daily trade publication for the sports industry . Pollack modelled the concept for the Sports Business Daily on the political daily The Hotline . Its primary goal was to “ cover the coverage , ” or aggregate and organize daily news that was related to business of sports Doug Bailey , The Hotline 's founder , was Jeffrey Pollack 's partner in this venture . Pollack later noted that Bailey ’ s influence was “ absolutely critical ” to the initial success of The Daily . The Sports Business Daily originally occupied 3 rooms in the same building and initially hired The Hotline 's Stephen Bilafer as the Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief . Fellow editor Chuck Todd followed Bilafer in the move from The Hotline to The Daily . Bilafer would go on to note that it would have been a “ deal breaker ” had Todd not been permitted to join him at the SBD . After assembling a small editorial , marketing and sales team , The Sports Business Daily launched on September 12 , 1994 amidst the “ perfect storm of business and sports stories . ” With Pollack as its president and publisher , The Sports Business Daily garnered a strong reputation among to decision @-@ makers in the industry . When the time The Sports Business Daily was sold in 1996 , it was a " recognized leader in sports industry news and is relied upon by top sports , entertainment , financial , and media executives worldwide . " At the time of the sale , The Sports Business Daily provided the content for ESPN 's <unk> " Industry Insider . " 
 Pollack 's career with the NBA began when he was hired as a communications consultant for the NBA during its collective bargaining arrangement . Pollack consulted with NBA commissioner David Stern and helped design the relaunch strategy after the NBA lockout in the 1998 – 99 season . As a result of these activities , Pollack was hired as the Vice President of Marketing & Corporate Communications for the NBA . He remained with the league until 2000 . 
 After a brief stint with a sports website , which Pollack once termed his “ reverse MBA , ” he was hired as the Managing Director of Broadcasting and New Media for NASCAR Digital Entertainment . NASCAR had recently consolidated its media rights and the brand reoriented the way it presented itself to consumer product and global media companies . Pollack helped develop NASCAR 's television partnerships with Fox , FX , NBC and TNT and it was under his guidance that NASCAR grew into a major sporting event . At the time , it rose to the “ second @-@ most @-@ watched <unk> <unk> on cable TV , behind football . " Pollack also encouraged NASCAR to use advanced media and technologies . One of his central innovations was to create an immersive experience for viewers at home . He helped developed the cable TV program , NASCAR <unk> Car , which involved mounting cameras that could capture the race from inside the cars . [ 15 ] Pollack won two Emmy Awards , as a result : the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Achievement in Interactive Television Programming and a Sports Emmy for Outstanding Innovative Technical Achievement . He was also the first to receive the Billboard Digital Entertainment Award for the best interactive television programming .

 In 2005 , Harrah 's Casino hired Pollack as its Vice President of Marketing . While he was officially responsible for Harrah ’ s sports ventures , which included boxing and motor sports , Pollack stated that , " My top priority is to grow the popularity of the World Series of Poker … It is already the No. 1 brand in poker , but we 're going to make it even stronger through world @-@ class media partnerships , strategic marketing alliances and superior customer service . " By most accounts , he succeeded doing just this . Pollack introduced a range of changes into the WSOP ’ s media relations , player relations , tournament structure and schedule , and expanded into international markets . 
 His first responsibility with Harrah 's was the 2005 World Series of Poker . Poker players ' first impression of him centered on the 2005 Tournament of Champions ( ToC ) . The ToC was hyped as a $ 2 @.@ 5 million <unk> for which players had to qualify . In 2005 , the ToC was sponsored by Pepsi , who was about to start an advertising campaign involving Doyle Brunson , Johnny Chan , and Phil Hellmuth . Pepsi insisted that its three spokesmen take part in the ToC and the WSOP consented . The other players objected that three corporate exemptions were granted at the last moment . Pollack was heavily criticized , but addressed the criticism head on and ensured that a similar misstep would never occur . 
 = = = WSOP Changes = = = 
 On January 13 , 2006 he was promoted to Commissioner of the WSOP . One of his first actions as the commissioner was to work towards avoiding the criticism of the ToC . Pollack started meeting with a group of professional poker players in a monthly council . While the council did not have formal decision @-@ making authority , Pollack stated in 2009 that “ we haven ’ t made a meaningful decision about event schedules , structures , rules , et cetera , since 2006 without the input of the Players Advisory Council . ” 
 Pollack believed that the success of the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year , but rather upon the players ' experiences . For example , in 2007 the WSOP flattened its award structure . The cash awards were distributed more evenly so that people who went out earlier earned more money , while those who made it to the final table won less . 
 In an effort to reduce complaints about marked cards , the WSOP entered into a partnership with United States Playing Card Company ( <unk> ) . <unk> introduced a new " Poker Peek " cards as the official card of the WSOP . New decks were introduced every day at every table . In 2006 , <unk> provided playing cards that became creased as the events endured , resulting in cards that were essentially marked . 
 The training of WSOP dealers was also heavily criticized in past tournaments . In an effort to forestall this criticism , the WSOP began intensive training for dealers as early as March 2007 for over 300 dealers . The training included staff and supervisory training . Part of the reason for this additional training was to prevent a repeat of the " extra chips " that materialized during 2006 's main event . During the 2006 main event , the tournament finished with more chips than normal chip upgrading would have led to . Another effort to reduce that risk was the introduction of special chips exclusively for the main event . 
 In 2008 , Pollack revised the tournament ’ s schedule and introduced a four @-@ month break after the finalists had been determined in July . The hiatus was intended to help build suspense and allow the finalists to promote themselves as “ poker ambassadors ” before play resumed in November . The final two days of play were edited down to a two @-@ hour show and broadcast on ESPN .
