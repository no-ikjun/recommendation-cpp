" The episode was about " how he [ SpongeBob ] keeps missing the bus and how that makes him feel . " Williams said the episode was " so small that you could explore gags and opportunities for gags . " The episode was an example of " a good outline " in the series where the storyboards and humor were done easily . Williams said " it was great for the board guys . " She added " In many ways , my job was to create situations where the board guys could be funny , to create a situation that could be funny , and let them go for the actual , specific jokes . "

 = 2010 Pichilemu earthquake = 
 The 2010 Pichilemu earthquake ( Spanish : <unk> de Pichilemu de 2010 ) , also known as the Libertador O 'Higgins earthquake , was a 6 @.@ 9 MW intraplate earthquake that struck Chile 's O 'Higgins Region on 11 March 2010 . The earthquake was centred 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) northwest of the city of Pichilemu , according to the University of Chile Seismological Service . 
 The earthquake was caused by increased regional stress arising from an earthquake on 27 February , centered offshore Maule Region , which was felt throughout central Chile . The 11 March earthquake was at first thought to be an aftershock from the 27 February event , but University of Chile Seismologist Jaime Campos identified it as an " independent earthquake " . The Hawaii @-@ based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center pointed out the possibility of local tsunamis within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the epicentre , although small , but violent waves were seen in the Pichilemu and Bucalemu area . One person was reported dead . At least eleven aftershocks immediately followed , causing panic throughout coastal towns between the Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions . 
 The earthquake was specially destructive in the epicentre town , Pichilemu , capital of Cardenal Caro Province . The city hosts five National Monuments of Chile , of which two , the Agustín Ross Park and the Agustín Ross Cultural Centre , were seriously damaged by the earthquake . It also damaged the villages of La Aguada and Cardonal de Panilonco . Rancagua , the capital of O 'Higgins Region , was also damaged , leading President Sebastián Piñera to declare a catastrophe state in O 'Higgins Region . 
 = = Background = = 
 Nearly all of the territory of Chile is subject to earthquakes , arising from strains in the subducting Nazca and South American Plates or shallow strike @-@ slip faults . The subduction zone along the Chilean coast produced the most powerful earthquake ever recorded , the 1960 Valdivia earthquake . Some earthquakes which occurred near the epicentre of the 11 March 2010 event are the 1985 <unk> and <unk> Lake earthquakes . 
 On 27 February 2010 , a strong earthquake , which reached a magnitude of 8 @.@ 8 on the moment magnitude scale , hit central Chile . The earthquake occurred in the region of the plate boundary between the Nazca and South American plates , offshore Maule Region . The earthquake produced a tsunami which caused great damage in cities and towns along the Chilean coast ; Pichilemu was " devastated " after the earthquake and tsunami struck . 
 The 6 @.@ 9 earthquake of 11 March 2010 occurred two weeks after the 27 February event . Chilean seismologists , including Sergio Barrientos from the University of Chile Seismological Service , were worried about the " absence of an earthquake around magnitude 7 following the February 27 quake . " Two foreshocks of the 11 March event occurred on 5 March : one reached magnitude 5 @.@ 7 , and the other magnitude 5 @.@ 2 ; both were felt between the Valparaíso and Maule regions . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Pichilemu earthquake was caused by the change in regional stress from the 27 February earthquake . Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) of the 11 March earthquake locations and seismic @-@ wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate , unlike the 27 February earthquake , which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates . Later in 2010 , University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate . While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile , a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake , a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached . 
 The earthquake has been given three different locations : the University of Chile Seismological Service ( Servicio <unk> de la Universidad de Chile ) stated that the event occurred 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) northwest of Pichilemu , at a depth of 33 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 20 @.@ 6 mi ) ; the United States Geological Service reported the earthquake occurred 105 kilometres ( 65 mi ) west of Rancagua , capital of O 'Higgins Region , at a depth of 11 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) ; and local online newspaper Pichilemu News reported the earthquake occurred 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) northeast of Pichilemu , between the villages of Panilonco and La Aguada , and reached a moment magnitude of 7 @.@ 2 . 
 On 15 March 2010 , seismologist Mario Pardo from the University of Chile Seismological Service ruled out that Pichilemu was experiencing a seismic swarm , after public concerns about the continued aftershocks in the area ; as of that date , more than 50 aftershocks had occurred in the area , the strongest of them measuring 6 @.@ 7 in the moment magnitude scale , minutes after the initial quake . From the pattern of aftershocks , it has been suggested that this earthquake originated from rupture along a previously unknown geological fault , the Pichilemu Fault , between Pichilemu and the commune of <unk> in Maule Region , at 15 km depth , 40 km in length and 20 km wide . At first it was not known whether this fault was formed during the earthquake or if it was just reactivated , however geologist José <unk> from the University of Chile affirmed that " [ the fault ] corresponds to a long life fault , in a million years time , whose activity had not been detected before . " 
 In a 2012 publication titled Aftershock <unk> of the 27 February 2010 Mw 8 @.@ 8 Maule Earthquake Rupture Zone , it was stated that , in total , 10 @,@ 000 aftershocks were located in the Pichilemu area for the first six months after the mainshock ; this pronounced crustal aftershock activity with mainly normal faulting mechanisms found in approximately a 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) wide region , with sharp inclined borders and oriented oblique to the trench . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The earthquake took place minutes before the new President of Chile , Sebastián Piñera , was sworn in , at about 12 : 15 local time , at the Chilean congress in Valparaíso , where the shaking was clearly felt . Piñera was at the Palace of Cerro Castillo at the time of the earthquake , and as he left the place , he was seen " looking worried " ; Michelle Bachelet , the outgoing president , was also seen " worried " by the earthquake as she entered the Congress . La Nación newspaper reported some journalists attempted to flee the Congress building . According to Spanish newspaper El Mundo , there was " nervousness " at the ceremony , and the ceremony narrator called for calm , adding that the Congress building could even stand stronger earthquakes . 
 Presidents Néstor Kirchner of Argentina , Evo Morales of Bolivia , Álvaro Uribe of Colombia , Rafael Correa of Ecuador , and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay were present at the ceremony , but television footage showed that the inauguration was not interrupted , even though there was a tsunami warning in place ; however , it was reported the ceremony was " speeded . " 
 President Piñera cancelled the ceremonial lunch with his visitors and traveled to Rancagua , one of the cities most affected by the earthquake ; Piñera subsequently declared a catastrophe state in O 'Higgins Region as a result of the earthquake , and appointed Army General Antonio <unk> as Area Commander in Chief ( Jefe de Plaza ) for the region , while he was visiting Rancagua that day . The declaration meant that " the military would occupy the area to keep order and prevent the kind of looting that occurred in Concepción during the first two to three days after last month 's quake " , according to The New York Times . 
 = = Tsunami = = 
 A Pacific @-@ wide tsunami warning was not issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center , although the organization pointed out the possibility of local tsunamis within 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) of the epicentre , roughly the area between La Serena and Concepción . Half an hour after the earthquake , the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy ( Servicio <unk> y <unk> de la Armada , <unk> ) issued a tsunami warning for the area between Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions , as a way of " keeping people protected " against the possible occurrence of new tsunamis . President Piñera urged coastal residents to move to higher ground in case of a tsunami . Following the tsunami alert , thousands of residents of central Pichilemu fled to La Cruz Hill , with some of them staying them for several days , and received advice from members of the Army . People from the village of Cáhuil stayed at Cordón . The tsunami warning emitted by <unk> was lifted that same day at around 15 : 50 local time . 
 According to a preliminary report by the National Office of Emergency of the Interior Ministry ( Oficina Nacional de <unk> del Ministerio del Interior , <unk> ) on 11 March 2010 , only ' small waves , without any [ special ] kind of characteristics ' were seen in the area surrounding Pichilemu , while the USGS reported a small tsunami , with sea wave heights of 16 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 525 ft ) at Valparaíso , and 29 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 951 ft ) at San Antonio . Interior Minister Rodrigo <unk> reported violent waves in Pichilemu and Bucalemu . 
 = = Damage and casualties = = 
 At Pichilemu , the epicentre town , the earthquake destroyed the <unk> surrounding Agustín Ross Park , damaged severely the recently re @-@ inaugurated Agustín Ross Cultural Centre , and the Espinillo , and <unk> villages . The earthquake was accompanied by " great noise , " according to witnesses from the Pichilemu villages of Cardonal de Panilonco and La Aguada ; most of the already damaged buildings in La Aguada fell down , including the local church . The road to Cardonal de Panilonco was damaged , and many houses built with adobe did not resist the shaking . 
 Outside Pichilemu , in Rancagua , local mayor Eduardo Soto reported severe damage to homes in the town . The Santa Julia highway overpass located between Rancagua and <unk> collapsed , and part of the Pan @-@ American highway was damaged . A power outage affected Pichilemu for two days , beginning right after the earthquake struck , and there were partial power outages in <unk> , San Fernando and Peumo . In Santiago , " windows rattled , buildings trembled and cellphone service failed " , according to a The New York Times article . The old Basílica del Salvador in Santiago , which was damaged during the 1985 <unk> earthquake and was never repaired , suffered additional damage . In Nilahue Barahona , a village near the town of Pumanque , electric cables fell to the ground during the earthquake , causing a fire that burned 65 hectares ( 160 acres ) of a pine , eucalyptus and grassland forest . The earthquake was also reported to have been felt in Mendoza , Bariloche , Córdoba , San Rafael , Buenos Aires , Montevideo , and Asunción . 
 One person died of a heart attack during the earthquake in Talca , Maule Region . A United States Geological Survey summary of the earthquake reported damage at Rancagua , 177 kilometers northeast of Pichilemu . Relief efforts for the 27 February earthquake stalled for about six hours because of the constant aftershocks . 
 According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's National Geophysical Data Center , the damage provoked by the earthquake and its accompanying small tsunami was " limited " , adding that " a rough estimate of the dollar amount of damage " was " roughly corresponding to less than one million " . 
 = = Aftershocks = = 
 Following the main shock , there were two aftershocks of magnitude 6 or greater . The first of them occurred at 11 : 55 local time , fifteen minutes after the initial quake , and was centered in the commune of La Estrella , Cardenal Caro Province , at a depth of 18 @.@ 0 kilometres ( 11 @.@ 2 mi ) , reaching a magnitude of 6 @.@ 7 ; another aftershock , of magnitude 6 @.@ 0 , took place eleven minutes later , at 12 : 06 local time , this time centered in Pichilemu , at a depth of 29 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 18 @.@ 2 mi ) . In total , there were ten aftershocks within the six hours after the 6 @.@ 9 magnitude earthquake , two of magnitude 6 or greater , and seven between 5 and 6 . 
 Almost two months later , on 2 May 2010 , an aftershock of magnitude 5 @.@ 8 MW struck the Chilean O 'Higgins Region , at 10 : 52 local time . The aftershock was centered 44 kilometres ( 27 mi ) southwest of Navidad , and occurred at a depth of 32 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 20 mi ) , according to the University of Chile Seismological Service . The National Emergencies Office ( <unk> ) reported that the aftershock was felt most strongly in Talca , 258 kilometres ( 160 mi ) south of Santiago , and that there were no casualties , only some telephone lines had collapsed . Six other aftershocks subsequently hit the Pichilemu area that day . The United States Geological Survey measured the aftershock with a magnitude of 5 @.@ 9 . 
 A further aftershock of the Pichilemu earthquake occurred on 29 September 2010 at 12 : 29 local time . It reached magnitude 5 @.@ 6 , and its epicentre was centered 13 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) southwest of Lolol , 43 kilometres ( 27 mi ) southwest of Santa Cruz , at a depth of 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) . Telephone lines collapsed in O 'Higgins Region . No infrastructural damage or casualties was reported . The aftershock was felt between the Valparaíso and Maule regions . The event reached Mercalli V intensity in Rancagua , Navidad , Talca , Curicó , amid other cities and towns . 
 As of February 2013 , there have been about 8 @,@ 500 aftershocks of the Chilean February and March 2010 earthquakes according to the University of Chile Seismological Service , with most taking place in the <unk> of Pichilemu . Seismologist Sergio Ruiz said that " a significant number of aftershocks " will take place at least until 2015 .

 The earthquake was reported by local , national and international news media . Locally , online newspaper Pichilemu News published an article named " First signs of change ? : Shaken handover ceremony in Chile because of new earthquake aftershocks " ( " ¿ Los <unk> <unk> del <unk> ? : <unk> <unk> de <unk> se <unk> en el <unk> ante nuevas <unk> del <unk> " ) on 11 March ; five days later , local newspaper El Expreso de la Costa published an interview with Mario Pardo , seismologist in charge of the geophysics department of the University of Chile , who recommended people of Pichilemu to " try to remain calm , the worst already happened " . The only local radio that continued broadcasting through the day of the earthquake was Radio Entre Olas , directed by Jorge Nasser Guerra , who along with two other radio workers , reportedly were the only not to be evacuated after the earthquake in Pichilemu . Because the earthquake provoked a power outage , the radio worked with " emergency equipment " . Previously , after the 27 February earthquake , Entre Olas did not stop broadcasting either , despite there was a power outage that lasted for several days . 
 Nationally @-@ distributed newspaper El Mercurio published on its 12 March 2010 main page the headline " 6 @.@ 9 [ magnitude ] aftershock marks the most seismic day after the earthquake " ( " <unk> de 6 @,@ 9 ° <unk> el día más <unk> post <unk> " ) , adding that " [ s ] <unk> of the twenty <unk> that occurred yesterday [ 11 March ] in central @-@ southern Chile had their epicentre in Pichilemu , Region of O 'Higgins , which was declared in Disaster State yesterday . " On that same day , Santiago @-@ based newspaper La Tercera published on their headline : " Piñera faces first crisis as he takes office as new President " ( " Piñera <unk> <unk> crisis al <unk> como nuevo Presidente " ) ; La Tercera <unk> : " The 6 @.@ 9 Richter magnitude earthquake , which occurred minutes before the power handover took place , added an additional quota of drama to the oath of Sebastián Piñera , whose agenda was already modified by the 27 February disaster . " Other newspapers of national distribution where the earthquake was reported on its main page included Las Últimas Noticias ( which featured a photograph of President Piñera <unk> a helicopter in military dress ) , <unk> , and La Nación , whose main headline said " Emergency measures marked start of Piñera [ ' s presidency ] " ( " <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> de Piñera " ) . 
 Throughout Chile , regional newspapers also reported the earthquake and tsunami warning on their edition of 12 March 2010 . Among these are La Estrella de Arica ( Arica ) , La Estrella de Iquique ( Iquique ) , El Mercurio de Antofagasta , La Estrella del Norte ( both from Antofagasta ) , El Mercurio de Calama , La Estrella del Loa ( both from Calama ) , El Diario de Atacama , Diario <unk> ( both from Copiapó ) , El Día ( La Serena ) , El Mercurio de Valparaíso , La Estrella de Valparaíso ( both from Valparaíso ) , El <unk> ( San Antonio ) , El <unk> ( Rancagua ) , La Prensa ( Curicó ) , El Sur ( Concepción ) , El Austral de <unk> ( <unk> ) , El Diario Austral de Los Ríos ( Valdivia ) , El Austral de Osorno ( Osorno ) , El <unk> ( Puerto Montt ) , and La Prensa Austral ( Punta Arenas ) . 
 Among the international media who reported on the quake were the BBC , CNN , CBS News , The Huffington Post , and news agencies Al Jazeera , Reuters , and Associated Press . The New York Times included on their 12 March 2010 main page a photograph of Presidents Fernando Lugo of Paraguay and Rafael Correa of Ecuador " re @-@ acting to an aftershock felt Thursday [ 11 March ] in Valparaíso , Chile , the strongest since the devastating Feb. 27 earthquake " ; the photograph was followed by the headline " For Chile , More Aftershocks , and an Inauguration " .

 = Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 = 
 Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ( MH370 / <unk> ) was a scheduled international passenger flight operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared on 8 March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport , Malaysia , to Beijing Capital International Airport in China . The aircraft last made voice contact with air traffic control at 01 : 19 MYT , 8 March ( 17 : 19 UTC , 7 March ) when it was over the South China Sea , less than an hour after takeoff . It disappeared from air traffic controllers ' radar screens at 01 : 22 MYT . Malaysian military radar continued to track the aircraft as it deviated westwards from its planned flight path and crossed the Malay Peninsula . It left the range of Malaysian military radar at 02 : 22 while over the Andaman Sea , 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) north @-@ west of Penang in north @-@ western Malaysia . The aircraft , a Boeing 777 @-@ 200ER , was carrying 12 Malaysian crew members and 227 passengers from 15 nations . 
 A multinational search effort began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea , from whence the aircraft 's signal was last seen on secondary surveillance radar , and was soon extended to the Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea . Analysis of satellite communications between the aircraft and Inmarsat 's satellite communications network concluded that the flight continued until at least 08 : 19 and flew south into the southern Indian Ocean , although the precise location cannot be determined . Australia took charge of the search on 17 March , when the search moved to the southern Indian Ocean . On 24 March , the Malaysian government noted that the final location determined by the satellite communication is far from any possible landing sites , and concluded that " Flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean . " The current phase of the search , the largest and most expensive in aviation history , is a comprehensive survey of the sea floor about 1 @,@ 800 kilometres ( 970 nmi ) south @-@ west of Perth , Western Australia , which began in October 2014 . Nothing was found of the aircraft until 29 July 2015 , when a piece of marine debris , later confirmed to be a flaperon from Flight 370 , washed ashore on Réunion Island . Although multiple additional small pieces of debris have been found , the bulk of the aircraft has still not been located , prompting many theories about its disappearance . 
 Malaysia established the Joint Investigation Team ( JIT ) to investigate the incident , working with foreign aviation authorities and experts . Neither the crew nor the aircraft 's communication systems relayed a distress signal , indications of bad weather , or technical problems before the aircraft vanished . Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated , but eliminated as suspects . Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance , after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives . Power was lost to the aircraft 's satellite data unit ( SDU ) at some point between 01 : 07 and 02 : 03 ; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat 's satellite communication network at 02 : 25 — three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar . Based on analysis of the satellite communications , the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for five hours with little deviation in its track , ending when its fuel was exhausted . 
 With the presumed loss of all on board , Flight 370 is the second deadliest incident involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines ' history , behind Flight 17 in both categories . Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially , a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after Flight 370 and the crash of Flight 17 ; the airline was <unk> by the end of 2014 . The Malaysian government received significant criticism , especially from China , for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search . Flight 370 's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders , including several issues raised four years earlier — but never mandated — following the loss of Air France Flight 447 . In response to Flight 370 's disappearance , the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) adopted new standards for aircraft position reporting over open ocean , extended recording time for cockpit voice recorders , and , from 2020 , will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the flight recorders , or the information they contain , before the recorders sink below water .

 Flight 370 was operated with a Boeing 777 @-@ <unk> , serial number <unk> , registration 9M @-@ MRO . It was the <unk> Boeing 777 produced , first flown on 14 May 2002 , and was delivered new to Malaysia Airlines on 31 May 2002 . The aircraft was powered by two Rolls @-@ Royce Trent 892 engines and configured to carry 282 passengers . It had accumulated 53 @,@ 471 @.@ 6 hours and 7 @,@ 526 cycles in service and had not previously been involved in any major incidents , though a minor incident while taxiing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport in August 2012 resulted in a broken wing tip . Its last maintenance " A check " was carried out on 23 February 2014 . The aircraft was in compliance with all applicable Airworthiness Directives for the airframe and engines . A replenishment of the crew oxygen system was performed on 7 March 2014 , a routine maintenance task ; an examination of this procedure found nothing unusual . 
 The Boeing 777 was introduced in 1994 and is generally regarded as having an excellent safety record . Since its first commercial flight in June 1995 , there have been only four other serious incidents involving hull @-@ loss : British Airways Flight 38 in 2008 ; a cockpit fire in a parked EgyptAir Flight 667 at Cairo International Airport in 2011 ; the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 in 2013 , in which three people died ; and Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 , which was shot down over Ukraine with 298 people aboard in July 2014 .

 Under a 2007 agreement with Malaysia Airlines , Tzu Chi — an international Buddhist organisation — immediately sent specially trained teams to Beijing and Malaysia to give emotional support to passengers ' families . The airline also sent its own team of caregivers and volunteers and agreed to bear the expenses of bringing family members of the passengers to Kuala Lumpur and providing them with accommodation , medical care , and counselling . Altogether , 115 family members of the Chinese passengers flew to Kuala Lumpur . Some other family members chose to remain in China , fearing they would feel too isolated in Malaysia .

ATC over peninsular Malaysia and adjacent waters is provided by the Kuala Lumpur Area Control Centre ( ACC ) ; Lumpur Radar is the name of the frequency used for en route air traffic . At 00 : 46 , Lumpur Radar cleared Flight 370 to flight level 350 — approximately 35 @,@ 000 ft ( 10 @,@ 700 m ) . At 01 : 01 , Flight 370 's crew reported to Lumpur Radar that they had reached flight level 350 , which they confirmed again at 01 : 08 . 
 = = = Communication lost = = = 
 The aircraft 's final automated position report and last transmission , using the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System ( ACARS ) protocol , was sent at 01 : 07 MYT ; among the data provided in the message was total fuel remaining — 43 @,@ 800 kg ( 96 @,@ 600 lb ) . The final verbal contact with air traffic control occurred at 01 : 19 : 30 , when Captain Shah acknowledged a send @-@ off by Lumpur Radar to Ho Chi Minh ACC : 
 Lumpur Radar : " Malaysian three seven zero , contact Ho Chi Minh one two zero decimal nine . Good night . " 
 Flight 370 : " Good night . Malaysian three seven zero . " 
 The crew was expected to contact air traffic control in Ho Chi Minh City as the aircraft passed into Vietnamese airspace , just north of the point where contact was lost . The captain of another aircraft attempted to reach the crew of Flight 370 " just after [ 01 : 30 ] " using the international distress frequency to relay Vietnamese air traffic control 's request for the crew to contact them ; the captain said he was able to establish contact , but only heard " mumbling " and static . Calls made to Flight 370 's cockpit at 02 : 39 and 07 : 13 were unanswered but acknowledged by the aircraft 's satellite data unit . 
 = = = Radar = = = 
 At 01 : 20 : 31 MYT , Flight 370 was observed on radar at the Kuala Lumpur ACC as it passed the navigational waypoint IGARI ( 6 ° 56 ′ 12 ″ N 103 ° 35 ′ 6 ″ E ) in the Gulf of Thailand ; five seconds later , the Mode @-@ S symbol disappeared from radar screens . At 01 : 21 : 13 , Flight 370 disappeared from the radar screen at Kuala Lumpur ACC and was lost about the same time on radar at Ho Chi Minh ACC , which reported that the aircraft was at the nearby waypoint <unk> . Air traffic control uses secondary radar , which relies on a signal emitted by a transponder on aircraft ; therefore , the transponder was no longer functioning on Flight 370 after 01 : 21 . The final transponder data indicated that the aircraft was flying at its assigned cruise altitude of flight level 350 and was travelling at 471 knots ( 872 km / h ; 542 mph ) true airspeed . There were few clouds around this point and no rain or lightning nearby . Later analysis estimated that Flight 370 had 41 @,@ 500 kg ( 91 @,@ 500 lb ) of fuel when it disappeared from secondary radar . 
 At the time that the transponder stopped functioning , military radar showed Flight 370 turning right , but then beginning a left turn to a south @-@ westerly direction . From 01 : 30 : 35 – 01 : 35 , military radar showed Flight 370 at 35 @,@ 700 ft ( 10 @,@ 900 m ) on a 231 ° magnetic heading , with a ground speed of 496 knots ( 919 km / h ; 571 mph ) . Flight 370 continued across the Malay Peninsula , fluctuating between 31 @,@ 000 – 33 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 400 – 10 @,@ 100 m ) in altitude . A civilian primary radar at Sultan Ismail Petra Airport with a 60 nmi ( 110 km ; 69 mi ) range made four detections of an unidentified aircraft between 01 : 30 : 37 and 01 : 52 : 35 ; the tracks of the unidentified aircraft are " consistent with those of the military data . " At 01 : 52 , Flight 370 was detected passing just south of Penang Island . From there , the aircraft flew across the Strait of Malacca passing close to the waypoint <unk> , and Pulau Perak at 02 : 03 , after which it flew along air route <unk> to waypoints MEKAR , <unk> , and possibly <unk> . The last known location , from and near the limits of Malaysian military radar , was at 02 : 22 , 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) after passing waypoint MEKAR and 200 nmi ( 370 km ; 230 mi ) northwest of Penang at an altitude of 29 @,@ 500 ft ( 9 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 Countries were reluctant to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities . Indonesia has an early warning radar system but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370 , despite the aircraft possibly having flown near , or over , the northern tip of Sumatra . Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off , but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards . Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working . The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off . Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370 , but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made . The signal did not include identifying data . No radar contact was detected by Australia , including the <unk> over @-@ the @-@ horizon radar system , which was believed to be looking north to detect illegal migrants and not west over the Indian Ocean where Flight 370 is thought to have flown . 
 = = = Satellite communication resumes = = = 
 At 02 : 25 MYT , the aircraft 's satellite communication system sent a " log @-@ on request " message — the first message on the system since the ACARS transmission at 01 : 07 — which was relayed by satellite to a ground station , both operated by satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat . After logging on to the network , the satellite data unit aboard the aircraft responded to hourly status requests from Inmarsat and two ground @-@ to @-@ aircraft phone calls , at 02 : 39 and 07 : 13 , which went unanswered by the cockpit . The final status request and aircraft acknowledgement occurred at 08 : 10 . The aircraft sent a log @-@ on request at 08 : 19 : 29 , which was followed , after a response from the ground station , by a " log @-@ on acknowledgement " message at 08 : 19 : 37 . The log @-@ on acknowledgement is the last piece of data available from Flight 370 . The aircraft did not respond to a status request from Inmarsat at 09 : 15 .

 At 01 : 38 MYT , Ho Chi Minh Area Control Centre ( ACC ) contacted Kuala Lumpur Area Control Centre to query the whereabouts of Flight 370 and informed them that they had not established verbal contact with Flight 370 , which was last detected by radar at waypoint <unk> . The two centres exchanged four more calls over the next 20 minutes with no new information . 
 At 02 : 03 , Kuala Lumpur ACC relayed to Ho Chi Minh ACC information received from Malaysia Airlines ' operations centre that Flight 370 was in Cambodian airspace . Ho Chi Minh ACC contacted Kuala Lumpur ACC twice in the following eight minutes asking for confirmation that Flight 370 was in Cambodian airspace . At 02 : 15 , the watch supervisor at Kuala Lumpur ACC queried Malaysia Airlines ' operations centre , which said that it could exchange signals with Flight 370 and that Flight 370 was in Cambodian airspace . Kuala Lumpur ACC contacted Ho Chi Minh ACC to ask whether the planned flight path for Flight 370 passed through Cambodian airspace . Ho Chi Minh ACC responded that Flight 370 was not supposed to enter Cambodian airspace and that they had already contacted Phnom Penh ACC ( which controls Cambodian airspace ) , which had no contact with Flight 370 . Kuala Lumpur ACC contacted Malaysia Airlines ' operations centre at 02 : 34 , inquiring about the communication status with Flight 370 , and were informed that Flight 370 was in a normal condition based on a signal download and that it was located at 14 ° 54 ′ 00 ″ N 109 ° 15 ′ 00 ″ E. Later , another Malaysia Airlines aircraft ( Flight 386 bound for Shanghai ) attempted , at the request of Ho Chi Minh ACC , to contact Flight 370 on the Lumpur Radar frequency — the frequency on which Flight 370 last made contact with Malaysian air traffic control — and on emergency frequencies . The attempt was unsuccessful . 
 At 03 : 30 , Malaysia Airlines ' operations centre informed Kuala Lumpur ACC that the locations it had provided earlier were " based on flight projection and not reliable for aircraft positioning . " Over the next hour , Kuala Lumpur ACC contacted Ho Chi Minh ACC asking whether they had contacted Chinese air traffic control . At 05 : 09 , Singapore ACC was queried for information about Flight 370 . At 05 : 20 , an undisclosed official — identified in the preliminary report released by Malaysia as " Capt [ name redacted ] " — contacted Kuala Lumpur ACC requesting information about Flight 370 ; he opined that , based on known information , " MH370 never left Malaysian airspace . " 
 The watch supervisor at Kuala Lumpur ACC activated the Kuala Lumpur Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre ( ARCC ) at 05 : 30 , over four hours after communication was lost with Flight 370 . The ARCC is a command post at an Area Control Centre that coordinates search @-@ and @-@ rescue activities when an aircraft is lost .

 Malaysia Airlines issued a media statement at 07 : 24 MYT , one hour after the scheduled arrival time of the flight at Beijing , stating that contact with the flight had been lost by Malaysian ATC at 02 : 40 and that the government had initiated search @-@ and @-@ rescue operations ; the time when contact was lost was later corrected to 01 : 21 . Neither the crew nor the aircraft 's communication systems relayed a distress signal , indications of bad weather , or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens .

 The news media reported several sightings of an aircraft that fit the description of the missing Boeing 777 . For example , on 19 March 2014 , CNN reported that witnesses , including fishermen , an oil rig worker and people on the <unk> <unk> atoll in the Maldives saw the missing airliner . Some claimed to have seen it crash . Three months later , the Daily Telegraph reported that a British woman claimed she may have seen the aircraft on fire .

 On 24 March , Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak appeared before media at 22 : 00 local time to give a statement regarding Flight 370 , during which he announced that he had been briefed by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch that it and Inmarsat ( the satellite data provider ) had concluded that the airliner 's last position before it disappeared was in the southern Indian Ocean . As there were no places there where it could have landed , the aircraft must therefore have crashed into the sea . 
 Just before Najib spoke at 22 : 00 MYT , an emergency meeting was called in Beijing for relatives of Flight 370 passengers . Malaysia Airlines announced that Flight 370 was assumed lost with no survivors . It notified most of the families in person or via telephone , and some received a SMS ( in English and Chinese ) informing them that it was highly likely that the aircraft had crashed with no survivors . 
 On 29 January 2015 the Director General of the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia , Azharuddin Abdul Rahman , announced that the status of Flight 370 would be changed to an " accident " , in accordance with the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation . 
 If the official assumption is confirmed , Flight 370 was the deadliest aviation incident in the history of Malaysia Airlines at the time of its disappearance , surpassing the 1977 hijacking and crash of Malaysian Airline System Flight 653 that killed all 100 passengers and crew on board , and the deadliest involving a Boeing 777 , surpassing Asiana Airlines Flight 214 ( 3 fatalities ) . In both of those categories , Flight 370 was surpassed 131 days later by Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 , another Boeing 777 @-@ 200ER , which was shot down on 17 July 2014 , killing all 298 people aboard . 
 = = Search = = 
 A search and rescue effort was launched in Southeast Asia soon after the aircraft 's disappearance . After initial analysis of communications between the aircraft and a satellite , the surface search was moved the following week to the southern Indian Ocean . Between 18 March and 28 April 19 vessels and 345 sorties by military aircraft searched over 4 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . The current phase of the search is a bathymetric survey and sonar search of the sea floor , about 1 @,@ 800 kilometres ( 970 nmi ; 1 @,@ 100 mi ) south @-@ west of Perth , Western Australia . Since 30 March 2014 the search has been coordinated by the Joint Agency Coordination Centre ( JACC ) , an Australian government agency established specifically to co @-@ ordinate the search effort to locate and recover Flight 370 , which primarily involves the Malaysian , Chinese , and Australian governments . 
 The search for Flight 370 is the most expensive search operation in aviation history . In June 2014 , Time estimated that the total search effort to that point had cost approximately US $ 70 million . The tender for the underwater search is AU $ 52 million ( US $ 43 million or € 35 million ) — shared by Australia and Malaysia — for 12 months . 
 = = = Southeast Asia = = = 
 The Kuala Lumpur Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre ( ARCC ) was activated at 05 : 30 MYT — four hours after communication was lost with the aircraft — to co @-@ ordinate search and rescue efforts . Search efforts began in the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea . On the second day of the search , Malaysian officials said that radar recordings indicated Flight 370 may have turned around ; the search zone was expanded to include part of the Strait of Malacca . On 12 March , the chief of the Royal Malaysian Air Force announced that an unidentified aircraft — believed to be Flight 370 — had travelled across the Malay peninsula and was last sighted on military radar 370 km ( 200 nmi ; 230 mi ) northwest of Penang Island ; search efforts were subsequently increased in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal . 
 Records of signals sent between the aircraft and a communications satellite over the Indian Ocean revealed that the aircraft had continued flying for almost six hours after its final sighting on Malaysian military radar . Initial analysis of these communications determined that Flight 370 was along one of two arcs — equidistant from the satellite — when its last signal was sent ; the same day this analysis was publicly disclosed , 15 March , authorities announced they would abandon search efforts in the South China Sea , Gulf of Thailand , and Strait of Malacca to focus their efforts on the two corridors . The northern arc — from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan — was soon discounted as the aircraft would have had to pass through heavily militarised airspace and those countries claimed their military radar would have detected an unidentified aircraft entering their airspace . 
 = = = Southern Indian Ocean = = = 
 The focus of the search shifted to the Southern Indian Ocean west of Australia and within Australia 's aeronautical and maritime Search and Rescue regions that extend to 75 ° E longitude . Accordingly , on 17 March , Australia agreed to lead the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean . 
 = = = = Initial search = = = = 
 From 18 – 27 March 2014 the search effort focused on a 305 @,@ 000 km2 ( 118 @,@ 000 sq mi ) area about 2 @,@ 600 km ( 1 @,@ 400 nmi ; 1 @,@ 600 mi ) south @-@ west of Perth that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said is " as close to nowhere as it 's possible to be " and which is renowned for its strong winds , inhospitable climate , hostile seas , and deep ocean floors . Satellite imagery of the region was analysed ; several objects of interest and two possible debris fields were identified on images captured between 16 – 26 March . None of these possible objects were found by aircraft or ships . 
 Revised estimates of the radar track and the aircraft 's remaining fuel led to a move of the search 1 @,@ 100 km ( 590 nmi ; 680 mi ) north @-@ east of the previous area on 28 March , which was followed by another shift on 4 April . An intense effort began to locate the underwater locator beacons ( ULBs ; informally known as " <unk> " ) attached to the aircraft 's flight recorders , whose batteries were expected to expire around 7 April . Two ships equipped with towed <unk> locators ( <unk> ) and a submarine equipped with a hull @-@ mounted acoustic system began searching for pings along a 240 @-@ kilometre ( 150 mi ) seabed line believed to be the Flight 370 impact area . Operators considered it a shot in the dark , when comparing the vast search area with the fact that a <unk> could only search up to 130 km2 ( 50 sq mi ) per day . Between 4 – 8 April several acoustic detections were made that were close to the frequency and rhythm of the sound emitted by the flight recorders ' ULBs ; analysis of the acoustic detections determined that , although unlikely , the detections could have come from a damaged <unk> . A sonar search of the sea @-@ floor near the detections was carried out between 14 April and 28 May without any sign of Flight 370 . In a March 2015 report , it was revealed that the battery for the <unk> attached to Flight 370 's flight data recorder had expired in December 2012 and may not have been as capable . 
 = = = = Underwater search = = = = 
 In late June 2014 details of the next phase of the search were announced ; officials have called this phase the " underwater search " , despite the previous seafloor sonar survey . Continued refinement of analysis of Flight 370 's satellite communications identified a " wide area search " along the arc where Flight 370 was located when it last communicated with the satellite . The priority search area within the wide area search is in its southern extent . Some of the equipment to be used for the underwater search operates best when towed 200 m ( 650 ft ) above the seafloor at the end of a 10 km ( 6 mi ) cable . Available bathymetric data for this region was of poor resolution , thus necessitating a bathymetric survey of the search area before the underwater phase began . Commencing in May , the bathymetric survey charted around 208 @,@ 000 km2 ( 80 @,@ 000 sq mi ) of seafloor through 17 December 2014 , when it was suspended for the ship conducting the survey to be mobilised in the underwater search . 
 The underwater phase of the search , which began on 6 October 2014 , uses three vessels equipped with towed deep water vehicles , which use side @-@ scan sonar , multi @-@ beam echo sounders , and video cameras to locate and identify aircraft debris . A fourth vessel participated in the search between January – May 2015 ; it had an autonomous underwater vehicle ( AUV ) to search areas which cannot be effectively searched by equipment on the other vessels . The governments of Malaysia , China , and Australia have agreed to thoroughly search 120 @,@ 000 km2 ( 46 @,@ 000 sq mi ) of seafloor . As of 29 June 2016 , over 110 @,@ 000 km2 ( 42 @,@ 000 sq mi ) of seafloor have been searched during the underwater phase of the search and the current phase is expected to be completed around August 2016 , weather permitting . In case the search does not recover the aircraft , the governments of Malaysia , China , and Australia have agreed not to extend the search area any further . 
 Following the discovery of the flaperon on Réunion , the ATSB reviewed their drift calculations for debris from the aircraft and , according to the JACC , they are satisfied that the search area is still the most likely crash site . Reverse drift modelling of the debris , to determine its origin after 16 months , also supports the current underwater search area , although reverse drift modelling is very imprecise over long periods . 
 = = Marine debris = = 
 On 29 July 2015 , aircraft debris was found on a beach in Saint @-@ André , on Réunion , an island in the western Indian Ocean , about 4 @,@ 000 km ( 2 @,@ 200 nmi ; 2 @,@ 500 mi ) west of the underwater search area . The object had a stenciled internal marking " 657 BB , " consistent with the code for a portion of a right wing flaperon ( a trailing edge control surface ) from a Boeing 777 . The following day , a damaged suitcase was found which may be associated with Flight 370 . The location is consistent with models of debris dispersal 16 months after an origin in the current search area , off the west coast of Australia . On 31 July , a Chinese water bottle and an Indonesian cleaning product were found in the same area . 
 The first object to be found was transported from Réunion — an overseas department of France — to Toulouse , for examination by France 's civil aviation accident investigation agency , the Bureau d 'Enquêtes et d 'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l 'Aviation Civile ( BEA ) , and a French defence ministry laboratory . Malaysia sent investigators to both Réunion and Toulouse . French police conducted a search of the waters around Réunion for additional debris . 
 On 2 August , Malaysian officials confirmed that the object was a flaperon from a Boeing 777 aircraft and that the verification was made with investigators from France , Malaysia , Boeing , and the US National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) . Three days later , the Prime Minister of Malaysia announced that the discovered flaperon was confirmed to be from Flight 370 ; French officials only stated that a " very high probability " existed that the object was from Flight 370 . On 3 September , French officials announced that serial numbers found on the flaperon link it " with certainty " to Flight 370 . This serial number was retrieved via <unk> . 
 A week after the discovery of a flaperon from Flight 370 on a beach on Réunion , France announced plans for an aerial search for possible marine debris around the island . On 7 August 2015 , France began searching an area 120 km ( 75 mi ) by 40 km ( 25 mi ) along the east coast of Réunion . Foot patrols for debris along beaches were also planned . Malaysia asked authorities in neighbouring states to be on alert for marine debris which could be from an aircraft . On 14 August it was announced that no debris that could be related to Flight 370 had been found at sea off Réunion , but that some had been found on land . Air and sea searches for debris ended on 17 August . 
 On 2 March 2016 , it was reported that an object ( with the text " no step " on it ) had been found off the coast of Mozambique and early photographic analysis suggested it could have come from the aircraft 's horizontal stabilizer . It was found in late February by Blaine Gibson on a sandbank in the Mozambique Channel , between Mozambique in eastern Africa and Madagascar ; and in the same part of the southern Indian Ocean where the only confirmed piece of debris , a flaperon , had been found the previous July . The fragment was sent to Australia where experts examined whether it originated from Flight 370 . 
 In December 2015 , Liam Lotter found a grey piece of debris on a beach in southern Mozambique , but only after he read in March 2016 about Gibson 's find ( some 300 kilometers from his find ) did his family alert authorities . It was flown to Australia for analysis . Later in March , Australian officials said that it was highly likely that both pieces of debris were from Flight 370 , and Malaysian authorities confirmed that with almost certainty it had originated from the flight ; transport Minister Darren Chester said that investigators had found the pieces were consistent with panels from a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft . On 24 March 2016 , the Geoscience Australia and ATSB confirmed that two panels recovered from Mozambique match that of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 . The location where both pieces were retrieved was found to be consistent with the drift model performed by CSIRO , further corroborating it could have come from Flight 370 . In April 2016 , the Australian analysis concluded that the Mozambique debris had " almost certainly " originated from the airplane . The items have been identified as coming from the right stabiliser and right wing respectively . 
 On 7 March 2016 more debris , possibly from the aircraft , was found on the island of Réunion . Ab Aziz <unk> , Malaysia 's Deputy Transport Minister , said that " an unidentified grey item with a blue border " , might be linked to Flight 370 . Both Malaysian and Australian authorities , coordinating the search in the South Indian Ocean , sent teams to verify whether the debris was from the missing aircraft . 
 On 21 March 2016 , South African based archaeologist Neels Kruger found a fragment with a partial Rolls Royce engine manufacturers logo on a beach near Mossel Bay , South Africa . An acknowledgement of a possible part of an engine cowling was made by the Malaysian Ministry of Transport . An additional piece of possible debris , suggested to have come from the interior of the aircraft , was found on the island of Rodrigues , Mauritius , in late March and was to be examined by Australian authorities . On 11 May 2016 , the authority determined that these two pieces of debris are " almost certainly " from Flight 370 . 
 On 9 June 2016 , The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a man named Samuel Armstrong had found what could possibly be debris from the aircraft , a piece with similar coloring to Malaysia Airlines ' clear @-@ gray livery on the bottom of their aircraft 's fuselage and a pyramid or seven @-@ shaped figure on it , at a location on Kangaroo Island , southern Australia . South Australian police collected the piece and it was to be delivered to the ATSB for further investigation . The examination found out it was not from the flight . 
 On 24 June 2016 , the Australian Transport Minister , Darren Chester , said that a piece of aircraft debris was found on Pemba Island , off of the coast of Tanzania . It was handed over to the authorities so that experts from Malaysia can determinate whether it is part of the aircraft . The Australian government released photos of the piece , believed to be an outboard wing flap , on 20 July .

 = = = International participation = = = 
 Malaysia set up a Joint Investigation Team ( JIT ) , composed of specialists from Malaysia , Australia , China , the UK , the US , and France , led according to ICAO standards by " an independent investigator in charge " . The team consists of an airworthiness group , an operations group , and a medical and human factors group . The airworthiness group will examine issues related to maintenance records , structures , and systems of the aircraft . The operations group will review flight recorders , operations , and meteorology . The medical and human factors group will investigate psychological , pathological , and survival factors . Malaysia also announced , on 6 April , that it had set up three ministerial committees — a Next of Kin Committee , a committee to organise the formation of the Joint Investigation Team , and a committee responsible for Malaysian assets deployed in the search effort . The criminal investigation is being led by the Royal Malaysia Police , assisted by Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities . 
 On 17 March , Australia took control for co @-@ ordinating search , rescue , and recovery operations . For the following six weeks , the Australian Maritime Safety Authority ( AMSA ) and Australian Transport Safety Board ( ATSB ) worked to determine the search area , correlating information with the JIT and other government and academic sources , while the Joint Agency Coordination Centre ( JACC ) coordinated the search efforts . Following the fourth phase of the search , the ATSB took responsibility for defining the search area . In May , the search strategy working group was established by the ATSB to determine the most likely position on the aircraft at the 00 : 19 UTC ( 08 : 19 MYT ) satellite transmission . The group included aircraft and satellite experts from : Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( UK ) , Boeing ( US ) , Defence Science and Technology Group ( Australia ) , Department of Civil Aviation ( Malaysia ) , Inmarsat ( UK ) , National Transportation Safety Board ( US ) , and Thales ( UK ) . 
 The Malaysian Ministry of Transport issued an interim report entitled " Factual Information : Safety Information for MH370 " on 8 March 2015 . As suggested by the report 's title , it focused on providing factual information and not analysis of possible causes of the disappearance . 
 = = = Analysis of satellite communication = = = 
 The communications between Flight 370 and the satellite communication network operated by Inmarsat , which were relayed by the Inmarsat @-@ 3 F1 satellite , provide the only significant clues to the location of Flight 370 after disappearing from Malaysian military radar at 02 : 22 MYT . These communications have also been used to deduce possible in @-@ flight events ( see next section ) . The investigative team was challenged with reconstructing the flight path of Flight 370 from a limited set of transmissions with no explicit information about the aircraft 's location , heading , or speed . 
 = = = = Background = = = = 
 Aeronautical satellite communication ( SATCOM ) systems are used to transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit as well as automated messages from on @-@ board systems using the ACARS communications protocol , but may also be used to transmit <unk> and ATN messages and provide voice , fax and data links using other protocols . The aircraft 's satellite data unit ( SDU ) is used to send and receive signals with the satellite communications network ; it operates independently of other aircraft equipment that communicate through the SATCOM system , many using the ACARS protocol . Signals from the SDU are relayed by a satellite , which simply changes the signal 's frequency , and then received by a ground station , which processes the signal and , if applicable , routes it to its destination ( e.g. , Malaysia Airlines ' operations centre ) ; signals to the aircraft are sent in reverse order . When the SDU is powered on and attempts to connect with the Inmarsat network , it transmits a log @-@ on request , which the ground station acknowledges . This is , in part , to determine that the SDU belongs to an active service subscriber and also used to determine which satellite should be used to transmit messages to the SDU . After connecting , if a ground station has not received any contact from a terminal for one hour , the ground station will transmit a " log @-@ on interrogation " message — informally referred to as a " ping " ; an active terminal responds automatically . The entire process of interrogating the terminal is referred to as a ' handshake ' . 
 = = = = Communications from 02 : 25 to 08 : 19 MYT = = = = 
 Although the ACARS data link on Flight 370 stopped functioning between 01 : 07 and 02 : 03 MYT , the SDU remained operative . After last contact by primary radar west of Malaysia , the following events were recorded in the log of Inmarsat 's ground station at Perth , Western Australia ( all times are MYT / UTC + 8 ) : 
 02 : 25 : 27 – First handshake – a log @-@ on request initiated by aircraft 
 02 : 39 : 52 – Ground to aircraft telephone call , acknowledged by SDU , unanswered 
 03 : 41 : 00 – Second handshake ( initiated by ground station ) 
 04 : 41 : 02 – Third handshake ( initiated by ground station ) 
 05 : 41 : 24 – Fourth handshake ( initiated by ground station ) 
 06 : 41 : 19 – Fifth handshake ( initiated by ground station ) 
 07 : 13 : 58 – Ground to aircraft telephone call , acknowledged by SDU , unanswered 
 08 : 10 : 58 – Sixth handshake ( initiated by ground station ) 
 08 : 19 : 29 – Seventh handshake ( initiated by aircraft ) ; widely reported as a " partial handshake ' " , consisting of two transmissions : 
 08 : 19 : 29 @.@ 416 – " log @-@ on request " message transmitted by aircraft ( seventh " partial " handshake ) 
 08 : 19 : 37 @.@ 443 – " log @-@ on acknowledge " message transmitted by aircraft , last transmission received from Flight 370 
 The aircraft did not respond to a ping at 09 : 15 . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 A few deductions can be made from the satellite communications . The first is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08 : 19 MYT — seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea . The varying burst frequency offset ( BFO ) values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed . The aircraft 's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite , so it can also be deduced that the aircraft 's navigation system was operational . 
 Since the aircraft did not respond to a ping at 09 : 15 , it can be concluded that at some point between 08 : 19 and 09 : 15 , the aircraft lost the ability to communicate with the ground station . The log @-@ on message sent from the aircraft at 08 : 19 : 29 was " log @-@ on request " . There are only a few reasons the SDU would transmit a log @-@ on request , such as a power interruption , software failure , loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU , or a loss of the link due to the aircraft 's attitude . Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that it was sent during power @-@ up after an electrical outage . At 08 : 19 , the aircraft had been airborne for 7 h 38 min ; the typical Kuala Lumpur @-@ Beijing flight is 51 ⁄ 2 hours and fuel exhaustion was likely . In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame @-@ out — which would eliminate power to the SDU — the aircraft 's ram air turbine ( RAT ) would deploy , providing power to some instruments and flight controls , including the SDU . Approximately 90 seconds after the 02 : 25 handshake — also a log @-@ on request — communications from the aircraft 's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log . Similar messages would be expected following the 08 : 19 handshake but none were received , supporting the fuel exhaustion scenario . 
 = = = = Analysis = = = = 
 Two parameters associated with these transmissions that were recorded in a log at the ground station were key to the investigation : 
 Burst time offset ( BTO ) – the time difference between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received . This measure is proportional to twice the distance from the ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station . This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth 's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance , which can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the rings outside the aircraft 's range . 
 Burst frequency offset ( BFO ) – the difference between the expected and received frequency of transmissions . The difference is caused by Doppler shifts as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station ; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station ; a small , constant error ( bias ) in the SDU that results from drift and aging ; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink . This measure can be analysed to determine the aircraft 's speed and heading , but multiple combinations of speed and heading can be valid solutions . 
 By combining the distance between the aircraft and satellite , speed , and heading with aircraft performance constraints ( e.g. fuel consumption , possible speeds and altitudes ) , investigators generated candidate paths that were analysed separately by two methods . The first assumed the aircraft was flying on one of the three autopilot modes ( two are further affected by whether the navigation system used magnetic north or true north as a reference ) , calculated the BTO and BFO values along these routes , and compared them with the values recorded from Flight 370 . The second method generated paths which had the aircraft 's speed and heading adjusted at the time of each handshake to minimise the difference between the calculated BFO of the path and the values recorded from Flight 370 . A probability distribution for each method at the BTO arc of the sixth handshake of the two methods was created and then compared ; 80 percent of the highest probability paths for both analyses combined intersect the BTO arc of the sixth handshake between 32 @.@ 5 ° S and 38 @.@ 1 ° S , which can be extrapolated to 33 @.@ 5 ° S and 38 @.@ 3 ° S along the BTO arc of the seventh handshake .

 The SATCOM link functioned normally from pre @-@ flight ( beginning at 00 : 00 MYT ) until it responded to a ground @-@ to @-@ air ACARS message with an acknowledge message at 01 : 07 . Ground @-@ to @-@ air ACARS messages continued to be transmitted to Flight 370 until Inmarsat 's network sent multiple " Request for <unk> " messages at 02 : 03 , without a response from the aircraft . At some time between 01 : 07 and 02 : 03 , power was lost to the SDU . At 02 : 25 , the aircraft 's SDU sent a " log @-@ on request " . It is not common for a log @-@ on request to be made in @-@ flight , but it could occur for multiple reasons . An analysis of the characteristics and timing of these requests suggest a power interruption in @-@ flight is the most likely culprit . As the power interruption was not due to engine flame @-@ out , per ATSB , it may have been the result of manually switching off the aircraft 's electrical system . 
 = = = = <unk> crew or hypoxia = = = = 
 An analysis by the ATSB comparing the evidence available for Flight 370 with three categories of accidents — an in @-@ flight upset ( e.g. , stall ) , a glide event ( e.g. , engine failure , fuel exhaustion ) , and an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event — concluded that an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event " best fit the available evidence " for the five @-@ hour period of the flight as it travelled south over the Indian Ocean without communication or significant deviations in its track , likely on autopilot . No consensus exists among investigators on the unresponsive crew or hypoxia theory . If no control inputs were made following flameout and the disengagement of autopilot , the aircraft would likely have entered a spiral dive and entered the ocean within 20 nmi ( 37 km ; 23 mi ) of the flameout and disengagement of autopilot .

 Two men boarded Flight 370 with stolen passports , which raised suspicion in the immediate aftermath of its disappearance . The passports , one Austrian and one Italian , were reported stolen in Thailand within the preceding two years . Interpol stated that both passports were listed on its database of lost and stolen passports , and that no check had been made against its database . Malaysia 's Home Minister , Ahmad Zahid Hamidi , criticised his country 's immigration officials for failing to stop the passengers travelling on the stolen European passports . The two one @-@ way tickets purchased for the holders of the stolen passports were booked through China Southern Airlines . It was reported that an Iranian had ordered the cheapest tickets to Europe via telephone in Bangkok , Thailand , and paid in cash . The two passengers were later identified as Iranian men , one aged 19 and the other 29 , who had entered Malaysia on 28 February using valid Iranian passports . The head of Interpol said the organization was " inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident " . The two men were believed to be asylum seekers . 
 United States and Malaysian officials were reviewing the backgrounds of every passenger named on the manifest . On 18 March , the Chinese government announced that it had checked all of the Chinese citizens on the aircraft and ruled out the possibility that any were involved in " destruction or terror attacks " . One passenger who worked as a flight engineer for a Swiss jet charter company was briefly suspected as a potential hijacker because he was thought to have the relevant skill set . 
 = = = = Crew involvement = = = = 
 Investigators believe someone in the cockpit of Flight 370 re @-@ programmed the aircraft 's autopilot before it travelled south across the Indian Ocean . Police searched the homes of the pilots and seized financial records for all 12 crew members , including bank statements , credit card bills and mortgage documents . On 2 April 2014 , Malaysia 's Police Inspector @-@ General said that more than 170 interviews had been conducted as part of Malaysia 's criminal investigation , including interviews with family members of the pilots and crew . 
 Media reports have claimed that Malaysian police have identified Captain Shah as the prime suspect if human intervention is proven to be the cause of Flight 370 's disappearance . The United States ' Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) reconstructed the deleted data from Captain Shah 's home flight simulator ; a Malaysian government spokesman indicated that " nothing sinister " had been found on it but a leaked American document stated that a route on the pilot 's home flight simulator , closely matching the projected flight over the Indian Ocean , was found during the FBI analysis of the hard drive of the computer used for the flight simulator . 
 The preliminary report issued by Malaysia in March 2015 stated that there was " no evidence of recent or imminent significant financial transactions carried out " by any of the pilots or crew and that analysis of the behaviour of the pilots on CCTV showed " no significant behavioural changes " . 
 = = = = Cargo = = = = 
 Flight 370 was carrying 10 @,@ 806 kg ( 23 @,@ 823 lb ) of cargo , of which four ULDs of mangosteens and 221 kg ( 487 lb ) of lithium @-@ ion batteries are of interest , according to Malaysian investigators . The four ULDs of mangosteens were loaded into the aft cargo bay of the aircraft . The lithium @-@ ion batteries were divided among two pallets in the forward cargo bay and one pallet placed in the rear of the aft cargo bay . 
 The lithium @-@ ion batteries were contained in a 2 @,@ 453 kg ( 5 @,@ 408 lb ) consignment being transported between Motorola Solutions facilities in Bayan <unk> , Malaysia and Tianjin , China ; the rest of the consignment consisted of walkie @-@ talkie chargers and accessories . The batteries were assembled on 7 March and transported to the Penang Cargo Complex to be transported by MASkargo — Malaysia Airlines ' cargo subsidiary — to be loaded onto a lorry to transport it to Kuala Lumpur International Airport and onwards by air to Beijing . At the Penang Cargo Complex , the consignment was inspected by MASkargo employees and Malaysian customs officials , but did not go through a security screening , before the truck was sealed for transfer to the airport . The consignment did not go through any additional inspections at Kuala Lumpur International Airport before it was loaded onto Flight 370 . Because the batteries were packaged in accordance with IATA guidelines , they were not regulated as dangerous goods . Lithium @-@ ion batteries can cause intense fires if they overheat and ignite , which has led to strict regulations on their transport aboard aircraft . A fire fuelled by lithium @-@ ion batteries caused the crash of UPS Airlines Flight 6 and lithium @-@ ion batteries are suspected to have caused a fire which resulted in the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 991 ; both were cargo aircraft . Some airlines have stopped carrying bulk shipments of lithium @-@ ion batteries on passenger aircraft , citing safety concerns . 
 A 4 @,@ 566 kg ( 10 @,@ 066 lb ) consignment of mangosteens was aboard Flight 370 , over half of which was harvested in Muar , Malaysia and the remainder from Sumatra , Indonesia . The mangosteens were packaged in plastic baskets containing 8 – 9 kg ( 18 – 20 lb ) of mangosteens and covered with a water @-@ soaked sponge to preserve their freshness . The mangosteens were loaded into four ULDs at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and inspected by officials from Malaysia 's Federal Agriculture Marketing Authority before being loaded onto Flight 370 . According to the head of Malaysian police , Inspector @-@ General Tan Sir Khalid Abu Bakar , the people who handled the mangosteens and the Chinese importers were questioned to rule out sabotage . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Information sharing = = = 
 Public communication from Malaysian officials regarding the loss of the flight was initially beset with confusion . The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise , incomplete , and sometimes inaccurate information , with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders . Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information , most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft . 
 Although Malaysia 's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein , who is also the country 's Defence Minister , denied the existence of problems between the participating countries , academics said that because of regional conflicts , there were genuine trust issues involved in co @-@ operation and sharing intelligence , and that these were hampering the search . International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty , security , intelligence , and national interests made meaningful multilateral co @-@ operation very difficult . A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently ; thus it was not a multilateral search effort . The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a positive sign of co @-@ operation . Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country 's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information . China , through the official Xinhua News Agency , said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency , a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later . 
 Malaysia had initially declined to release raw data from its military radar , deeming the information " too sensitive , " but later acceded . Defence experts suggested that giving others access to radar information could be sensitive on a military level , for example : " The rate at which they can take the picture can also reveal how good the radar system is . " One suggested that some countries could already have had radar data on the aircraft but were reluctant to share any information that could potentially reveal their defence capabilities and compromise their own security . Similarly , submarines patrolling the South China Sea might have information in the event of a water impact , and sharing such information could reveal their locations and listening capabilities . 
 Criticism was also levelled at the delay of the search efforts . On 11 March , three days after the aircraft disappeared , British satellite company Inmarsat had provided officials ( or its partner , SITA ) with data suggesting the aircraft was nowhere near the areas in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea being searched at that time ; and may have diverted its course through a southern or northern corridor . This information was only publicly acknowledged and released by Najib on 15 March in a press conference . Explaining why information about satellite signals had not been made available earlier , Malaysia Airlines said that the raw satellite signals needed to be verified and analysed " so that their significance could be properly understood " before it could publicly confirm their existence . Hishammuddin said Malaysian and US investigators had immediately discussed the Inmarsat data upon receiving them on 12 March , and on two occasions , both groups agreed that it needed further processing and sent the data to the US twice for this purpose . Data analysis was completed on 14 March : by then , the AAIB had independently arrived at the same conclusion . 
 In June 2014 , relatives of passengers on Flight 370 began a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to raise US $ 100 @,@ 000 — with an ultimate goal of raising US $ 5 million — as a reward to encourage anyone who knows the location of Flight 370 or the cause of its disappearance to reveal what they know . The campaign , which ended 8 August 2014 , raised US $ 100 @,@ 516 from 1007 contributors . 
 = = = Malaysia Airlines = = = 
 A month after the disappearance , Malaysia Airlines ' chief executive Ahmad <unk> Yahya acknowledged that ticket sales had declined but failed to provide specific details . This may partially result from the suspension of the airline 's advertising campaigns following the disappearance . Ahmad stated in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that the airline 's " primary focus ... is that we do take care of the families in terms of their emotional needs and also their financial needs . It is important that we provide answers for them . It is important that the world has answers , as well . " In further remarks , Ahmad said he was not sure when the airline could start repairing its image , but that the airline was adequately insured to cover the financial loss stemming from Flight 370 's disappearance . In China , where the majority of passengers were from , bookings on Malaysia Airlines were down 60 percent in March . 
 Malaysia Airlines retired the Flight 370 ( MH370 ) flight number and replaced it with Flight 318 ( <unk> ) beginning 14 March . This follows a common practice among airlines to rename flights following notorious accidents . The flight — Malaysia Airline 's second daily flight to Beijing — was later suspended beginning 2 May ; according to insiders , this was due to lack of demand . 
 Malaysia Airlines was given US $ 110 million from insurers in March 2014 to cover initial payments to passengers ' families and the search effort . In May , remarks from lead <unk> of the flight , Allianz , indicated the insured market loss on Flight 370 , including the search , was about US $ 350 million . 
 = = = = Financial troubles = = = = 
 At the time of Flight 370 's disappearance , Malaysia Airlines was struggling to cut costs to compete with a wave of new , low @-@ cost carriers in the region . In the previous three years , Malaysia Airlines had booked losses of : <unk> billion ( US $ 356 million ) in 2013 , <unk> million in 2012 , and <unk> billion in 2011 . Malaysia Airlines lost <unk> million ( US $ 137 @.@ 4 million ) in the first quarter of 2014 ( January – March ) . The second quarter — the first full quarter in the aftermath of Flight 370 's disappearance — saw a loss of <unk> million ( US $ 97 @.@ 6 million ) , which represented a 75 percent increase over losses from the second quarter of 2013 . Industry analysts expect Malaysia Airlines to lose further market share and face a challenging environment to stand out from competitors while addressing their financial plight . The company 's stock , down as much as 20 percent following the disappearance of Flight 370 , had fallen 80 percent over the previous five years , which contrasts with a rise in the Malaysian stock market of about 80 percent over the same period . 
 Many analysts and the media suggested that Malaysia Airlines would need to rebrand and repair its image and / or require government assistance to return to profitability . The loss of Flight 17 in July greatly exacerbated Malaysia Airline 's financial problems . The combined effect on consumer confidence of the loss of Flights 370 and 17 and the airline 's poor financial performance led <unk> Nasional — the majority shareholder ( 69 @.@ 37 percent ) and a Malaysian state @-@ run investment arm — to announce on 8 August its plan to purchase the remainder of the airline , thereby <unk> it . 
 = = = = Compensation for passengers ' next @-@ of @-@ kin = = = = 
 Lack of evidence in determining the cause of Flight 370 's disappearance , even physical evidence that the aircraft crashed , raises many issues regarding responsibility for the accident and payments made by insurance agencies . Under the Montreal Convention , it is the carrier 's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an accident and each passenger 's next @-@ of @-@ kin are automatically entitled , regardless of fault , to a payment of approximately US $ 175 @,@ 000 from the airline 's insurance company — a total of nearly US $ 40 million for the 227 passengers on board . 
 Malaysia Airlines would still be vulnerable to civil lawsuits from passengers ' families . Compensation awarded during or settled out @-@ of @-@ court during civil trials will likely vary widely among passengers based on country of the court . An American court could likely award upwards of US $ 8 – 10 million , while Chinese courts would likely award a small fraction of that . Despite the announcement that Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean , it was not until 29 January 2015 that the Malaysian government officially declared Flight 370 an accident with no survivors , a move that would allow compensation claims to be made . The first lawsuit related to the disappearance was filed in October 2014 – before Flight 370 was declared an accident – on behalf of two Malaysian boys whose father was a passenger , for negligence in failing to contact the aircraft soon after it was lost and for breach of contract for failing to bring the passenger to his destination . 
 Malaysia Airlines offered ex gratia condolence payments soon after the disappearance . In China , families of passengers were offered ¥ 31 @,@ 000 ( about US $ 5 @,@ 000 ) " comfort money " ; but some families rejected the offer . It was also reported that Malaysian relatives received only $ 2 @,@ 000 . In June , Malaysia 's deputy Foreign Minister Hamzah <unk> said that families of seven passengers received $ 50 @,@ 000 advance compensation from Malaysia Airlines , but that full payout would come after the aircraft is found or officially declared lost ( which later occurred in January 2015 ) . 
 = = = Malaysia = = = 
 Questions and criticisms were raised by air force experts and the Malaysian opposition about the state of Malaysia 's air force and radar capabilities . The failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft ( later determined to be Flight 370 ) flying through Malaysian airspace was criticised by many . The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight 's disappearance . The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach , and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time @-@ consuming and expensive search operation . 
 The Malaysian Prime Minister , Najib Razak , responded to criticism of his government in an opinion piece published in the The Wall Street Journal in which he acknowledged mistakes had been made , and said time would show that Malaysia had done its best , had helped co @-@ ordinate the search , and would continue to support . Najib went on to emphasise the need for the aviation industry to " not only learn the lessons of MH370 but implement them , " saying in closing that " the world learned from [ Air France Flight 447 ] but didn 't act . The same mistake must not be made again . " 
 Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim criticised the Malaysian government regarding its response to Flight 370 's disappearance and the military 's response when Flight 370 turned back over the Malay Peninsula ; he called for an international committee to take charge of the investigation " to save the image of the country and to save the country . " Malaysian authorities have accused Anwar — who was jailed on contentious charges the day before Flight 370 disappeared — of politicising the crisis . Flight 370 's captain was a supporter of Anwar and the two knew each other . 
 Questioned about why Malaysia did not scramble fighter jets to intercept the aircraft as it tracked back across the Malay Peninsula , he noted that it was deemed a commercial aircraft and was not hostile , remarking : " If you 're not going to shoot it down , what 's the point of sending [ a fighter jet ] up ? " 
 The response to the crisis and lack of transparency in the response brought attention to the state of media in Malaysia . After decades of having tight control of media , during which government officials were accustomed to passing over issues without scrutiny or accountability , Malaysia was suddenly thrust to the forefront of global media and unable to adjust to demands for transparency . 
 On the second anniversary of the disappearance , 8 March 2016 , Razak said that he was hopeful that the missing Flight 370 would be found . The Malaysian Parliament observed a moment of silence to mark the anniversary . Razak said in a statement that the search had been " the most challenging in aviation history " , but that he remained committed to completing it . 
 = = = China = = = 
 Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Xie <unk> reacted sceptically to the conclusion by the Malaysian government that the aircraft had gone down with no survivors , demanding " all the relevant information and evidence about the satellite data analysis " , and said that the Malaysian government must " finish all the work including search and rescue . " The following day , 25 March , Chinese president Xi Jinping sent a special envoy to Kuala Lumpur to consult with the Malaysian government over the missing aircraft . 
 = = = = Relatives of passengers = = = = 
 On 25 March , around two hundred family members of the Chinese passengers protested outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing . Relatives who had arrived in Kuala Lumpur after the announcement continued with their protest , accusing Malaysia of hiding the truth and harbouring the murderer . They also wanted an apology for the Malaysian government 's poor initial handling of the disaster and its " premature " conclusion of loss , drawn without physical evidence . An op @-@ ed for China Daily said that Malaysia was not wholly to be blamed for its poor handling of such a " bizarre " and " unprecedented crisis , " and appealed to Chinese people not to allow emotions to prevail over evidence and rationality . The Chinese ambassador to Malaysia defended the Malaysian government 's response , stating that the relatives ' " radical and irresponsible opinions do not represent the views of Chinese people and the Chinese government " . The ambassador also strongly criticised Western media for having " published false news , stoked conflict and even spread rumours " to the detriment of relatives and of Sino – Malaysian relations . On the other hand , a US Department of Defense official criticised China for what he perceived as providing apparently false leads that detracted from the search effort and wasted time and resources . 
 The day before the second anniversary of the disappearance , 7 March 2016 , twelve Chinese families with relatives aboard the missing flight , filed a lawsuit in a Beijing , one day before the deadline for pursuing litigation against the carrier . In Kuala Lumpur , lawyer Ganesan <unk> reported that he had filed a joint lawsuit on behalf of the families of 32 passengers on 3 March 2016 , explaining that most were Chinese , along with an American and a few Indians . 
 = = = = Boycotts = = = = 
 Some Chinese have boycotted all things Malaysian , including holidays and singers , in protest of Malaysia 's handling of the Flight 370 investigation . Bookings on Malaysia Airlines from China , where the majority of passengers were from , were down 60 percent in March . In late March , several major Chinese ticketing agencies — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Mango — discontinued the sale of airline tickets to Malaysia and several large Chinese travel agencies reported a 50 percent drop in tourists compared to the same period the year before . China is the third largest source of visitors for Malaysia , accounting for 1 @.@ 79 million tourists . One market analyst predicted a 20 – 40 percent drop in Chinese tourists to Malaysia , resulting in a loss of 4 – 8 billion yuan ( <unk> – 4 @.@ 2 billion ; US $ 650 million @-@ 1 @.@ 3 billion ) . 
 The boycotts have largely been led or supported by celebrities . Film star Chen Kun posted a message to Weibo — where he has 70 million followers — stating that he would be boycotting Malaysia until their government told the truth . The post was shared over 70 @,@ 000 times and drew over 30 @,@ 000 comments . Over 337 @,@ 000 people retweeted a tweet from TV host Meng Fei , which said he would join the boycott . 
 China and Malaysia had dubbed 2014 to be the " Malaysia – China Friendship Year " to celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries . 
 = = = Air transport industry = = = 
 The fact that , in a digitally @-@ connected world , a modern aircraft could disappear has been met with surprise and disbelief by the public ; and while changes in the aviation industry often take years to be implemented , airlines and air transport authorities have responded swiftly to take action on several measures to prevent a similar incident from occurring . 
 = = = = Aircraft tracking = = = = 
 The International Air Transport Association — an industry trade organisation representing over 240 airlines ( representing 84 percent of global air traffic ) — and the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) — the United Nations ' civil aviation body — are working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time . The IATA created a task force ( which includes several outside stakeholders ) to define a minimum set of requirements that any tracking system must meet , allowing airlines to decide the best solution to track their aircraft . The IATA 's task force plans to come up with several short- , medium- , and long @-@ term solutions to ensure that information is provided in a timely manner to support search , rescue , and recovery activities in the wake of an aircraft accident . The task force was expected to provide a report to the ICAO on 30 September 2014 , but on that day said that the report would be delayed , citing the need for further clarification on some issues . In December 2014 , the IATA task force recommended that , within 12 months , airlines track commercial aircraft in no longer than 15 @-@ minute intervals , although it still has not released its report and full details of proposed changes . The IATA itself did not support the deadline , which it believes cannot be met by all airlines , but the proposed standard has the support of the ICAO . Although the ICAO can set standards , it has no legal authority and such standards must be adopted by member states . 
 The ICAO has adopted a standard that , by November 2018 , all aircraft over open ocean report their position every 15 minutes . In March 2016 , the ICAO approved an amendment to the Chicago Convention requiring new aircraft manufactured after 1 January 2021 to have autonomous tracking devices which can send location information at least once per minute in distress circumstances . 
 In May 2014 , Inmarsat said it would offer its tracking service for free to all aircraft equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection ( which amounts to nearly all commercial airliners ) . Inmarsat has also changed the time period for handshakes with their terminals from one hour to 15 minutes . 
 = = = = Transponders = = = = 
 There was a call for automated transponders after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks ; no changes were made as aviation experts preferred flexible control , in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies . In the wake of Flight 370 , the air transport industry is still resistant to the installation of automated transponders , which would likely entail significant costs . Pilots have also criticised changes of this kind , insisting on the need to cut power to equipment in the event of a fire . Nonetheless , new types of tamper @-@ proof circuit breakers are being considered . 
 = = = = Flight recorders = = = = 
 The frenzied search for the flight recorders in early April , due to the 30 @-@ day battery life of the underwater locator beacons ( ULBs ) attached to them , brought attention to the limitations of the ULBs . The battery life of the ULBs is limited , and the distance the signal from the ULBs can be detected from is 2 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 – 9 @,@ 800 ft ) , or 4 @,@ 500 m ( 14 @,@ 800 ft ) under favourable conditions . Even if the flight recorders are located , the cockpit voice recorder memory has capacity to store only two hours of data , continuously recording over the oldest data . This length complies with regulations and it is usually only data from the last section of a flight that is needed to determine the cause of an accident . The events which caused Flight 370 to divert from its course and disappear happened more than two hours before the flight ended . Given these limitations and the importance of the data stored on flight recorders , Flight 370 has brought attention to new technologies that enable data streaming to the ground . 
 A call to increase the battery life of ULBs was made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447 , which were not located until 2011 . The ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014 , with implementation by 2018 . The European Aviation Safety Agency has stated its new regulations require that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders must range from 30 to 90 days . The agency proposed a new underwater locator beacon with a larger transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans . 
 In March 2016 , the ICAO adopted several amendments to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370 's disappearance . For aircraft manufactured after 2020 , cockpit voice recorders will be required to record at least 25 hours of data , so that they record all phases of a flight . Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders , or the information they contain , before the recorders sink below water . This provision is performance @-@ based so that it can be accomplished by different techniques , such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water 's surface . The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft . 
 = = = = Safety recommendations = = = = 
 In January 2015 , the US NTSB cited Flight 370 and Air France Flight 447 when it issued eight safety recommendations related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations and repeated recommendations for a crash @-@ protected cockpit image recorder and tamper @-@ resistant flight recorders and transponders .

 The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been dubbed one of the greatest aviation mysteries of all time . 
 Several documentaries have been produced about the flight . The Smithsonian Channel aired a one @-@ hour documentary about the flight on 6 April 2014 , titled Malaysia 370 : The Plane That Vanished . The Discovery Channel broadcast a one @-@ hour documentary about Flight 370 on 16 April 2014 titled Flight 370 : The Missing Links . 
 An episode of the television documentary series Horizon titled " Where is Flight MH370 ? " was broadcast on 17 June 2014 on BBC Two . The programme , narrated by Amanda Drew , documents how the aircraft disappeared , what experts believe happened to it , and how the search has unfolded . The programme also examines new technologies such as flight recorder streaming and automatic dependent surveillance @-@ broadcast ( ADS @-@ B ) , which may help prevent similar disappearances in the future . It concludes by noting that Ocean Shield had spent two months searching 850 square kilometres ( 330 sq mi ) of ocean , but that it had searched far to the north of the Inmarsat " hotspot " on the final arc , at approximately 28 degrees south , where the aircraft was most likely to have crashed . On 8 October 2014 , a modified version of the Horizon programme was broadcast in the US by PBS as an episode of Nova , titled " Why Planes Vanish " , with a different narrator . 
 The first fictional account of the mystery was Scott Maka 's MH370 : A Novella , published three months after the aircraft 's disappearance .

 The Black Mages was a Japanese instrumental rock / hard rock band formed in 2002 by Nobuo Uematsu , Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito - three composers for Square Enix . The band arranged Uematsu 's Final Fantasy video game series @-@ based compositions in a hard rock style often similar to progressive metal , achieved with the additional use of synthesizers . Since its inception , the band had expanded to six members with the addition of Keiji Kawamori , Michio Okamiya and Arata Hanyuda . On August 7 , 2010 , Nobuo Uematsu announced the band had disbanded , but he would continue to perform rock arrangements of his music as a part of another band , the Earthbound Papas . 
 The band has released three studio albums . Their first was released eponymously as The Black Mages in 2003 , and contained arrangements of Final Fantasy battle themes . The second album , The Black Mages II : The Skies Above , was released in 2004 and featured additional pieces besides battle themes including the group 's first original song , " Blue Blast ~ Winning the Rainbow " , which was created for Japanese K @-@ 1 fighter Takehiro Murahama . The third album , The Black Mages III : Darkness and Starlight , was released on March 19 , 2008 . Music from the group has also appeared in other albums , including one track in Dark Chronicle Premium Arrange , an album of arranged music from the video game Dark Chronicle , a piece in the animated film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children and its corresponding soundtrack album , and one track on Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack , the soundtrack album for the Nintendo DS version of Final Fantasy III . 
 The Black Mages did not tour as a band , but performed several concerts to promote their album releases . For their first album they performed in Shibuya and Kanagawa , Japan in 2003 and later released a live video of the first concert on DVD exclusively to Uematsu fanclub members . They repeated this for the release of their second album , performing in Kawasaki and Osaka , Japan in 2005 and similarly released on DVD to fanclub members . The third album saw a performance in Yokohama , Japan in 2008 ; a DVD of the show was released commercially on March 25 , 2009 . In addition to these concerts , The Black Mages made live appearances at two Final Fantasy concerts , More Friends : Music from Final Fantasy and Voices - Music from Final Fantasy , as well as another video game music event , Extra : Hyper Game Music Event 2007 . 
 = = History = = 
 In 2000 , Square Enix employees Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito formed an experimental partnership to compose music for the video game All Star Pro @-@ Wrestling in a rock style . After the game 's success , the two continued to compose in the same style . In 2002 , Fukui and Sekito decided to arrange some of the compositions of Nobuo Uematsu , the primary composer for the music of the Final Fantasy series . Uematsu , a fan of rock music , enjoyed these arrangements , and Fukui and Sekito asked him to join them in making a rock band . Declining at first due to feeling too busy with his composing duties and attempts to become a music producer with his Smile Please label , Uematsu agreed to join them in a single live performance as a keyboardist . At the performance , Uematsu felt a " mix of stage fright and excitement , [ with ] all the crowds cheering , the audience paying full attention " , and decided to join the two in making a band ; Fukui and Sekito had refused to start one if Uematsu was not involved as one of the musicians . 
 The group has said they were " nervous " about forming a rock band , as they were all " middle @-@ aged " , but decided after the performance it would not be a problem . The name " The Black Mages " was chosen by an employee at Square Enix , Mr. Matsushita , and was decided to be in English because it " wouldn 't stand out " in Japanese . Square Enix owns the name " The Black Mages " , which means while using that name the band was essentially limited to playing Final Fantasy music and original pieces rather than arranging music from other game series that were not owned by the company . 
 In 2003 , Uematsu decided the band should produce an album of Final Fantasy arrangements . The trio arranged , interpreted , and sequenced ten battle themes from various Final Fantasy titles , with Uematsu as producer ; the album was released eponymously on February 19 , 2003 . To celebrate the success , Uematsu decided to organize a concert in tribute to the album ; Uematsu and Fukui served as the keyboardists , while Sekito was the guitarist . They needed more people to perform the arrangements live , however , and as such , several other members from Square Enix joined . Keiji Kawamori joined to play the bass guitar , Michio Okamiya to play the guitar , and Arata Hanyuda to play the drums . Since then , The Black Mages have released two additional albums , with all six members participating . The group performed concerts to promote both of these albums , and also participated in video game music @-@ themed concerts . 
 On August 7 , 2010 , Uematsu announced the band had formally disbanded . He did not directly state the reason for the decision , though in previous interviews he had noted the band was increasingly finding it difficult to find time to rehearse together . In an April 2011 interview he said the main reason was because The Black Mages had been formed as a " Square Enix " band , they were unable to perform arrangements of work he had composed after leaving Square Enix or to focus on original pieces . Uematsu continues to play rock arrangements of his music as a part of the band the Earthbound Papas , which performed at the Distant Worlds II concert in 2010 . He has been joined by fellow Black Mages band @-@ mates Michio Okamiya and Arata Hanyuda , both continuing on guitar and drums , respectively . They had also left Square Enix ; Uematsu built the new band to not include any current Square Enix employees so as to avoid the trademark and licensing problems of The Black Mages .

 The Black Mages is an arranged soundtrack album of video game music from the Final Fantasy series of role @-@ playing video games . The album contains a selection of musical tracks from the games , arranged and performed in a hybrid of power metal and progressive metal by The Black Mages . All the selected tracks are " battle themes " from the games . The pieces have been described as " hard @-@ rock " with " blazing synthesizers and guitars " . It was first released on February 19 , 2003 , by DigiCube , and subsequently re @-@ released on May 10 , 2004 , by Square Enix . It spans ten tracks and covers a duration of 51 : 29 . 
 The album reached No. 43 on the Japan Oricon charts . It was well received by critics like Andy <unk> of RPGFan , who termed it " addicting " and " powerful " . He criticized the overuse of synthesizer as opposed to live instruments in some tracks , and that some of the arrangements stayed too close to the original tracks , especially " Dancing Mad " . Tetra of Square Enix Music Online also enjoyed the album , saying " all of the members are strong musicians , and Sekito and Fukui were equally strong arrangers " . His primary complaint with the album was he felt many of the songs followed the same general pattern in their arrangements .

 The Black Mages II : The Skies Above is an arranged soundtrack album of video game music from the Final Fantasy series of role @-@ playing video games . Like the previous album , it contains a selection of musical tracks from the games , arranged and performed in a hybrid of power metal and progressive metal by The Black Mages . Unlike their first album , The Skies Above includes other pieces besides battle themes ; the album also features songs , which were performed by <unk> Hamano , credited as " <unk> " , and Tomoaki Watanabe , or " Mr. Goo " . It also includes a non @-@ Final Fantasy track , " Blue Blast — Winning the Rainbow " , an original piece that was created for Japanese K @-@ 1 fighter Takehiro Murahama . The Skies Above , as opposed to the first album , features real drums rather than sequenced drums , as the band had expanded from its original three members , none of whom played drums . The line " Maybe I 'm a Lion " in the track of the same name was spoken by Alexander O. Smith , a translator for Square Enix and close friend of Okamiya , one of the new members . It was released on December 22 , 2004 , by Universal Music Group . The album spans eleven tracks , and covers a duration of 50 : 56 . 
 The album received mixed reviews from critics ; Jesse Jones of RPGFan said that he was " simply amazed " by the album , though it was not without flaws . While terming the music overall as " excellent " , he disliked the vocal arrangements in " Otherworld " and " The Skies Above " , finding that the voices of the singers did not match with the songs ' instrumentals . Zane of Square Enix Music Online was less approving of the album , calling it " passable " and saying that the new arrangements gave " mixed results " . He blamed the " intolerable vocals " and occasional poor choices in instruments as the problems with the album , concluding that the second Black Mages album was inferior to the first .

 The Black Mages III : Darkness and Starlight is the third arranged soundtrack album of video game music from the Final Fantasy series of role @-@ playing video games . The album contains a selection of musical tracks from the games , arranged and performed in a hybrid of power metal and progressive metal by The Black Mages in a similar manner to their previous albums . It was released on March 19 , 2008 , by Uematsu 's Dog Ear Records , spanning ten tracks and a duration of 60 : 40 . The Black Mages sing the chorus for the song " Darkness and Starlight " , the only vocal track on the album . The album has been described as being composed of a mix of " intense " symphonic metal pieces and rock opera . Like the previous album , Darkness and Starlight features an original piece , " Life ~ in memory of <unk> ~ " , which was composed by Uematsu for Yoshitaka Tagawa , a boy he had met who died of leukemia . 
 The album was well received by websites like RPGFan , which said the album was " very much worth the over three year wait " and described the tracks as " enjoyable " and " inspiring " . He had few complaints with the album , only describing " Opening ~ Bombing Mission " and " Assault of the Silver Dragons " as " bland " , but still worth listening to . Square Enix Music Online was even more positive in its review of the album , calling it " a masterpiece " and " The Black Mages ' finest effort to date " , wishing only the album had been longer .

 = Supreme Court of Indiana = 
 The Supreme Court of Indiana , established by Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution , is the highest judicial authority in the state of Indiana . Located in Indianapolis , the Court 's chambers are in the north wing of the Indiana Statehouse . 
 In December 1816 the Supreme Court of Indiana succeeded the General Court of the Indiana Territory as the state 's high court . During its long history the Court heard a number of high @-@ profile cases , including Lasselle v. State ( 1820 ) . Originally begun as a three member judicial panel , the Court underwent major reforms in 1852 and 1971 , as well as several other reorganizations . Court reforms led to a majority of Supreme Court cases being delegated to lower courts , an enlarged panel of justices , and employment of a large staff to assist as its caseload increases . 
 = = Organization and Jurisdiction = = 
 In 2008 the Court consisted of one chief justice and four associate justices , the constitutional minimum ; however , the Indiana General Assembly may increase the number of associate justices to a maximum of eight for a total of nine court justices . A board of five commissioners assists the Court in its administrative duties . Commissioners are nominated by the Judicial Nominating Commission and appointed by the governor . The Court offices and chambers are located on the third floor in the north wing of the Indiana Statehouse . The Court maintains a large legal library on the third floor that is open to the public . 
 The Court has no original jurisdiction in most cases , meaning that it can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts . Most cases begin in local circuit courts , where the initial trial is held and a jury decides the outcome of the case . The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court , who can hear the case or enforce the lower court 's decision . If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case , they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court . The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment , or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts . 
 The Supreme Court of Indiana has original and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas , including the practice of law , discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts , and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state . When the Court accepts a case , it reviews the documentation of the trials in the lower court and sometimes allows oral arguments before making a decision . In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing arguments from either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in the lower courts . The Court can order a new trial to take place in the local court , overturn the decision of lower courts and enforce its own decision , or uphold the decision of lower courts . 
 The Court appoints three commissions to assist it in its exclusive jurisdiction over the practice of law in Indiana . The role of the Board of Law Examiners is to " inquire into and determine the character , fitness , and general qualifications to be admitted to practice law as a member of the bar of the Supreme Court of Indiana . " The Disciplinary Commission is responsible for investigating grievances filed against members of the bar for misconduct and making disciplinary recommendations to the Supreme Court . The Commission for Continuing Legal Education administers , develops , and regulates continuing legal education requirements , mediation training standards , and attorney specialization programs . 
 The Judicial Nominating Commission is responsible for recruiting and interviewing applicants to fill vacancies on the Indiana Supreme Court , the Court of Appeals , and the Tax Court . It then sends three nominees for each vacancy to the governor . The Judicial Qualification Commission investigates complaints of judicial misconduct and files charges where appropriate . Both commissions have the same members and are chaired by the chief justice . 
 The entire Court takes part in the annual Judicial Conference of Indiana , which is attended by all of the state 's judges , and recommends improvements to the Court and state judiciary . The Court is also responsible for implementing all laws passed by the Indiana General Assembly that affect the judiciary . The Division of Supreme Court Administration is staffed by clerks who oversee the fiscal management of the courts , including payroll and expenses . In addition , the division is responsible for maintaining the Court 's records and assists in its administrative functions . 
 = = Terms and elections = = 
 Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution governs the term length of Supreme Court Justices . When there is a vacancy on the Court , a new justice is nominated using a variation of the Missouri Plan . First , the Judicial Nominating Commission submits a list of three qualified nominees to the governor . The governor then selects the new Justice from the list . If the governor fails to choose a replacement within sixty days , the chief justice or the acting chief justice must do so . The Judicial Nomination Commission Chief Justice selects the chief justice from the sitting associate justices for a five @-@ year term . The chief justice presides over the Court . When the position of chief justice becomes vacant , the most senior member of the Court serves as the acting chief justice until a new one is chosen by the Judicial Nominating Commission . The chief justice also serves as chairman of the Judicial Nominating Commission . 
 Justices are appointed to a term that could potentially last for ten years . Once a new justice is chosen , he may serve for two years before being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice 's second year in office . The justice is listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected from the Court . If retained , the justice may serve the remainder of his ten @-@ year term . When a term is completed , the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court . A majority vote of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may impeach a justice for misconduct . It is mandatory for a justice to retire at age seventy @-@ five , even if their term is incomplete . 
 = = = Qualification = = = 
 Eligibility requirements to be nominated as a justice of the Supreme Court are established in Article 7 of the Indiana Constitution . The candidate must be a citizen of the United States and reside within the state of Indiana before being considered for the office . The candidate must also have been admitted to the practice of law in Indiana for at least ten years prior to their candidacy or must have served as a judge of a circuit , superior , or criminal court of Indiana for five years . The candidate cannot be under an indictment in any court in the United States with a crime punishable as a felony . The Judicial Nominating Commission must also ensure that they are the " most highly qualified public candidates " available .

 = = History = = 
 The Indiana Supreme Court was established in 1816 when Indiana was granted statehood . The new Court replaced the General Court of the Indiana Territory , which consisted of a three @-@ member panel . Housed in a three @-@ room building it shared with the Indiana legislature , the Court held its first session in Corydon on May 5 , 1817 . Under the state constitution of 1816 , the governor appointed justices with the state senate 's " advice and consent " for a term of seven years . 
 In December 1816 Jonathan Jennings , Indiana 's first governor , nominated John Johnson of Vincennes Knox County ; James Scott of Charlestown Clark County ; and Jesse Holman of Aurora Dearborn County , to serve as the first panel of judges on the Indiana Supreme Court . Johnson became the Court 's first chief justice . When Johnson died in 1817 , Jennings named Isaac Blackford to replace him . Blackford became the second chief justice of the Court and was the longest serving justice in the Court 's history , serving 36 years , 3 months , and 24 days . Blackford recorded all of the Court 's early decisions in a multivolume work titled Blackford 's Reports that served for many years as a foundational text on the interpretation of state laws . 
 In 1824 the Supreme Court relocated to Indianapolis with the rest of the state 's government . Initially the Court shared space on the second floor of the Marion County Courthouse , before moving to the third Indiana Statehouse . In 1865 the Court was given its own building on lot number one in Indianapolis , where it remained until 1888 , moving to its present location in the fifth Indiana Statehouse . As of 2012 the Court occupies the entire north wing of the third floor of the Indiana Statehouse . 
 In 1851 the Supreme Court was reorganized under the new state constitution . The position of justice was changed from an appointed position to an elected one . Judicial terms were changed to six years and the Court 's size was set to a minimum of three members and not more than five . The Court 's judges quickly became overwhelmed by an ever @-@ increasing caseload . In 1853 the minimum was increased to four members and in 1872 it was increased to five . The Court has remained at a minimum of five justices since that time . In 1867 the general assembly transferred all the law books in the Indiana State Library to the Court to create a Supreme Court Law Library . The library grew to become the primary legal library for the state and includes more than seventy @-@ thousand volumes . 
 The Court 's caseload continued to grow over time . In 1881 the general assembly approved the creation of a five @-@ member panel of commissioners to assist the justices in administrative tasks . Even this was not enough to handle the load . In 1891 the Appellate Court of Indiana was created to handle cases of lower importance . At first the appellate court only took a small portion of the Supreme Court 's caseload , but its responsibility gradually increased . 
 In 1970 state constitutional amendments reorganized the Court . The constitution renamed the Appellate Court the Indiana Court of Appeals . With the formation of the Court of Appeals , the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to the lower courts . Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits on the size of the Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine . The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor . The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates . Justices also became subject to a retention election . In addition , the office of chief justice became permanent . Previously the title rotated among the justices . In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration , legalizing and expanding the role of the clerks of the Court . 
 = = = Landmark cases = = = 
 The Court has heard several cases that have had a major impact on Indiana as well as others that have set nationwide precedents . The first of these cases , Lasselle v. State ( 1820 ) , where the Court overturned a circuit court decision that tested slave ownership in the new state by stating " the framers of our constitution intended a total and entire prohibition of slavery , " and resulted in all slaves in Indiana being freed . In the Fall Creek Massacre case ( 1823 ) , State v. Hudson , the Court upheld a lower court 's finding that crimes committed against Native Americans were punishable under American laws . This decision lead to the first execution of a white man for crimes against natives . In the Falkenburg v. Jones case ( 1889 ) , Indiana became the first state to establish the right for a defendant to obtain court records free of charge . The 1909 case of <unk> v. <unk> established that the Court could invalidate a governor 's veto if proper veto procedures were not followed , in effect ruling the pocket @-@ veto as unconstitutional . In 1917 the state was among the first to adopt an <unk> rule , established in the case of Callendar v. State , which prevented illegally obtained evidence from be submitted in court . In William v. Smith , a case heard in 1921 , the Court overturned Indiana 's eugenics laws , the first of their kind in the nation . 
 = All Things Must Pass = 
 All Things Must Pass is a triple album by English musician George Harrison . Recorded and released in 1970 , the album was Harrison 's first solo work since the break @-@ up of the Beatles in April that year , and his third solo album overall . It includes the hit singles " My Sweet Lord " and " What Is Life " , as well as songs such as " Isn 't It a Pity " and the title track that were turned down by the Beatles . The album reflects the influence of his musical activities with artists such as Bob Dylan , the Band , Delaney & Bonnie and Billy Preston during 1968 – 70 , as well as Harrison 's growth as an artist beyond his supporting role to former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney . All Things Must Pass introduced Harrison 's signature sound , the slide guitar , and the spiritual themes that would be present throughout his subsequent solo work . The original vinyl release consisted of two LPs of songs and a third disc of informal jams , titled Apple Jam . Commentators interpret Barry Feinstein 's album cover photo , showing Harrison surrounded by four garden gnomes , as a statement on his independence from the Beatles . 
 Production began at London 's Abbey Road Studios in May 1970 , with extensive overdubbing and mixing continuing through October . Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie 's Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – as well as Ringo Starr , Gary Wright , Preston , Klaus Voormann , John Barham , Badfinger and Pete Drake . The sessions produced a double album 's worth of extra material , most of which remains unissued . 
 All Things Must Pass was critically and commercially successful on release , with long stays at number 1 on charts around the world . The album was co @-@ produced by Phil Spector and employs his Wall of Sound production technique to notable effect ; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described the sound as " Wagnerian , Brucknerian , the music of mountain tops and vast horizons " . Reflecting the widespread surprise at the assuredness of Harrison 's post @-@ Beatles debut , Melody Maker 's Richard Williams likened the album to Greta Garbo 's first role in a talking picture and declared : " Garbo talks ! – Harrison is free ! " According to Colin Larkin , writing in the 2011 edition of his Encyclopedia of Popular Music , All Things Must Pass is " generally rated " as the best of all the former Beatles ' solo albums . 
 During the final year of his life , Harrison oversaw a successful reissue campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the album 's release . Following this reissue , in March 2001 , the set was certified six @-@ times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America . Among its appearances in critics ' best @-@ album lists , All Things Must Pass was ranked 79th on The Times ' " The 100 Best Albums of All Time " in 1993 , while Rolling Stone currently places it 433rd on the magazine 's " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " . In January 2014 , All Things Must Pass was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame .

 Music journalist John Harris has identified the start of George Harrison 's " journey " to making All Things Must Pass as his visit to America in late 1968 , following the acrimonious sessions for the Beatles ' White Album . While in Woodstock in November , Harrison established a long @-@ lasting friendship with Bob Dylan and experienced a creative equality among the Band that contrasted sharply with John Lennon and Paul McCartney 's domination in the Beatles . Coinciding with this visit was a surge in Harrison 's songwriting output , following his renewed interest in the guitar , after three years spent studying the Indian sitar . As well as being one of the few musicians to co @-@ write songs with Dylan , Harrison had recently collaborated with Eric Clapton on " Badge " , which became a hit single for Cream in the spring of 1969 . 
 Once back in London , and with his compositions continually overlooked for inclusion on releases by the Beatles , Harrison found creative fulfilment in extracurricular projects that , in the words of his musical biographer , Simon Leng , served as an " emancipating force " from the restrictions imposed on him in the band . His activities during 1969 included producing Apple signings Billy Preston and Doris Troy , two American singer @-@ songwriters whose soul and gospel roots proved as influential on All Things Must Pass as the music of the Band . He also recorded with artists such as Leon Russell and Jack Bruce , and accompanied Clapton on a short tour with Delaney Bramlett 's soul revue , Delaney & Bonnie and Friends . In addition , Harrison identified his involvement with the Hare Krishna movement as providing " another piece of a jigsaw puzzle " that represented the spiritual journey he had begun in 1966 . As well as embracing the <unk> branch of Hinduism , Harrison produced two hit singles during 1969 – 70 by the UK @-@ based devotees , credited as Radha Krishna Temple ( London ) . In January 1970 , Harrison invited American producer Phil Spector to participate in the recording of Lennon 's Plastic Ono Band single " Instant Karma ! " This association led to Spector being given the task of salvaging the Beatles ' Get Back rehearsal tapes , released officially as the Let It Be album ( 1970 ) , and later co @-@ producing All Things Must Pass . 
 Harrison first discussed the possibility of making a solo album of his unused songs during the ill @-@ tempered Get Back sessions , held at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969 . At Abbey Road Studios on 25 February , his 26th birthday , Harrison recorded demos of " All Things Must Pass " and two other compositions that had received little interest from Lennon and McCartney at Twickenham . With the inclusion of one of these songs – " Something " – and " Here Comes the Sun " on the Beatles ' Abbey Road album in September 1969 , music critics acknowledged that Harrison had bloomed into a songwriter to match Lennon and McCartney . Although he began talking publicly about recording his own album from the autumn of 1969 , it was only after McCartney announced that he was leaving the Beatles , in April 1970 , signalling the band 's break @-@ up , that Harrison committed to the idea . Despite having already made Wonderwall Music ( 1968 ) , a mostly instrumental soundtrack album , and the experimental Electronic Sound ( 1969 ) , Harrison considered All Things Must Pass to be his first solo album .

 Spector first heard Harrison 's stockpile of unreleased compositions early in 1970 , when visiting his recently purchased home , Friar Park . " It was endless ! " Spector later recalled of the recital , noting the quantity and quality of Harrison 's material . Harrison had accumulated songs from as far back as 1966 ; both " Isn 't It a Pity " and " Art of Dying " date from that year . He co @-@ wrote at least two songs with Dylan while in Woodstock , one of which , " I 'd Have You Anytime " , appeared on All Things Must Pass . Harrison wrote " Let It Down " in late 1968 also . 
 He introduced the Band @-@ inspired " All Things Must Pass " , along with " Hear Me Lord " and " Let It Down " , at the Beatles ' Get Back rehearsals , only to have them rejected by Lennon and McCartney . The tense atmosphere at Twickenham fuelled another All Things Must Pass song , " Wah @-@ Wah " , which Harrison wrote in the wake of his temporary departure from the band on 10 January 1969 . " Run of the Mill " followed soon afterwards , its lyrics focusing on the failure of friendships within the Beatles amid the business problems surrounding their Apple organisation . Harrison 's musical activities outside the band during 1969 inspired other compositions on the album : " What Is Life " came to him while driving to a London session that spring for Preston 's That 's the Way God Planned It album ; " Behind That Locked Door " was Harrison 's message of encouragement to Dylan , written the night before the latter 's comeback performance at the Isle of Wight Festival ; and Harrison began " My Sweet Lord " as an exercise in writing a gospel song during Delaney & Bonnie 's stopover in Copenhagen in December 1969 . 
 " I Dig Love " resulted from Harrison 's early experiments with slide guitar , a technique that Bramlett had introduced him to , in order to cover for guitarist Dave Mason 's departure from the Friends line @-@ up . Other songs on All Things Must Pass , all written during the first half of 1970 , include " Awaiting on You All " , which reflected Harrison 's adoption of chanting through his involvement with the Hare Krishna movement ; " Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp ( Let It Roll ) " , a tribute to the original owner of Friar Park ; and " Beware of Darkness " . The latter was another composition influenced by Harrison 's association with the Radha Krishna Temple , and was written while some of the devotees were staying with him at Friar Park . 
 Shortly before beginning work on All Things Must Pass , Harrison attended a Dylan session in New York on 1 May 1970 , during which he acquired a new song of Dylan 's , " If Not for You " . Harrison wrote " Apple Scruffs " , which was one of a number of Dylan @-@ influenced compositions on the album , towards the end of production on All Things Must Pass , as a tribute to the diehard fans who had kept a vigil outside the studios where he was working . 
 According to Leng , All Things Must Pass represents the completion of Harrison 's " musical @-@ philosophical circle " , in which his 1966 – 68 immersion in Indian music found a Western equivalent in gospel music . While identifying hard rock , country and western , and Motown among the other genres on the album , Leng writes of the " plethora of new sounds and influences " that Harrison had absorbed through 1969 and now incorporated , including " Krishna chants , gospel ecstasy , Southern blues @-@ rock [ and ] slide guitar " . The melodies of " Isn 't It a Pity " and " Beware of Darkness " have aspects of Indian classical music , and on " My Sweet Lord " , Harrison combined the Hindu bhajan tradition with gospel . The recurrent lyrical themes on the album are Harrison 's spiritual quest , as it would be throughout his solo career , and friendship , particularly the failure of relationships among the Beatles . Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork Media describes the album as " dark @-@ tinged Krishna folk @-@ rock " . 
 = = = Apple Jam = = = 
 On the original LP 's third disc , entitled Apple Jam , four of the five tracks – " Out of the Blue " , " Plug Me In " , " I Remember Jeep " and " Thanks for the Pepperoni " – are improvised instrumentals built around minimal chord changes , or in the case of " Out of the Blue " , a single @-@ chord riff . The title for " I Remember Jeep " originated from the name of Clapton 's dog , Jeep , and " Thanks for the Pepperoni " came from a line on a Lenny Bruce comedy album . In a December 2000 interview with Billboard magazine , Harrison explained : " For the jams , I didn 't want to just throw [ them ] in the cupboard , and yet at the same time it wasn 't part of the record ; that 's why I put it on a separate label to go in the package as a kind of bonus . " 
 The only vocal selection on Apple Jam is " It 's Johnny 's Birthday " , sung to the tune of Cliff Richard 's 1968 hit " Congratulations " , and recorded as a gift from Harrison to Lennon to mark the latter 's 30th birthday . Like all the " free " tracks on the bonus disc , " It 's Johnny 's Birthday " carried a Harrison songwriting credit on the original UK release of All Things Must Pass , while on the first US copies , the only songwriting information on the record 's face labels was the standard inclusion of a performing rights organisation , BMI . In December 1970 , " Congratulations " songwriters Bill Martin and Phil Coulter claimed for royalties , with the result that the composer 's credit for Harrison 's track was swiftly changed to acknowledge Martin and Coulter . 
 = = = Demo tracks and outtakes = = = 
 Aside from the seventeen compositions issued on discs one and two of the original album , Harrison recorded at least twenty other songs – either in demo form for Spector 's benefit , just before recording got officially under way in late May , or as outtakes from the sessions . In a 1992 interview , Harrison commented on the volume of material : " I didn 't have many tunes on Beatles records , so doing an album like All Things Must Pass was like going to the bathroom and letting it out . " As well as " Wah @-@ Wah " , " Art of Dying " and others that would soon be developed in a band setting , Harrison 's solo performance for Spector included the following songs , all of which remain unreleased : 
 " Window , Window " – another composition turned down by the Beatles in January 1969 
 " Everybody , Nobody " – the melody of which Harrison adapted for " Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp " 
 " Nowhere to Go " – a second Harrison – Dylan collaboration from November 1968 , originally known as " When Everybody Comes to Town " 
 " Cosmic Empire " , " Mother Divine " and " Tell Me What Has Happened to You " . 
 Also from this performance were two tracks that Harrison returned to in later years . " Beautiful Girl " appeared on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1 / 3 , and the Dylan @-@ written " I Don 't Want to Do It " was Harrison 's contribution to the soundtrack for Porky 's Revenge ! ( 1985 ) . 
 During the main sessions for All Things Must Pass , Harrison taped or <unk> early versions of " You " , " Try Some , Buy Some " and " When Every Song Is Sung " . Harrison offered these three songs to Ronnie Spector in February 1971 for her proposed ( and soon abandoned ) solo album on Apple Records . After releasing his own versions of " Try Some , Buy Some " and " You " between 1973 and 1975 , he offered " When Every Song Is Sung " ( since retitled " I 'll Still Love You " ) to former bandmate Ringo Starr for his 1976 album Ringo 's Rotogravure . " Woman Don 't You Cry for Me " , written in December 1969 as his first slide @-@ guitar composition , was another song that Harrison revisited on Thirty Three & 1 / 3 . Harrison included " I Live for You " as the only all @-@ new bonus track on the 2001 reissue of All Things Must Pass . " Down to the River " remained unused until he reworked it as " Rocking Chair in Hawaii " for his final studio album , the posthumously released Brainwashed ( 2002 ) . 
 Harrison recorded the following compositions during the All Things Must Pass sessions but they have never received an official release : 
 " Dehradun " – written during the Beatles ' stay in Rishikesh in early 1968 , and unveiled by Harrison in a brief performance on ukulele for the 1995 TV broadcast of The Beatles Anthology 
 " Gopala Krishna " – also known as " Om Hare Om " , with all @-@ Sanskrit lyrics , and described by Simon Leng as a " rocking companion " to " Awaiting on You All " 
 " Going Down to Golders Green " – a Sun Records @-@ era Presley parody based on the melody of " Baby Let 's Play House " . 
 = = Contributing musicians = = 
 The precise line @-@ up of contributing musicians is open to conjecture . Due to the album 's big sound and the many participants on the sessions , commentators have traditionally referred to the grand , orchestral nature of this line @-@ up . In 2002 , music critic Greg Kot described it as " a who 's who of the decade 's rock royalty " , while Harris writes of the cast taking on " a Cecil B. De Mille aspect " . 
 The musicians included Bobby Whitlock , Jim Gordon , Carl Radle , Bobby Keys , Jim Price and Dave Mason , all of whom had recently toured with Delaney & Bonnie . Along with Eric Clapton , there were also musicians whose link with Harrison went back some years , such as Ringo Starr and Billy Preston , and German bassist Klaus Voormann , formerly of Manfred Mann and a friend since the Beatles ' years in Hamburg . Handling much of the keyboard work with Whitlock was Gary Wright , who went on to collaborate regularly with Harrison throughout the 1970s . 
 From within Apple 's stable of musicians , Harrison recruited the band Badfinger , future Yes drummer Alan White , and Beatles assistant Mal Evans on percussion . Badfinger drummer Mike Gibbins ' powerful tambourine work led to Spector giving him the nickname " Mr Tambourine Man " , after the Dylan song , while bandmates Pete Ham , Tom Evans and Joey Molland provided rhythm acoustic @-@ guitar parts that , in keeping with Spector 's Wall of Sound principles , were to be " felt but not heard " . Orchestral arranger John Barham also sat in on the sessions , occasionally contributing on harmonium and vibraphone . Other guests included Nashville pedal steel player Pete Drake , Procol Harum 's Gary Brooker and a pre @-@ Genesis Phil Collins . 
 For contractual reasons , on UK pressings of All Things Must Pass , Clapton 's participation on the first two discs of the album remained unacknowledged for many years , although he was listed among the musicians appearing on the Apple Jam disc in Britain . Harrison was unaware of Collins 's contribution until putting together the 30th anniversary reissue of the album in 2000 , at which point he offered Collins his belated thanks . Clapton 's former bandmate in Cream and Blind Faith , Ginger Baker , participated in the session for " I Remember Jeep " only , according to the album 's sleeve notes . 
 Simon Leng consulted Voormann , Barham , Molland and Delaney Bramlett for his chapter covering the making of All Things Must Pass and credits Tony Ashton as one of the keyboard players on both versions of " Isn 't It a Pity " . Some sources suggest that Peter Frampton may have been among the rhythm guitarists on some songs , while similarly unsubstantiated claims exist regarding possible guest appearances from John Lennon , Maurice Gibb and Pink Floyd 's Richard Wright . In addition , for some years after the album 's release , rumours claimed that the Band backed Harrison on the country @-@ influenced " Behind That Locked Door " .

 The date for Harrison 's run @-@ through of songs for Spector , at Abbey Road Studios , is generally thought to have been 20 May 1970 , the same day as the Let It Be film 's world premiere , with recording sessions beginning on 26 May . With assistance from former Beatles engineers Ken Scott and Phil McDonald , Spector recorded most of the album 's backing tracks live , in some cases featuring multiple drummers and keyboard players , and as many as five rhythm guitarists . 
 According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter , the majority of these backing tracks were taped on 8 @-@ track at Abbey Road , with the first batch of sessions taking place from late May through to the second week of June . The first song recorded was " Wah @-@ Wah " ; " What Is Life " , versions one and two of " Isn 't It a Pity " , and the songs on which Drake participated , such as " All Things Must Pass " and " Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp " , were among the other tracks taped then . The Apple Jam instrumentals " Thanks for the Pepperoni " and " Plug Me In " , featuring Harrison , Clapton and Mason each taking extended guitar solos , were recorded later in June , at the Beatles ' Apple Studio , and marked the formation of Clapton , Whitlock , Radle and Gordon 's short @-@ lived band Derek and the Dominos . Harrison also contributed on guitar to both sides of the band 's debut single , " Tell the Truth " and " Roll It Over " , which were produced by Spector and recorded at Apple on 18 June . The eleven @-@ minute " Out of the Blue " featured contributions from Keys and Price , both of whom began working with the Rolling Stones around this time . 
 Although Harrison had estimated in a New York radio interview that the solo album would take no more than eight weeks to complete , recording , overdubbing and mixing on All Things Must Pass lasted for five months , until late October . Part of the reason for this was Harrison 's need to make regular visits to Liverpool to tend to his mother , who had been diagnosed with cancer . Participants at the recording sessions identify Spector 's erratic behaviour as another factor affecting progress on the album . Harrison later referred to Spector needing " eighteen cherry brandies " before he could start work , a situation that forced much of the production duties onto Harrison alone . In July 1970 , by which time sessions had resumed at Trident Studios , Spector fell over in the studio and broke his arm . Early that month , work on All Things Must Pass was temporarily brought to a halt as Harrison headed north to see his dying mother for the last time . EMI 's growing concerns regarding studio costs added to the pressure on Harrison , and a further complication , John Harris notes , was that Clapton had become infatuated with Harrison 's wife , Pattie Boyd , and adopted a heroin habit as a means of coping with his guilt . 
 = = = Overdubbing = = = 
 In Spector 's absence , Harrison had completed the album 's backing tracks and preliminary overdubs by 12 August . He then sent early mixes of many of the songs to his co @-@ producer , who was convalescing in Los Angeles , and Spector replied by letter dated 19 August with suggestions for further overdubs and final mixing . Among Spector 's comments were detailed suggestions regarding " Let It Down " , the released recording of which Madinger and Easter describe as " the best example of Spector running rampant with the ' Wall of Sound ' " , and an urging that he and Harrison carry out further work on the songs at the superior , 16 @-@ track Trident Studios facility . Spector then returned to oversee conversion of the 8 @-@ track recordings to 16 @-@ track masters , a process that allowed for more freedom when overdubbing new instruments . 
 John Barham 's orchestrations were recorded during the next phase of the album 's production , starting in early September , along with many further contributions from Harrison , such as his lead vocals , slide guitar parts and multi @-@ tracked backing vocals ( the latter credited to " the George O 'Hara @-@ Smith Singers " ) . Leng recognises Barham 's arrangements on " pivotal " songs such as " Isn 't It a Pity " , " My Sweet Lord " , " Beware of Darkness " and " All Things Must Pass " as important elements of the album 's sound , while Spector has praised Harrison 's guitar and vocal work on the overdubs , saying : " Perfectionist is not the right word . Anyone can be a perfectionist . He was beyond that ... " Harrison 's style of slide guitar playing incorporated aspects of both Indian music and the blues tradition ; from its introduction on All Things Must Pass , Leng writes , Harrison 's slide guitar became his musical signature – " as instantly recognisable as Dylan 's harmonica or Stevie Wonder 's " . 
 = = = Mixing and mastering = = = 
 On 9 October , while carrying out final mixing at Abbey Road , Harrison presented Lennon with the recently recorded " It 's Johnny 's Birthday " . The track featured Harrison on vocals , harmonium and all other instruments , and vocal contributions from Mal Evans and assistant engineer Eddie Klein . That same month , Harrison finished his production work on Starr 's 1971 single " It Don 't Come Easy " , the basic track for which they had recorded with Voormann in March at Trident . Aside from his contributions to projects by Starr , Clapton , Preston and Ashton during 1970 , over the following year Harrison would reciprocate the help that his fellow musicians on All Things Must Pass had given him by contributing to albums by Whitlock , Wright , Badfinger and Keys . 
 On 28 October , Harrison and Boyd arrived in New York , where he and Spector carried out final preparation for the album 's release , such as sequencing . Harrison harboured doubts about whether all the songs they had finished were worthy of inclusion ; Allan Steckler , Apple Records ' US manager , was " stunned " by the quality of the material and assured Harrison that he should issue all the songs . Spector 's signature production style gave All Things Must Pass a heavy , reverb @-@ oriented sound , which Harrison came to regret with the passage of time . Outtakes from the recording sessions became available on bootlegs in the 1990s . One such unofficial release , the three @-@ disc The Making of All Things Must Pass , contains multiple takes of some of the songs on the album , providing a work @-@ in @-@ progress on the sequence of overdubs onto the backing tracks . 
 = = Album artwork = = 
 Harrison commissioned Tom Wilkes to design a hinged box in which to house the three vinyl discs , rather than have them packaged in a triple gatefold cover . Apple insider Tony Bramwell later recalled : " It was a bloody big thing ... You needed arms like an orang @-@ utan to carry half a dozen . " The packaging caused some confusion among retailers , who , at that time , associated boxed albums with opera or classical works . 
 The stark black @-@ and @-@ white cover photo was taken on the main lawn at Friar Park by Wilkes ' Camouflage Productions partner , Barry Feinstein . Commentators interpret the photograph – showing Harrison seated in the centre of , and towering over , four comical @-@ looking garden gnomes – as representing his removal from the Beatles ' collective identity . The gnomes had recently been delivered to Friar Park and placed on the lawn ; seeing the four figures there , and mindful of the message in the album 's title , Feinstein immediately drew parallels with Harrison 's former band . Author and music journalist Mikal Gilmore has written that Lennon 's initial negativity regarding All Things Must Pass was possibly because he was " irritated " by this cover photo ; Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley attributes this reaction to envy on Lennon 's part during a time when " everything [ Harrison ] touched turned to gold " . 
 Apple included a poster with the album , showing Harrison in a darkened corridor of his home , standing in front of an iron @-@ framed window . Wilkes had designed a more adventurous poster , but according to Beatles author Bruce Spizer , Harrison was uncomfortable with the imagery . Some of the Feinstein photographs that Wilkes had incorporated into this original poster design appeared instead on the picture sleeves for the " My Sweet Lord " single and its follow @-@ up , " What Is Life " . 
 = = Release = = 
 EMI and its US counterpart , Capitol Records , had originally scheduled the album for release in October 1970 , and advance promotion began in September . An " intangible buzz " had been " in the air for months " regarding Harrison 's solo album , according to Alan Clayson , and " for reasons other than still @-@ potent loyalty to the Fab Four " . Harrison 's stature as an artist had grown over the past year through the acclaim afforded his songs on Abbey Road , as well as the speculation caused by his and Dylan 's joint recording session in New York . Noting also Harrison 's role in popularising new acts such as the Band and Delaney & Bonnie , and his association with Clapton and Cream , NME critic Bob Woffinden concluded in 1981 : " All in all , Harrison 's credibility was building to a peak . " 
 All Things Must Pass was released on 27 November 1970 in the United States , and on 30 November in Britain , with the rare distinction of having the same Apple catalogue number ( <unk> 639 ) in both countries . Often credited as rock 's first triple album , it was the first triple set of previously unissued music by a single act , the multi @-@ artist Woodstock live album having preceded it by six months . Adding to the commercial appeal of Harrison 's songs , Clayson writes , All Things Must Pass appeared at a time when religion and spirituality had become " a turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ decade craze " among Western youth , just as the Twist had been in 1960 . Another factor behind the album 's first weeks of release was Harrison 's meeting with McCartney in New York , the failure of which led to McCartney filing suit in London 's High Court to dissolve the Beatles ' legal partnership . 
 Apple issued " My Sweet Lord " as the album 's first single , as a double A @-@ side with " Isn 't It a Pity " in the majority of countries . It was highly successful , topping singles charts around the world during the first few months of 1971 , on its way to becoming the most performed song of that year . Discussing the song 's cultural impact , Gilmore credits " My Sweet Lord " with being " as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced " . Issued in February 1971 , the second single , " What Is Life " backed with " Apple Scruffs " , was also successful . 
 All Things Must Pass was number 1 on the UK 's official albums chart for eight weeks , although until 2006 , chart records incorrectly stated that it had peaked at number 4 . On Melody Maker 's national chart , the album was also number 1 for eight weeks , from 6 February to 27 March , six of which coincided with " My Sweet Lord " topping the magazine 's singles chart . In America , All Things Must Pass spent seven weeks at number 1 on the Billboard Top LP 's chart , from 2 January until 20 February , and a similarly long period atop the listings compiled by Cash Box and Record World ; for three of those weeks , " My Sweet Lord " held the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 . Writing in the April 2001 issue of Record Collector , managing editor Peter Doggett described Harrison as " arguably the most successful rock star on the planet " at the start of 1971 , with All Things Must Pass " easily outstripping other solo Beatles projects later in the year , such as [ McCartney 's ] Ram and [ Lennon 's ] Imagine " . Harrison 's so @-@ called " Billboard double " – whereby one artist simultaneously holds the top positions on the magazine 's albums and singles listings – was a feat that none of his former bandmates equalled until Paul McCartney and Wings repeated the achievement in June 1973 . At the 1972 Grammy Awards , All Things Must Pass was nominated for Album of the Year and " My Sweet Lord " for Record of the Year , but Harrison lost out in both categories to Carole King . 
 All Things Must Pass was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America on 17 December 1970 and it has since been certified six times platinum . According to John Bergstrom of PopMatters , as of January 2011 , All Things Must Pass had sold more than Imagine and McCartney and Wings ' Band on the Run ( 1973 ) combined . Also writing in 2011 , Lennon and Harrison biographer Gary Tillery describes it as " the most successful album ever released by an ex @-@ Beatle " . In his 2004 book The 100 Best @-@ Selling Albums of the 70s , Hamish Champ ranks it as the 36th best @-@ selling album of that decade .

 = = = Contemporary reviews = = = 
 All Things Must Pass received almost universal critical acclaim on release – as much for the music and lyrical content as for the fact that , of all the former Beatles , it was the work of supposed junior partner George Harrison . Beatles author Robert Rodriguez has written of critics ' attention being centred on " a major talent unleashed , one who 'd been hidden in plain sight all those years " behind Lennon and McCartney . " That the Quiet Beatle was capable of such range , " Rodriguez continues , " from the joyful ' What Is Life ' to the meditative ' Isn 't It a Pity ' to the steamrolling ' Art of Dying ' to the playful ' I Dig Love ' – was revelatory . " Most reviewers tended to discount the third disc of studio jams , accepting that it was a " free " addition to justify the set 's high retail price , although Anthony DeCurtis recognises Apple Jam as further evidence of the album 's " bracing air of creative liberation " . 
 Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone deemed All Things Must Pass " both an intensely personal statement and a grandiose gesture , a triumph over artistic modesty " and referenced the three @-@ record set as an " extravaganza of piety and sacrifice and joy , whose sheer magnitude and ambition may dub it the War and Peace of rock and roll " . Gerson also lauded the album 's production as being " of classic <unk> proportions , Wagnerian , Brucknerian , the music of mountain tops and vast horizons " . In the NME , Alan Smith referred to Harrison 's songs as " music of the mind " , adding : " they search and they wander , as if in the soft rhythms of a dream , and in the end he has set them to words which are often both profound and profoundly beautiful . " Billboard magazine hailed All Things Must Pass as " a masterful blend of rock and piety , technical brilliance and mystic mood , and relief from the tedium of everyday rock " . 
 Melody Maker 's Richard Williams summed up the surprise many felt at Harrison 's apparent transformation : All Things Must Pass , he said , provided " the rock equivalent of the shock felt by pre @-@ war moviegoers when Garbo first opened her mouth in a talkie : Garbo talks ! – Harrison is free ! " In another review , for The Times , Williams opined that , of all the Beatles ' solo releases thus far , Harrison 's album " makes far and away the best listening , perhaps because it is the one which most nearly continues the tradition they began eight years ago " . William Bender of Time magazine described it as an " expressive , classically executed personal statement ... one of the outstanding rock albums in years " , while Don Heckman wrote in The New York Times : " If anyone had any doubts that George Harrison was a major talent , they can relax ... This is a release that shouldn 't be missed . " 
 That the album sounded so contemporary in 1970 contributed to All Things Must Pass seeming dated and faddish later in the decade . Village Voice critic Robert Christgau , having bemoaned in 1971 that the album was characterised by " overblown <unk> " and uninteresting music , wrote in a 1981 review of its " <unk> " , " right down to the anonymity of the multitracked vocals " . In their book The Beatles : An Illustrated Record , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler were likewise lukewarm in their assessment , criticising the " homogeneity " of the production and " the lugubrious nature of Harrison 's composing " . Writing in The Beatles Forever in 1977 , however , Nicholas Schaffner praised the album as the " crowning glory " of Harrison and Spector 's careers , and highlighted " All Things Must Pass " and " Beware of Darkness " as the " two most eloquent songs ... musically as well as lyrically " . 
 = = = Retrospective reviews and legacy = = = 
 AllMusic 's Richie Unterberger views All Things Must Pass as " [ Harrison 's ] best ... a very moving work " , while Roger Catlin of MusicHound describes the set as " epic and audacious " , its " dense production and rich songs topped off by the extra album of jamming " . Q magazine considers it to be an exemplary fusion of " rock and religion " , as well as " the single most satisfying collection of any solo Beatle " . Filmmaker Martin Scorsese has written of the " powerful sense of the ritualistic on the album " , adding : " I remember feeling that it had the grandeur of liturgical music , of the bells used in Tibetan Buddhist ceremonies . " Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002 , Greg Kot described this grandeur as an " echo @-@ laden cathedral of rock in excelsis " where the " real stars " are Harrison 's songs ; in the same publication , Mikal Gilmore labelled the album " the finest solo work any ex @-@ Beatle ever produced " . In his July 2001 feature for Mojo , John Harris called it " the inaugural solo album that still stands as the best Beatles solo record " , while earlier that year the magazine 's album review read in part : " This remains the best Beatles solo album ... oozing both the goggle @-@ eyed joy of creative emancipation and the sense of someone pushing himself to the limit ... " 
 In his PopMatters review , John Bergstrom likens All Things Must Pass to " the sound of Harrison exhaling " , noting : " He was quite possibly the only Beatle who was completely satisfied with the Beatles being gone . " Bergstrom credits the album with heavily influencing bands such as ELO , My Morning Jacket , Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear , as well as helping bring about the dream pop phenomenon . Another Rolling Stone critic , James Hunter , commented in 2001 on how All Things Must Pass " helped define the decade it ushered in " , in that " the cast , the length , the long hair falling on suede @-@ covered shoulders ... foretold the sprawl and sleepy ambition of the Seventies . " In The Rolling Stone Album Guide ( 2004 ) , Mac Randall writes that the album is exceptional , but " a tad overrated " by those critics who tend to overlook how its last 30 minutes comprise " a bunch of instrumental blues jams that nobody listens to more than once " . Unterberger similarly cites the inclusion of Apple Jam as " a very significant flaw " , while recognising that its content " proved to be of immense musical importance " , with the formation of Derek and the Dominos . Writing for Pitchfork Media in 2016 , Jayson Green said that Harrison was the only former Beatle who " changed the terms of what an album could be " since , although All Things Must Pass was not the first rock triple LP , " in the cultural imagination , it is the first triple album , the first one released as a pointed statement . " 
 Among Harrison 's biographers , Simon Leng views All Things Must Pass as a " paradox of an album " : as eager as Harrison was to break free from his identity as a Beatle , Leng suggests , many of the songs document the " Kafkaesque chain of events " of life within the band and so added to the " mythologized history " he was looking to escape . Ian Inglis notes 1970 's place in an era marking " the new supremacy of the singer @-@ songwriter " , through such memorable albums as Simon & Garfunkel 's Bridge Over Troubled Water , Neil Young 's After the Gold Rush , Van Morrison 's Moondance and Joni Mitchell 's Ladies of the Canyon , but that none of these " possessed the startling impact " of All Things Must Pass . Harrison 's triple album , Inglis writes , " [ would ] elevate ' the third Beatle ' into a position that , for a time at least , comfortably eclipsed that of his former bandmates " . 
 All Things Must Pass features in music reference books such as The Mojo Collection : The Greatest Albums of All Time , Robert Dimery 's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die and Tom Moon 's 1 @,@ 000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die . In 1999 , All Things Must Pass appeared at number 9 on The Guardian 's " Alternative Top 100 Albums " list , where the editor described it as the " best , mellowest and most sophisticated " of all the Beatles ' solo efforts . In 2006 , Pitchfork Media placed it at number 82 on the site 's " Top 100 Albums of the 1970s " . Six year later , it was voted 433rd on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " . According to the website Acclaimed Music , All Things Must Pass has also appeared in the following critics ' best @-@ album books and lists , among others : Paul Gambaccini 's The World Critics Best Albums of All Time ( 1977 ; ranked number 79 ) , The Times ' " 100 Best Albums of All Time " ( 1993 ; number 79 ) , Allan Kozinn 's The 100 Greatest Pop Albums of the Century ( published in 2000 ) , Q 's " The 50 ( + 50 ) Best British Albums Ever " ( 2004 ) , Mojo 's " 70 of the Greatest Albums of the 70s " ( 2006 ) , the NME 's " 100 Greatest British Albums Ever " ( 2006 ; number 86 ) , Paste magazine 's " The 70 Best Albums of the 1970s " ( 2012 ; number 27 ) , and Craig Mathieson and Toby Creswell 's The 100 Best Albums of All Time ( 2013 ) .

 To mark the 30th anniversary of the album 's release , Harrison supervised a remastered edition of All Things Must Pass , which was issued in January 2001 , less than a year before his death from cancer at the age of 58 . The reissue appeared on Gnome Records , a label specifically set up by him for the project . Harrison oversaw revisions to Wilkes and Feinstein 's album artwork , which included a <unk> " George & the Gnomes " front cover and , on the two CD sleeves and the album booklet , further examples of this cover image showing an imaginary , gradual encroachment of urbanisation on the Friar Park landscape . The latter series served to illustrate Harrison 's dismay at " the direction the world seemed headed at the start of the millennium " , Gary Tillery observes , a direction that was " so far afield from the Age of Aquarius that had been the dream of the sixties " . Harrison launched a website dedicated to the reissue , which offered , in the description of Chuck Miller of Goldmine magazine , " graphics and sounds and little Macromedia @-@ created gnomes dancing and giggling and playing guitars in a Terry Gilliam @-@ esque world " . As a further example of his willingness to embrace modern media , Harrison prepared an electronic press kit , which he described as " not exactly an EPK but it is a threat to world order as we know it " . 
 Titled All Things Must Pass : 30th Anniversary Edition , the new album contained five bonus tracks , including " I Live For You " , two of the songs performed for Spector at Abbey Road in May 1970 ( " Beware of Darkness " and " Let It Down " ) and " My Sweet Lord ( 2000 ) " , a partial re @-@ recording of Harrison 's biggest solo hit . In addition , Harrison resequenced the content of Apple Jam so that the album closed with " Out of the Blue " , as he had originally intended . Assisting Harrison with overdubs on the bonus tracks were his son , Dhani Harrison , singer Sam Brown and percussionist Ray Cooper , all of whom contributed to the recording of Brainwashed around this time . 
 With Harrison undertaking extensive promotional work , the 2001 reissue was a critical and commercial success . Having underestimated the album 's popularity , Capitol faced a back order of 20 @,@ 000 copies in America . There , the reissue debuted at number 4 on Billboard 's Top Pop Catalog Albums chart and topped the magazine 's Internet Album Sales listings . In the UK , it peaked at number 68 on the national albums chart . Writing in Record Collector , Doggett described this success as " a previously unheard @-@ of achievement for a reissue " . 
 Following Harrison 's death on 29 November 2001 , All Things Must Pass returned to the US charts , climbing to number 6 and number 7 , respectively , on the Top Pop Catalog and Internet Album Sales charts . With the release on iTunes of much of the Harrison catalogue , in October 2007 , the album re @-@ entered the US Top Pop Catalog chart , peaking at number 3 .

 For the 40th anniversary of All Things Must Pass , EMI reissued the album in its original configuration , in a limited @-@ edition box set of three vinyl LPs . Available via participating Record Store Day retailers , with each copy individually numbered , the release took place on 26 November 2010 . In what Bergstrom notes as a contrast to the more aggressive marketing campaign run simultaneously by John Lennon 's estate , to commemorate Lennon 's 70th birthday , a digitally remastered 24 @-@ bit version of the album was made available for download from Harrison 's official website . The reissue coincided with the Harrison estate 's similarly low @-@ key release of the Ravi Shankar – George Harrison box set Collaborations and East Meets West Music 's reissue of Raga , the long @-@ unavailable documentary on Shankar that Harrison had helped release through Apple Films in 1971 .

 All Things Must Pass was remastered again for inclusion in the eight @-@ disc Harrison box set The Apple Years 1968 – 75 , issued in September 2014 . Also available as a separate , double CD release , the reissue reproduces Harrison 's 2001 liner notes and includes the same five bonus tracks that appeared on the 30th anniversary edition . In addition , the box set 's DVD contains the promotional film created for the 2001 reissue .

 = = Publication and format = = 
 The magazine offers both print and digital subscriptions and has back issues available for sale in both formats . It sells high quality fine art prints from its photo collection for several hundreds of dollars per print . Although it claims to be a quarterly magazine , treats has published just two issues per year for each calendar year of its existence to date : 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 . 2014 has had one issue so far . 
 The print editions are produced in oversized format on 70 lb. matte stock . The magazine is also available digitally in several formats such as on <unk> for iPad and as a mobile phone app as well as via the official website , a blog , and various social media websites .

 treats ! describes itself as " a limited edition , fine art print & digital publication available only by subscription & sold at select news @-@ stands , book stores & boutiques worldwide . " The literary content of the magazine has been described as " left @-@ of @-@ center " by Daily Beast . The magazine , which is based in Los Angeles , is described by USA Today , The Huffington Post , and The New York Times as an artistic erotica magazine . Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times noted that his " copilot " felt that the magazine 's nude photography was " virtually indistinguishable " from Playboy 's despite the " fine arts quarterly " billing . 
 According to Steve Shaw , the magazine 's publisher , treats ! was founded to present content that was too risqué for magazines such as Vogue , Elle and InStyle . Shaw 's nickname for photos that could not be used because they pushed the borders too far was " treats " , and he decided to use the nickname as the title for the magazine . The magazine presents images that have not been airbrushed or photographically retouched . 
 = = History = = 
 Shaw has a background in celebrity glamour photography for Maxim , FHM , Playboy , and British Esquire . He claims he had become fed up with shooting restrictions such as " three quarters of one side of a boob ... You can only show one inch down from the bum crack ... " and with uncooperative subjects . Thus , he says , he created his own magazine with what Daily Beast described as " female full @-@ frontal nudity , luxe @-@ y aesthetic , and [ an ] underpinning of fashion @-@ world credibility " that has gotten " influential tastemakers and industry icons " to take notice . 
 Shaw 's initial investment for his magazine was $ 600 @,@ 000 . Within the first year of its launch photographers like Brett Ratner were volunteering to shoot for the magazine . As of 2014 , Duran , Mark Seliger , Ben Watts , Josh Ryan , and Bob Carlos Clarke are among the photographers who have been featured in the magazine . 
 The launch party for the magazine was held on Thursday , February 24 , 2011 at the James Goldstein residence as an Oscars @-@ week party before the 83rd Academy Awards . Issue 1 of the magazine , which was without any advertisements , debuted with a cover photo of models Irene <unk> and Cassy <unk> photographed by Tony Duran that was described by Business Wire as " edgy , scintillating and elegant " . The issue featured the classic picture of Raquel Welch on the cross taken by Terry O 'Neill . Literary subjects in the premier include features on Jason Statham and Shepard Fairey . 5 @,@ 000 magazines were printed for issue 1 and 10 @,@ 000 for issue 2 . Its launch was awarded a " best new launch " award of 2011 by the Media Industry Newsletter ( <unk> ) . 
 The magazine debuted with a $ 20 @.@ 00 newsstand price , a $ 65 @.@ 00 yearly subscription price and $ 15 @.@ 00 download price . With the fourth issue the newsstand price changed to $ 30 @.@ 00 . In 2012 , the magazine added an online gallery that sold prints of the magazine 's content at prices ranging from $ 395 to $ 3 @,@ 995 — depending on size and framing . 
 Emily Ratajkowski posed for several of the early issues . She claims that her appearance on the March 2012 issue 3 cover is what brought her two unsolicited high @-@ profile music video modeling roles ( Robin Thicke , T.I. , and Pharrell Williams ' " Blurred Lines " and Maroon 5 's " Love Somebody " ) . Thicke had seen the treats ! magazine black @-@ and @-@ white cover and convinced director Diane Martel to cast her in the " Blurred Lines " music video . 
 Dylan Penn , daughter of Sean Penn and Robin Wright , appeared nude on the cover of the seventh issue of treats ! , which was published in April 2014 . Penn avoided full exposure on the cover with the aid of a $ 6 @,@ 000 @-@ plus Fendi bag and in a similar manner in the photo layout feature within the magazine . Penn was photographed by Duran .

 " Champion " is a song by Trinidadian American recording artist Nicki Minaj , taken from her second studio album , Pink Friday : Roman Reloaded ( 2012 ) . The song features additional vocals from hip hop artists Drake , Nas , and Young Jeezy . " Champion " was written by Minaj , Aubrey Graham , Jay Jenkins , and Nasir Jones , while the production and additional writing was handled by Pink Friday ( 2010 ) collaborators T @-@ Minus and Nikhil Seetharam . Musically , " Champion " is a downtempo hardcore hip hop ballad that also incorporates elements of R & B , new @-@ age , and space music . The lyrics speak of each artist 's rise to fame , as well as the trials and tribulations that it carries ; it references the death of Minaj 's cousin , Nicholas Telemaque , who was murdered near his Brooklyn home on July 3 , 2011 . 
 " Champion " garnered praise from music critics , with the majority declaring it a stand @-@ out track . The song is notable for the return of Minaj 's original low @-@ key sound , as well as her tame " gimmick @-@ free " delivery as opposed to her eccentric " Roman " songs . Critics generally praised the song for its serious tone and introspective nature . Minaj performed the song live for the first time on 106 & Park on April 3 , 2012 , along with " Beez in the Trap " , and " Roman Reloaded " .

 " Champion " was written by Minaj , along with T @-@ Minus , Nikhil S. , Drake , Young Jeezy , and Nas , with production handled by T @-@ Minus and Nikhil S. , who had previously worked with Minaj on her debut studio album Pink Friday ( 2010 ) . Minaj had wanted several artists to appear on the song , including fellow New York rapper Nas . She had stated that she did not think that she could get Nas on the song , saying " He 's always been so exclusive . He doesn 't work with everybody and I respect people that are like that . They take pride in their craft . " Minaj told Vibe , " I keep saying to be from Queens and to end up having him ... We know how picky he is [ for features ] . He said ' I like the song , I 'm a do it , you can wait ' til Monday and I got you ' and he kept his word . He <unk> it , for me to wait for a feature and it be that and murk the song and finish the song that way ... I was amazed . " After hearing the song , Nas agreed to be on the track , and sent his verse back to Minaj the following Monday . After collaborating , Nas said that he had fallen in love with the song : " Nicki hit us up , I got love , so it was nothin ' <unk> did the record .... If I feel it , I can get on it . I heard the track . I felt it . I loved it . " Another artist Minaj wanted on " Champion " was long @-@ time idol and fellow female rapper Lauryn Hill . " I wanted to get her on ' Champion ' ... That would have been crazy , right ? She was my fave . [ ... ] Lauryn to me is the goddess . I 'd love to meet her . I 'm pretty sure she 's heard me talk about her a billion times . " Although Minaj vouched for Hill to appear on the track , plans were never finalized and the collaboration ultimately fell through . 
 Recording of " Champion " took place at Conway Studios , in Los Angeles , California , as well as Jungle City Studios in New York City , New York . Mixing was handled by Jon Sher and Noel Cadastre at Conway Studios . Minaj was unsure if he would accept her offer to be featured on " Champion " , but after sending him the song , Nas replied back with his verse via e @-@ mail . On March 28 , 2012 , " Champion " leaked onto the internet six days ahead of its official release . In the following hours after the leak of " Champion " , the contents of the entire album were leaked online . On May 24 , 2012 , a poll was posted on Minaj 's official website asking fans to choose the next single ( s ) . The poll was divided into three categories . The second category prompted fans to choose between " Champion " , " HOV Lane " , and " I Am Your Leader " . " Champion " had the most votes and won the poll . " HOV Lane " came in second place and " I Am Your Leader " came in third .

 " Champion " is a relatively slow @-@ paced , retrospective downtempo ballad that draws heavily from hardcore hip hop .

The " anthemic " and " inspiring " song features a low @-@ key , woozy , and snaky production , accompanied by prominent military @-@ style drums , heavy synths , and rough , hard strewn beats . " Champion " has been described as one of the few songs that Minaj 's delivery is " calm and collected " as opposed to her eccentric " Roman " tracks . The rise to fame , the trials and tribulations that ensue , and celebration are prominent themes that are discussed in the lyrics . Minaj also makes reference to her deceased cousin , Nicholas Telemaque , who was shot and killed near his Brooklyn home on July 3 , 2011 , in the line " ' Cause they killed my little cousin , Nicholas / But my memories only have happy images .

 = Scout Moor Wind Farm = 
 Scout Moor Wind Farm is the second largest onshore wind farm in England . The wind farm , which was built for Peel Wind Power Ltd , produces electricity from 26 <unk> <unk> wind turbines . It has a total nameplate capacity of 65 MW of electricity , providing 154 @,@ 000 MW · h per year ; enough to serve the average needs of 40 @,@ 000 homes . The site occupies 1 @,@ 347 acres ( 545 ha ) of open moorland between Edenfield , Rawtenstall and Rochdale , and is split between the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in northern Greater Manchester and the Borough of Rossendale in south @-@ eastern Lancashire . The turbines are visible from as far away as south Manchester , 15 – 20 miles ( 24 – 32 km ) away . 
 A protest group was formed to resist the proposed construction , and attracted support from the botanist and environmental campaigner David Bellamy . Despite the opposition , planning permission was granted in 2005 and construction began in 2007 . Although work on the project was hampered by harsh weather , difficult terrain , and previous mining activity , the wind farm was officially opened on 25 September 2008 after " years of controversy " , at a cost of £ 50 million . 
 In 2012 Peel Energy sold its 50 % share in the facility to Munich Re 's asset management division <unk> . The other 50 % holding was also purchased by <unk> from HgCapital Renewable Power Partners . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Scout Moor is an upland moor of peat bog and heather in the South Pennines , reaching a maximum elevation of 1 @,@ 552 feet ( 473 m ) at its peak , Top of Leach . The underlying geology – a mixture of hard rock and soft shales – broadly belongs to the Lower Coal Measures . The rock and shales weather at different rates , giving the area a landscape of " steep escarpments separated by sloping shelves " , although the main dome of the moor is flat and rounded . The moorland covers an area of about 1 @,@ 347 acres ( 545 ha ) , of which less than 21 acres ( 8 @.@ 5 ha ) , about 2 % , is occupied by the wind farm . 
 Scout Moor Quarry , a 250 @-@ acre ( 100 ha ) open @-@ pit mine in Edenfield , is used for the extraction of gritstone and sandstone , and formerly had its own railway line . The eastern fringe of Scout Moor Wind Farm extends to Hail Storm Hill ( also known as <unk> Moss ) , one of the 180 Marilyns of England . The presence of coal under Scout Moor led to extensive and unrecorded shallow coal mining in the area during the 18th and 19th centuries . <unk> , shafts and coal seams from that period mark the landscape . 
 = = History = = 
 One meaning of scout is a long ridge of rock , appearing to " shoot out " horizontally . The word is thought to be a corruption of the Old English <unk> , meaning " shot " or " to shoot " , suggesting Anglo @-@ Saxon settlement in the locality at a very ancient time . 
 Although the UK Government has set a target of 10 % for the proportion of the UK 's electricity produced by renewable energy by 2010 , wind power in the UK has a long history of controversy , with an average approval rate for planning permission of only 28 % for onshore wind farms . Scout Moor was first identified as an excellent site for a wind farm in 2001 . Peel Holdings commissioned market research consultants MORI to undertake a telephone poll over seventeen days in 2002 , soliciting the opinions of residents in Bury , Rossendale and Rochdale about wind farms in general and Scout Moor in particular . The results showed that 88 % of respondents thought wind farms were a very or fairly good idea , 72 % thought the Scout Moor project was a very or fairly good idea , and 63 % stated wind power as the preferred energy source . 
 The proposal to build a wind farm , in a joint venture between United Utilities and Peel Holdings , was announced in 2003 . Shortly afterwards a pressure group , The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor , was formed , and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury 's , Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans . At the meeting , the spokesperson for the group said that , although they supported the use of alternative energy , they felt that this was the wrong area . Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt , and would adversely affect common land , open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value . The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape , adversely affecting peat , water courses and wildlife , and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact , as well as causing a noise nuisance . 
 The second presentation was given by a representative of Scout Moor Wind Farm , who argued the need for Britain to produce clean green power without harmful emissions , to counter the increasing dangers of global warming . He went on to say that the UK has fewer wind farms than other major industrial countries in Europe , even though it is a windier country , and that North West England has a particularly poor record , with only 1 @.@ 3 % of electricity generated from renewable energy . Following this meeting the campaign to oppose the proposal gathered momentum , and in November 2003 a protest was held on the moor , led by environmental campaigner Professor David Bellamy . 
 Although Bury Metropolitan Borough Council supported the proposal , objections were raised by Lancashire County Council , Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council and Rossendale Borough Council , and a public enquiry was held in November and December 2004 . The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry gave formal consent to the application for the development of the wind farm in May 2005 , by which time United Utilities had sold their share in the project and ended their involvement . A number of conditions were imposed : 
 Under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act ( 1990 ) the applicant will be required to establish a habitat management plan . Other conditions have been placed on the development including that : 
 Access tracks to all areas to and around the turbine bases shall remain unfenced . Access will be allowed on the site for the whole of the life of the development for members of the public and grazing stock . 
 Construction will take place outside the bird nesting season . 
 A survey will take place to establish the presence of badgers in the area before development takes place . 
 No development shall take place until there is a full archaeological investigation . 
 More conditions have been attached to the consent and various surveys and assessments must be carried out by the applicant before development can commence . 
 On 20 April 2006 , Janet Anderson ( Member of Parliament for Rossendale and Darwen ) asked Margaret Beckett , then Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , whether the development would meet the provisions of the Commons Bill regarding the protection of and public access to common land . The reply from Jim Knight , ( Parliamentary Under @-@ Secretary of State for Rural Affairs , Landscape and Biodiversity ) was that " [ t ] hese applications are made under section 147 of the Inclosure Act 1845 . Consideration is given under these provision to the effect of the exchange on the general public 's legal right of access over the land . The future provisions in the Commons Bill are not relevant . " 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The detailed design for the project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007 . The first task was to build a stable access road , but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low load @-@ bearing capacity . The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries , so there was a potential for subsidence . To address these problems , the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed , using a complex system of <unk> and <unk> to prevent the road from sinking . This was achieved by laying a crushed @-@ gravel base , reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids , to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material . The wind turbines arrived at Scout Moor in parts , transported by large goods vehicles along the M66 motorway to Edenfield as part of a 76 @-@ day @-@ long convoy of delivery . 
 The weather constrained the wind farm 's construction for the teams from contractor McNicholas and German turbine supplier <unk> . During the final stages , the project manager for McNicholas was quoted as saying : 
 The weather has undoubtedly been the single biggest challenge we have faced up here . We have worked with wind speeds well in excess of <unk> and temperatures as low as minus 12 degrees Celsius , which is more like minus 25 with the wind @-@ chill factor . I 've worked on a lot of wind farm construction projects but the adverse conditions have made this one of the most difficult ... We have spent £ 30 @,@ 000 on personal protective equipment for the workers . Keeping them warm , fed and moving in these conditions is a massive man management project , but we did it . 
 The wind farm , which stretches across nearly 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of open moorland between Edenfield , Rawtenstall and Rochdale , the largest onshore wind farm in England , was officially opened on 25 September 2008 . As of 26 August 2008 , 21 of 26 turbines had been commissioned and 4 @,@ 000 MW · h of electricity had been exported to the National Grid . The turbines are visible from south Manchester , 15 – 20 miles ( 24 – 32 km ) away , and are expected to produce enough electricity to meet the needs of 40 @,@ 000 average homes . Scout Moor has the capacity to produce a total of 65 MW , compared with the 90 MW capacity of Kentish Flats , the United Kingdom 's largest offshore wind farm . The total cost of the Scout Moor project was £ 50 million , but Peel Holdings expect the turbines to be in operation for at least 25 years . Since its opening , the wind farm " has become a real tourist attraction " ; a calendar showing photographs of the wind farm 's construction has been featured in local news stories .

 Over the lifetime of the wind farm , Peel Holdings ' energy subsidiary , Peel Wind Power Ltd , will provide up to £ 500 @,@ 000 to help landowners create biodiverse areas on the land surrounding the moor . A prime target habitat envisaged to be enhanced and re @-@ created under the Habitat Enhancement Plan is upland blanket bog and important habitats for skylarks and wading birds on the moorland fringe . To receive funding , landowners within an identified area will need to apply to a panel made up of representatives from Peel , the local authorities and independent ecological experts . This panel will meet regularly throughout the year . 
 Peel Wind Power are members of <unk> and state in their member 's profile that they are actively seeking new opportunities in the renewable energy sector . In November 2008 , the company announced a two @-@ year agreement to look at developing wind farms on land owned by UK Coal . If the 14 sites encompassed by the agreement were successfully developed , they would have the potential for 54 wind turbines generating up to 133 megawatts of power . Peel Energy director Steven Underwood said : " This agreement is an important step for Peel Energy , significantly expanding its onshore pipeline and gaining access to some of the UK 's best potential wind farm locations . " The Peel group holds a 28 % stake in UK Coal . 
 At a private meeting held in May 2007 between developers , <unk> UK , and invited local councillors , plans were put forward for another large wind farm consisting of 24 turbines on the moors above nearby Haslingden , spanning Thirteen Stone Hill and Oswaldtwistle Moor . Following the meeting Catherine Pilling , a Rossendale Liberal Democrat councillor , expressed her view that the natural beauty of the Rossendale Valley was under threat as it was increasingly being targeted by wind farm developers . " Our party is very much in favour of renewable energy , " she said , " but Rossendale is an area of outstanding beauty , and you have to ask : Would they be building a similar thing in the Lake District ? " Rossendale Borough Council leader Duncan <unk> representing the electoral ward of Worsley in Rossendale , the proposed site of the new wind farm , said he was against wind farms and would be campaigning against it and speaking at the Development Control committee when it came . The leader of the Labour local councillors was also opposed to the plan , saying that he was concerned about the size of the turbines and that the visual impact on the " beautiful West Pennine Moors " would be devastating . Planning permission for the development was granted by <unk> Council in March 2010 .

 = = = Capacity factor = = = 
 As the figures given in the table above were published before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures . Wind speed is not constant , therefore , a wind farm 's annual energy production never achieves the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year . The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor . Typical capacity factors are 20 – 40 % , with values at the upper end of the range achieved on particularly favourable sites . The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm , calculated from the company 's projected figures , is 27 % .

 = Tom Tancredo presidential campaign , 2008 = 
 The Tom Tancredo presidential campaign , 2008 for President of the United States began with the announcement of candidacy by the Congressman from Colorado on April 2 , 2007 . Since then , the campaign had garnered grassroots support and endorsements from conservative Republicans concerned about illegal immigration and border security . However , the candidate remained low in the polls and was criticized for his nativist campaign , which had been described as " single @-@ issued . " Tancredo stated that he probably would not win the nomination but hoped his campaign would bring forth more debate on his issue of concern , immigration . On December 20 , 2007 Tancredo withdrew from the presidential race , and endorsed Mitt Romney . 
 = = Campaign development = = 
 Prior to his announcement early in 2007 , draft movements sprung to try to convince Congressman Tancredo to run for President of the United States . Tancredo responded to the draft efforts by stating that he would only start a campaign if a candidate already in the race did not extensively address the issue of Immigration and stay committed to conservative principles . 
 After Tancredo 's announcement on April 2 , 2007 , he immediately began campaigning in the strategically important state of New Hampshire , making his first appearance at a meeting and a speech in Hudson and Nashua on April 4 . Following this , Tancredo campaigned in the first caucus state of Iowa on April 14 at a fundraiser in Des Moines . Tancredo made over 90 campaign appearances in the state of Iowa ( more than any other ) and appeared in Des Moines five times . He appeared in New Hampshire approximately 35 times and appeared sporadically in other states in the same time span . 
 Until June , the campaign never took off in the polls nor in funds and received little media attention , with the exception of the May 15 GOP debate in South Carolina . However , Tancredo was given an opportunity to discuss immigration and attack the Bush administration and fellow Republican members of Congress at a GOP debate in New Hampshire on June 5 , 2007 . His criticism was directed mostly at top tiered candidate John McCain for his support of the failed " Amnesty bill . " But throughout the night , he continually criticized the policies of the Bush administration , which he labeled as " liberal . " When asked what President Bush 's role would be in a Tancredo administration , he reflected on a time in 2003 when he was told by Karl Rove to " [ not ] darken the doorstep of the White House " because of his criticism of the president . Tancredo concluded that President Bush would be given the same command if he ever became president . During the debate in regards to immigration and Republican members of Congress , Tancredo said the following : 
 As July approached and came to its close , Tancredo 's standing improved somewhat with the looming Ames Straw Poll . His strategy to focus on Iowa continued , and the number of grassroots supporters in the state increased . On July 31 , the campaign developed an interesting new strategy , offering a trip to Washington , D.C. and a tour of the capitol to anyone who brought 25 Tancredo supporters to the straw poll . On the day before , supporters in Iowa distributed T @-@ shirts which read " I 'm a Member of Tom 's Army Against Amnesty . " Interviewed supporters were asked why they supported the candidate , they replied , " He really has the concerns of America at heart , he 's concerned about the culture of America itself . What 's happening to the bedrock of American culture . " Tancredo finished in fourth place at the Ames Straw poll with over 14 % of the vote . It was won by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney . 
 On August 31 , Tancredo shifted momentarily to a new issue . On the two @-@ year anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans , he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort . He remarked that it was time , " the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station . " The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states ' rights , commenting that " at some point , state and local officials and individuals have got to step up to the plate and take some initiative , the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems has got to come to an end . " 
 In September Tancredo participated in two debates which received much media attention for the decisions of top tiered candidates to not participate in them . He attended the Values Voters Debate in Fort Lauderdale , Florida on September 17 , 2007 . In the straw poll that followed , Tancredo came in seventh place with 2 % of the vote . Mike Huckabee won the straw poll with 63 % . Tancredo also appeared at the Black Caucus Debate on September 27 at Baltimore , Maryland which aired on PBS . During this debate he commented that the economic differences between African @-@ Americans and Anglo @-@ Americans has " nothing to do with race . " He also discussed illegal immigration . 
 On September 25 , Tancredo became the first presidential candidate to be interviewed on Wikinews . He discussed gay issues , immigration , and federalism among others . When asked who he would back if he had to support a Democratic Party candidate for president , Tancredo chose Senator Barack Obama of Illinois remarking : 
 In October with the World Series approaching and Tancredo 's team the Colorado Rockies representing the National League , he decided to offer a bet with fellow candidate Mitt Romney whose team the Boston Red Sox were representing the American League . Tancredo proposed that he would drop out of the race if Boston won but only if Romney agreed to drop out if Colorado won . Luckily for Tancredo , the Romney campaign turned down the bet and Boston won the world series . 
 On November 13 , the campaign released a controversial advertisement called " Tough on Terror " in which a hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall . The ad blames inept border security for the attack and flashes images of an injured child and a wrecked train . After Tancredo gives his approval for the message with the comment " I approve this message because someone needs to say it , " a voiceover states , " There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens who have come to take our jobs ... the price we pay for spineless politicians who refuse to defend our borders against those who come to kill . " Since its release , the ad received criticism from some who called it " cheap " and " blatant <unk> . " Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to a nuclear war . The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad . 
 On November 15 , in a move poking fun at Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards and building on the media coverage aimed at his campaign for the previously mentioned advertisement , Tancredo received a haircut for $ 400 , which was used to donate money to the Autism Society of America . The haircut was given by David Holden of New Hampshire whose son is afflicted with autism . 
 In early December , Tancredo declined an invitation to a Spanish @-@ language debate featured on Univision as a protest to immigrants who do not learn English . He did , however , participate in the November 28 , 2007 debate where he accused his opponents , most notable Mike Huckabee of trying to " out @-@ Tancredo , Tancredo " on the issue of illegal immigration . 
 On December 20 , 2007 Tancredo dropped out of the presidential race and thus ended his campaign . He cited that it had become apparent to him that he could not win the race but was glad at what he perceived as the new positions of his opponents on illegal immigration , believing that " we 've ( The Tom Tancredo campaign ) forced them into that [ rhetoric ] ... " Tancredo also cited Huckabee 's surge as a reason for his withdraw , stating his disagreements with the Governor made it important to help Romney secure the nomination . While announcing his withdrawal , Tancredo also announced that he was endorsing Mitt Romney for President in 2008 , citing Romney as " the best hope for our cause [ of immigration reform ] . " 
 = = Polling = = 
 About one year before entering the race , Tancredo won the Macomb County Straw Poll in Michigan on July 5 , 2006 . He received 60 of the 327 votes cast or 18 % of the vote . Tancredo beat out the second @-@ place finisher Rudy Giuliani by 15 votes . On February 13 , 2007 , the American Conservative Union issued ratings for potential presidential candidates for the 2008 election . Tancredo took first with a lifetime ranking of 99 out of 100 . The website <unk> polled 525 people who attended CPAC 2007 , and 88 @.@ 1 % believed that Tancredo would govern as a conservative . Newt Gingrich polled next at 87 @.@ 9 % . 
 In general polling , Tancredo fared far worse than in straw polls . Early polls placed the candidate both above and below the 1 % mark . However , in November 2007 he slightly moved up in polling , reaching the 2 % mark and coming out ahead of his closest rival , Congressman Duncan Hunter of California . In a November 16 Gallup poll , Tancredo stood in seventh place at 2 % , trailing Congressman Ron Paul of Texas by 3 % . In a head @-@ to @-@ head matchup done by Rasmussen Reports on August 29 , 2007 , Tancredo trailed New York Senator Hillary Clinton by 13 % finishing with 37 % to Clinton 's 50 % . In a head @-@ to @-@ head matchup with Barack Obama administered on the same day , Tancredo finished with 31 % to 48 % for Obama . 
 = = Financials = = 
 Individual contributions made up the most of the campaign cash that Tancredo received , making up about 97 % of his total pocketbook . PAC contributions were comparably low , producing only around $ 75 @,@ 500 , of the $ 1 @,@ 311 @,@ 869 . He granted himself $ 200 for the campaign and received no federal funding . $ 88 @,@ 457 of his money came from interest from the campaign 's bank accounts and loans from outside sources . It should be noted that the majority of Tancredo 's funds were not disclosed during the campaign As of September 30 , 2007 the campaign raised $ 3 @,@ 538 @,@ 244 and spent $ 3 @,@ 458 @,@ 130 , leaving only $ 110 @,@ 079 cash on hand . 
 Ronald Robinson of the Young America 's Foundation donated $ 1 @,@ 000 to the campaign . Michael Bushell , owner of <unk> and Pueblo Chieftain newspaper publisher Robert Rawlings both gave $ 500 to Tancredo 's campaign . 
 Tancredo qualified for and accepted public funds from the Presidential election campaign fund <unk> . However , he returned the matching funds since withdrawing from the race . 
 = = Advisors and endorsements = = 
 The biggest endorsement that Tancredo received was that of Bay Buchanan , the sister of perennial presidential candidate Pat Buchanan and former Treasurer of the United States under President Ronald Reagan . Immediately following her endorsement she was named the Senior Advisor of the campaign . Other advisors included Phil Alexander , formerly of the Buchanan campaigns in 1996 , and 2000 . New Hampshire advisor , Shelly <unk> formerly the New Hampshire chairman of the Christian Coalition . Iowa advisor and former U.S. Senate candidate in 2002 Bill <unk> . And campaign official Tim Haley , the former campaign manager of Pat Buchanan 's Reform Party run in 2000 . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 The campaign was criticized for as wide ranging issues as Tancredo 's speaking abilities and performances in debates to the categorization of his campaign as " unwinnable " and " one @-@ issued . " 
 After the October 9 , 2007 Dearborn GOP Debate , Tancredo was criticized by the conservative blog , " Republican Ranting " for stuttering and stumbling , citing this as causing him major problems in the debate . Also cited was the following exchange with Sam Brownback : 
 Tancredo : Sam , I don ’ t , your mom , if she was a postal worker , believe me , she didn ’ t need a union on top of civil service benefits 
 Brownback : Don ’ t pick on my mother 
 Tancredo : I ’ m sure she was a sweetheart . 
 Brownback : Leave my mother out of this . 
 Tancredo : Especially with regard to , need I say it , illegal immigration … 
 Brownback : My mother is not an illegal immigrant . 
 A writer at the blog <unk> , spoke about his experience at the August 12 , 2007 Iowa Straw poll stating that " Tancredo ... stuttered and stumbled , spoke during the applause , lost his place several times , so had to look at the written copy , not a good performance by any standard . " 
 The campaign was criticized for focusing too heavily on the issue of Immigration , which gave the candidate the appearance of running a one @-@ issue campaign . During an exchange on the August 22 , 2007 edition of Hannity and Colmes , Geraldo Rivera and Tancredo got into a lively argument over sanctuary cities and a murder committed by an illegal immigrant in Newark , New Jersey . Rivera remarked : 
 First of all , this was the 60th homicide in Newark this year , and I 'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined about any of the other homicides , and only became interested in this one when it became clear that one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11 . That 's one thing . 
 Number two , why was this person , this one of the six around to commit this hideous crime ? He was out because he had a 31 @-@ count indictment for the rape of a child , and he was out on $ 15 @,@ 000 bail , instead of the requisite $ 450 @,@ 000 bail that he never could have made and never would have been on the street . 
 It had nothing to do with his immigration status . And it 's just being used by advocates of this crushing anti @-@ immigration policy to make a cheap political point . 
 The political website " Political Realm " summed up Tancredo 's campaign profile with the statement that " In the end , Tancredo is a single @-@ issue candidate and that will not be enough to carry him over the top . " Tancredo himself acknowledged that he is a one @-@ issue candidate making the statement at a speech in to the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) , " If you want to call me a single @-@ issue candidate , that 's fine , just so long as you know that my single issue is the survival and the success of the conservative movement in America . " He remarked that his campaign was not about winning the nomination but instead winning over people to his point of view in the race :

 " Coach 's Daughter " is the fifth episode of the American television sitcom , Cheers , written by Ken Estin and directed by James Burrows . It first aired on NBC on October 28 , 1982 . This episode serves as the only appearance of Lisa Pantusso , portrayed by Allyce Beasley . In this episode , Coach 's daughter Lisa arrives with her fiancé Roy , who is boorish and obnoxious and rude to her , causing Coach to resent him .

 = = Plot = = 
 Coach 's ( Nicholas Colasanto ) daughter , Lisa , ( Allyce Beasley ) arrives with her fiancé , Roy ( Philip Charles MacKenzie ) , a door @-@ to @-@ door salesman who turns out to be abrasive and insensitive . Repulsed by Roy 's obnoxious , boorish personality and insults toward people , including Lisa , Coach finds Roy not good enough for her . However , Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father 's blessings . To make matters worse , at Melville 's restaurant , Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself , which makes Coach angrier . Therefore , witnessing Roy 's treatment on her , Coach 's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late . 
 No longer able to keep his silence , Coach escorts Lisa into an office , admits to Lisa that she is too good for someone who treats her badly , like Roy , and openly refuses to let her marry him . Lisa reluctantly admits that she knows everything about Roy , that her relationship with Roy is a sham , and that Roy is the first and only man in her life , as she had no other . Coach is shocked with disbelief and tells her that she 's " beautiful " , but Lisa objects and begs him for one moment to analyze her physical appearance , which she is insecure about . Coach then realizes that Lisa resembles her mother , who was not comfortable about her beauty . Yet , Coach dearly tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day , regardless of her appearance , just as her mother was more beautiful every day . Finally , Lisa feels self @-@ confident and thanks her father for his comments . 
 After the talk in the office , Lisa confesses to Roy that she hates him , that she finds him " obnoxious " , and that everything about him repulses her . Roy swears that the relationship is over , vows that he will never return if he leaves her forever , and exits the bar . Lisa prepares to celebrate her freedom from Roy with Coach , as they leave the bar . Meanwhile , Diane ( Shelley Long ) draws sketches of people , but her efforts show no resemblance to their subjects . 
 = = Production = = 
 Ken Levine remarked that the whole audience laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter at the end of the episode . It was reshot but the audience still laughed . Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the laughter from the office scene , so it is not heard in the final cut . Before portraying Tim — a minor insignificant character — in multiple episodes , Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck , who works at the lab that mutates viruses . Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple , to whom Diane shows her botched artwork .

 = 1924 Rose Bowl = 
 The 1924 Rose Bowl was a postseason American college football bowl game played between the independent Navy Midshipmen and the Washington Huskies , a member of the Pacific Coast Conference ( PCC ) . The game took place on January 1 , 1924 , at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena , California , closing the 1923 college football season . The game opened in front of approximately 40 @,@ 000 people and ended in a 14 – 14 tie . It was the first post @-@ season bowl game for both teams . The 1924 game was the tenth edition of the Rose Bowl , which had first been played in 1902 . Following the inaugural game 's blowout score , football was replaced with chariot races until 1916 . The Rose Bowl stadium had been constructed in 1923 , making this edition the second game played in the arena . 
 The game 's organizers had previously selected a team from the East Coast and the West Coast , and asked the Washington Huskies to represent the West Coast . Washington requested that the Navy Midshipmen be their opponents , and Navy accepted . Washington selected Navy in favor of several teams from the east which had amassed better records . Both teams had suffered only a single loss during the season , but Washington had won eight games compared with Navy 's five , although Navy had also amassed two ties . Predictions gave Washington a slight advantage in the game due to the weight difference between the teams : the Washington players were on average 10 pounds ( 4 @.@ 5 kg ) heavier than those of Navy . 
 The game kicked off in the afternoon ; heavy rain showers had fallen the day before , causing a slight delay . The first quarter was scoreless , but Navy scored a touchdown on the first play of the second quarter . Washington answered Navy with a 23 @-@ yard touchdown run on the next drive . Near the end of the second quarter , Navy scored a touchdown on a two @-@ yard run , giving them a 14 – 7 halftime lead . The third quarter was a defensive stalemate as neither team scored . Navy fumbled the ball on their own ten @-@ yard line late in the quarter . Four plays afterward , Washington tied the game on a 12 @-@ yard touchdown pass . Navy threw an interception at midfield , and Washington drove down to the Navy 20 @-@ yard line before attempting a game @-@ winning field goal . The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards . 
 For his performance in the game , Navy quarterback Ira McKee was named the Most Valuable Player . Navy led in nearly every statistical aspect of the contest . Washington returned to the Rose Bowl at the end of the 1925 season , falling to the Alabama Crimson Tide 20 – 19 . Navy did not participate in another bowl game until 1955 , when their squad , nicknamed the " team named desire " , upset the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl . Since the 1924 Rose Bowl , Navy and Washington have met five more times ; the Huskies won three of the games .

 The Rose Bowl game was first played in 1902 , as a way to help fund the Rose Parade . Because of the first contest 's lopsided score , a football game was not played again until 1916 , having been replaced by chariot races . Between 1902 and 1947 , the Rose Bowl was played between a team from the East Coast and a team from the West Coast . Until the construction of the Rose Bowl stadium , which began hosting the game in 1923 , it was called the " Tournament East – West football game " . Because the Pacific Coast Conference ( PCC ) was the only conference with teams located in the Western United States , a school from the conference had been chosen for every Rose Bowl game . The tournament committee invited the University of Washington Huskies to participate in the 1924 game , and they accepted . Washington was then allowed by the organization to select its opponent for the game — the first time a team was allowed to do so . Washington chose the Navy Midshipmen based on a suggestion from the committee , and Navy accepted the invitation .

 The Navy Midshipmen entered the Rose Bowl under coach Bob Folwell with five wins , one loss , and two ties ( 5 – 1 – 2 ) . Navy 's sole loss in the 1923 season came in their annual game against Penn State , which they lost 21 – 3 . All five of Navy 's wins came against eastern teams , including Colgate and William and Mary , and two of Navy 's wins were shutouts , against Colgate and Saint Xavier . Navy tied 0 – 0 with Army in the 1923 Army – Navy Game , the last game of the season , played on November 23 in front of nearly 70 @,@ 000 spectators — including high @-@ ranking military officials . Their other tie was a 3 – 3 game against Princeton . Navy was selected by Washington to participate in the Rose Bowl , although several teams with better records were eligible . Both Cornell and Yale finished the season with an undefeated 8 – 0 record . Eleven teams finished with only one loss , including Furman ( 10 – 1 ) , Notre Dame ( 9 – 1 ) , and the Virginia Military Institute ( VMI ) ( 9 – 1 ) .

 The Washington Huskies entered the 1924 Rose Bowl with a record of eight wins and one loss ( 8 – 1 ) under coach Enoch Bagshaw . Washington opened their season with victories over teams from the battleships Mississippi and New York ; because these teams did not represent colleges , they were not considered an official part of Washington 's schedule . Washington 's first official game ended with a 34 – 0 shutout of Willamette , which was followed by four more shutouts . Washington 's next game was a 26 – 14 victory over PCC opponent Montana — the first points Washington allowed all season . The squad 's following game was their sole loss : a 9 – 0 shutout by conference opponent California . Washington finished the regular season with two straight wins over conference opponents , including a victory in the Apple Cup over Washington State .

 The 1924 Rose Bowl was the first meeting between Navy and Washington , and was the first bowl game that either team participated in . The competitors were announced on November 30 , 1923 , and the teams arrived for the bowl in mid @-@ December , holding practices until the evening before the game . Heavy rain fell the night before the competition ; Bagshaw said , " Wet weather will not bother us " , and Folwell said , " My men will know what to do in the mud and will be there doing it " . However , because of the wet conditions , several football critics predicted that Washington would have a slight advantage in the game due to their larger size . It was estimated that 52 @,@ 000 people would attend the game . For the first time , the participating teams were responsible for ticket sales , and as a result only 40 @,@ 000 people actually attended ; a large number of tickets were sold to a navy fleet which was called to service on December 31 , the day before the game . The competition was the first Rose Bowl to be broadcast on radio , and was aired by a local Pasadena station .

 During the 1923 football season , the Navy Midshipmen outscored their opponents 133 – 43 , led by quarterback Ira McKee , who threw several touchdown passes throughout the year . Navy 's other offensive strong point was running back Carl Cullen , who ran for several hundred yards during the season . The Navy defense was considered weak by football critics , with an average player weight 10 pounds ( 4 @.@ 5 kg ) less than that of Washington . Navy 's defense had stopped running plays successfully during the regular season , but had trouble defending pass plays . Navy 's special teams were considered by critics to be decent , about even with those of Washington .

 The Washington Huskies had outscored their opponents 203 – 37 during the regular season , excluding the games against New York and Mississippi . Washington 's running backs , George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau , led their offense during the season , each gaining several hundred rushing yards . However , Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee , and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl . The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy , being much larger on average . Washington 's defense had been very effective during the regular season , holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once . Washington 's special teams were considered to be average .

 The kickoff for the Rose Bowl was originally scheduled for 2 : 00 p.m. on January 1 , 1924 , but the night before the game , a meeting of the Rose Bowl organization rescheduled the kickoff time to 2 : 16 p.m. the same day . This was likely due to poor field conditions caused by the previous night 's rain . The opening ceremonies were the most elaborate of any bowl game up to that time , with numerous events held . Navy admiral Samuel Shelburne Robison received an admiral 's salute from Navy 's band when he took his seat . The Navy band and the color guard of the marines performed the National Anthem , then the marine color guard hoisted the U.S. flag over the field . Both teams ' mascots were walked around the field before the kickoff . The Tournament of Roses predicted that tickets would be sold out by the day of the game , but actual ticket sales were much lower than they had hoped . Still , sales were higher than those of several previous competitions .

 The game began at the rescheduled time , with a temperature of 52 ° F ( 11 ° C ) and the field still wet . Because of the playing conditions , running plays were ineffective , which caused problems for the Washington offense . Navy instead used passing plays , which the Washington defense had trouble stopping . Navy was driving down to the 22 @-@ yard line of Washington when the first quarter ended . Navy controlled the first quarter , completing all six passing attempts and holding the Washington offense to under 100 yards gained . 
 On their first play of the second quarter , Navy scored a touchdown on a pass play from Ira McKee to Carl Cullen . McKee kicked the extra point for Navy , giving them a 7 – 0 lead . In an attempt to trick Washington , Navy tried an onside kick on the next play , but Washington recovered the ball . After two short running plays , Washington quarterback Fred Abel completed a 23 @-@ yard pass to running back Kinsley Dubois , bringing Washington inside the 25 @-@ yard line . On the next play , running back George Wilson ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown . Washington 's kicker converted the extra point to tie the game at 7 – 7 . After several drives from each team that did not result in further scoring , Navy completed a 57 @-@ yard pass down to the Washington eight @-@ yard line . Two plays later , Ira McKee ran the ball in from two yards out for a touchdown , then afterward converted the extra point . The first half ended with Navy leading by 14 – 7 , having completed all 11 passes they attempted .

 Both teams ' defenses controlled the third quarter , allowing no points to be scored . Navy 's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion , which came on his fourteenth attempt . Washington 's offense had little success in the third quarter , being held to only a few yards gained and turning the ball over once . In the fourth quarter , after several unsuccessful drives by each team , Navy made a major error . After being stopped on their own 26 @-@ yard line , Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation , and the center snapped the ball over the punter 's head . The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten @-@ yard line . Washington lost two yards in three plays , and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12 @-@ yard line . Washington stacked their offensive line , allowing their left guard , James Bryan , to become an eligible receiver . Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan , who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown . Washington 's kicker then converted the extra point , tying the game at 14 . 
 Navy received the ball from Washington and began to throw it erratically . After gaining several yards , Ira McKee threw an interception near midfield . On the next play , Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson , who was tackled on the Navy 20 @-@ yard line after gaining 30 yards . Washington brought out their placekicker , Leonard <unk> , to kick a 32 @-@ yard field goal , which would have won them the game . <unk> kicked the ball about a yard short of the right upright , giving the ball back to Navy with the game still tied . A few plays later the game ended in a 14 – 14 tie .

 For his performance in the 1924 Rose Bowl , Navy quarterback Ira McKee was awarded Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) honors . McKee completed 16 of 20 passes for a total of 175 yards , including one pass for a touchdown . McKee also had 85 rushing yards on twelve attempts . Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game 's Ironman Award , though he had little effect on the game . Against the urging of his coaches , Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee . He left near the end of the game , and was later discovered to have broken his previously unaffected leg in multiple places . 
 Navy 's McKee threw for a perfect 11 of 11 passes during the first half , but completed just five of nine attempts during the second half . Two of these incompletions were interceptions . McKee <unk> Washington 's Fred Abel by 110 yards . Carl Cullen was McKee 's main receiver for the game , catching ten passes from him , one of which was taken for a touchdown . The other six passes were caught by other receivers . On the ground , Cullen rushed for the most yards of any player , gaining 102 throughout the course of the game . McKee was Navy 's key runner , gaining 85 yards . Cullen , McKee , fullback Alan Shapley , and other team members rushed for a total of 187 yards during the game . McKee completed both extra point attempts , and the squad 's punter kicked five times , for an average distance of 33 @.@ 8 yards . 
 Abel attempted eight passes during the game , and completed just three for a total of 65 yards . Of Abel 's five incompletions , two were interceptions . Kinsley Dubois caught two of Abel 's completed passes , amassing 53 receiving yards . Guard James Bryan caught the other , a 12 @-@ yard touchdown pass . George Wilson led Washington in rushing yards , gaining 87 over the course of the game , and scoring Washington 's only rushing touchdown . Kinsley Dubois came next , gaining 30 yards , followed by Abel , with 20 . The remainder of the team 's 137 rushing yards were amassed by others , including Tesreau . Washington 's kicker Leonard <unk> was two for two on extra points , but missed his only field goal attempt . Washington punted nine times , averaging 33 yards per attempt .

 The tie gave Washington an 8 – 1 – 1 record for the 1923 season , the second best in school history up to that point . It remained behind the 1916 season , when the squad went 6 – 0 – 1 . Navy 's record went to 5 – 1 – 3 , a slight improvement from the previous year , when the team went 5 – 2 . It became Navy 's eighth straight winning season . 
 Washington went 8 – 1 – 1 in the 1924 season , remaining under the direction of coach Enoch Bagshaw . The team was invited to the 1926 Rose Bowl after completing an undefeated 11 – 0 – 1 1925 season . They lost the game to the Alabama Crimson Tide by a score of 20 – 19 . Washington finished the 1920s with an overall record of 65 – 26 – 6 ; Bagshaw coached the team for every season except 1920 , when they were under the leadership of Stub Allison . Navy finished the 1924 season with a 2 – 6 record , ending their number of consecutive winning seasons at eight . The Navy football team was not invited to participate in another bowl game until 1955 , when the " team named desire " , so named due to coach Eddie <unk> comparing the squad to the play A Streetcar Named Desire , defeated the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl 21 – 0 . Navy finished the 1920s with a record of 55 – 22 – 8 ; nine of the ten seasons ended in winning records . Navy 's coach , Bob Folwell , left the team after the 1924 season , to be replaced by Jack Owsley . Navy and Washington have since met five times , with Washington currently leading the series 3 – 2 – 1 . 
 Because the 1924 Rose Bowl and several later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales , the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the southern end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field . The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales . The strategy has been used since , with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition .

 = Forglen House = 
 Forglen House is a mansion house that forms the centrepiece of the Forglen estate in the parish of Forglen , northwest of Turriff , Aberdeenshire , in the northeast of Scotland . The lands were given to the abbots of the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion before 1211 and the Monymusk Reliquary was held there . The original castle , built around 1346 , was replaced by a vernacular harled house that was later extended . Significant development of the estate began when it was acquired by the family of Lord Banff and they started the work of landscaping and planting trees . It became their main family seat during the 18th century . After the death of William Ogilvy , the eighth and final Lord Banff , the estate passed by marriage to the Abercromby baronets who continued to enhance the property and maintained it as their main residence . Sir Robert Abercromby , 5th Baronet commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect , John Smith to design the present house in 1839 . 
 Forglen House was sold by the Abercromby family in 1974 but remains in private ownership . It is not open to the public , although access to the grounds is available and some cottages can be hired as holiday lets , including one of the lodge houses . 
 The mansion is a Category A listed building and several other structures within the estate , including the stables and a gothic @-@ style mausoleum , are Category B listed . The gardens are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland as outstanding in most sections . 
 = = History = = 
 The estate of Forglen ( <unk> Gleann , meaning " the hollow of the vale " in Gaelic ) was one of the parcels of land added to the property of the abbots at the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion prior to 1211 . Charters indicate the Monymusk Reliquary or <unk> was probably held at Forglen and the tenants were required to ride under the standard of the Arbroath abbots if called to defend king and kingdom . Forglen remained under the Abbey 's feudal superiority until the superiority passed to the Marquis of Hamilton in 1608 . Thirty @-@ nine years later , in 1641 , the feudal superior was William Murray , 1st Earl of Dysart and then , in 1642 , it was the <unk> of Panmure . 
 The first holders of the Forglen land detailed in the charters are Sir Thomas of Monymusk and then his son , Malcolm , is listed in the 1315 charter . Malcolm was probably succeeded by a son , John , who died by 1387 . The following generations produced no male heirs so the land was inherited by daughters . Alexander Irvine of Drum raised a successful <unk> ( writ ) mort d 'ancestor at a specially arranged court in Aberdeen on 24 January 1414 claiming the lands of Forglen . The session was overseen by the <unk> of the Arbroath abbots and held in the house of Alexander Stewart , Earl of Mar , a known supporter of the Irvine family who had fought alongside him in France and at the Battle of Harlaw , just north of Inverurie . The land continued in Irvine family ownership until 1624 when they sold it to the <unk> of <unk> . George Ogilvy , who later became Lord Banff , acquired Forglen in 1637 . 
 The Ogilvy family were staunch Royalists and their properties , including Forglen , came under attack by the Covenanter forces led by General Robert Monro in 1640 . The principal family seat at the time was Inchdrewer Castle and appears to have remained as the main residence until around 1713 when George Ogilvy , 3rd Lord Banff died in a fire there . Sir Alexander Ogilvy , 1st Baronet was the second son of George Ogilvy , 2nd Lord Banff and is described in a 1702 ratification charter signed by Queen Anne as " Alexander Ogilvy of Forglen " . He assumed the title of Lord Forglen after his appointment as a Senator of the College of Justice in 1706 . 
 Forglen became the main family residence of the Ogilvy family during the 18th century and marked the onset of significant development of the estate . The 7th Lord Banff , Alexander , who inherited the estate from his grandfather in 1727 , began planting trees and organising plantations . He died at Forglen on 1 December 1771 . As Alexander 's eldest son , also named Alexander , had pre @-@ deceased him , his second son , William , inherited and became the 8th Lord Banff . William , a former army captain who served under the Duke of York , continued the development of the estate until his death at Forglen on 4 June 1803 . The lands were then inherited by William 's sister , Lady Jane Abercromby , who had married Sir George Abercromby of Birkenbog and the peerage of Lord Banff became dormant . 
 The Abercromby baronets owned a significant amount of property in Ireland , as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from John Anderson in the early 19th century . By 1814 Forglen was used as the main family seat of the Abercromby family ; in 1877 they also acquired Dunlugas House , which was sited on the other side of the River Deveron . Lady Jane Abercromby 's son , Sir Robert Abercromby , 5th Baronet , continued to enhance the grandeur of the estate policies by commissioning the building of a new mansion and several other buildings . 
 During the Second World War Forglen was one area that had an Auxiliary Unit Patrol . Auxiliary Units were a top @-@ secret resistance organisation formed down the entire eastern side of the UK . If Germany ever invaded , the patrol would go into hiding in an Operational Base . When the invasion was one to two weeks old , and things settled down , the patrol would come out at night and undertake guerilla warfare . Members of the patrols were trained as explosives experts and were well armed compared to the conventional British Army . Research by Coleshill Auxiliary Research Team has identified the patrol members and an approximate location of the operational base in the estate . 
 Robert Alexander Abercromby , the 9th Abercromby baronet , died at home on 19 October 1972 and the estate was marketed for sale in 1974 . In 2007 it was owned by Tristan Russell and his family who had acquired it sometime before 1994 .

 The original residence at Forglen , on the left bank of the River Deveron , was constructed around 1346 . The first structure was probably a castle but was replaced with a vernacular harled house , which had a tower wing extension erected during the late 18th @-@ century . In 1839 , when Sir Robert Abercromby commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect John Smith to build the present mansion , the old house was demolished but some materials were salvaged and used in the new house . The mansion was constructed over the footprint of the previous structure . Armorial panels and inscriptions from the ancient castle were preserved and set into an octagonal tower . 
 The cost of building the new mansion was £ 16 @,@ 000 , equivalent to about £ 1 @.@ 4 million as of 2012 . Architectural historian Charles McKean likened the central tower and gatehouse to the style of Robert <unk> and described the mansion house design as an " Elizabethan Gothic confection " that had " all the romantic aspirations of the early 19th century poured into it " . The mansion house was designated a Category A listed building by Historic Scotland on 22 February 1972 .

 Based on a courtyard house layout , externally the harled <unk> rubble mansion is a combination of Elizabethan and Jacobean ( or Gothic ) design , similar to Smith 's work at <unk> . A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high . Within the back of the courtyard , circular towers enclose the service stairways .
