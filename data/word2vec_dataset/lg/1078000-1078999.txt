 Badger Pass Ski Area was established in 1935 . The 9 @-@ hole Wawona Golf Course opened in June 1918 in a meadow adjacent to the Wawona Hotel . A golf course was later built near the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite Valley , but was removed and converted into a meadow in 1981 .

 Introduced animals and diseases had impacted the park area by the late 19th century . Galen Clark noted in the mid @-@ 1890s that native grasses and flowering plants in Yosemite Valley had been reduced in number by three @-@ quarters . 
 White pine blister rust , a fungal disease that infects conifer trees , was accidentally introduced in British Columbia in 1910 and had reached California by the 1920s . It has since infected many sugar pine trees in the Yosemite area . The rust is managed by removing plants belonging to the <unk> genus , which act as carriers of the fungus . 
 Trout were introduced in Yosemite streams and lakes to promote fishing . Tadpole predation by the introduced fish reduced frog populations . Lakes and streams are no longer stocked in the park . 
 Current park managers focus on controlling nine high @-@ priority invasive plant species of noxious weeds : yellow star @-@ thistle ( Centaurea solstitialis ) ; spotted knapweed ( Centaurea maculosa ) ; Himalayan blackberry ( Rubus armeniacus ) ; bull thistle ( Cirsium vulgare ) ; velvet grass ( Holcus lanatus ) ; cheat grass ( Bromus tectorum ) ; French broom ( Genista <unk> ) ; Italian thistle ( <unk> <unk> ) ; and perennial <unk> ( <unk> latifolium ) . In 2008 , the park began to use the herbicides glyphosate and <unk> to augment manual methods to manage the most threatening plants .

 Brown bears , also called grizzlies , featured prominently in Miwok mythology and were the top predators in the region until the 1920s , when they became locally extinct . A sketch of a Yosemite grizzly by Charles <unk> adorns the flag of California . 
 American black bears were a common attraction by the 1930s , but in 1929 alone 81 people required treatment for bear @-@ related injuries . Troublesome bears were marked with white paint before being relocated to other parts of the park , and repeat offenders were killed . Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940 , but the Park Service continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps ; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972 . Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage . 
 To supplement their incomes , the rangers trapped predators such as coyote , fox , lynx , mountain lion , and wolverine for their furs , a practice that survived until 1925 . Predator control continued however ; 43 mountain lions were killed in Yosemite by the state lion hunter in 1927 . Cooper 's hawk and sharp @-@ shinned hawk were hunted to local extinction . 
 Bighorn sheep , which were driven locally extinct through hunting and disease , have been reintroduced in the east of the park . The Park Service and the Yosemite Fund have also helped peregrine falcons and great gray owls to re @-@ establish themselves . Tule elk , which had been hunted almost to extinction , were housed in a pen in Yosemite before being moved to the Owens Valley in eastern California . 
 = Wilt Chamberlain 's 100 @-@ point game = 
 Wilt Chamberlain set the single @-@ game scoring record in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) by scoring 100 points for the Philadelphia Warriors in a 169 – 147 win over the New York Knicks on March 2 , 1962 , at Hershey Sports Arena in Hershey , Pennsylvania . It is widely considered one of the greatest records in basketball . Chamberlain set five other league records that game including most free throws made , a notable achievement , as he was regarded as a poor free throw shooter . The teams broke the record for most combined points in a game ( 316 ) . That season , Chamberlain averaged a record 50 @.@ 4 points per game , and he had broken the NBA single @-@ game scoring record ( 71 ) earlier in the season in December with 78 points . The third @-@ year center had already set season scoring records in his first two seasons . In the fourth quarter , the Knicks began fouling other players to keep the ball away from Chamberlain , and they also became deliberate on offense to reduce the number of possessions for Philadelphia . The Warriors countered by committing fouls of their own to get the ball back . 
 The game was not televised , and no video footage of the game has been recovered ; there are only audio recordings of the game 's fourth quarter . The NBA was not yet a major sports league and struggled to compete against college basketball . The attendance at this game was around half of capacity , and there were no members of the New York press at the game . 
 = = Prologue = = 
 Chamberlain was in his third season in the NBA , having set season scoring records in each of his first two seasons with 37 @.@ 6 and then 38 @.@ 4 points per game . Frank McGuire , the Warriors ' new coach , started the season vowing to get the ball to Chamberlain " two @-@ thirds of the time . " Sports Illustrated wrote that McGuire 's " eventual effect may be to measurably change the character of professional basketball from the brawling , hustling , cigar @-@ in @-@ the @-@ face and eye @-@ on @-@ the @-@ till game it has been for decades to the major league sport which it longs and deserves to be . " He was determined to play Chamberlain every minute of every game ; the 7 @-@ foot @-@ 1 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 16 m ) and 260 @-@ pound ( 120 kg ) center had missed only eight minutes and 33 seconds that season due to disqualification in a game from technical fouls . In three earlier games that week , Chamberlain had scored 67 , 65 , and 61 points respectively , giving him an already @-@ record 15 times scoring 60 or more points in his career . He was closing in on 4 @,@ 000 points for the season , needing 237 more ; no other player had ever scored 3 @,@ 000 points at that point . On December 8 , 1961 , in a triple overtime game versus the Los Angeles Lakers , he set a new NBA record by scoring 78 points , breaking the record of 71 previously set by Elgin Baylor . Legendary Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn often told the story that after the game , he asked Baylor if it bothered him that Chamberlain had an extra 15 minutes to break the record . According to Hearn , Baylor said he wasn 't concerned because " someday that guy is going to score 100 " . Rival center Bill Russell predicted , " [ Chamberlain ] has the size , strength , and stamina to score one hundred some night . " In a high school game in 1955 , Chamberlain had scored 90 points in a 123 – 21 victory . The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote , " Chamberlain might have hit 100 if he had played the entire 32 minutes . " 
 Before Chamberlain , the most dominant big man in the NBA was 6 @-@ foot @-@ 10 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 08 m ) George Mikan . In November 1950 , the Fort Wayne Pistons held the ball for minutes at a time without shooting to limit the impact of the Minneapolis Lakers ' Mikan . The Pistons attempted 13 shots in the game , and won 19 – 18 . NBA President Maurice Podoloff said , " In our game , with the number of stars we have , we of necessity run up big scores . " In the 1950 – 51 season , teams averaged just above 80 points per game . The NBA introduced the 24 @-@ second shot clock in 1954 , and league scoring and attendance increased . By the 1961 – 62 season , teams were averaging 119 points each game . Chamberlain that season was one of 37 black players in the league , the NBA having started integration of blacks in 1950 . With their emergence , the NBA game was stylistically being played faster and above the rim . Many of the league 's great players were black , and blacks believed they were limited by a league quota of four black players per team . Critics suggested that basketball was becoming uninteresting with taller players dominating . Warriors teammate Joe Ruklick thought that " the attitude [ among white players in the NBA ] was , in my opinion , ' [ Chamberlain ] is a freak who will come and go . There will never be a black guy doing this again . ' " Chamberlain , nicknamed Dipper , was revolutionizing the sport with his slam dunks , nicknamed the Dipper Dunk . Traditionalists considered dunking poor sportsmanship , and their occurrence was rare . As the league 's second tallest player , Chamberlain began dunking more regularly . He was still more of a finesse player , preferring fadeaway shots and finger rolls . He rarely dunked forcefully . Teammate Paul Arizin believed Chamberlain did not want to be perceived as great merely from being tall . 
 There was little advance excitement about the pending Warriors @-@ Knicks game that Friday . Only five games remained in the regular season , with the Warriors ( 46 – 29 ) in second place — eleven games behind the Boston Celtics — and the Knicks in last place . Chamberlain had spent the night before the game in New York , partying all night with a female companion before dropping her off at her home at 6 : 00 A.M. With no sleep and suffering from a hangover , he boarded the train to Philadelphia at 8 AM , met several friends at the Philadelphia train station , and had a long lunch with them , thus almost missing the team bus to Hershey . The other players were similarly bored . Warriors player York Larese said : " The biggest thrill in my life was to see that . There was nothing exciting about the Knicks playing the Warriors in Hershey . Chocolate was more exciting . " The game was played at Hershey Sports Arena , an old drafty gym originally built for ice hockey . The league occasionally played games in remote towns to attract new fans . This was the Warriors ' third " home " game of the season in Hershey , which was 85 miles ( 137 km ) from Philadelphia . The Warriors ' Tom Meschery called the arena " god @-@ forsaken place ... The town of Hershey was built around a huge chocolate factory ; everything there became permeated with the smell of chocolate . It was practically impossible to stay indoors ; people felt sick . I was just dreaming to leave the place as fast as I could . " 
 On a cold , rainy Friday night , only 4 @,@ 124 spectators paid to see the game , more to see players from the Philadelphia Eagles , the local American football team , play an exhibition basketball game against their colleagues from the Baltimore Colts before the NBA game started . The arena 's capacity was over 8 @,@ 000 , and Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb was infamous for exaggerating attendance numbers . Warriors home attendance had dropped from 7 @,@ 000 in Chamberlain 's rookie season to less than 5 @,@ 000 in this , his third , season . College basketball had started offering doubleheaders during the Great Depression to provide customers value for their money . Fans had grown accustomed to watching two games , so doubleheaders in the NBA became common . 
 The National Basketball Association was still struggling in its 16th season , not yet a major sports league and less established than college basketball . The league was hardly national with only one team west of St Louis . The NBA received low television ratings , and this game was not televised . The National Broadcast Company ( NBC ) considered not renewing the league 's television contract . No members from the New York press were present as reporters were in Florida covering spring training for the New York Yankees and the expansion New York Mets . With few in the media present , the Warriors ' publicist was tasked this night with being the stringer for the Associated Press ( AP ) , United Press International ( UPI ) , and The Philadelphia Inquirer . Only two photographers were at the game . 
 The Knicks were shorthanded with their starting center , Phil Jordon , out sick . Jordon 's illness was officially reported as influenza but it was widely suspected he was simply hung over . Jordon in an early @-@ season game had played Chamberlain even , scoring 33 points to the Warriors center 's 34 . The Knicks instead started 6 @-@ foot @-@ 10 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 08 m ) , 220 @-@ pound ( 100 kg ) , second @-@ year player Darrall Imhoff , a strong defensive player in college who led the California Golden Bears to the NCAA championship in 1959 and won a gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics . New York also had 6 @-@ foot @-@ 9 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 06 m ) , 210 @-@ pound ( 95 kg ) , backup center Cleveland Buckner , a better shooter than a defender who Chamberlain overpowered for an NBA record 28 points in one quarter two days earlier .

 = = = First three quarters = = = 
 According to McGuire , the game did not start with any game plan to get Chamberlain 100 points . After a few minutes , the Warriors led 19 – 3 , and their star center had already scored 13 points and made his first five shots . At the end of the first quarter , the Knicks trailed 42 – 26 , and in his typical style , Chamberlain had already scored 23 points , making all nine of his free throws . Free throws were the weakest part of his game , making barely more than half in his first seasons . He had started shooting free throws underhanded that season per McGuire 's suggestion . Chamberlain at that point was thinking more about a free throw shooting record than scoring a lot of points ; the NBA record was 24 free throws made in a game . Imhoff was soon benched because of foul trouble . After one foul , he snapped at the referee , " Well , why don 't you just give the guy a hundred now and we 'll all go home ! " Neither referee had ever been a lead official , and Imhoff privately wished a stronger lead was working the game . By halftime , the Warriors had lost some of their edge , but still led 79 – 68 . Chamberlain 's point total stood at 41 . The Warriors felt little excitement , as he had scored 60 or more points on 15 previous occasions . " I often came into the locker room with 30 or 35 points , therefore , 41 points was not a big deal , " Chamberlain later explained . Warriors ' Guy Rodgers at halftime said , " Let 's get the ball to Dip . Let 's see how many he can get . " McGuire agreed . 
 This simple tactic proved unstoppable . Soon , he had surpassed the 50 @-@ point barrier , causing arena speaker Dave Zinkoff to fire up the previously sleepy crowd . Chamberlain also kept his cool despite getting perpetually triple and quadruple @-@ teamed by the Knicks , who did not shy away from hard fouls to distract the center . McGuire was irate and demanded that the referees call more fouls , but Chamberlain could not be stopped . He scored another 28 points to lift his Warriors to a commanding 125 – 106 lead when the third quarter ended . His own total stood at 69 , nine shy of his previous scoring record . The Knicks ' third center , Dave Budd , who alternated with the foul @-@ troubled Imhoff at pivot , later stated that resistance was futile : " You couldn 't play [ Chamberlain ] conventionally because he was so big . The only thing you could attempt to do was either front him , and in that case they 'd try to lob it in to him , or beat him down the floor and set up where he wanted to get and force him out a couple of extra steps . The guy weighed 300 or 270 [ pounds ] , so that wasn 't easy , either . " Chamberlain now realized he could break his own 73 @-@ point scoring record ( for a 48 @-@ minute game ) or his record 78 points , set in triple overtime . 
 = = = Breaking records = = = 
 Dave Zinkoff , the public address announcer , began announcing Chamberlain 's point total after each of his baskets . With ten minutes to play in the game , Warriors forward Tom Meschery sensed the team concept breaking down . The team 's offense had shifted to getting Chamberlain the ball and then stopping and watching instead of cutting and moving without the ball . Chamberlain needed 25 points with eight minutes remaining to reach 100 , a rate equivalent to 150 points in a full game . He scored his 79th point with 7 : 51 left , breaking his own record and sending the crowd into a frenzy . The 4 @,@ 124 spectators screamed , " Give it to Wilt ! Give it to Wilt ! " After he reached 80 , the crowd yelled for 100 . Chamberlain thought , " Man , these people are tough . I 'm tired . I 've got 80 points and no one has ever scored 80 . " The Warriors continued giving Chamberlain the ball . Warrior Al Attles later explained , " We wanted that Wilt got the record , because we all liked him . " Attles himself led by example , passing up on an easy layup so that Chamberlain could score points 88 and 89 , five minutes before the end . 
 With six minutes remaining , the Knicks began intentionally fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain , keeping the ball out of the center 's hands . New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score . Effectively , they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit , willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back . Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain , who would use his size and strength to get the ball . Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4 : 15 . Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left , reciprocating the intentional foul strategy . Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five , save Chamberlain , and replaced them with bench players . The intention was to foul the Knicks , get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball . Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other . The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls , and the Knicks with 32 , and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls . 
 With 2 : 12 left , Chamberlain had 94 points , and he scored on a fadeaway for his 96th point . His next basket at 1 : 19 came off a lob pass from York Larese for a powerful dunk that was rare for Chamberlain . Gary M. Pomerantz in his book Wilt , 1962 : The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era wrote that Chamberlain 's usual " Dipper Dunk " was " a considerably less emphatic basket stuff , like a rock that barely ripples the pond . " With less than a minute left in the game , Chamberlain set up in the post . Ruklick passed to Rodgers , who passed to Chamberlain close to the basket , but he missed the shot . Ted Luckenbill rebounded and passed it back to Chamberlain , who missed again . Luckenbill again rebounded and this time passed to Ruklick , who eschewed an easy layup and instead lobbed a high pass to Chamberlain . With 46 seconds left , Chamberlain got free from the five Knicks , jumped high and put the ball into the basket to hit the century mark . Eyewitness accounts of the historic basket differ as to whether Chamberlain merely laid the ball in or actually stuffed the ball through the hoop for an alley @-@ oop slam dunk . In any event , the arena exploded in a frenzy and over 200 spectators stormed the floor , wanting to touch the hero of the night . Ruklick immediately ran to the scorer 's table to ensure that he was officially credited with the assist .

 For years , the belief was that the final 46 seconds of the game were not played after Chamberlain scored his 100th point due to the celebration on the court ; Chamberlain himself was quoted as having made that claim . However , recordings from the WCAU radio broadcast include announcer Bill Campbell resuming his play @-@ by @-@ play call after Chamberlain 's 100th point and calling the game to its conclusion . A copy of the radio broadcast of the game was only uncovered in 1988 . WCAU 's original game tape had been recorded over by one of its engineers , a standard practice in those days . However , a Philadelphian had recorded with a Dictaphone part of Campbell 's coverage in the fourth quarter , but only the Warriors possessions . Two years later , a reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape of Campbell 's entire fourth quarter call surfaced ; Jim Trelease , then a college student at the University of Massachusetts , had recorded a 3 a.m. re @-@ broadcast of the fourth quarter of the game . The NBA merged the reel @-@ to @-@ reel with the Dictaphone tape , which also included a short postgame show . German sports journalist Gunter Bork specified that the interruption resulting from Chamberlain 's 100th point lasted for nine minutes , after which play continued . 
 Over the years , Harvey Pollack , who at the time was in charge of publicity and statistics for the Warriors , has given conflicting statements on the question . In a 1992 book , he was twice quoted as saying that the game ended with 46 seconds remaining . But in a 2002 interview quoted by Chamberlain biographer Robert Cherry , Pollack said that the last 46 seconds were played , and that Chamberlain just stood in the middle circle , waiting for the game to end and not wanting to touch the ball , as " 100 sounded better than 102 " . The game 's official box score notes that Warrior Joe Ruklick missed two free throws after the break . Ruklick said he planned to miss the second free throw in hopes that Chamberlain might rebound it and get 102 points . 
 The radio postgame show reported the Warriors defeating the Knicks 169 – 150 . However , the official scorer 's report recorded the game as 169 – 147 , a discrepancy that has never been explained . Chamberlain made 36 of 63 field @-@ goals and 28 of 32 free throws , the latter a far better rate than his roughly 50 % career average . In two earlier games at Hershey that season , Chamberlain had made a combined 27 of 38 free throws , 71 percent . The basket rims at the arena were aged , flimsy , and forgiving . Balls would bounce off of typical firm rims , whereas balls near the rim in Hershey were apt to get a good roll and fall in . Playing all 48 minutes of the game , Chamberlain set NBA records for field goals attempted ( 63 ) and made ( 36 ) , free throws made ( 28 ) , most points in a quarter ( 31 ) , and half ( 59 ) . He averaged 73 points in four games that week , exceeding 60 in all of them . 
 Rodgers finished with a game @-@ high 20 assists and later said : " It was the easiest game ever for me to get assists , all I had to do was pass it to Wilt . " Attles was a defensive specialist who rarely scored , yet went 8 – 8 from the field and hit his single free throw . He later lamented , " In the game where I literally couldn 't miss , Wilt had to go out and score 100 . " 
 The Warriors and Knicks combined for a record 316 points . Philadelphia fell short of the Boston Celtics ' then @-@ record of 173 points in a game . It was not uncommon for late @-@ season NBA games to feature little defense . Celtics guard Bob Cousy said that the level of play in the NBA decreased as the season progressed , and " defenses are out of gas " by the end of the season . 
 The following night , Chamberlain got permission to travel back to New York with three Knicks players . According to Cherry , Chamberlain drifted in and out of sleep and got a kick overhearing the New York players talk about the " S.O.B. who scored 100 points on us " . On March 4 , the Warriors played the Knicks again in Madison Square Garden , and Imhoff got a standing ovation for " holding " Chamberlain to 58 points . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The record was not highly anticipated like the four @-@ minute mile had been . In Philadelphia , there was little fanfare in The Philadelphia Inquirer or The Philadelphia Bulletin , which both had a box on the front page announcing the achievement with a story in the sports section . Philadelphia Daily News had no mention on its cover . The Bulletin wrote , " Thus was fulfilled a prophecy made the first time the magnificent 7 ' 1 " scoring star of the Warriors played a game in the National Basketball Association three years ago . " New York City papers ran stories from the news agencies . The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune ran the AP story on pages 14 and 11 , respectively . The New York Daily News ran the UPI story on page 26 . The New York Post gave prominent back @-@ page coverage to Chamberlain 's feat on Sunday . The New York Daily News on Sunday wrote , " Basketball is not prospering because most normal sized American youngsters or adults cannot identify themselves with the freakish stars ... You just can 't sell a seven @-@ foot basket stuffing monster to even the most gullible adolescent . " In his prime , Chamberlain was such a dominant scorer that his feat was mostly taken for granted . Warriors player Al Attles said that after Chamberlain 's previous record 78 @-@ point game , " It was only a matter of time until he reached 100 , you could wait for it . " Warriors coach Frank McGuire initially thought the same thing , then said , " I always thought it was inevitable that he would do it . But when he did , I stopped and thought about it . I couldn 't believe it . " 
 Chamberlain thanked his teammates . " It wouldn 't even have been close to possible without them . They wanted me to get it as much I did . " He added , " They had to do more than just give up open shots . They had to avoid fouls and pass me the ball in traffic . " Knicks ' player Richie Guerin felt the Warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside the normal flow of the game . Although effusive in his praise of Chamberlain , Guerin nonetheless estimated that if the game had played out normally , Chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100 . Chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if the Knicks " had played straight @-@ up basketball . " New York coach Eddie Donovan suggested , " The game was a farce . They would foul us and we would foul them . " The Knicks ' Naulls stated , " The game was not a fluke ... I thought it was absolutely authentic . " Imhoff said Zinkoff 's announcements did not help the Knicks ' cause . 
 Johnny Kerr of the Syracuse Nationals marveled , " How about this : He 's the world 's worst free @-@ throw shooter and he 's 28 out of 32 ! " Cousy figured the game must have gone out of control , just as when Cousy had 29 assists when the Celtics scored 173 points against Minneapolis . Boston coach Red Auerbach laughed , " He 's playing against nobody . " Bill Russell smiled and said , " The Big Fella finally did it . " In a conversation with Naulls after the game , Chamberlain predicted he would win his NBA championships but still be known for his individualism , versus Russell who was credited for making his team — the Boston Celtics — great . Two days after the historic feat , Chamberlain made a guest appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show . 
 Chamberlain finished the season with a record of 50 @.@ 4 points per game . He scored a record 4 @,@ 029 points , more than the division @-@ winning Warriors in 1947 – 48 scored as a team . He played in a record 3 @,@ 882 minutes — including every minute of 79 ( a record ) of 80 games . He averaged 48 @.@ 5 minutes per game . An NBA game is 48 minutes , but Chamberlain played in 10 overtime periods in seven games . He was second in the league in field goal percentage at <unk> and made 61 percent of his free throws , a career high . The Warriors finished the season with a 49 – 31 record . They lost in the conference finals of the playoffs to the Celtics , losing the seventh game 109 – 107 . The closest Chamberlain came again to 100 was 73 and 72 points the next season , when he also averaged 44 @.@ 8 points . The NBA in 1964 widened the lane from 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) to 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) to limit Chamberlain , and he averaged 36 @.@ 9 that season . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The anniversary of the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987 . By that time , the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average attendance of 13 @,@ 000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson , Larry Bird , and Michael Jordan . The Warriors ' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40 @,@ 000 people claimed to have seen the game , and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden . Chamberlain later stated it was one of his favorite games , but not the favorite : that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell . He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning . Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA 's all @-@ time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired , he was mostly remembered as the man who had single @-@ handedly scored 100 points in a game . Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100 @-@ point game in his final years . On a radio show commemorating the game 's 31st anniversary in 1993 , he said , " As time goes by , I feel more a part of that 100 @-@ point game . " He explained that growing up on the streets , he would have been derisively labelled a gunner , a glory @-@ hound , for attempting 63 shots . " You take that many shots on the playground , and no one ever wants you on their team again . " He said he took shots he normally would not , noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting , as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100 @-@ point game . He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him . " I know that it has been my tag . I am definitely proud of it . But it was definitely a team effort . You had to see some of the things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while . " 
 Two other participants were profoundly affected . Firstly , Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as the player who let Chamberlain score 100 on him , although he only played 20 of 48 minutes and was not on the court when it happened . On the other hand , the game immortalized little @-@ used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the man who gave Chamberlain the 100 @-@ point assist . Decades later , The New York Times interviewed Ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as " a walking footnote " of one of basketball 's greatest moments . The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain sitting on a bench , holding up a paper with a scribbled " 100 " . The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation : when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room , he took a paper and scribbled the number on it , and Associated Press photographer Paul <unk> who was there at the game ( not for professional reasons , but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat ) took the now @-@ famous photo . Cherry calls it the " ultimate picture " of Wilt Chamberlain . 
 Chamberlain 's 100 points is widely considered one of basketball 's greatest records . Decades after his record , many NBA teams did not even average 100 points as fewer field goals per game were being attempted . The closest any player has gotten to 100 points was the Los Angeles Lakers ' Kobe Bryant , who scored 81 in a 122 – 104 win over the Toronto Raptors on January 22 , 2006 . Whereas Chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win , Bryant created his own shot — mostly from the outside — in a game which the Lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until the fourth quarter . Chamberlain , playing in an era when the games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful , accounted for 59 percent of his team 's points , compared to Bryant scoring 66 percent of the Lakers ' 122 points . Bryant afterwards said Chamberlain 's record was " unthinkable ... It 's pretty exhausting to think about it . " David Thompson broke Chamberlain 's record for points in a quarter by scoring 32 in the first quarter of his 73 @-@ point game . Adrian Dantley tied the record of 28 free throws made in a regular season game on January 4 , 1984 , but through 2010 – 11 season , all of Chamberlain 's other records set that day still stand . Twenty years after the Warriors and Knicks combined for 316 points , the San Antonio Spurs defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 171 – 166 in triple overtime on March 6 , 1982 , for a total of 337 points . That record was broken quicker as the Detroit Pistons defeated the Denver Nuggets 186 – 184 ( also in triple overtime ) on December 13 , 1983 , for 370 points . 
 Pomerantz wrote in his 2005 book that the lack of videotape of the 100 @-@ point game " only added to its mystique . " For a while , NBA Commissioner David Stern 's office phone would play Campbell 's call of the 100 @-@ point basket to callers on hold : " He made it ! He made it ! He made it ! A Dipper Dunk ! " Kerry Ryman , who was 14 years old when he attended the game , claimed to have left the arena with the basketball that Chamberlain used to score his famous basket .

 = Bothia = 
 Bothia is a fungal genus in the family Boletaceae . A monotypic genus , it contains the single species Bothia castanella , a bolete mushroom first described scientifically in 1900 from collections made in New Jersey . Found in the eastern United States , Costa Rica , China , and Taiwan , it grows in a mycorrhizal association with oak trees . Its fruit body is chestnut brown , the cap is smooth and dry , and the underside of the cap has radially elongated tubes . The spore deposit is yellow @-@ brown . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown . Historically , its unique combination of morphological features resulted in the transfer of B. castanella to six different Boletaceae genera . Molecular phylogenetic analysis , published in 2007 , demonstrated that the species was genetically unique enough to warrant placement in its own genus . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The bolete was first named Boletinus <unk> by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1900 . The type was collected in New Jersey by botanist Edward Sterling . William Alphonso Murrill transferred it to Boletinellus in 1909 ; his generic concept of Boletinus included a ring on the stipe . Rolf Singer placed it in <unk> in 1938 , while Wally Snell and Esther Dick thought the species to be more appropriately placed in Xerocomus , and transferred it to that genus in 1958 . Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers moved it to Suillus in their 1964 treatment of North American species . In more recent history ( 1996 ) , it has been moved to Chalciporus . Snell and Dick 's Boletinus squarrosoides ( later moved by different authors to <unk> , Xerocomus , and Chalciporus ) is a facultative synonym ( based on a different type ) of B. castanella . In their original 1936 publication , they compared the two species , and noted that Boletinus squarrosoides differed from B. <unk> by " reddish brown color , terete <unk> , and yellow colors of the flesh , tubes and stipe . " By 1958 , after having examined additional collections , they realized that the two species were conspecific and represented morphological variations of each other . 
 In 2007 , Roy Halling and colleagues published molecular analysis showing that the species was genetically and morphologically distinct enough to deserve placement in a new Boletaceae genus , which they named Bothia . Since the original type has been lost , they designated a neotype from a collection made in Reading , Pennsylvania . Bothia is named in honor of mycologist Ernst E. Both , formerly curator emeritus of the Buffalo Museum of Science , and " promoter , facilitator and consummate student of <unk> " . The specific epithet castanella , which means " small chestnut " , refers to the color of the cap . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of Bothia castanella is convex at first before flattening out in age , reaching a diameter of 3 – 8 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) . The center of the cap sometimes acquires a shallow depression , while the margin ranges from even to wavy and irregular . The cap surface is dry and initially hairy , but becomes smooth in maturity . Its color ranges from reddish @-@ brown to burgundy @-@ brown to dark yellowish @-@ brown . The flesh is white , and , unlike several other bolete species , does not change color when bruised or injured . It is about 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) thick . 
 On the cap undersurface are the pores , which are angular to elongated and measure about 2 mm wide . The color of the pore surface is pinkish brown to tan or buff , but it becomes yellowish brown in maturity ; bruised areas turn ochre @-@ tawny . The tubes are somewhat decurrent attached to the stipe ( i.e. , running slightly down its length ) , and extend about 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) deep . The mushroom lacks any appreciable odor or taste . The dry , solid stipe measures 2 – 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) long by 0 @.@ 6 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick , and is nearly equal in thickness throughout , or slightly tapered on either end . Its surface is more or less smooth except for a reticulate ( meshed ) area at the apex . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown . 
 Fruit bodies produce a yellow @-@ brown spore print . Spores are egg @-@ shaped to ellipsoid , smooth , thin @-@ walled , and measure 8 @.@ 4 – 10 @.@ 5 by 4 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 9 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 25 – 35 by 7 – 9 µm . Cystidia are present on both the tube walls ( as pleurocystidia ) and abundantly on the edges ( as cheilocystidia ) . They are somewhat spindle @-@ shaped , sometimes with a central swelling , and measure 45 – 70 by 7 – 12 μm . Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae , and all of the hyphae are inamyloid . 
 Several chemical tests can used to help confirm identification of the mushroom . The cap cuticle turns grayish with the application of a drop of ferrous sulfate ( FeSO4 ) , and dark brown to amber with a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) . The flesh turns pale brown with KOH , and pale yellow with ammonia ( NH4OH ) . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The fruit bodies of Bothia castanella grow singly , scattered , or in groups under oak , although other trees such as birch , beech , hickory , eastern white pine , and hemlock are sometimes present in the area . Typical habitats include woods and parklands . In Asia it has been recorded growing in bamboo forests . 
 In the United States , where the fruiting season occurs from July to October , its range extends from the Carolinas north to New York and New England , and west to Minnesota . It has also been collected from Costa Rica , China , and Taiwan . 
 = 1946 Australian National Airways DC @-@ 3 crash = 
 On Sunday 10 March 1946 a Douglas DC @-@ 3 aircraft departed from Hobart , Tasmania for a flight to Melbourne . The aircraft crashed into the sea with both engines operating less than 2 minutes after takeoff . All twenty @-@ five people on board the aircraft died . It was Australia 's worst civil aviation accident . 
 An investigation panel was promptly established to investigate the accident . The panel was unable to conclusively establish the cause but it decided the most likely cause was that the automatic pilot was inadvertently engaged shortly after takeoff while the gyroscope was caged . The Department of Civil Aviation took action to ensure that operation of the automatic pilot on @-@ off control on Douglas DC @-@ 3 aircraft was made distinctive from operation of any other control in the cockpit , and that instructions were issued impressing on pilots that gyroscopes should be un @-@ caged prior to takeoff . 
 An inquiry chaired by a Supreme Court judge closely examined three different theories but found there was insufficient evidence to determine any one of them as the cause . This inquiry discovered that the captain of the aircraft was diabetic and had kept it secret from both his employer and the Department of Civil Aviation . The judge considered the captain 's diabetes and self @-@ administration of insulin probably contributed significantly to the accident but he stopped short of making this his official conclusion . 
 In his report , the judge recommended modification of the lever actuating the automatic pilot . The inquiry uncovered four irregularities in the regulation of civil aviation in Australia and the judge made four recommendations to deal with these irregularities . 
 = = The flight = = 
 The Australian National Airways aircraft registered VH @-@ AET arrived at Cambridge aerodrome at 8 : 15 pm local time , about four hours late . The return flight to Essendon Airport was scheduled to depart at 4 : 50 pm , but did not do so until 8 : 50 pm . 
 On board were 21 passengers , 3 pilots and an air hostess . Douglas DC @-@ 3 ( and C @-@ 47 ) aircraft were normally crewed by two pilots but on 10 March the cockpit of VH @-@ AET was occupied by a third person , a supernumerary pilot who was making his first flights with the airline . The weight of the aircraft was about 900 pounds ( 408 kg ) below the maximum authorised weight . The takeoff was into a light southerly wind towards Frederick Henry Bay and the sea . Observers at the aerodrome reported that the takeoff was normal , and both engines were operating perfectly . 
 Witnesses in the vicinity of Seven @-@ Mile Beach estimated that the aircraft reached a height of a little above 400 ft ( 122 m ) before turning left slightly and descending steeply . The aircraft cleared the land and crashed into Frederick Henry Bay about 300 yards ( 275 m ) beyond the water 's edge and a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the western end of Seven @-@ Mile Beach . After takeoff it flew for less than 2 minutes and covered a distance of only 2 @.@ 9 nautical miles ( 5 @.@ 4 km ) .

 = = = Wreckage = = = 
 On learning of the crash at nearby Seven @-@ Mile Beach employees of Australian National Airways raced from Cambridge aerodrome to lend assistance . About 11 : 15 pm the rear fuselage came to the surface a short distance off @-@ shore . Donald Butler , one of the employees , feared the air hostess might still be trapped in her seat in the rear of the fuselage . He took a length of rope , swam out to the floating piece of structure , attached the rope to the tailwheel and then swam back to the beach . A motor lorry was used to drag the rear fuselage ashore but there was no @-@ one inside . The right tailplane , elevator and trim tab were almost undamaged . The elevator trim tab was still set appropriately for a shallow climb after take @-@ off . 
 The wreckage was in about 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) of water . A diving pontoon was towed to the site by Royal Australian Navy ship HMAS Huon . Diver Glen Thorne found pieces of wreckage scattered over a wide area of the sea bed . The aircraft had disintegrated and there were few recognisable pieces of structure . Key parts of the wreckage were eventually recovered from the sea bed by Thorne working from the pontoon . 
 = = = Bodies = = = 
 About 4 hours after the crash the mutilated body of a woman was washed onto Seven @-@ Mile Beach . Fifteen minutes later the body of a man was washed ashore . It was later identified as the body of the captain . At intervals until 6 : 30 am another 5 bodies were washed ashore . The next day , another 3 bodies were recovered . The bodies were badly mutilated and either naked or clad only in vestiges of underclothing , indicating the severity of the impact with the water . One body was missing a leg . A head , severed from its body , was recovered in the vicinity . 
 The bodies of 21 of the 25 people on board were eventually recovered from the beaches around Frederick Henry Bay . The remaining 4 bodies were never found . One body was found on the beach at Sandford , about 5 miles from the site of the crash . The body of the supernumerary pilot was not identified until 19 days after the accident . 
 Two years after the accident , a human thigh @-@ bone was found on Seven @-@ Mile Beach . Police believed the bone came from one of the bodies never recovered . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The director @-@ general of Civil Aviation promptly established a panel to investigate the accident . The panel was chaired by John Watkins , Superintendent of Airworthiness & Aeronautical Engineering . After examining the wreckage recovered from the sea bed the panel was satisfied both engines were operating at high power at the time of impact and there was no pre @-@ existing structural or mechanical defect that would explain the crash . 
 The panel arranged for the witnesses at Seven Mile Beach to observe a series of flights by a de Havilland Dragonfly taking off from Cambridge aerodrome , and to identify which flight best represented what they saw on the night of the crash . This exercise established that VH @-@ AET reached a maximum height of about 425 feet ( 130 m ) . The panel members were satisfied that , after take @-@ off , VH @-@ AET achieved a normal climb of about 325 feet per minute ( 1 @.@ 6 m / s ) and a gradient of about 1 ¾ % before suddenly commencing a descent of about 17 ½ % . Calculations showed that the aircraft 's descent reached about 4 @,@ 000 feet per minute ( 20 m / s ) and its speed about 160 mph ( 257 km / hour ) before it struck the water . 
 The panel contemplated 25 possible causes of the accident . In its interim report to the Director @-@ General on 20 March 1946 the panel reduced these possible causes to 3 : 
 = = = Automatic pilot = = = 
 The control box for the automatic pilot was recovered from the wreckage . The control knob for its gyroscope was in the caged position and the <unk> warning flag was in view even though the control box carried a placard stating the gyro must be <unk> before takeoff . The automatic pilot 's speed valve unit was also recovered ; it showed that the three valves were open in positions indicating the unit was operating at the time of the crash . The investigation panel proposed that the automatic pilot might have been engaged at a height of about 400 ft ( 120 m ) causing the aircraft to descend swiftly into the sea . Engagement could have occurred inadvertently when one of the pilots intended to select fuel cross @-@ feed ON . The operating levers for fuel cross @-@ feed and automatic pilot were the same shape , the same height above the cockpit floor , and about 12 inches ( 305 mm ) apart on the cockpit control console . 
 No @-@ one on the ground at Cambridge aerodrome saw the pilot who occupied the co @-@ pilot seat prior to takeoff . The panel proposed that the captain may have asked the supernumerary pilot to occupy the co @-@ pilot seat during the flight to Essendon Airport . The supernumerary pilot was on his third flight with the company and had no prior experience flying the C @-@ 47 or DC @-@ 3 . The panel considered that if the supernumerary pilot had occupied the co @-@ pilot seat , and if the captain had called for fuel cross @-@ feed to be turned ON to deal with a fuel pressure problem in one engine , it was possible the supernumerary pilot 's lack of familiarity with the DC @-@ 3 cockpit caused him to inadvertently engage the automatic pilot . 
 The panel used a DC @-@ 3 aircraft with a cockpit identical to that of VH @-@ AET to carry out four flight tests with the gyroscope caged . When the automatic pilot was engaged the control wheel moved forward so strongly it was torn from the pilot 's hands and he could only regain control by use of both hands and significant force . Initial tests showed that when the pilot was unprepared , up to 600 ft ( 183 m ) could be lost before he identified the problem and disengaged the automatic pilot . On the fourth test the pilot restricted the height loss to 300 ft ( 91 m ) . The panel considered the most likely explanation of the accident was inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot with the gyroscope caged . 
 = = = Others = = = 
 Bird strike – A fortnight after the accident the mutilated body of a large bird was found on Seven @-@ Mile Beach . It was considered the bird , which had a wingspan of about 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , may have struck the aircraft cockpit , distracting or incapacitating the pilots . Alternatively , the bird could have struck the aircraft 's pitot tube , damaging it and causing inaccuracy in the airspeed indicator . 
 Pilot illness – The investigation panel considered the pilot may have collapsed suddenly . The panel used a DC @-@ 3 aircraft to carry out tests in which one of the pilots simulated falling forward onto the aircraft controls . They found it difficult to fall forward sufficiently to exert a significant force on the elevator control , and the other pilot had no difficulty keeping the aircraft in a climbing attitude . 
 = = = Report = = = 
 The investigation panel 's report to the Director @-@ General made recommendations including : 
 operation of the automatic pilot on @-@ off control on Australian @-@ registered DC @-@ 3 aircraft should be made distinctive from operation of any other control in the cockpit . 
 instructions should be issued impressing on pilots that gyroscopes should be un @-@ caged prior to takeoff . 
 the practice of using passenger @-@ carrying flights to give experience to pilots under instruction should be reviewed urgently . 
 = = Inquiry = = 
 On 24 April 1946 the Minister for Civil Aviation , Arthur Drakeford , appointed Mr Justice Simpson of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to conduct an inquiry into the accident . Counsel assisting the inquiry was to be Henry Winneke . 
 Justice Simpson examined the evidence in detail , including the evidence put forward in support of the 3 most likely causes identified by the investigation panel . He eventually found there was insufficient evidence to consider any of the theories proved . Justice Simpson 's report of the findings of his inquiry was made public by the Minister on 11 June 1946 . Simpson said he was satisfied the accident was not caused by failure of any part of the aircraft 's structure , its engines or its controls ; or failure to remove any of the flight @-@ control clamps prior to takeoff . 
 = = = Automatic pilot = = = 
 John Watkins , chairman of the investigation panel , told the inquiry the evidence supporting the theory that inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot caused the accident was that its control box was recovered from the wreckage and its gyroscope was still caged . The speed valve unit was also recovered and it indicated the automatic pilot was operating at the time of impact . <unk> engagement of the automatic pilot with the gyroscope caged could explain a sudden descent by a DC @-@ 3 . Watkins also said the panel 's report to the Director @-@ General made several recommendations and they were already being actioned . These included one recommendation that operation of the automatic pilot on @-@ off control on Australian @-@ registered DC @-@ 3 aircraft should be made distinctive from operation of any other control in the cockpit . 
 The Flight Superintendent of Australian National Airways , Captain <unk> Taylor , told the inquiry he did not believe the accident could have been caused by inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot . He said if that happened , the pilot could dis @-@ engage it before losing 50 ft ( 15 m ) in altitude . 
 The Chief Technical Adviser of Australian National Airways , Thomas Lawrence , told the inquiry he did not think there was any evidence to indicate the automatic pilot was engaged at the time of the accident . He thought the crash was the result of a combination of factors . 
 = = = Bird @-@ strike = = = 
 Michael Sharland , honorary ornithologist to the Tasmanian Museum , told the Inquiry he had been shown the mutilated remains of a dead bird and had identified it as a gannet , a fishing bird known to dive on its prey from heights from 50 ft to 500 ft . He was unable to say how the bird had died but said its injuries suggested it had been in a collision with a heavy , fast @-@ moving body . Captain <unk> Taylor said he thought a bird @-@ strike on the aircraft 's pitot tube could have caused the crash . 
 Justice Simpson rejected the bird @-@ strike theory , saying the descent of the aircraft was caused by forward @-@ movement of the control column in the cockpit . He was unable to state what caused this movement of the control column . 
 = = = Medical = = = 
 The inquiry discovered that the chief @-@ pilot of the aircraft , Captain Thomas Spence , was diabetic and had been discharged from the RAAF in September 1941 as medically unfit . In early 1942 he applied for a commercial pilot licence but did not declare his diabetes . In a medical examination for the purpose of obtaining the licence , and at all subsequent examinations , Spence had shown no sign of diabetes . A specialist in diabetes told the Inquiry it was almost impossible to detect diabetes in a person who wished to withhold it . 
 The inquiry also received evidence that a friend had asked Spence about his diabetes in relation to his employment as a pilot . Spence had asked his friend to keep it quiet so his employment would not be jeopardised . 
 The senior route captain for Australian National Airways , Captain Douglas Way , told the inquiry he was unaware Spence was treating himself with insulin . Captain Way said he knew Spence had been discharged from the RAAF as medically unfit but Spence had told him it was a minor complaint discovered when he was in Canada and when he returned to Australia he found himself cured . 
 At a medical examination in October 1943 for renewal of his commercial pilot licence Spence told the examiner he had been in hospital with influenza and a carbuncle . The examiner did not inquire further on the matter . Investigations with Brisbane Hospital for the purpose of informing Justice Simpson revealed that Spence 's hospitalisation was for diabetic pre @-@ coma . Justice Simpson agreed that Spence had misled many people . 
 Spence was scheduled to have a medical examination on 11 March and it was considered plausible that he may have taken extra insulin to prepare himself for the examination . An overdose of insulin , or irregular doses , can distort the senses and cause the muscles to be <unk> @-@ ordinated . 
 Counsel assisting the Inquiry , Henry Winneke , advocated that the cause of the accident was Spence 's diabetes . Justice Simpson was critical of the Director @-@ General 's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department 's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident . After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence 's diabetes , Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident . 
 In Justice Simpson 's report to the Governor @-@ General he wrote that he could see much to support the theory that the most likely cause was Spence 's actions in the cockpit while he was adversely affected by insulin . However , in his report he didn 't determine that the accident had been caused by Spence 's medical condition because there was insufficient evidence to completely prove the theory . 
 = = = Irregularities = = = 
 During the court of inquiry Justice Simpson became aware of four irregularities and listed them in his report . 
 When Thomas Spence had applied for a commercial pilot licence the RAAF Director @-@ General of Medical Services had been acting as assessor for the Department of Civil Aviation . The Director @-@ General had neglected to check Spence 's RAAF medical history . 
 A medical examiner had failed to check Spence 's statement that his recent hospitalisation was due to influenza . The truth was that Spence had been suffering a serious diabetic condition . 
 VH @-@ AET was approved to carry 24 persons . On 10 March 1946 the aircraft took off with 25 persons on board – a full complement of 21 passengers , an air hostess and 3 pilots instead of the usual 2 . 
 No flare path had been lit to illuminate the runway for takeoff and any unexpected return to the aerodrome for landing . 
 = = = Recommendations = = = 
 Justice Simpson made five recommendations : 
 The practice of allowing pilots under instruction to gain experience in the cockpit of aircraft carrying passengers should be reviewed . 
 The levers that actuate the automatic pilot and the fuel cross @-@ feed should be modified so they have a different appearance . 
 A regulation should be made to prohibit taking off at night without a flare path or other runway lighting system ; and it should be compulsory for the flare path to remain lit until there is no longer a possibility the aircraft might return to the airport to land . 
 Ground engineers completing daily inspections should keep copies of their inspection records . 
 Medical examinations for issue or renewal of pilot licences should be made by doctors chosen , and paid for , by the Department of Civil Aviation .

 = HMS Boadicea ( 1908 ) = 
 HMS Boadicea was the lead ship of her class of scout cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . She led the 1st Destroyer Flotilla from completion until the ship was transferred to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in mid @-@ 1912 . A year later Boadicea was reassigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron and she spent the bulk of World War I with that squadron . The ship was present at , but did not fight in , the Battle of Jutland in mid @-@ 1916 . Boadicea was converted into a minelayer at the end of 1917 and made three sorties to lay her mines before the end of the war . She was placed in reserve after the war and taken out of service in 1920 . The ship was used for harbour service at Dartmouth until she was sold for scrap in 1926 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Designed to provide destroyer flotillas with a command ship capable of outclassing enemy destroyers with her six four @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns , Boadicea proved too slow in service from the start of her career . Her 25 @-@ knot ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) speed was barely capable of matching the speeds of the River @-@ class destroyers she led in her flotilla in 1909 and proved inadequate to match the speed of later destroyers . 
 Displacing 3 @,@ 350 long tons ( 3 @,@ 400 t ) , the ship had an overall length of 405 feet ( 123 @.@ 4 m ) , a beam of 41 feet 6 inches ( 12 @.@ 6 m ) and a deep draught of 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) . She was powered by two Parsons steam turbine sets , each driving two shafts . The turbines produced a total of 18 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam produced by 12 Yarrow boilers that burned both fuel oil and coal , and gave a maximum speed of 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . She carried a maximum of 780 long tons ( 790 t ) of coal and 189 long tons ( 192 t ) of fuel oil . Her crew consisted of 317 officers and enlisted men . 
 Her main armament consisted of six breech @-@ loading ( BL ) four @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) Mk VII guns . The forward pair of guns were mounted side by side on a platform on the forecastle , the middle pair were amidships , one on each broadside , and the two remaining guns were on the centreline of the quarterdeck , one ahead of the other . The guns fired their 31 @-@ pound ( 14 kg ) shells to a range of about 11 @,@ 400 yards ( 10 @,@ 400 m ) . Her secondary armament was four quick @-@ firing ( QF ) three @-@ pounder ( 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) ) Vickers Mk I guns and two submerged 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . During the war , four additional four @-@ inch guns were added amidships to increase her firepower . A QF three @-@ inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft gun was also added . In 1918 it was replaced by a four @-@ inch gun . 
 As a scout cruiser , the ship was only lightly protected to maximise her speed . She had a curved protective deck that was one inch ( 25 mm ) thick on the slope and 0 @.@ 5 inches ( 13 mm ) on the flat . Her conning tower was protected by four inches of armour .

 The fourth ship to bear her name in the Royal Navy , Boadicea was laid down at Pembroke Royal Dockyard on 1 June 1907 and launched on 14 May 1908 by Lady Kensington . She was the first turbine @-@ powered cruiser in the Royal Navy and was completed in June 1909 , under the temporary command of Commander Francis Leake . Captain Edward Charlton relieved Leake on 27 July and the ship became the flotilla leader of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla . Captain Vernon Haggard assumed command of the ship on 27 October 1911 and he was relieved by Captain Ernest Carey when the ship was transferred to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla on 31 July 1912 . Carey was only in command until 3 April 1913 when Captain Cecil Fox replaced him . Boadicea was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron on 5 July and Fox was relieved by Captain Louis <unk> . On 31 July 1914 , she took Vice @-@ Admiral John Jellicoe from Wick to Scapa Flow to assume command of the Grand Fleet . 
 She was assigned to the Second Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet in Scapa Flow at the start of the war . On 15 December her bridge and several crewmen were lost overboard due to severe weather in the Pentland Firth as the squadron sortied to intercept German ships bombarding ports in Yorkshire . Boadicea had to return to port for repairs . She was at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , but was assigned to a position at the rear of the squadron and did not fire her guns . She actually spotted the German fleet the night after the battle , but her report was not passed to Jellicoe for fear of giving away the position of the Grand Fleet . <unk> was relieved by Captain Algernon Candy on 8 September . The ship was relieved in the squadron by her sister ship Bellona in October 1917 and was on detached duties , probably in preparation for her conversion into a minelayer in December 1917 . Boadicea was assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron in January 1918 and she laid mines at the entrance to the Kattegat on the nights of 18 / 19 and 24 / 25 February 1918 , part of her total of 184 mines laid in three missions . The ship remained with the 4th Battle Squadron for the rest of the war . 
 After end of the war in November , the ship was relieved of her assignment with the 4th Battle Squadron and assigned to the Nore in February 1919 and placed in reserve there the following month . She was paid off on 18 February 1920 at Chatham Dockyard and was used for harbour service at Dartmouth until she was sold for scrap on 13 July 1926 to be broken up at Alloa , Rosyth .

In the 21st century , it is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle , with Minneapolis proper containing America 's fifth @-@ highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies . As an integral link to the global economy , Minneapolis is categorized as a global city . Noted for its strong music and performing arts scenes , Minneapolis is home to both the award @-@ winning Guthrie Theater and the historic First Avenue nightclub , the latter of which helped launch the career of musical icon Prince . 
 Minneapolis ' name is attributed to Charles Hoag , the city 's first schoolteacher , who combined mni , a Dakota Sioux word for water , and polis , the Greek word for city .

 = = = Sioux natives , city founded = = = 
 Dakota Sioux had long been the region 's sole residents when French explorers arrived around 1680 . For a time relations were based on fur trading . Gradually more European @-@ American settlers arrived , competing for game and other resources with the Dakota . 
 In the early 19th century , the United States acquired this territory from France . It gradually established posts here . Fort Snelling was built in 1819 by the United States Army , and it attracted traders , settlers and merchants , spurring growth in the area . The United States government pressed the Mdewakanton band of the Dakota to sell their land , allowing people arriving from the East to settle here . The Minnesota Territorial Legislature authorized present @-@ day Minneapolis as a town in 1856 on the Mississippi 's west bank . Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867 , the year rail service began between Minneapolis and Chicago . It later joined with the east @-@ bank city of St. Anthony in 1872 . 
 = = = <unk> ; lumber and flour milling = = = 
 Minneapolis developed around Saint Anthony Falls , the highest waterfall on the Mississippi River and a source of power for its early industry . Forests in northern Minnesota were exploited by the lumber industry , which operated seventeen sawmills on power from the waterfall . By 1871 , the west river bank had twenty @-@ three businesses , including flour mills , woolen mills , iron works , a railroad machine shop , and mills for cotton , paper , sashes , and planing wood . Due to the occupational hazards of milling , six local sources of artificial limbs were competing in the prosthetics business by the 1890s . The farmers of the Great Plains grew grain that was shipped by rail to the city 's thirty @-@ four flour mills . Millers have used hydropower elsewhere since the 1st century B.C. , but the results in Minneapolis between 1880 and 1930 were so remarkable the city has been described as " the greatest direct @-@ drive waterpower center the world has ever seen . " 
 A father of modern milling in America and founder of what became General Mills , Cadwallader C. Washburn converted his business from gristmills to truly revolutionary technology , including " gradual reduction " processing by steel and porcelain roller mills that were capable of producing premium @-@ quality pure white flour very quickly . Some ideas were developed by William Dixon Gray and some acquired through industrial espionage from the Hungarians by William de la Barre . Charles A. Pillsbury and C.A. Pillsbury Company across the river were barely a step behind , hiring Washburn employees to immediately use the new methods . The hard red spring wheat that grows in Minnesota became valuable ( $ .50 profit per barrel in 1871 increased to $ 4 @.@ 50 in 1874 , ) and Minnesota " patent " flour was recognized at the time as the best in the world . 
 Not until later did consumers discover the value in the bran ( which contains wheat 's vitamins , minerals and fiber ) that " Minneapolis ... millers routinely dumped " into the Mississippi . Millers cultivated relationships with academic scientists especially at the University of Minnesota . Those scientists backed them politically on many issues , for example during the early 20th century , when health advocates in the nascent field of nutrition criticized the flour " bleaching " process . At peak production , a single mill at Washburn @-@ Crosby made enough flour for 12 million loaves of bread each day , and by 1900 , 14 @.@ 1 percent of America 's grain was milled in Minneapolis . Further , by 1895 through the efforts of silent partner William Hood Dunwoody , Washburn @-@ Crosby exported four million barrels of flour a year to the United Kingdom , and when exports reached their peak in 1900 , about one third of all flour milled in Minneapolis was shipped overseas . 
 = = = Corruption , social movements , urban renewal = = = 
 Known initially as a kindly physician , Doc Ames led the city into corruption during four terms as mayor just before 1900 . The gangster Kid Cann was famous for bribery and intimidation during the 1930s and 1940s . The city made dramatic changes to rectify discrimination as early as 1886 when Martha Ripley founded Maternity Hospital for both married and unmarried mothers . 
 When the country 's fortunes turned during the Great Depression , the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging workers ' rights . A lifelong civil rights activist and union supporter , mayor Hubert Humphrey helped the city establish fair employment practices and a human relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities by 1946 . In the 1950s , about 1 @.@ 6 % of the population of Minneapolis was nonwhite . Minneapolis contended with white supremacy , participated in desegregation and the African @-@ American civil rights movement , and in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement . 
 Minneapolis was a " particularly virulent " site of anti @-@ semitism until 1950 . A hate group recruited members in the city and held meetings there around 1936 to 1938 . The Jewish Free Employment Bureau tried to help victims of economic discrimination , with limited success . Formed in 1948 , the nonsectarian Mount Sinai Hospital was a place where Jewish physicians and health professionals could practice . 
 During the 1950s and 1960s , as part of urban renewal , the city razed about 200 buildings across 25 city blocks ( roughly 40 % of downtown ) , destroying the Gateway District and many buildings with notable architecture , including the Metropolitan Building . Efforts to save the building failed but are credited with sparking interest in ( but not always succeeding in ) historic preservation in the state . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 The history and economic growth of Minneapolis are tied to water , the city 's defining physical characteristic , which was brought to the region during the last ice age ten thousand years ago . Ice blocks deposited in valleys by retreating glaciers created the lakes of Minneapolis . Fed by a receding glacier and Lake Agassiz , torrents of water from a glacial river cut the Mississippi riverbed and created the river 's only waterfall , Saint Anthony Falls , important to the early settlers of Minneapolis . 
 Lying on an artesian aquifer and flat terrain , Minneapolis has a total area of 58 @.@ 4 square miles ( 151 @.@ 3 km2 ) and of this 6 % is water . Water supply is managed by four watershed districts that correspond to the Mississippi and the city 's three creeks . Twelve lakes , three large ponds , and five unnamed wetlands are within Minneapolis . 
 The city center is located at 45 ° N latitude . The city 's lowest elevation of 686 feet ( 209 m ) is near where Minnehaha Creek meets the Mississippi River . The site of the Prospect Park Water Tower is often cited as the city 's highest point and a placard in Deming Heights Park denotes the highest elevation . A spot at 974 feet ( 297 m ) in or near Waite Park in Northeast Minneapolis , however , is corroborated by Google Earth as the highest ground .

 Minneapolis has a humid continental climate typical of the Upper Midwest . According to NOAA , Minneapolis 's annual average for sunshine is 58 % . On the Köppen climate classification , Minneapolis falls in the humid continental climate zone ( Dfa ) and is situated in USDA plant hardiness zone 4b borderline 5a . As is typical in a continental climate , the difference between average temperatures in the coldest winter month and the warmest summer month is great : 60 @.@ 1 ° F ( 33 @.@ 4 ° C ) . 
 The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events , including snow , sleet , ice , rain , thunderstorms , and fog . The highest recorded temperature was 108 ° F ( 42 ° C ) in July 1936 while the lowest was − 41 ° F ( − 41 ° C ) in January 1888 . The snowiest winter of record was 1983 – 84 , when 8 @.@ 2 feet or 98 @.@ 4 inches ( 250 cm ) of snow fell .

 = HMS Invincible ( 1907 ) = 
 HMS Invincible was a battlecruiser of the British Royal Navy , the lead ship of her class of three , and the first battlecruiser to be built by any country in the world . In the First World War she participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in a minor role as she was the oldest and slowest of the British battlecruisers present . She fired on the light cruiser Cöln , but did not hit her before Cöln was sunk by the battlecruiser Lion . During the Battle of the Falkland Islands , Invincible and her sister Inflexible sank the armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau almost without loss to themselves , despite numerous hits by the German ships . 
 She was the flagship of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron during the Battle of Jutland . The squadron had been detached from Admiral Beatty 's Battlecruiser Fleet a few days before the battle for gunnery practice with the Grand Fleet and acted as its heavy scouting force during the battle . She was destroyed by a magazine explosion during the battle after ' Q ' turret was penetrated . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Invincible was significantly larger than her armoured cruiser predecessors of the Minotaur class . She had an overall length of 567 ft ( 173 m ) , a beam of 78 @.@ 5 ft ( 23 @.@ 9 m ) , and a draft of 30 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load . She displaced 17 @,@ 250 long tons ( 17 @,@ 530 t ) at load and 20 @,@ 420 long tons ( 20 @,@ 750 t ) at deep load , nearly 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) more than the earlier ships . 
 The Invincible @-@ class ships were formally known as armoured cruisers until 1911 when they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an Admiralty order of 24 November 1911 . Unofficially a number of designations were used until then , including cruiser @-@ battleship , dreadnought cruiser and battle @-@ cruiser . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Invincible had two paired sets of Parsons turbines , each of which was housed in a separate engine @-@ room and drove an outboard and inboard shaft . The high @-@ pressure ahead and astern turbines were coupled to the outboard shafts and the low @-@ pressure turbines to the inner shafts . A cruising turbine was also coupled to each inner shaft ; these were not used often and were eventually disconnected . Her three @-@ bladed propellers were 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) in diameter on the inner shafts while the outer propellers were 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by thirty @-@ one Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers in four boiler rooms , and were designed to produce a total of 41 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 31 @,@ 000 kW ) , but reached nearly 46 @,@ 500 shp ( 34 @,@ 700 kW ) during trials in 1908 . She was designed for 25 knots ( 46 km / h ) , but reached 26 @.@ 64 knots ( 49 km / h ) during trials . 
 Invincible carried 2 @,@ 997 long tons ( 3 @,@ 045 t ) of coal , and an additional 738 long tons ( 750 t ) of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full fuel capacity , she could steam for 3 @,@ 090 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 720 km ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ) . Her electrical power was provided by four 200 kW turbo @-@ generators and motor generators with capacity of 100 kW . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Invincible carried eight BL 12 @-@ inch ( 304 @.@ 8 mm ) Mk X guns in four twin turrets . For evaluation purposes these were electrically driven <unk> and BX turrets , two each built by Vickers and Armstrongs . They proved to be a failure despite two lengthy refits in 1909 and 1911 and were converted to hydraulic power during her refit in early 1914 at the cost of £ 151 @,@ 200 . The situation was so bad during her gunnery trials in October 1908 that the captain of HMS Excellent , the Royal Navy 's chief gunnery school , described their operation in the following manner : " When the order was given to train the turret , elevate or run a gun in or out , it was only necessary to push a button , or move a switch , but the result was often a flash of blue flame which seemed to fill the turret . " 
 Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 4 in ( 102 mm ) QF Mk III guns . During 1915 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve . All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun on a high @-@ angle MKII mount at the aft end of the superstructure that was carried between October – November 1914 and from April 1915 onwards . A 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss gun on a high @-@ angle MkIc mounting with a maximum elevation of 60 ° was also mounted in November 1914 . Five 18 @-@ inch ( 450 @-@ mm ) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the Invincibles , two on each side and one in the stern . Fourteen torpedoes were carried for them . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The waterline belt was 6 inches thick roughly between the fore and aft 12 @-@ inch gun turrets , but was reduced to four inches from the fore turret to the bow , but did not extend aft of the rear turret . The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by 7 in ( 178 mm ) of armour , except for the turret roofs which used 3 in ( 76 mm ) of Krupp non @-@ cemented armour ( KNC ) . The thickness of the main deck was 1 – 2 in ( 25 – 51 mm ) and the lower deck armour was 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 in ( 38 – 64 mm ) . Mild steel torpedo bulkheads of 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms .

 The ship was built at Sir W. G. Armstrong , Whitworth & Co . , Ltd on Tyneside . She was laid down on 2 April 1906 , and launched at 3 p.m. on 13 April 1907 by Lady Allendale . On 28 December 1907 , while still fitting out , she was hit by the collier Oden , which resulted in the buckling of beams and frames in the hull and five bottom plates being stove in . She was officially completed on 16 March 1909 . On 18 March , she sailed from the Tyne to Portsmouth , where she would be commissioned . On the way , she collided with the brigantine Mary Ann , and stood by until the lifeboat John Birch arrived from Yarmouth to take the brigantine in tow . 
 = = Early career = = 
 She was commissioned into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 and participated in fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909 , the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909 , and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July . She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 in an attempt to cure the electrical problems with her turrets , but they were still unsatisfactory . Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911 , but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power . This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912 . On 17 March 1913 , she collided with the submarine HMS <unk> , but the collision was ruled the fault of the submarine . She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle @-@ worthy . 
 Her refit at Portsmouth Dockyard began in March 1914 and was interrupted by the declaration of war on Germany on 4 August . She 'd been formally recommissioned the day prior , but the turret work required another week to complete . Invincible was the first battlecruiser to be fitted with a new fire @-@ control director , but this could not be completed in the allotted time and would remain inoperable until she was refitted after the Battle of the Falkland Islands . She was declared operational on 12 August , when Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Archibald Gordon Moore , commanding the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron , hoisted his flag in her . He was ordered to the Humber , along with the battlecruiser HMS New Zealand , where he could better support the British ships patrolling the Broad Fourteens .

 Invincible 's first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight operation on 28 August 1914 . Beatty 's ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks . They turned south at full speed at 11 : 35 AM when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade estuary . The brand @-@ new light cruiser Arethusa had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers Strassburg and Cöln when Beatty 's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12 : 37 PM . Strassburg was able to duck into the mists and evade fire , but Cöln remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron . Beatty was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser Ariadne directly to his front . He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at close range ( under 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) ) . At 1 : 10 PM Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire . At this time , Invincible , trailing the main body of battlecruisers , opened fire on Cöln . She fired 18 rounds , all misses , before Beatty 's main body encountered the crippled Cöln shortly after turning north and she was sunk by two salvos from Lion .

 The West Indies Squadron of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock was destroyed by the German German East Asia Squadron commanded by Admiral Graf von Spee during the Battle of Coronel on 1 November 1914 . In response , the Admiralty ordered that a squadron be sent to destroy the Germans . The squadron , under the command of Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee , consisted of Invincible ( flag ) and Inflexible . They departed on 11 November and rendezvoused with several other cruisers under Rear Admiral Stoddard at Abrolhos Rocks , off the coast of Brazil on the 26th . They departed the following day and reached Port Stanley in the Falklands on the morning of 7 December . 
 Spee , making a leisurely voyage back to the Atlantic , wanted to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley and sent the armoured cruiser SMS Gneisenau and the light cruiser Nürnberg to see if the harbour was clear of British warships on the morning of 8 December . They were spotted at 7 : 30 AM , although the pre @-@ dreadnought Canopus , grounded in Stanley Harbour to defend the town and its wireless station , did not receive the signal until 7 : 45 . Sturdee was not expecting an engagement and most of his ships were coaling . The armoured cruiser Cornwall and the light cruiser Bristol had one or both of their engines under repair . The armed merchant cruiser Macedonian was patrolling the outer harbour entrance while the armoured cruiser Kent was anchored in the outer harbour , scheduled to relieve the Macedonian at 8 : 00 AM . The German ships were not expecting resistance and the first salvo from Canopus 's guns at 9 : 20 caused them to sheer off from their bombardment of the wireless station and fall back on Spee 's main body . 
 Sturdee 's ships did not sortie from the harbour until 9 : 50 , although they could see the retreating German ships on the southwest horizon . The Invincibles , fresh out of dry dock , had a 5 knots ( 5 @.@ 8 mph ; 9 @.@ 3 km / h ) advantage over Spee 's ships , which all had fouled bottoms that limited their speeds to no more than 20 knots ( 23 mph ; 37 km / h ) . The light cruiser SMS Leipzig lagged behind the other ships and Inflexible opened fire when the range dropped to 17 @,@ 500 yards ( 16 @.@ 0 km ) at 12 : 55 PM . Invincible opened fire shortly afterwards and both ships began straddling Leipzig as the range closed to 13 @,@ 000 yards ( 12 km ) . At 1 : 20 , Spee ordered his squadron to separate and ordered his light cruisers to turn to the southwest , while his armoured cruisers turned north east to cover their retreat . The German ships opened fire at 1 : 30 and scored their first hit at 1 : 44 when SMS Scharnhorst struck Invincible , though the shell burst harmlessly on the belt armour . Both sides fired rapidly during the first half @-@ hour of the engagement , before Sturdee opened up the distance to put his ships outside the effective range of the German guns . British gunnery was very poor , scoring only four hits out of 210 rounds fired . The primary cause was the smoke from the guns and funnels , since the British were downwind of the Germans , though one gun of Invincible 's ' A ' turret jammed at 1 : 42 and was out of action for thirty minutes . 
 Spee turned to the south in an attempt to disengage while the British had their vision obscured , but only opened the range to 17 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 km ) before his course change was spotted . The British battlecruisers gave chase at 24 knots ( 28 mph ; 44 km / h ) . Forty minutes later the British opened fire again at 15 @,@ 000 yards ( 14 km ) . Eight minutes later Spee turned again to the east to give battle . His strategy was to close the range so he could bring his 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) secondary armament into play . He was successful and the 15 cm guns were able to open fire at 3 : 00 at maximum elevation . The smoke bothered both sides , but multiple hits were scored . Those of the German ships either failed to detonate or hit armoured areas . However , Gneisenau 's starboard engine room was put out of action . Sturdee ordered his ships at 3 : 15 to cross their own wakes to gain the windward advantage . Spee turned to the northwest , as if to attempt to cross the British T , but actually to bring Scharnhorst 's undamaged starboard guns to bear as most of those on his port side were now out of action . The British continued to hit Scharnhorst and Gneisenau regularly and Scharnhorst ceased fire at 4 : 00 before capsizing at 4 : 17 with no survivors . Gneisenau had been slowed by earlier damage and was battered for another hour and a half by Inflexible and Invincible at ranges down to 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) . Despite the damage her crew continued to fire back until she ceased firing at 4 : 47 , her ammunition exhausted . Sturdee was ready to order ' Cease fire ' at 5 : 15 when an ammunition hoist was freed up and she made her last shot . The British then pounded her until 5 : 50 , after her captain had given the order to scuttle her at 5 : 40 . She slowly capsized at 6 : 00 and the British were able to rescue 176 men from the freezing waters . Invincible had fired 513 12 @-@ inch shells during the battle , but had been hit twenty @-@ two times . Two of her bow compartments were flooded and one hit on her waterline abreast ' P ' turret had flooded a coal bunker and temporarily given her a 15 ° list . Nevertheless , only one man had been killed and five wounded aboard the battlecruisers . 
 After the battle Invincible made temporary repairs at Port Stanley and headed for Gibraltar , where she could be drydocked for more permanent repairs . This took a month and the opportunity was taken to extend the height of her fore funnel by 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) to reduce the amount of smoke blocking visibility from the bridge and spotting top . Invincible sailed to England on 15 February 1915 and joined the Grand Fleet . On 21 February the British battlecruiser force was organised into three squadrons of the Battlecruiser Fleet , with the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) that was to consist of the three Invincible @-@ class ships once Inflexible arrived from the Mediterranean . She was refitted between 25 April and 12 May to have four worn @-@ out 12 @-@ inch guns replaced and the secondary armament reduced and given casemates . Rear Admiral Horace Hood took command of the 3rd BCS on 27 May 1915 and hoisted his flag in Invincible . 
 The 1st and 3rd BCS had sortied in response to the German bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24 – 25 April 1916 , but failed to locate the German ships in heavy weather . During the return home , Invincible was rammed by the patrol yacht Goissa at 11 : 07 PM . Goissa 's bow was embedded in Invincible 's side which partially <unk> @-@ in . Invincible 's speed was reduced to 12 knots ( 14 mph ; 22 km / h ) through flooding and she was forced to haul out of line and proceed independently to Rosyth for repairs which lasted until 22 May 1916 . 
 = = = Battle of Jutland = = = 
 At the end of May 1916 , the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron was temporarily assigned to the Grand Fleet for gunnery practice . On 30 May , the entire Grand Fleet , along with Admiral Beatty 's battlecruisers , had been ordered to sea to prepare for an excursion by the German High Seas Fleet . In order to support Beatty , Admiral Hood took his three battlecruisers ahead of the Grand Fleet . At about 2 : 30 PM Invincible intercepted a radio message from the British light cruiser Galatea , attached to Beatty 's Battlecruiser Force , reporting the sighting of two enemy cruisers . This was amplified by other reports of seven enemy ships steering north . Hood interpreted this as an attempt to escape through the Skagerrak and ordered an increase in speed to 22 kn ( 41 km / h ) at 3 : 11 and steered East @-@ Southeast to cut off the fleeing ships . Twenty minutes later Invincible intercepted a message from Beatty reporting five enemy battlecruisers in sight and later signals reporting that he was engaging the enemy on a south @-@ easterly course . At 4 : 06 Hood ordered full speed and a course of south @-@ southeast in an attempt to converge on Beatty . At 4 : 56 , with no British ships in sight , Hood requested Beatty 's course , position and speed , but never received a reply . 
 Hood continued on course until 5 : 40 when gunfire was spotted in the direction to which his light cruiser Chester had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes . Chester encountered four light cruisers of Hipper 's 2nd Scouting Group and was badly damaged before Hood turned to investigate and was able to drive the German cruisers away from Chester . At 5 : 53 Invincible opened fire on Wiesbaden and the other two Invincibles followed two minutes later . The German ships turned for the south after fruitlessly firing torpedoes at 6 : 00 and attempted to find shelter in the mist . As they turned Invincible hit Wiesbaden in the engine room and knocked out her engines while Inflexible hit Pillau once . The 2nd Scouting Group was escorted by the light cruiser Regensburg and 31 destroyers of the 2nd and 9th Flotillas and the 12th Half @-@ Flotilla which attacked the 3rd BCS in succession . They were driven off by Hood 's remaining light cruiser Canterbury and the five destroyers of his escort . In a confused action the Germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled the destroyer Shark with gunfire . Having turned due west to close on Beatty 's ships , the three Invincible @-@ class battlecruisers were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes , but Invincible turned north , while Inflexible and Indomitable turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes . All the torpedoes missed , although one passed underneath Inflexible without detonating . As Invincible turned north , her helm jammed and she had to come to a stop to fix the problem , but this was quickly done and the squadron reformed heading west . 
 At 6 : 21 , with both Beatty and the Grand Fleet converging on him , Hood turned south to lead Beatty 's battlecruisers . Hipper 's battlecruisers were 9 @,@ 000 yards ( 8 @.@ 2 km ) away and the Invincibles almost immediately opened fire on Hipper 's flagship Lützow and Derfflinger . Indomitable hit Derfflinger three times and Seydlitz once , while the Lützow quickly took 10 hits from Lion , Inflexible and Invincible , including two hits below the waterline forward by Invincible that would ultimately doom her . But at 6 : 30 Invincible abruptly appeared as a clear target before Lützow and Derfflinger . The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at Invincible and sank her in 90 seconds . At least one 305 mm ( 12 @-@ inch ) shell from the third salvo struck her midships ' Q ' turret . The shell penetrated the front of ' Q ' turret , blew off the roof and detonated the midships magazines , which blew the ship in half . The explosion possibly ignited ' A ' and ' X ' magazines . Of her complement , 1026 officers and men were killed , including Rear @-@ Admiral Hood . There were only six survivors picked up by Badger . The names of the survivors are : 
 Commander Hubert E. Dannreuther , RN

 = Music of the Spheres ( Doctor Who ) = 
 " Music of the Spheres " is a mini @-@ episode of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who that premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London before the Intermission of the Doctor Who Prom on 27 July 2008 , for which it was especially made . The Doctor Who Prom , including the audio for " Music of the Spheres " , was broadcast simultaneously on BBC Radio 3 . " Music of the Spheres " was shown on the official BBC Doctor Who website during the interval and the concert itself was filmed for later broadcast on BBC One on 1 January 2009 . 
 The episode has live and pre @-@ recorded components : the pre @-@ recorded component takes place in the TARDIS ; the live component is the Doctor Who Prom which took place during the episode 's first transmission . Consequently , a major component of the episode is that it breaks the fourth wall : the Doctor ( David Tennant ) " converses " with the audience and conducts the orchestra to perform his symphony Ode to the Universe . He is antagonised by the Graske ( Jimmy Vee ) , who intends to cause mischief at the Prom . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The beginning of the episode depicts the Tenth Doctor composing Ode to the Universe : a symphony based on the " music of the spheres " — an aural representation of the Universe 's gravity patterns . During the composition , a Graske teleports into the TARDIS to warn the Doctor about the imminent opening of a portal linking the TARDIS to the Doctor Who Prom at the Royal Albert Hall . The Doctor conducts the orchestra in a performance before he realises the Graske has escaped into the Prom with his water pistol . He forces the Graske 's return by " reversing the polarity of the neutron flow " and banishes him from the TARDIS and to the other side of the universe . At the end of the episode , he tells the viewer that the music of the spheres encompasses everyone . 
 = = Production = = 
 Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner decided to create a " mini @-@ episode " to be screened at the Doctor Who Prom in part because actor David Tennant was unable to participate in the live concert due to his commitments to the Royal Shakespeare Company 's production of Hamlet . Davies incorporated interactive elements into his script to ensure that the live performance was " an event " : 
 You can watch it later on the website , or on YouTube , or whatever , but frankly , you 'll never know what it was really like unless you are in the Albert Hall on that day . It can never be captured again . And that 's a reward for people who buy tickets and queue and travel . 
 Davies sought to continue the Doctor 's long association with music in this special after he realised the Tenth Doctor had yet to show " any aptitude for music " . In his introductory note , Davies cites as examples of the Doctor 's previous associations with music : the First Doctor disguising himself as Ancient Rome 's most famous lyre @-@ player in Emperor Nero 's court in The Romans ; the Second Doctor playing his recorder ; the Third Doctor singing <unk> to sleep with a Venusian lullaby in The Curse of Peladon ; the Fourth Doctor shattering glass by singing in the style of Dame Nellie Melba in The Power of Kroll ; the Fifth Doctor playing a harp on Gallifrey in The Five Doctors ; the Sixth Doctor singing opera ; the Seventh Doctor playing the spoons ; the Eighth Doctor admiring composer Giacomo Puccini ; and the Ninth Doctor dancing with Rose Tyler to " In The Mood " by Glenn Miller in " The Doctor Dances " . In writing the episode , Davies expressed hope that " this mini @-@ adventure [ would show ] that music can take any shape or form , whether it ’ s singing , or playing the recorder , or even the spoons . " He states that " music can go anywhere , reach anyone , and make better people of us all . Just like the Doctor . " 
 The mini @-@ episode was filmed on Saturday 3 May 2008 , the last day of filming for Series 4 of Doctor Who , in the BBC Wales studios at Upper Boat , Pontypridd . Jimmy Vee , " a faithful friend of the show " , was recalled to the part of the Graske he first portrayed in the interactive episode " Attack of the Graske " . Murray Gold composed music especially for this short episode . Gold 's Series 4 arrangement of the Doctor Who theme tune is used for the title sequence , and Ron <unk> and Delia Derbyshire 's original version of the Doctor Who theme tune is played over the end credits .

 The episode premièred at the Royal Albert Hall before the interval of the Doctor Who Prom on Sunday 27 July 2008 and could be heard simultaneously on BBC Radio 3 . It was also made available to watch during the interval on the official Doctor Who website and was shown on BBC One on 1 January 2009 as part of their showing of Doctor Who Prom . BBC Radio 3 's recording of Doctor Who Prom including the audio of " Music of the Spheres " could be streamed via BBC iPlayer for a week after transmission . 
 Freema Agyeman , who played Martha Jones in Doctor Who and Torchwood , introduced the episode , which was shown on a large screen above the stage and smaller screens around the edge of the Dress Circle in the Royal Albert Hall . As the Doctor addressed them , the Royal Albert Hall audience shouted back responses . Manuscript paper fell to the stage as the Doctor was seen to feed his sheet music to the orchestra . When the Graske sneaked through the portal , he appeared in the audience carrying the Doctor 's water pistol and squirting members of the audience . A cellist had to defend himself from an attack by the Graske who promptly exited as , on screen , the Doctor pulled him back to the TARDIS . The Graske in the audience was Jimmy Vee in costume and prosthetics . 
 " Music of the Spheres " was immediately followed by a Cyberman introducing the interval over applause . On BBC Radio 3 , presenter Sarah Walker back announced the episode and announced its availability to watch during the interval on the official Doctor Who website . " Let 's Do The Time Warp Again " , presented by science fiction writer Justina Robson and produced by Mark Berman , was then broadcast on BBC Radio 3 during the interval in which Robson expressed her views about Doctor Who .

 The Doctor Who Prom , described as " fantastic " by Davies , was attended by 6 @,@ 000 people who were addressed directly in the " panto @-@ style scene " , " Music of the Spheres " . Davies commented that they had " a brilliant time " and that " Music of the Spheres " involved " a lot of interaction with the audience " . He also stated that the audience in the Royal Albert Hall had a " unique , one @-@ off Doctor Who experience " , repaying them for their effort in getting there and queuing in the heat . 
 Writing in The Times , Caitlin Moran said that the Doctor 's homily to music and self @-@ expression was " the most affecting moment " in the Prom , bringing " what could have been a wonderful , yet surreal and overwhelming introduction to orchestral music " down to " a rather lovely question . Did you like this orchestra , kids ? What would you do with one ? " 
 = Peter Sellers = 
 Peter Sellers , CBE ( born Richard Henry Sellers ; 8 September 1925 – 24 July 1980 ) was an English film actor , comedian and singer . He performed in the BBC Radio comedy series The Goon Show , featured on a number of hit comic songs and became known to a worldwide audience through his many film characterisations , among them Chief Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther series of films . 
 Born in Portsmouth , Sellers made his stage debut at the Kings Theatre , Southsea , when he was two weeks old . He began accompanying his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres . He first worked as a drummer and toured around England as a member of the Entertainments National Service Association ( ENSA ) . He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in Ralph Reader 's wartime Gang Show entertainment troupe , which toured Britain and the Far East . After the war , Sellers made his radio debut in <unk> , and eventually became a regular performer on various BBC radio shows . During the early 1950s , Sellers , along with Spike Milligan , Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine , took part in the successful radio series The Goon Show , which ended in 1960 . 
 Sellers began his film career during the 1950s . Although the bulk of his work was comedic @-@ based , often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen , he also performed in other film genres and roles . Films demonstrating his artistic range include I 'm All Right Jack ( 1959 ) , Stanley Kubrick 's Lolita ( 1962 ) and Dr. Strangelove ( 1964 ) , What 's New , Pussycat ? ( 1965 ) , Casino Royale ( 1967 ) , The Party ( 1968 ) , Being There ( 1979 ) and the five films of the Pink Panther series ( 1963 – 78 ) . Sellers 's versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises , and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film , frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles . Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films , and his performances had a strong influence on a number of later comedians . Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award , twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performances in Dr. Strangelove and Being There , and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film ( 1960 ) . He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role twice , for I 'm All Right Jack and for the original Pink Panther film , The Pink Panther ( 1963 ) and was nominated as Best Actor three times . In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in Being There , and also earned three other Golden Globe nominations in the same category . Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers " one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century . " 
 In his personal life , Sellers struggled with depression and insecurities . An enigmatic figure , he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played . His behaviour was often erratic and compulsive , and he frequently clashed with his directors and co @-@ stars , especially in the mid @-@ 1970s when his physical and mental health , together with his alcohol and drug problems , were at their worst . Sellers was married four times , and had three children from his first two marriages . He died as a result of a heart attack in 1980 , aged 54 . English filmmakers the Boulting brothers described Sellers as " the greatest comic genius this country has produced since Charles Chaplin . " 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life ( 1925 – 35 ) = = = 
 Sellers was born on 8 September 1925 , in Southsea , a suburb of Portsmouth . His parents were Yorkshire @-@ born William " Bill " Sellers ( 1900 – 62 ) and Agnes Doreen " Peg " ( née Marks , 1892 – 1967 ) . Both were variety entertainers ; Peg was in the Ray Sisters troupe . Although christened Richard Henry , his parents called him Peter , after his elder stillborn brother . Sellers remained an only child . Peg Sellers was related to the pugilist Daniel Mendoza ( 1764 – 1836 ) , whom Sellers greatly revered , and whose engraving later hung in his office . At one time Sellers planned to use Mendoza 's image for his production company 's logo . 
 Sellers was two weeks old when he was carried on stage by Dick Henderson , the headline act at the Kings Theatre in Southsea : the crowd sang " For He 's a Jolly Good Fellow " , which caused the infant to cry . The family constantly toured , causing much upheaval and unhappiness in the young Sellers 's life . 
 Sellers maintained a very close relationship with his mother , which his friend Spike Milligan later considered unhealthy for a grown man . Sellers 's agent , Dennis <unk> , recalled his first meeting with Peg and Peter Sellers , noting that " Sellers was an immensely shy young man , inclined to be dominated by his mother , but without resentment or objection " . As an only child though , he spent much time alone . 
 In 1935 the Sellers family moved to North London and settled in Muswell Hill . Although Bill Sellers was Protestant and Peg was Jewish , Sellers attended the North London Roman Catholic school St. Aloysius College , run by the Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy . The family was not rich , but Peg insisted on an expensive private schooling for her son . According to biographer Peter Evans , Sellers was fascinated , puzzled , and worried by religion from a young age , particularly Catholicism , but soon after entering Catholic school , he " discovered he was a Jew — he was someone on the outside of the mysteries of faith . " Later in his life , Sellers observed that while his father 's faith was according to the Church of England , his mother was Jewish , " and Jews take the faith of their mother . " According to Milligan , Sellers held a guilt complex about being Jewish and recalls that Sellers was once moved to tears when he presented him with a candlestick from a synagogue for Christmas , believing the gesture to be an anti @-@ Jewish slur . 
 Sellers became a top student at the school , excelling in drawing in particular . However , he was prone to laziness , but his natural talents shielded him from criticism by his teachers . Sellers recalled that a teacher scolded the other boys for not studying , saying : " The Jewish boy knows his catechism better than the rest of you ! " 
 = = = Early performances ( 1935 – 39 ) = = = 
 Accompanying his family on the variety show circuit , Sellers learned stagecraft , but received conflicting encouragement from his parents and developed mixed feelings about show business . His father doubted Sellers 's abilities in the entertainment field , even suggesting that his son 's talents were only enough to become a road sweeper , while Sellers 's mother encouraged him continuously . 
 While at St Aloysius College , Sellers began to develop his improvisational skills . He and his closest friend at the time , Bryan Connon , both enjoyed listening to early radio comedy shows . Connon remembers that " Peter got endless pleasure imitating the people in Monday Night at Eight . He had a gift for improvising dialogue . Sketches , too . I 'd be the ' straight man ' , the ' feed ' , ... I 'd cue Peter and he 'd do all the radio personalities and chuck in a few voices of his own invention as well . " 
 With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 , St Aloysius College was evacuated to Cambridgeshire . Because his mother did not allow Sellers to go , his formal education ended at fourteen . Early in 1940 , the family moved to the north Devon town of Ilfracombe , where Sellers 's maternal uncle managed the Victoria Palace Theatre ; Sellers got his first job at the theatre , aged fifteen , starting as a caretaker . He was steadily promoted , becoming a box office clerk , usher , assistant stage manager and lighting operator . He was also offered some small acting parts . Working backstage gave him a chance to study actors such as Paul Scofield . He became close friends with Derek Altman , and together they launched Sellers 's first stage act under the name " Altman and Sellers " , consisting of playing ukuleles , singing , and telling jokes . 
 During his backstage theatre job , Sellers began practising on a set of drums that belonged to the band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots . Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions . The instrument greatly suited Sellers 's temperament and artistic skills . Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer , had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation . 
 = = = Second World War ( 1939 – 45 ) = = = 
 As the Second World War progressed , Sellers continued to develop his drumming skills , and played with a series of touring bands , including those of Oscar Rabin , Henry Hall and <unk> , as well as his father 's quartet , before he left and joined a band from Blackpool . Sellers became a member of the Entertainments National Service Association ( ENSA ) , which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war . Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts , including impersonations of George Formby , with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele . 
 In September 1943 , he joined the Royal Air Force , although it is unclear whether he volunteered or was conscripted ; his mother unsuccessfully tried to have him deferred on medical grounds . Sellers wanted to become a pilot , but his poor eyesight restricted him to ground staff duties . He found these duties dull , so auditioned for Squadron Leader Ralph Reader 's RAF Gang Show entertainment troupe : Reader accepted him and Sellers toured the UK before the troupe was transferred to India . His tour also included Ceylon and Burma , although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown , and Sellers may have exaggerated its length . He also served in Germany and France after the war . According to David Lodge who became friends with Sellers , he was " one of the best performers ever " on the drums and developed a fine ability to impersonate military officers during this period . 
 = = = Early post @-@ war career and The Goon Show ( 1946 – 55 ) = = = 
 In 1946 , Sellers made his final show with ENSA starring in the pantomime Jack and the Beanstalk at the Théâtre Marigny in Paris . He was posted back to England shortly afterwards to work at the Air Ministry , and demobilised later that year . On resuming his theatrical career , Sellers could get only sporadic work . He was fired after one performance of a comedy routine in Peterborough ; the headline act , Welsh vocalist Dorothy Squires , however , persuaded the management to reinstate him . Sellers also continued his drumming and was billed on his appearance at The Hippodrome in Aldershot as " Britain 's answer to Gene Krupa " . In March 1948 Sellers gained a six @-@ week run at the Windmill Theatre in London , which predominantly staged revue acts : he provided the comedy turns in between the nude shows on offer . 
 Sellers wrote to the BBC in 1948 , and was subsequently auditioned . As a result , he made his television debut on 18 March 1948 in New To You . His act was largely based on impressions , was well received , and he returned the following week . Frustrated with the slow pace of his career , Sellers telephoned BBC radio producer Roy Speer , pretending to be Kenneth Horne , star of the radio show Much @-@ Binding @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Marsh . Speer called Sellers a " cheeky young sod " for his efforts , but gave him an audition . This led to his brief appearance on 1 July 1948 on <unk> and subsequently to work on Ray 's a Laugh with comedian Ted Ray . In October 1948 , Sellers was a regular radio performer , appearing in Starlight Hour , The Gang Show , Henry Hall 's Guest Night and It 's Fine To Be Young . 
 By the end of 1948 , the BBC Third Programme began to broadcast the comedy series Third Division , which starred , among others , Harry Secombe , Michael Bentine and Sellers . One evening , Sellers and Bentine visited the Hackney Empire , where Secombe was performing , and Bentine introduced Sellers to Spike Milligan . The four would meet up at Grafton 's public house near Victoria , owned by Jimmy Grafton , who was also a BBC script writer . The four comedians dubbed him <unk> ( Keeper of Goons and Voice of Sanity ) Grafton later edited some of the first Goon Shows . 
 In 1949 , Sellers started to date Anne Howe , an Australian actress who lived in London . Sellers proposed to her in April 1950 and the couple were married in London on 15 September 1951 ; their son , Michael , was born on 2 April 1954 , and their daughter , Sarah , followed in 1958 . 
 Sellers 's introduction to film work came in 1950 , where he dubbed the voice of Alfonso Bedoya in The Black Rose . He continued to work with Bentine , Milligan , and Secombe . On 3 February 1951 , he made a trial tape entitled The Goons , and sent it to the BBC producer Pat Dixon , who eventually accepted it . The first Goon Show was broadcast on 28 May 1951 . Against their wishes , they appeared under the name Crazy People . Sellers appeared in The Goons until the last programme of the ten @-@ series run , broadcast on 28 January 1960 . Sellers played four main characters — Major <unk> , Hercules <unk> @-@ Thynne , <unk> and Henry <unk> — and seventeen minor ones . 
 Starting with 370 @,@ 000 listeners , the show eventually reached up to seven million people in Britain , and was described by one newspaper as " probably the most influential comedy show of all time " . For Sellers , the BBC considers it had the effect of launching his career " on the road to stardom " . 
 In 1951 the Goons made their feature film debut in Penny Points to Paradise . Sellers and Milligan then penned the script to Let 's Go Crazy , the earliest film to showcase Sellers 's ability to portray a series of different characters within the same film , and he made another appearance opposite his Goons co @-@ stars in the 1952 flop , Down Among the Z Men . In 1954 , Sellers was cast opposite Sid James , Tony Hancock , Raymond Huntley , Donald Pleasence and Eric Sykes in the British Lion Film Corporation comedy production , Orders Are Orders . John Grierson believes that this was Sellers 's breakthrough role on screen and credits this film with launching the film careers of both Sellers and Hancock . 
 = = = I 'm All Right Jack and early years in film ( 1956 – 59 ) = = = 
 Sellers pursued a film career and took a number of small roles such as a police inspector in John and Julie ( 1955 ) . He accepted a larger part in the 1955 Alexander Mackendrick @-@ directed Ealing comedy The Ladykillers in which he starred opposite Alec Guinness , Herbert Lom and Cecil Parker as Harry Robinson , the Teddy Boy ; biographer Peter Evans considers this Sellers 's first good role . The Ladykillers was a success in both Britain and the US , and the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay . 
 The following year Sellers appeared in a further three television series based on The Goons , which aired on Britain 's new ITV network . The series were The Idiot Weekly , Price 2d , A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred . In 1957 film producer Michael Relph became impressed with Sellers 's portrayal of an elderly character in Idiot Weekly , and cast the 32 @-@ year @-@ old actor as a 68 @-@ year @-@ old projectionist in Basil Dearden 's The Smallest Show on Earth , supporting Bill Travers , Virginia McKenna and Margaret Rutherford . The film was a commercial success and is now thought of as a minor classic of British screen comedy in the post @-@ war era . Following this , Sellers provided the growling voice of Winston Churchill to the BAFTA award winning film The Man Who Never Was . Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in Mario <unk> 's offbeat black comedy The Naked Truth , opposite Terry @-@ Thomas , Peggy Mount , Shirley Eaton and Dennis Price . 
 Sellers 's difficulties in getting his film career to take off , and increasing problems in his personal life , prompted him to seek periodic consultations with astrologer Maurice Woodruff , who held considerable sway over his later career . After a chance meeting with a North American Indian spirit guide in the 1950s , Sellers became convinced that the music hall comedian Dan Leno , who died in 1904 , haunted him and guided his career and life @-@ decisions . 
 In 1958 Sellers starred with David Tomlinson , Wilfrid Hyde @-@ White , David Lodge and Lionel Jeffries as a chief petty officer in Val Guest 's Up the Creek . Guest later claimed that he had written and directed the film as a vehicle for Sellers , and thus had started Sellers 's film career . To practice his voice , Sellers purchased a reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape recorder . The film received critical acclaim in the United States and Roger Lewis viewed it as an important practice ground for Sellers . Next , Sellers featured with Terry @-@ Thomas as one of a pair of comic villains in George Pal 's tom thumb ( 1958 ) , a musical fantasy film , opposite Russ Tamblyn , Jessie Matthews and Peter Butterworth . Terry @-@ Thomas later said that " my part was perfect , but Peter 's was bloody awful . He wasn 't difficult about it , but he knew it " . The performance was a major landmark in Sellers 's career and became his first contact with the Hollywood film industry . 
 Sellers released his first studio album in 1958 called The Best of Sellers ; a collection of sketches and comic songs , which were undertaken in a variety of comic characters . Produced by George Martin and released on Parlophone , the album reached number three in the UK Albums Chart ; The same year , Sellers made his first film with John and Roy Boulting in Carlton @-@ Browne of the F.O. , a comedy in which he played a supporting role for the film 's lead , Terry @-@ Thomas . Before the release of that film , the <unk> , along with Sellers and Thomas in the cast , started filming I 'm All Right Jack , which became the highest grossing film at the British box office in 1960 . In preparation for his role as Fred Kite , Sellers watched footage of union officials . The role earned him a BAFTA , and the critic for The Manchester Guardian believed it was Sellers 's best screen performance to date . 
 In between Carlton @-@ Browne of the F.O. and I 'm All Right Jack , Sellers starred in The Mouse That <unk> , a film in which Jean Seberg also appeared , and was directed by Jack Arnold . He played three leading and distinct roles : the elderly Grand Duchess , the ambitious Prime Minister and the innocent and clumsy farm boy selected to lead an invasion of the United States . The film received universal and high praise by critics . 
 After completing I 'm All Right Jack , Sellers returned to record a new series of The Goon Show . Over the course of two weekends , he took his 16mm cine @-@ camera to Totteridge Lane in London and filmed himself , Spike Milligan , Mario <unk> , Leo McKern and Richard Lester . Originally intended as a private film , the eleven @-@ minute short film The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film was screened at the 1959 Edinburgh and San Francisco film festivals . It won the award for best fiction short in the latter festival , and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject ( Live Action ) . In 1959 Sellers released his second album , Songs For Swinging Sellers , which — like his first record — reached number three in the UK Albums Chart . Sellers 's last film of the fifties was The Battle of the Sexes ; a comedy directed by Charles Crichton . 
 = = = The Millionairess , Lolita , The Pink Panther and divorce ( 1960 – 63 ) = = = 
 In 1960 Sellers portrayed an Indian doctor , Dr Ahmed el Kabir in Anthony Asquith 's romantic comedy The Millionairess , a film based on a George Bernard Shaw play of the same name . Sellers was not interested in accepting the role until he learned that Sophia Loren was to be his co @-@ star . When asked about Loren , he explained to reporters " I don 't normally act with romantic , glamorous women ... she 's a lot different from Harry Secombe . " Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming , culminating in Sellers declaring his love for her in front of his wife . Sellers also woke his son at night to ask : " Do you think I should divorce your mummy ? " Roger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions , that " he 'd play a role as an Indian doctor , and for the next six months , he 'd be an Indian in his real [ daily ] life . " The film inspired the George Martin @-@ produced novelty hit single " Goodness Gracious Me " , with Sellers and Loren , which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart in November 1960 . A follow @-@ up single by the duo , <unk> and Mash , reached number 22 in the UK chart . The songs were included on an album released by the couple , Peter & Sophia , which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart . 
 In 1961 Sellers made his directorial debut with Mr. Topaze , in which he also starred . The film was based on the Marcel Pagnol play Topaze . Sellers portrayed an ex @-@ schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to a life of crime to obtain wealth . The film and Sellers 's directorial abilities received an unenthusiastic response from the public and critics alike , and Sellers rarely referred to it again . The same year he starred in the Sidney Gilliat @-@ directed Only Two Can Play , a film based on the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis . He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis , a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz ( Mai <unk> ) , and his long @-@ suffering wife Jean ( Virginia Maskell ) . 
 In 1962 Sellers played a retired British army general in John Guillermin 's Waltz of the Toreadors , based on the play of the same name . The film was widely criticised for its slapstick cinematic adaption , and director Guillermin himself considered the film an " amateurish " effort . However , Sellers won the San Sebastián International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA award nomination for his performance , and it was well received by the critics . Stanley Kubrick asked Sellers to play the role of Clare <unk> in the 1962 film Lolita , opposite James Mason and Shelley Winters . Kubrick had seen Sellers in The Battle of the Sexes and listened to the album The Best of Sellers , and was impressed by the range of characters he could portray . Sellers was apprehensive about accepting the role , doubting his ability to successfully portray the part of a flamboyant American television playwright who was according to Sellers " a fantastic nightmare , part homosexual , part drug addict , part sadist " . Kubrick encouraged Sellers to improvise and stated that he would often reach a " state of comic ecstasy . " Kubrick had American jazz producer Norman Granz record portions of the script for Sellers to listen to , so he could study the voice and develop confidence , granting Sellers a free artistic licence . Sellers later claimed that his relationship with Kubrick became one of the most rewarding of his career . Writing in The Sunday Times , Dilys Powell noted that Sellers gave , " ... a firework performance , funny , malicious , only once for a few seconds overreaching itself , and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy . " Towards the end of 1962 , Sellers appeared in The Dock Brief , a legal satire directed by James Hill and co @-@ starring Richard Attenborough . 
 Sellers 's behaviour towards his family worsened in 1962 ; according to his son Michael , Sellers asked him and his sister Sarah " who we love more , our mother or him . Sarah , to keep the peace , said , ' I love you both equally ' . I said , ' No , I love my mum . ' " This prompted Sellers to throw both children out , saying that he never wanted to see them again . At the end of 1962 , his marriage to Anne broke down . In 1963 , Sellers starred as gang leader " Pearly Gates " in Cliff Owen 's The Wrong Arm of the Law , followed by his portrayal of a vicar in Heavens Above ! . 
 After his father 's death in October 1962 , Sellers decided to leave England and was approached by director Blake Edwards who offered him the role of Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther , after Peter Ustinov had backed out of the film . Edwards later recalled his feelings as " desperately unhappy and ready to kill , but as fate would have it , I got Mr. Sellers instead of Mr. Ustinov — thank God ! " Sellers accepted a fee of £ 90 @,@ 000 ( £ 695 @,@ 641 in 2016 pounds ) for five weeks ' work on location in Rome and Cortina . The film starred David Niven in the principal role , with two other actors — <unk> and Claudia Cardinale — having more prominent roles than Sellers . However , Sellers 's performance is regarded as being on par with that of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton , according to biographer Peter Evans . Although the Clouseau character was in the script , Sellers created the personality , devising the costume , accent , make @-@ up , moustache and trench coat . 
 The Pink Panther was released in the UK in January 1964 and received a mixed reception from the critics , although Penelope Gilliatt , writing in The Observer , remarked that Sellers had a " flawless sense of mistiming " in a performance that was " ... one of the most delicate studies in accident @-@ proneness since the silents . " Despite the views of the critics , the film was one of the top ten grossing films of the year . The role earned Sellers a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 22nd Golden Globe Awards , and for a Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards .

 In 1963 , Stanley Kubrick cast Sellers to appear in Dr. Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb alongside George C. Scott , Sterling Hayden , Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens . Sellers and Kubrick got on famously during the film 's production and had the greatest of respect for each other , also sharing a love of photography . The director asked Sellers to play four roles : US President Merkin <unk> , Dr. Strangelove , Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF and Major T. J. " King " Kong . Sellers was initially hesitant about taking on these divergent characters , but Kubrick prevailed . According to some accounts , Sellers was also invited to play the part of General Buck <unk> , but turned it down because it was too physically demanding . Kubrick later commented that the idea of having Sellers in so many of the film 's key roles was that " everywhere you turn there is some version of Peter Sellers holding the fate of the world in his hands " . Sellers was especially anxious about successfully enacting the role of Kong and accurately affecting a Texan accent . Kubrick requested screenwriter Terry Southern to record in his natural accent a tape of Kong 's lines . After practising with Southern 's recording , Sellers got sufficient control of the accent , and started shooting the scenes in the aeroplane . After the first day 's shooting , Sellers sprained his ankle while leaving a restaurant and could no longer work in the cramped cockpit set . Kubrick then re @-@ cast Slim Pickens as Kong . The three roles Sellers undertook were distinct , " variegated , complex and refined " , and critic Alexander Walker considered that these roles " showed his genius at full stretch " . Sellers played <unk> as a bland , placid intellectual in the mould of Adlai Stevenson ; he played Mandrake as an unflappable Englishman ; and Dr. Strangelove , a character influenced by pre @-@ war German cinema , as a wheelchair @-@ bound fanatic . The critic for The Times wrote that the film includes , " three remarkable performances from Mr. Peter Sellers , masterly as the President , diverting as a revue @-@ sketch ex @-@ Nazi US Scientist ... and acceptable as an RAF officer , although the critic from The Guardian thought his portrayal of the RAF officer alone was , " worth the price of an admission ticket " . For his performance in all three roles , Sellers was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 37th Academy Awards , and the Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards . 
 Between November 1963 and February 1964 , Sellers began filming A Shot in the Dark , an adaptation of a French play , L <unk> by Marcel Achard . Sellers found the part and the director , Anatole Litvak , uninspiring ; the producers brought in Blake Edwards to replace Litvak . Together with writer William Peter Blatty , they turned the script into a Clouseau comedy , also adding Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Cato . During filming , Sellers 's relationship with Edwards became strained ; the two would often stop speaking to each other during filming , communicating only by the passing of notes . Sellers 's personality was described by others as difficult and demanding , and he often clashed with fellow actors and directors . Upon its release in late June 1964 , Bosley Crowther noted the " joyously free and facile way " in which Sellers had developed his comedy technique . 
 Towards the end of filming , in early February 1964 , Sellers met Britt Ekland , a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film Guns at <unk> . On 19 February 1964 , just ten days after their first meeting , the couple married . Sellers soon showed signs of insecurity and paranoia ; he would become highly anxious and jealous , for example , when Ekland starred opposite attractive men . Shortly after the wedding , Sellers started filming on location in Twentynine Palms , California for Billy Wilder 's Kiss Me , Stupid , opposite Dean Martin and Kim Novak . The relationship between Wilder and Sellers became strained ; both had different approaches to work and often clashed as a result . On the night of 5 April 1964 , prior to having sex with Ekland , Sellers took amyl nitrites ( poppers ) as a sexual stimulant in his search for " the ultimate orgasm " , and suffered a series of eight heart attacks over the course of three hours as a result . His illness forced him to withdraw from the filming of Kiss Me , Stupid and he was replaced by Ray Walston . Wilder was unsympathetic about the heart attacks , saying that " you have to have a heart before you can have an attack " . 
 After some time recovering , Sellers returned to filming in October 1964 , playing King of the <unk> alongside Ekland in Carol for Another Christmas , a United Nations special , broadcast on the ABC channel on 28 December 1964 . Sellers had been concerned that his heart attacks may have caused brain damage and that he would be unable to remember his lines , but he was reassured that his memory and abilities were unimpaired after the experience of filming . Sellers followed this with the role of the perverted Austrian psychoanalyst Doctor Fritz Fassbender in Clive Donner 's What 's New Pussycat ? , appearing alongside Peter O 'Toole , Romy Schneider , <unk> , Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress . The film was the first screenwriting and acting credit for Woody Allen , and featured Sellers in a love triangle . Because of Sellers 's poor health , producer Charles K. Feldman insured him at a cost of $ 360 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 @,@ 746 @,@ 738 in 2016 dollars ) . 
 Sellers became a close friend of Antony Armstrong @-@ Jones , 1st Earl of Snowdon , a photographer who was then married to Princess Margaret . Snowdon shared a love of women , photography , fine wine and fast cars with Sellers ; both were also prone to bouts of depression . They spent many weekends together with their wives and went on several holidays on board Sellers 's yacht Bobo in Sardinia . On 20 January 1965 , Sellers and Ekland announced the birth of a daughter , Victoria . They moved to Rome in May to film After the Fox , an Anglo @-@ Italian production in which they were both to appear . The film was directed by Vittorio De Sica , whose English Sellers struggled to understand . Sellers attempted to have De Sica fired , causing tensions on the set . Sellers also became unhappy with his wife 's performance , straining their relationship and triggering open arguments during one of which Sellers threw a chair at Ekland . Despite these conflicts , the script was praised for its wit . 
 Following the commercial success of What 's New Pussycat ? , Charles Feldman again brought together Sellers and Woody Allen for his next project , Casino Royale , which also starred Orson Welles ; Sellers signed a $ 1 million contract for the film ( $ 7 @,@ 096 @,@ 806 in 2016 dollars ) . Seven screenwriters worked on the project , and filming was chaotic . To make matters worse , according to Ekland , Sellers was " so insecure , he won 't trust anyone " . A poor working relationship quickly developed between Sellers and Welles : Sellers eventually demanded that the two should not share the same set . Sellers left the film before his part was complete . A further agent 's part was then written for Terence Cooper , to cover Sellers 's departure . 
 Shortly after leaving Casino Royale , Sellers was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in honour of his career achievements . The day before the investiture at Buckingham Palace , Sellers and Ekland argued , with Ekland scratching his face in the process ; Sellers had a make @-@ up artist cover the marks . Ekland later reported that although the couple argued , Sellers never hit her . During his next film , The Bobo , which again co @-@ starred Ekland , the couple 's marital problems worsened . Three weeks into production in Italy , Sellers told director Robert Parrish to fire his wife , saying " I 'm not coming back after lunch if that bitch is on the set " . Ekland later stated that the marriage was " an atrocious sham " at this stage . In the midst of filming The Bobo , Sellers 's mother had a heart attack ; Parrish asked Sellers if he wanted to visit her in hospital , but Sellers remained on set . She died within days , without Sellers having seen her . He was deeply affected by her death and remorseful at not having returned to London to see her . Ekland served him with divorce papers shortly afterwards . The divorce was finalised on 18 December 1968 , and Sellers 's friend Spike Milligan sent Ekland a congratulatory telegram . Upon its release in September 1967 , The Bobo was poorly received . 
 Sellers 's first film appearance of 1968 was a reunion with Blake Edwards for the fish out of water comedy The Party , in which he starred alongside Claudine <unk> and Denny Miller . He appears as <unk> V. Bakshi , a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party . His character , according to Sellers 's biographer Peter Evans , was " clearly an amalgam of Clouseau and the doctor in The Millionairess " . Roger Lewis notes that like a number of Sellers 's characters , he is played in a sympathetic and dignified manner . He followed it later that year with Hy <unk> 's I Love You , Alice B. Toklas , playing an attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a hippie . Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times gave the film three stars , remarking that Sellers was " back doing what he does best " , although he also said that in Sellers 's previous films he had " been at his worst recently " . 
 In 1969 Sellers starred opposite Ringo Starr in the Joseph McGrath @-@ directed film The Magic Christian . Sellers portrayed Sir Guy Grand , an eccentric billionaire who plays elaborate practical jokes on people . The critic Irv <unk> remarked that the film was a reflection of the cynicism of Peter Sellers , describing the film as a " proto @-@ Pythonesque adaption of Terry Southern 's semi @-@ free @-@ form short novel " , and " one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britain 's royal family . " The film , a satire on human nature , was in general viewed negatively by critics . Roger Greenspun of The New York Times believed that the film was of variable quality and summarised it as a " brutal satire " .

 After a cameo appearance in A Day at the Beach ( 1970 ) , and a serious role later in 1970 as an ageing businessman who seduces Sinéad Cusack in Hoffman , Sellers starred in Roy Boulting 's There 's a Girl in My Soup opposite Goldie Hawn . According to The Times , the film was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1970 . Andrew Spicer , writing for the British Film Institute 's Screenonline , considers that although Sellers favoured playing romantic roles , he " was always more successful in parts that sent up his own vanities and pretensions , as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario [ sic ] he played in There 's a Girl in My Soup " . The film was seen as a small revival of his career . However , Sellers 's next films , including Rodney <unk> 's Where Does It Hurt ? ( 1972 ) and Peter Medak 's Ghost in the Noonday Sun ( 1973 ) , were again poorly received , and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny . Despite these setbacks , Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi @-@ comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons 's The Optimists of Nine Elms . Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers " a period of indifference , and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion " . This was echoed by Sellers 's biographer , Peter Evans , who notes that out of nine films in the period , three were never released and five had flopped , while only There 's a Girl in My Soup had been a success . In his private life , he had been seeing the twenty @-@ three @-@ year @-@ old model Miranda Quarry . The couple married on 24 August 1970 , despite Sellers 's private doubts — expressed to his agent , Dennis <unk> — about his decision to re @-@ marry . 
 On 20 April 1972 , Sellers reunited with Milligan and Harry Secombe to record The Last Goon Show of All , which was broadcast on 5 October . In May 1973 , with his third marriage failing , Sellers went to the theatre to watch Liza Minnelli perform . He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later , despite Minnelli 's current betrothal to Desi Arnaz , Jr . , and Sellers still being married . Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up . By 1974 , Sellers 's friends were concerned that he was having a nervous breakdown . Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was " a deeply troubled man , distrustful , self @-@ absorbed , ultimately self @-@ destructive . He was the complete contradiction . " Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character . When he was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson 's eponymous chat show in 1974 , he withdrew the day before , explaining to Parkinson that " I just can 't walk on as myself " . When he was told he could come on as someone else , he appeared dressed as a member of the Gestapo . After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character , he stepped out of the role and settled down and , according to Parkinson himself , " was brilliant , giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity " . In 1974 , Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long @-@ dead music hall comic Dan Leno , who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau . 
 In 1974 , Sellers portrayed a " sexually voracious " Queen Victoria in Joseph McGrath 's comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet William McGonagall , The Great McGonagall , starring opposite Milligan and Julia Foster . However , the film was a critical failure , and Sellers 's career and life reached an all @-@ time low . As a result , by 1974 he agreed to accept salaries of £ 100 @,@ 000 and 10 per cent of the gross to appear in TV productions and advertisements , well below the £ 1 million he had once commanded per film . In 1973 , he appeared in a Benson & Hedges cinema commercial ; in 1975 , he appeared in a series of advertisements for Trans World Airlines , in which he played several eccentric characters , including Thrifty <unk> , Jeremy ' Piggy ' Peak Thyme and an Italian singer , Vito . Biographer Michael Starr asserts that Sellers showed enthusiasm towards these roles , although the airline campaign failed commercially . 
 A turning point in Sellers 's flailing career came in 1974 , when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make The Return of the Pink Panther , starring alongside Christopher Plummer , Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell . The film was shot on a budget of £ 3 million and earned $ 33 million at the box office upon release in May 1975 , reinvigorating Sellers 's career as an A @-@ list film star and restoring his millionaire status . The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards . In 1976 , he followed it with The Pink Panther Strikes Again . During the filming from February to June 1976 , the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated . Edwards says of the actor 's mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again , " If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw , that 's what Peter had become . He was certifiable . " With declining physical health , Sellers could at times be unbearable on set . His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish , and he frequently threw tantrums , often threatening to abandon projects . Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a " volatile and perplexing character [ who ] left a trail of misery in his private life " . He also noted that Sellers had a " compulsive personality and [ was ] an eccentric hypochondriac " who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period . His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time when he most needed the work . Despite Sellers 's deep personal problems , The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically . Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Sellers in the film , " There is , too , something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers ' Clouseau , a fellow who , when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion , gets tangled up in his necktie , and who , when he masquerades — for reasons never gone into — as Quasimodo , <unk> his hump with helium . " Sellers 's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards . 
 In March 1976 Sellers began dating actress Lynne Frederick , whom he married on 18 February 1977 . Biographer Roger Lewis documents that of all of Sellers 's wives , Frederick was the most poorly treated ; Julian Upton likened it to a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight , a relationship that " oscillated from ardour to hatred , reconciliation and remorse . " Peter Evans claims that Milligan detested his friend 's choice of partner and believed she was to blame for his increasing alcohol and cocaine dependency . On 20 March 1977 , Sellers suffered a second major heart attack during a flight from Paris to London ; he was subsequently fitted with a pacemaker . Sellers returned from his illness to undertake Revenge of the Pink Panther ; although it was a commercial success , the critics were tiring of Inspector Clouseau . Julian Upton expressed the view that the strain behind the scenes began to manifest itself in the sluggish pace of the film , describing it as a " laboured , stunt @-@ heavy hotchpotch of half @-@ baked ideas and rehashed gags . " Sellers too had become tired of the role , saying after production , " I 've honestly had enough of Clouseau — I 've got nothing more to give " . Steven Bach , the senior vice @-@ president and head of worldwide productions for United Artists , who worked with Sellers on Revenge of the Pink Panther , considered that Sellers was " deeply unbalanced , if not <unk> : that was the source of his genius and his truly quite terrifying aspects as manipulator and hysteric " . He refused to seek professional help for his mental issues . Sellers would claim that he had no personality and was almost unnoticeable , which meant that he " needed a strongly defined character to play " . He would make similar references throughout his life : when he appeared on The Muppet Show in 1978 , a guest appearance that earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Continuing or Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Variety or Music , he chose not to appear as himself , instead appearing in a variety of costumes and accents . When Kermit the Frog told Sellers he could relax and be himself , Sellers replied : 
 But that , you see , my dear Kermit , would be altogether impossible . I could never be myself ... You see , there is no me . I do not exist ... There used to be a me , but I had it surgically removed .

 In 1979 , Sellers starred alongside Lynne Frederick , Lionel Jeffries and <unk> Sommer in Richard Quine 's The Prisoner of Zenda . He portrayed three roles , including King Rudolf IV and King Rudolf V — rulers of the fictional small nation of <unk> — and Syd Frewin , Rudolf V 's half @-@ brother . Upon its release in May 1979 , the film was well received ; Janet Maslin of The New York Times observed how Sellers divided " his energies between a serious character and a funny one , but that it was his serious performance which was more impressive . " However , Philip French , for The Observer , was unimpressed by the film , describing it as " a mess of porridge " and stating that " Sellers reveals that he cannot draw the line between the sincere and the sentimental " . 
 Later in 1979 , Sellers starred opposite Shirley MacLaine , Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden in the black comedy Being There as Chance , a mindless , emotionless gardener addicted to watching TV . In a BBC interview in 1971 , Sellers had said that more than anything else , he wanted to play the role , and successfully persuaded the author of the book Jerzy Kosinski to allow him and director Hal Ashby to make the film , provided he could write the script . During filming , to remain in character , Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors . Sellers considered Chance 's walking and voice the character 's most important attributes , and in preparing for the role , he worked alone with a tape recorder , or with his wife , and then with Ashby , to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal " the childlike mind behind the words " . Sellers described his experience of working on the film as " so humbling , so powerful " , and co @-@ star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers " a dream " to work with . Sellers 's performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the " crowning triumph of Peter Sellers 's remarkable career " . Critic Frank Rich wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role , with a " schismatic personality that Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique ... A lesser actor would have made the character 's mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic ... [ His ] intelligence was always deeper , his onscreen confidence greater , his technique much more finely honed " : in achieving this , Sellers " makes the film 's fantastic premise credible " . The film earned Sellers a Best Actor award at the 51st National Board of Review Awards ; the London Critics Circle Film Awards Special Achievement Award , the Best Actor award at the 45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards ; and the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy award at the 37th Golden Globe Awards . Additionally , Sellers was nominated for the Best Actor award at the 52nd Academy Awards and the Best Actor in a Leading Role award at the 34th British Academy Film Awards . 
 In March 1980 Sellers asked his fifteen @-@ year @-@ old daughter Victoria what she thought about Being There : she reported later that , " I said yes , I thought it was great . But then I said , ' You looked like a little fat old man ' . ... he went mad . He threw his drink over me and told me to get the next plane home . " His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read " After what happened this morning with Victoria , I shall be happy if I never hear from you again . I won 't tell you what I think of you . It must be obvious . Goodbye , Your Father . " 
 Sellers 's last film was The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu , a comedic re @-@ imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer ; Sellers played both police inspector <unk> Smith and Fu Manchu , alongside Helen Mirren and David Tomlinson . The production of the film was troublesome before filming started , with two directors — Richard Quine and John <unk> — fired before the script had been completed . Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu with his ill @-@ health often causing delays . Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggard 's firing at Sellers 's instigation and Sellers took over direction , using his long @-@ time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences . Tom Shales of The Washington Post described the film as " an <unk> inept comedy " , adding that " it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers , a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment . " Manchu " will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill @-@ advised washouts as Tell Me Where It Hurts , The Bobo and The Prisoner of Zenda " . 
 Sellers 's final performances were a series of advertisements for Barclays Bank . Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland , he played Monty Casino , a Jewish con @-@ man . Four adverts were scheduled , but only three were filmed as Sellers collapsed in Dublin , again with heart problems . After two days in care — and against the advice of his doctors — he travelled to the Cannes Film Festival , where Being There was in competition . Sellers was again ill in Cannes , returning to his residence in Gstaad to work on the script for his next project , Romance of the Pink Panther . He agreed to undergo an angiogram at the Cedars @-@ Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , to see if he was able to undergo open @-@ heart surgery . Spike Milligan later considered that Sellers 's heart condition had lasted fifteen years and had " made life difficult for him and had a debilitating effect on his personality " . Sellers 's fourth marriage to Frederick collapsed soon after . 
 Sellers had recently started to rebuild his relationship with his son Michael after the failure of the latter 's marriage . Michael later said that " it marked the beginning of an all @-@ too @-@ brief closeness between us " . Sellers admitted to his son that " he hated so many things he had done " , including leaving his first wife , Anne , and his infatuation with Sophia Loren .

 On 21 July 1980 Sellers arrived in London from Geneva . He checked into the Dorchester hotel , before visiting Golders Green Crematorium for the first time to see the location of his parents ' ashes . He had plans to attend a reunion dinner with his Goon Show partners Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe , scheduled for the evening of 22 July . On the day of the dinner , Sellers took lunch in his hotel suite and shortly afterwards collapsed from a heart attack . He was taken to the Middlesex Hospital , London , and died just after midnight on 24 July 1980 , aged 54 . 
 Following Sellers 's death , fellow actor Richard Attenborough said that Sellers " had the genius comparable to Chaplin " , while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as " a man of enormous gifts ; and these gifts he gave to the world . For them , he is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment . " Burt Kwouk , who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films stated that " Peter was a well @-@ loved actor in Britain ... the day he died , it seemed that the whole country came to a stop . Everywhere you went , the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything " . Director Blake Edwards thought that " Peter was brilliant . He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual , unique facets of the character he was playing " . Sellers 's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers 's death , while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said " I 'm shattered . Peter was such a tremendous artist . He had so much talent , it just oozed out of him " ; in dark humour , referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned , he added , " Anything to avoid paying for dinner " . Secombe later declared to journalists " <unk> is <unk> now " . Milligan later said that " it 's hard to say this , but he died at the right time . " The Daily Mail described Sellers as " the greatest comic talent of his generation as well as a womanising drug @-@ taker who married four times in a fruitless search for happiness " , a " flawed genius " who , once he latched on to a comic idea , " loved nothing more than to carry it to extremes . " 
 A private funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 26 July , conducted by Sellers 's old friend , Canon John Hester . Sellers 's final joke was the playing of " In the Mood " by Glenn Miller , a tune he hated . His body was cremated and his ashes were interred at Golders Green Crematorium in London . After her death in 1994 , the ashes of his widow Frederick were co @-@ interred with his . A memorial service was held at St Martin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields on 8 September 1980 — what would have been Sellers 's 55th birthday . Close friend Lord Snowdon read the twenty @-@ third Psalm , Harry Secombe sang " Bread of Heaven " and the eulogy was read by David Niven . 
 Although Sellers was reportedly in the process of excluding Frederick from his will a week before he died , she inherited almost his entire estate worth an estimated £ 4 @.@ 5 million ( £ 17 @.@ 4 million in 2016 pounds ) while his children received £ 800 each ( £ 3 @,@ 094 in 2016 pounds ) . Spike Milligan appealed to her on behalf of Sellers 's three children , but she refused to increase the amount . Sellers 's only son , Michael , died of a heart attack at 52 during surgery on 24 July 2006 , twenty @-@ six years to the day after his father 's death . 
 In 1982 Blake Edwards tried to continue with Romance of the Pink Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore , who turned it down . Edwards subsequently released Trail of the Pink Panther , which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films . Frederick sued , claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract ; the court awarded her $ 1 million ( $ 2 @.@ 5 million today ) , plus 3 @.@ 15 per cent of the film 's profits and 1 @.@ 36 per cent of its gross revenue .

 Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of the Pink Panther films , " I 'm not sure why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team , though it may be because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all @-@ consuming , epic self @-@ absorption that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable — instead of alarming — and finally so funny . " Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers was one of the few comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters , giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life . A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that , regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are , he ensured that they always retain their dignity . On his playing of Clouseau , Sellers said : " I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world . The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot . I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching . " His biographer , Ed <unk> , notes that because of this retained dignity , Sellers is " the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are . " Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers 's performances in the Pink Panther films , which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment . Wesson considers that " As ' low ' and ' high ' comedy rolled into one , it 's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism " . This combination of " high " and " low " , exemplified by Clouseau 's attempting to retain dignity after a fall , means that within the film Clouseau was " the sole representative of humanity " . Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a " balance between character and absurdity " . Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy , Sellers could " inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being " . 
 Author Aaron <unk> observed that in Sellers 's early films , such as I 'm Alright Jack , he displays " deft , technical interpretations [ that ] pinpoint the mechanical nature of his comic characterization " , which " ... reduces each of his characters to a series of gross , awkward tics . " Academic Cynthia Baron observed that Sellers 's external characterisations led to doubt with reviewers as to whether Sellers 's work was " true " acting . Critic Tom Milne saw a change over Sellers 's career and thought that his " comic genius as a character actor was ... stifled by his elevation to leading man " and his later films suffered as a result . <unk> agreed , commenting that Sellers 's " exceptional vocal and physical technique " was under @-@ used during his career in the US . 
 Academics Maria <unk> and Tom Wallis remarked that Sellers fits the mould of a technical actor because he displays a mastery of physical characterisation , such as accent or physical trait . Writer and playwright John Mortimer saw the process for himself when Sellers was about to undertake filming on Mortimer 's The Dock Brief and could not decide how to play the character of the barrister . By chance he ordered cockles for lunch and the smell brought back a memory of the seaside town of Morecambe : this gave him " the idea of a faded North Country accent and the suggestion of a scrappy moustache " . So important was the voice as the starting point for character development , that Sellers would walk around London with a reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape recorder , recording voices to study at home .

 New York Magazine stated that all of the films starring Sellers as Clouseau showcased his " comedic brilliance . " Sellers 's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan said that Sellers " had one of the most glittering comic talents of his age " , while John and Roy Boulting noted that he was " the greatest comic genius this country has produced since Charles Chaplin " . Irv <unk> said that the most prominent albeit ever @-@ changing face in comedies of the sixties was Sellers who " changed like a chameleon throughout the era , dazzling audiences " . In a 2005 poll to find " The Comedian 's Comedian " , Sellers was voted 14 in the list of the top 20 greatest comedians by fellow comics and comedy insiders . Sellers and The Goon Show were a strong influence on the Monty Python performers , as well as on Peter Cook , who described Sellers as " the best comic actor in the world " . The British actor Stephen Mangan stated that Sellers was a large influence , as did the comedians Alan Carr and Rob Brydon . The comic performer Sacha Baron Cohen referred to Sellers as " the most seminal force in shaping [ his ] early ideas on comedy " . Cohen was considered for the role of Sellers in the biographical film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers . The three members of Spinal Tap — Michael McKean , Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer — have also cited Sellers as being an influence on them , as has the American talk @-@ show host Conan O 'Brien . David Schwimmer is another whose approach was influenced by Sellers : " he could do anything , from Dr Strangelove to Inspector Clouseau . He was just amazing . " Eddie Izzard notes that the Goons " influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as ' alternative ' " — including himself , while the media historian Graham McCann states " the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show ... would inspire , directly or indirectly and to varying extents , ... The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , The Young Ones , Vic Reeves Big Night Out , The League of Gentlemen [ and ] Brass Eye . " 
 The stage play Being Sellers premiered in Australia in 1998 , three years after the release of the biography by Roger Lewis , The Life and Death of Peter Sellers . In 2004 , the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title , starring Geoffrey Rush . The play later transferred to New York in December 2010 . The Belfast Telegraph notes how the film captured Sellers 's " life of drugs , drink , fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women " . Although the film was widely praised by critics , both Lord Snowdon and Britt Ekland were highly critical of the film and the enactment of Sellers ; Ekland believed that the film left the audiences with the wrong idea of her former husband , saying " the film leaves you with the impression that Peter Sellers was essentially a likeable man when in reality he was a monster . He may have been a brilliant actor , but as a human being he had no saving graces at all " . Snowdon disagreed with Ekland 's verdict , and with the film , and stated that Sellers " had a light touch , a sense of humour , I can 't bear to see him portrayed as somebody who was apparently without either ... The man on the screen is charmless , humourless and boring — the one thing you could never say about Peter . "

 = " Weird Al " Yankovic ( album ) = 
 " Weird Al " Yankovic is the eponymous debut album by American parodist Alfred " Weird Al " Yankovic . The album was the first of many produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer . Mostly recorded in March 1982 , the album was released by Rock ' n Roll Records as an LP and on Compact Cassette in 1983 . 
 Consisting of five direct parodies and seven original songs , " Weird Al " Yankovic parodies pop and rock music of the late 1970s and early 1980s , and satirizes American culture and experiences of the same time period . Half of the album is made up of parodies , featuring jabs at Toni Basil , Joan Jett , Stevie Nicks , The Knack , and Queen . Yankovic 's trademark instrument , the accordion , is used on all songs featured on the album . 
 Fueled by the underground success of the singles " My Bologna " and " Another One Rides the Bus " , the album charted at 139 on the Billboard 200 . Critically , however , the album received a lukewarm reception , with many reviewers feeling that Yankovic was a throw @-@ away act , and someone who could not overcome the stigma of a novelty record . 
 = = Production = = 
 After hearing Yankovic 's parody of his song " I Love Rock ' n ' Roll " , " I Love Rocky Road " , songwriter Jake Hooker suggested to guitarist Rick Derringer that he would be the perfect producer for the burgeoning parodist . Agreeing , Derringer used his music industry prestige and convinced Cherokee Studios to record an album 's worth of Yankovic 's songs gratis , to be paid from sales revenue . Then , in March 1982 , " Weird Al " Yankovic stepped into a professional recording studio for the first time and recorded nine of the songs for " Weird Al " Yankovic . 
 The huge irony of my life ; [ ... ] it was difficult for me to get signed to a record deal back in early 80s because all the executives were saying " Oh , you do that ... novelty music . You 're gonna have maybe one hit if you 're lucky and then [ ... ] you 'll go right to oblivion . You know , nobody 'll ever hear from you again . " 
 After encountering difficulty picking up a record label for the first @-@ time album , Jay Levey ( a Los Angeles artists ' manager ) provided <unk> @-@ FM with a copy of " I Love Rocky Road " . <unk> the program director of the Top 40 station , he played it immediately ; " I Love Rocky Road " was one of the most @-@ requested songs by the next day . At the same time , Tad Dowd — head of the new record label , Rock ' n Roll Records — had been trying to convince parent company Scotti Brothers Records to sign the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Yankovic . The positive furor over the <unk> playtest provided Dowd with the leverage needed to convince Scotti Bros. to offer a contract for Yankovic 's first album . 
 Scotti Brothers Records ' contract planned an April 1983 release date for a twelve @-@ track album : " I Love Rocky Road " and eight other tracks were already recorded , " Another One Rides the Bus " would be the original 1980 live recording from The Dr. Demento Show , and the last two songs ( " Ricky " and " Buckingham Blues " ) would be recorded at Scotti Brothers ' own studios in Santa Monica , California . 
 To promote the album , Levey coordinated a three @-@ week tour in late Summer 1983 across the United States ' East Coast and Midwest for both Yankovic and Dr. Demento . Promoted as " An Evening of Dementia with Dr. Demento in Person Plus ' Weird Al ' Yankovic " , Demento opened with recorded hits and short comedy films from his show before introducing Yankovic and the band . During their three weeks , the tour played in several famous clubs , including The Bottom Line in New York City . 
 The album cover for " Weird Al " Yankovic was designed by Brazilian artist Rogerio . The band chose Rogerio because of his " MAD Magazine @-@ like drawing style . " The cover art specifically features individual elements that correspond with each of the album 's twelve songs . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Eugene Chadbourne , reviewer for Allmusic , felt that while " Weird Al " Yankovic was a detailed harbinger of parody to come , the album does not hold up well on its own . Chadbourne extolled most of the parodies ( " Another One Rides the Bus " , " My Bologna " , " I Love Rocky Road " ) for their comedic value in contrast with their originals — songs he supposed to be " pretentious [ & ] overblown " . However , also according to Chadbourne , " Ricky " lacks the comedic connection Yankovic cultivates in later albums , and the original songs " may not seem like they were written in ten minutes , but the ideas behind them don 't seem to involve that much contemplation . [ They 're ] like little bits of puff [ whose ... ] impact on the flow of an album side is more like ballast . " 
 Introducing Yankovic as the guest DJ for All Songs Considered on National Public Radio in 2006 , host Bob Boilen opined that upon his debut , Yankovic " seemed the epitome of throw @-@ away novelty act " . Reviewing Yankovic in 2008 , Brian Raftery of Wired magazine wrote that " Ricky " introduced the world to " an accordion @-@ playing spaz with a coif like Rick James and a voice like an urgent goose . " In 1983 , Yankovic was considered a fad of the time — comparing him to parachute pants and Contras — and " thoroughly disposable . " Musical <unk> and review websites Allmusic and Artistdirect rated " Weird Al " Yankovic three and a half out of five stars . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Weird Al " Yankovic is the only album in Yankovic 's discography in which the accordion is prevalent in every song ; in subsequent albums it 's only used where deemed appropriate or wholly inappropriate for comedic effect . " Ricky " is a parody of " Mickey " by Toni Basil ; an ode to I Love Lucy with Yankovic performing as Ricky and Tress MacNeille as Lucy . " Gotta Boogie " is a play on words discussing a man with a " boogie " on his finger and his quandary therein . " I Love Rocky Road " is a parody of Arrows ' " I Love Rock ' n ' Roll " made famous by Joan Jett ; in the song the narrator expresses feelings about the titular ice cream flavor . " Buckingham Blues " is a blues song satirizing the socialite lifestyle of the Prince and Princess of Wales ( Prince Charles and Diana ) . Originally , the song was going to be a parody of " Jack & Diane " by John Mellencamp ; worried about spoiling a Jack and Diane movie deal , Mellencamp shot down the parody . Yankovic considered tweaking the " Jack & Diane " melody to avoid the song being a true parody , but decided against it and later rewrote it as an original song . Answering a fan in 1998 , Yankovic replied that he would not rewrite and rerecord the song in light of the death of Diana . 
 " Happy Birthday " is a style parody of Tonio K , one of Yankovic 's favorite artists . The song is a morbidly depressing birthday song detailing ails of the world , including poverty , nuclear holocaust , and eventual solar cataclysm . Only seeing two popular birthday songs at the time — " Happy Birthday to You " by Patty and Mildred J. Hill , and " Birthday " by The Beatles — Yankovic decided to write his own " severely twisted version of one . " " Stop Draggin ' My Car Around " is a parody of " Stop Draggin ' My Heart Around " by Stevie Nicks ; the lament of an otherwise " cool guy " forced to repeatedly save his 1964 Plymouth car from impoundment due to illegal parking , shame , and non @-@ payment . " My Bologna " is a parody of " My Sharona " by The Knack ; the narrator talks about his obsession with bologna sausage . This is a re @-@ recording of the song ; the original Capitol Records single version would not appear on a " Weird Al " album until the 1994 box set Permanent Record : Al in the Box . " The Check 's in the Mail " parodies business @-@ related prevarications , <unk> avoidance , litigation , and the titular payment delay . " Another One Rides the Bus " is a parody of " Another One Bites the Dust " by Queen ; the narrator laments about a crowded public bus . This is the original 1980 recording from The Dr. Demento Show . " I 'll Be Mellow When I 'm Dead " is a rejection of the stereotypical attitudes and accoutrements of the hippie / yuppie lifestyles . 
 " Such a Groovy Guy " parodies narcissism specifically noting fashion , demeanor , dominance and submission , and relationship breakup . Yankovic wrote the song for a woman he was dating in homage of her previous boyfriend who , upon the breakup asked her , " I ’ m such a groovy guy ! Why would you break up with me ? " Out of concern the individual may not be aware of his status , Yankovic does not identify him . " Mr. Frump in the Iron Lung " is an audience favorite from Yankovic 's days playing in coffeehouses at Cal Poly ; the song describes the rather lopsided relationship between the narrator and the eponymous " Mr. Frump " in his iron lung , until the latter 's death . The sound of the iron lung is an accordion 's air release valve . " It 's Still Billy Joel to Me " , Yankovic 's 1980 parody of Billy Joel 's " It 's Still Rock and Roll to Me " , was originally planned for this album . Wary of the song being considered " dated " three years later , and doubtful that Joel would give his blessing , the band never bothered to ask . Yankovic 's parody of The Kinks ' song " Lola " — " Yoda " — was written in 1980 ( during the initial theatre run of The Empire Strikes Back ) , and a " huge hit " on The Dr. Demento Show . However , the complexities of receiving permission from filmmaker George Lucas and the Kinks ' publishers delayed its release until 1985 .

 = Shays ' Rebellion = 
 Shays ' Rebellion was an armed uprising in Massachusetts ( mostly in and around Springfield ) during 1786 and 1787 . Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led four thousand rebels ( called Shaysites ) in rising up against perceived economic injustices and suspension of civil rights ( including multiple eviction and foreclosure notices ) by Massachusetts , and in a later attempt to capture the United States ' national weapons arsenal at the U.S. Armory at Springfield . Although Shays ' Rebellion met with defeat militarily against a privately raised militia , it prompted numerous national leaders ( including George Washington , who came out of retirement to deal with issues raised by Shays ' Rebellion ) to call for a stronger national government to suppress future rebellions , resulting in the U.S. Constitutional Convention and according to historian Leonard L. Richards , " fundamentally altering the course of U.S. history . " 
 The rebellion took place in a political climate where reform of the country 's governing document , the Articles of Confederation , was widely seen as necessary . The events of the rebellion , some of which occurred after the Philadelphia Convention had been called but before it began in May 1787 , are widely seen to have affected the debates on the shape of the new government . The shock of Shays ' Rebellion drew retired General George Washington back into public life , leading to his terms as the United States ' first President . The exact nature and consequence of the rebellion 's influence on the content of the Constitution and the ratification debates continues to be a subject of historical discussion and debate . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the rural parts of New England , particularly in the hill @-@ towns of central and western Massachusetts , the economy during the American Revolutionary War had been one of little more than subsistence agriculture . Some residents in these areas had little in the way of assets beyond their land , and bartered with one another for goods or services . In lean times , farmers might obtain goods on credit from suppliers in local market towns who would be paid when times were better . 
 In the more economically developed coastal areas of Massachusetts Bay and in the fertile Connecticut River Valley , the economy was basically a market economy , driven by the activities of wholesale merchants dealing with Europe , the West Indies and elsewhere on the North American coast . Not surprisingly , the state government was dominated by this merchant class . 
 When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783 , the European business partners of Massachusetts merchants refused to extend lines of credit to them and insisted that they pay for goods with hard currency . Despite the continent @-@ wide shortage of such currency , merchants began to demand the same from their local business partners , including those merchants operating in the market towns in the state 's interior . Many of these merchants passed on this demand to their customers , although the popular governor , John Hancock , did not impose hard currency demands on poorer borrowers and refused to actively prosecute the collection of delinquent taxes . 
 The rural farming population was generally unable to meet the demands being made of them by merchants or the civil authorities , and individuals began to lose their land and other possessions when they were unable to fulfill their debt and tax obligations . This led to strong resentments against tax collectors and the courts , where creditors obtained and enforced judgments against debtors , and where tax collectors obtained judgments authorizing property seizures . 
 At a meeting convened by aggrieved commoners , a farmer identified as " Plough <unk> " , encapsulated the situation : 
 " I have been greatly abused , have been obliged to do more than my part in the war , been loaded with class rates , town rates , province rates , Continental rates and all rates ... been pulled and hauled by sheriffs , constables and collectors , and had my cattle sold for less than they were worth ... The great men are going to get all we have and I think it is time for us to rise and put a stop to it , and have no more courts , nor sheriffs , nor collectors nor lawyers . " 
 Overlaid upon these financial issues was the fact that veterans of the war had received little pay during the war and faced difficulty collecting pay owed them from the State or the Congress of the Confederation . Some of the soldiers , Daniel Shays among them , began to organize protests against these oppressive economic conditions . Shays was a farmhand from Massachusetts when the Revolution broke out ; he joined the Continental Army , saw action at the Battles of Lexington and Concord , Bunker Hill and Saratoga , and was eventually wounded in action . In 1780 , he resigned from the army unpaid and went home to find himself in court for nonpayment of debts . He soon realized that he was not alone in his inability to pay his debts and began organizing for debt relief . 
 = = Early rumblings = = 
 One early protest against the government was led by Job Shattuck of Groton , who in 1782 organized residents there to physically prevent tax collectors from doing their work . A second , larger @-@ scale protest took place in the central Massachusetts town of Uxbridge , in Worcester County , on Feb. 3 , 1783 , when a mob seized property that had been confiscated by a local constable and returned it to its owners . Governor Hancock ordered the sheriff to suppress these actions . 
 Most rural communities , however , attempted to use the legislative process to gain relief . Petitions and proposals were repeatedly submitted to the state legislature to issue paper currency . Such inflationary issues would depreciate the currency , making it possible to meet obligations made at high values with lower @-@ valued paper . The merchants , among them James Bowdoin , were opposed to the idea , since they were generally lenders who stood to lose from such proposals . As a result , these proposals were repeatedly rejected . Governor Hancock , accused by some of anticipating trouble , resigned citing health reasons in early 1785 . When Bowdoin ( a perennial loser to Hancock in earlier elections ) was elected governor that year , matters became more severe . Bowdoin stepped up civil actions to collect back taxes , and the legislature exacerbated the situation by levying an additional property tax to raise funds for the state 's portion of foreign debt payments . Even comparatively conservative commentators such as John Adams observed that these levies were " heavier than the People could bear . " 
 = = Shutting down the courts = = 
 Protests in the rural Massachusetts turned into direct action in August 1786 , after the state legislature adjourned without considering the many petitions that had been sent to Boston . On August 29 a well @-@ organized force of protestors formed in Northampton and successfully prevented the county court from sitting . The leaders of this and later forces proclaimed that they were seeking relief from the burdensome judicial processes that were depriving the people of their land and possessions . They called themselves Regulators , a reference to the Regulator movement of North Carolina that sought to reform corrupt practices in the late 1760s . 
 On September 2 Governor Bowdoin issued a proclamation denouncing such mob action , but took no military measures beyond planning militia response to future actions . When the court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5 , the county militia ( composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors ) refused to turn out , much to Bowdoin 's amazement . Governors of the neighboring states where similar protests took place acted decisively , calling out the militia to hunt down the ringleaders after the first such protests . In Rhode Island , matters were resolved without violence because the " country party " gained control of the legislature in 1786 and enacted measures forcing its merchant elites to trade debt instruments for devalued currency . The impact of this was not lost on Boston 's merchants , especially Bowdoin , who held more than £ 3 @,@ 000 in Massachusetts notes . 
 Daniel Shays , who had participated in the Northampton action , began to take a more active role in the uprising in November , though he firmly denied that he was one of its leaders . On September 19 , the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts indicted eleven leaders of the rebellion as " disorderly , riotous , and seditious persons . " When the supreme judicial court was next scheduled to meet in Springfield on September 26 , Shays in Hampshire County and Luke Day in what is now Hampden County ( but was then part of Hampshire County ) organized an attempt to shut it down . They were anticipated by William Shepard , the local militia commander , who began gathering government @-@ supporting militia the Saturday before the court was to sit . By the time the court was ready to open , Shepard had 300 men protecting the Springfield courthouse . Shays and Day were able to recruit a similar number , but chose only to demonstrate , exercising their troops outside Shepard 's lines , rather than attempt to seize the building . The judges first postponed the hearings , and then adjourned on the 28th without hearing any cases . Shepard withdrew his force , which had grown to some 800 men ( to the Regulators ' 1 @,@ 200 ) , to the federal armory , which was then only rumored to be the target of seizure by the activists . 
 Protests in Great Barrington , Concord , and Taunton were also successful in shutting courts down in those communities in September and October . James Warren wrote to John Adams on October 22 , " We are now in a state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War . " Courts in the larger towns and cities were able to meet , but required protection of the militia , which Bowdoin called out for the purpose . 
 The Boston elites were mortified at this resistance . Governor Bowdoin commanded the legislature to " vindicate the insulted dignity of government . " Samuel Adams claimed that foreigners ( " British emissaries " ) were instigating treason among the commoners , and he helped draw up a Riot Act , and a resolution suspending habeas corpus in order to permit the authorities to keep people in jail without trial . Adams even proposed a new legal distinction : that rebellion in a republic , unlike in a monarchy , should be punished by execution . The legislature also moved to make some concessions to the upset farmers , saying certain old taxes could now be paid in goods instead of hard currency . These measures were followed up by one prohibiting speech critical of the government , and offering pardons to protestors willing to take an oath of allegiance . These legislative actions were unsuccessful in quelling the protests , and the suspension of habeas corpus alarmed many . 
 In late November warrants were issued for the arrest of several of the protest ringleaders . On November 28 a posse of some 300 men rode to Groton to arrest Job Shattuck and other rebel leaders in the area . Shattuck was chased down and arrested on the 30th , and was wounded by a sword slash in the process . This action and the arrest of other protest leaders in the eastern parts of the state radicalized those in the west , and they began to organize an overthrow of the state government . " The seeds of war are now sown " , wrote one correspondent in Shrewsbury , and by mid @-@ January rebel leaders spoke of smashing the " tyrannical government of Massachusetts . " 
 = = Rebellion = = 
 Since the federal government had been unable to recruit soldiers for the army ( primarily because of a lack of funding ) , the Massachusetts elites determined to act independently . On January 4 , 1787 , Governor Bowdoin proposed creation of a privately funded militia army . Former Continental Army General Benjamin Lincoln solicited funds , and had by the end of January raised more than £ 6 @,@ 000 from more than 125 merchants . The 3 @,@ 000 militia that were recruited into this army were almost entirely from the eastern counties of Massachusetts , and marched to Worcester on January 19 . 
 While the government forces organized , Shays , Day , and other rebel leaders in the west organized their forces , establishing regional regimental organizations that were run by democratically elected committees . Their first major target was the federal armory in Springfield . General Shepard had however , pursuant to orders from Governor Bowdoin , taken possession of the armory and used its arsenal to arm a force of some 1 @,@ 200 militia . He had done this despite the fact that the armory was federal , not state , property , and that he did not have permission from Secretary at War Henry Knox to do so . 
 The insurgents were organized into three major groups , and intended to surround and simultaneously attack the armory . Shays had one group east of Springfield near Palmer , Luke Day had a second force across the Connecticut River in West Springfield , and the third force , under Eli Parsons , was to the north at Chicopee . The rebels had planned their assault for January 25 , but Luke Day changed this at the last minute , sending Shays a message indicating he would not be ready to attack until the 26th . Day 's message was intercepted by Shepard 's men , so the militia of Shays and Parsons , some 1 @,@ 500 men , approached the armory on the 25th not knowing they would have no support from the west . 
 When Shays and his forces neared the armory , they found Shepard 's militia waiting for them . Shepard first ordered warning shots fired over the approaching Shaysites ' heads , and then ordered two cannons to fire grape shot at Shays ' men . Four Shaysites were killed and twenty wounded . There was no musket fire from either side , and the rebel advance collapsed . Most of the rebel force fled north , eventually regrouping at Amherst . On the opposite side of the river , Day 's forces also fled north , also eventually reaching Amherst . 
 General Lincoln , when he heard of the Springfield incident , immediately began marching west from Worcester with the 3 @,@ 000 men that had mustered . The rebels moved generally north and east to avoid Lincoln , eventually establishing a camp at Petersham ; along the way they raided the shops of local merchants for supplies , taking some of them hostage . Lincoln pursued them , reaching Pelham , some 30 miles ( 48 km ) from Petersham , on February 2 . On the night of February 3 – 4 , he led his militia on a forced march to Petersham through a bitter snowstorm . Arriving early in the morning , they surprised the rebel camp so thoroughly that they scattered " without time to call in their out parties or even their guards . " Although Lincoln claimed to capture 150 men , none of them were officers , leading historian Leonard Richards to suspect the veracity of the report . Most of the leadership escaped north into New Hampshire and Vermont , where they were sheltered despite repeated demands that they be returned to Massachusetts for trial . 
 = = Mopping up = = 
 Lincoln 's march marked the end of large @-@ scale organized resistance . <unk> who eluded capture fled to neighboring states , and pockets of local resistance continued . Some rebel leaders approached Lord Dorchester , the British governor of Quebec for assistance , who was reported to promise assistance in the form of Mohawk warriors led by Joseph Brant . ( Dorchester 's proposal was vetoed in London , and no assistance came to the rebels . ) 
 The same day that Lincoln arrived at Petersham , the state legislature passed bills authorizing a state of martial law , giving the governor broad powers to act against the rebels . The bills also authorized state payments to reimburse Lincoln and the merchants who had funded the army , and authorized the recruitment of additional militia . On February 12 the legislature passed the Disqualification Act , seeking to prevent a legislative response by rebel sympathizers . This bill expressly forbade any acknowledged rebels from holding a variety of elected and appointed offices . 
 Most of Lincoln 's army melted away in late February as enlistments expired ; by the end of the month he commanded but thirty men at a base in Pittsfield . In the meantime some 120 rebels had regrouped in New Lebanon , New York , and on February 27 they crossed the border . Marching first on Stockbridge , a major market town in the southwestern corner of the state , they raided the shops of merchants and the homes of merchants and local professionals . This came to the attention of Brigadier John Ashley , who mustered a force of some 80 men , and caught up with the rebels in nearby Sheffield late in the day . In the bloodiest encounter of the rebellion , 30 rebels were wounded ( one mortally ) , at least one government soldier was killed , and many were wounded . Ashley , who was further reinforced after the encounter , reported taking 150 prisoners . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 Four thousand people signed confessions acknowledging participation in the events of the rebellion ( in exchange for amnesty ) ; several hundred participants were eventually indicted on charges relating to the rebellion . Most of these were pardoned under a general amnesty that only excluded a few ringleaders . Eighteen men were convicted and sentenced to death , but most of these were either overturned on appeal , pardoned , or had their sentences commuted . Two of the condemned men , John Bly and Charles Rose , were hanged on December 6 , 1787 . Shays himself was pardoned in 1788 and he returned to Massachusetts from hiding in the Vermont woods . He was , however , vilified by the Boston press , who painted him as an archetypal anarchist opposed to the government . He later moved to the <unk> , New York , area , where he lived until he died poor and obscure in 1825 . 
 The crushing of the rebellion and the harsh terms of reconciliation imposed by the Disqualification Act all worked against Governor Bowdoin politically . In the gubernatorial election held in April 1787 , Bowdoin received few votes from the rural parts of the state , and was trounced by John Hancock . The military victory was tempered by tax changes in subsequent years . The legislature elected in 1787 cut taxes and placed a moratorium on debts . It also refocused state spending away from interest payments , resulting in a 30 % decline in the value of Massachusetts securities as those payments fell in arrears . 
 Vermont , then an unrecognized independent republic that had been seeking statehood independent from New York 's claims to the territory , became an unexpected beneficiary of the rebellion due to its sheltering of the rebel ringleaders . Alexander Hamilton broke from other New Yorkers , including major landowners with claims on Vermont territory , calling for the state to recognize and support Vermont 's bid for admission to the union . He cited Vermont 's de facto independence and its ability to cause trouble by providing support to the discontented from neighboring states as reasons , and introduced legislation that broke the impasse between New York and Vermont . Vermonters responded favorably to the overture , publicly pushing Eli Parsons and Luke Day out of the state ( but quietly continuing to support others ) . After negotiations with New York and the passage of the new constitution , Vermont became the fourteenth state . 
 = = Impact on Constitution = = 
 Thomas Jefferson , who was serving as ambassador to France at the time , refused to be alarmed by Shays ' Rebellion . In a letter to James Madison on January 30 , 1787 , he argued that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing . " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . It is its natural manure . " In contrast to Jefferson 's sentiments George Washington , who had been calling for constitutional reform for many years , wrote in a letter to Henry Lee , " You talk , my good sir , of employing influence to appease the present tumults in Massachusetts . I know not where that influence is to be found , or , if attainable , that it would be a proper remedy for the disorders . Influence is not government . Let us have a government by which our lives , liberties , and properties will be secured , or let us know the worst at once . " 
 = = = Influence on Constitutional Convention = = = 
 At the time of the rebellion , the weaknesses of the federal government as constituted under the Articles of Confederation were apparent to many . A vigorous debate was going on throughout the states on the need for a stronger central government , with Federalists arguing for the idea , and Anti @-@ Federalists opposing them . Historical opinion is divided on what sort of role the rebellion played in the formation and later ratification of the United States Constitution , although most scholars agree it played some role , at least temporarily drawing some anti @-@ Federalists to the strong government side . By early 1785 many influential merchants and political leaders were already agreed that a stronger central government was needed . A convention at Annapolis , Maryland , in September 1786 of delegates from five states concluded that vigorous steps needed to be taken to reform the federal government , but it disbanded because of a lack of full representation , calling for a convention of all the states to be held in Philadelphia in May 1787 . Historian Robert <unk> notes that several prominent figures had hoped that convention would fail , requiring a larger @-@ scale convention , and French diplomat Louis @-@ Guillaume Otto thought the convention was intentionally broken off early to achieve this end . 
 In early 1787 John Jay wrote that the rural disturbances and the inability of the central government to fund troops in response made " the inefficiency of the Federal government [ become ] more and more manifest . " Henry Knox observed that the uprising in Massachusetts clearly influenced local leaders who had previously opposed a strong federal government . Historian David Szatmary writes that the timing of the rebellion " convinced the elites of sovereign states that the proposed gathering at Philadelphia must take place . " Some states , Massachusetts among them , delayed choosing delegates to the proposed convention , in part because in some ways it resembled the " extra @-@ legal " conventions organized by the protestors before the rebellion became violent . 
 = = = Influence on Constitution = = = 
 The convention that met in Philadelphia was dominated by strong @-@ government advocates . Delegate Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut argued that because the people could not be trusted ( as exemplified by Shays ' Rebellion ) , the members of the federal House of Representatives should be chosen by state legislatures , not by popular vote . The example of Shays ' Rebellion may also have been influential in the addition of language to the constitution concerning the ability of states to manage domestic violence , and their ability to demand the return of individuals from other states for trial . The rebellion also played a role in the discussion of a number of the executives . While mindful of tyranny , delegates of the Constitutional Convention thought that the single executive would be more effective in responding to national disturbances . Federalists cited the rebellion as an example of the confederation government 's weaknesses , while opponents such as Elbridge Gerry thought that a federal response to the rebellion would have been even worse than that of the state . ( Gerry , a merchant speculator and Massachusetts delegate from Essex County , was one of the few convention delegates who refused to sign the new constitution , although his reasons for doing so did not stem from the rebellion . ) 
 = = = Influence on ratification = = = 
 When the constitution had been drafted , Massachusetts was viewed by Federalists as a state that might not ratify it , because of widespread anti @-@ Federalist sentiment in the rural parts of the state . Massachusetts Federalists , including Henry Knox , were active in courting swing votes in the debates leading up to the state 's ratifying convention in 1788 . When the vote was taken on February 6 , 1788 , representatives of rural communities involved in the rebellion voted against ratification by a wide margin , but the day was carried by a coalition of merchants , urban elites , and market town leaders . The state ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168 . 
 Historians are divided on the impact the rebellion had on the ratification debates . Robert <unk> notes that major Federalist pamphleteers rarely mentioned it , and that some anti @-@ Federalists used the fact that Massachusetts survived the rebellion as evidence that a new constitution was unnecessary . However , Leonard Richards counters that publications like the Pennsylvania Gazette explicitly tied anti @-@ Federalist opinion to the rebel cause , calling opponents of the new constitution " Shaysites " and the Federalists " Washingtonians " . David Szatmary argues that debate in some states was affected , particularly in Massachusetts , where the rebellion had a polarizing effect . Richards records Henry Jackson 's observation that opposition to ratification in Massachusetts was motivated by " that cursed spirit of insurgency " , but that broader opposition in other states originated in other constitutional concerns expressed by Elbridge Gerry , who published a widely distributed pamphlet outlining his concerns about the vagueness of some of the powers granted in the constitution and its lack of a Bill of Rights . 
 The military powers enshrined in the constitution were soon put to use by President George Washington . After the passage by the United States Congress of the Whiskey Act , protest against the taxes it imposed began in western Pennsylvania . The protests escalated and Washington led federal and state militia to put down what is now known as the Whiskey Rebellion .

 " Throb " is a song by American singer Janet Jackson from her fifth studio album , janet . ( 1993 ) . It was written and produced by Jackson , James Harris III and Terry Lewis and is a house song which lyrically is about sex with a partner . It was released commercially in the Netherlands as the album 's sixth single on June 18 , 1994 , while in the United States it was a radio @-@ only release . 
 " Throb " was well received by critics who appreciated its production . While it did not chart in the Netherlands , in the United States the song peaked at number 66 on the airplay chart and number two on the Hot Dance Club Play chart . The song was performed on three of Jackson 's tours .

 " Throb " begins with Jackson saying " come for me " , before promising to " boom , boom , boom until noon , noon , noon " with her sexual partner . " I can feel your body / pressed against my body / Wrap yourself around me / Love to feel you throbbing " , the singer sang amid moans , elements of house music , C & C Music Factory @-@ esque beats and a saxophone loop . Chuck Arnold from Philadelphia Daily News noted the song 's " surprisingly frank dirty talk " with the lyric " I can feel your body / Pressed against my body / When you start to <unk> ' / Love to feel you <unk> ' " . MuuMuse described the song writing that the track " swells and deflates in an aching , circular motion – not unlike a musical orgasm " . 
 An exclusive remix of " Throb " , the Morales <unk> Mix , was included on Jackson 's remix compilation album Janet Remixed in 1995 . Peter Rauhofer remixed " Throb " in 2013 and released the remix on Valentine 's Day .

 " Throb " received positive reviews from music critics . Billboard , while reviewing the album on its twentieth anniversary , said , " If the production sounds a little dated now , the overtly sexual vibes on this track are pretty timeless – and still risqué for the early 90s . " Robert Christgau called the song " orgiastic " . MuuMuse gave a positive review for " Throb " , defining it as " a ' 90 's purist 's house track , featuring classic dance rhythms and beat breaks " . The reviewer continued saying the song is " a much grittier experience than the slinky seduction " of Madonna 's " Erotica " single released the year before , and finished saying " Surprisingly however , the track has aged brilliantly , and listening to it now is still an overly enjoyable experience " . 
 Sputnikmusic considered that " Throb " has a " sexy workout feel " . Philadelphia Daily News 's Chuck Arnold called the song a " deep house jam with a <unk> ' bass line " . A reviewer for <unk> commented that for the " pulsing " song , Jackson became a house music diva . Complex noted that " Throb " is " the hip @-@ house tantric jam that 's Janet at her most explicit : moans , groans , ' damn , baby ' , you get the picture , yes " . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented : " Even the nearly structure @-@ less ' Throb ' , [ ... ] feels like a ( perhaps unintentional ) parody of Madonna 's ' Erotica ' , right down to the hard , house @-@ orgy beats .

 = Phallus calongei = 
 Phallus calongei is a species of stinkhorn mushroom . Found in Pakistan , it was described as new to science in 2009 . Starting out as an " egg " , the fully expanded fruit body consists of a single , thick , stipe with a cap attached to the apex and covered with olive @-@ green , slimy spore @-@ containing gleba . It is distinguished from other similar Phallus species by a combination of features , including a pinkish , reticulated ( network @-@ like ) cap , and a stipe that is tapered at both ends . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown . 
 = = Discovery , taxonomy and classification = = 
 Phallus calongei was discovered on June 16 , 2008 , near the <unk> stream in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( formerly known as the North Western Frontier Province ) in Pakistan . It was described as new to science in a 2009 Mycotaxon publication . The specific epithet calongei honors Spanish mycologist Francisco D. Calonge who has written extensively on the Gasteromycetes , and who has himself published or co @-@ published three Phallus species : P. <unk> ( Kreisel & Calonge ) , P. maderensis ( Calonge ) and P. <unk> ( Kreisel & Calonge ) . P. calongei is one of four Phallus species known to exist in Pakistan , the others being P. <unk> , P. impudicus , and P. <unk> . 
 According to the infrageneric classification scheme proposed by German mycologist Hanns Kreisel in 1996 , Phallus calongei belongs in the subgenus Phallus , section <unk> of the genus Phallus . Other species in this section include P. <unk> , P. tenuis , P. <unk> , P. <unk> , P. multicolor , and P. cinnabarinus . A number of features distinguish P. calongei from these , including : an undeveloped white volva , a stipe tapered at both ends , a deeply pitted and reticulate cap surface with pinkish ridges , and no indusium ( a lacy " skirt " hanging from the cap , present in some Phallus species ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 As a member of the genus Phallus , the shape of P. calongei mushrooms assume the general form of a phallus ( an erect human penis ) with a single elongated hollow stipe topped by a bulbous cap @-@ like structure at the apex . The fruit bodies of P. calongei start out appearing similar to whitish " eggs " , with a membranous exoperidium ( outer tissue layer ) and gelatinous , translucent endoperidium ( inner tissue layer ) . The fully expanded fruit body consists of a single , thick , stalk with a ridged and pitted cap attached to the apex ; the cap is covered with olive @-@ green , slimy gleba . The fruit body can reach up to 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) tall and 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . It is whitish and hollow , slightly tapered at both ends , and has a wall that consists of layers of perforated chambers . At the apex of the stalk is the " cap " , which can be up to 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) high and 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick . It is bell @-@ shaped to conical @-@ truncate with a pitted surface . As the gleba dissipates , the cap surface becomes strongly reticulated — forming a network of raised pinkish ridges . The tip of the cap is truncated , with a depressed and perforated surface . The gleba is olive @-@ green , fetid , and deliquescent ( melting away gradually ) . The spores are ellipsoid , smooth , and hyaline ( translucent ) , measuring 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 by 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 0 µm . The exoperidium of the " egg " remains at the base of the fruit body as a thin , membranous , undeveloped white volva . The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The only other Phallus species known with a pinkish @-@ colored cap is P. <unk> ; its conical cap has a surface that is wrinkled , not reticulate . Other similar species include P. hadriani , which has a purple volva , P. <unk> , which has a reddish volva , and P. <unk> , which has a pale pink stipe and volva . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 All species of Phallus are known to be saprobic , feeding off dead and decaying organic matter . P. calongei is known only from the type locality in Pakistan , where it was found growing on the ground at 2 @,@ 575 metres ( 8 @,@ 448 ft ) above sea level . 
 = Tropical Storm Delta ( 2005 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Delta was a late @-@ forming tropical storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season which struck the Canary Islands as a strong extratropical storm , causing significant damage and then crossed over Morocco before dissipating . It was the twenty @-@ sixth tropical or subtropical storm of the season , making the 2005 season the first to record so many storms . 
 Tropical Storm Delta , like most late @-@ season storms , developed out of an extratropical low . The storm gradually gained tropical characteristics and was briefly a subtropical storm on November 22 . Delta moved erratically for a few days before moving towards the Canary Islands . It became extratropical just before it passed to the north of the archipelago . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On November 19 , a broad area of eastward @-@ moving low pressure formed in the central Atlantic Ocean about 1400 miles ( 2200 km ) southwest of the Azores . It moved steadily eastward through November 20 , but on November 21 , under the influence of a cold front to its north , the low turned northeastward and started to develop central convection . On November 22 , the non @-@ tropical low pressure system began to gain some tropical characteristics , and its northward motion slowed to a stop . Late that afternoon , the low transitioned into a subtropical storm while stalled about 800 mi ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) west @-@ southwest of the Azores . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center considered that the storm had already gained enough tropical characteristics to be classified as a tropical storm , but in post @-@ storm analysis , this was reconsidered . 
 The storm 's convection organized around a central core , and the system became a tropical storm on November 23 and received the name Delta . An eye @-@ like feature appeared near the storm 's circulatory center several times that day . The larger @-@ scale deep @-@ layered cyclonic circulation within which it was embedded steered it on a slow southward and then south @-@ southwesterly track . Strong wind shear prevented immediate development and the system added an eastward component to its drift . Moving out of the high @-@ shear environment on November 24 , Delta gained organization . Outflow and convective banding increased and an eye feature became well defined . This eye signaled the storm 's peak strength of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , just below hurricane status . However , the official forecast at the time predicted Delta to strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane . Delta 's motion stalled as it reached the southern base of a large cyclonic trough over the northern Atlantic within which it was embedded . Maintaining its intensity , Delta remained motionless for half a day until , that evening when it began a slow southward drift at 6 mph ( 9 km / h ) . Maintaining its intensity , Delta remained motionless for half a day Convection broke down in the storm 's western semicircle early on November 25 ; the decreased organization caused slight weakening . Maintaining its intensity , Delta remained motionless for half a day The southward motion slowed and the weakening trend continued into the evening . Cooling cold tops were counteracted by wind shear which exposed most of the low @-@ level center . The storm 's southward motion stopped and it began moving east at 6 mph ( 9 km / h ) . Some of the computer models suggested the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west , which a few days later became Hurricane Epsilon . This did not occur , and Tropical Storm Delta began to move to the northeast . 
 As Delta accelerated to the northeast towards the Canary Islands , it intensified again , reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November 27 . In post @-@ storm analysis , the NHC noted that there was a possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day ; however , the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status . On November 28 , as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics . The extratropical storm , which maintained winds of near @-@ hurricane strength , passed about 105 mi ( 165 km ) north of the islands that night . The storm moved over Morocco early on November 29 and rapidly weakened overland , dissipating late that day over northwestern Algeria . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Tropical Storm Delta 's arrival in the Canary Islands was described as a " historic " event . Tropical cyclones there are extremely rare and the islands had no tropical warning systems in place . The government issued a general emergency advisory and advised citizens to stay indoors . Tenerife North Airport was closed , stranding hundreds of passengers for the duration of the storm . The Education Board of the Canary Islands Government suspended Tuesday classes for all non @-@ university schools for 320 @,@ 000 students . The shipping company Fred Olsen suspended services linking the islands of Tenerife and La Palma and La Gomera . On the island of El Hierro the exposed road to <unk> Health Center was closed as a precaution . 
 Delta caused considerable damage in the Canary Islands . The storm claimed nineteen lives and caused a total of € 312 million ( $ 364 million 2005 US dollars ) damage throughout the archipelago . Eighteen died when a boat sank off the Canary Islands ; twelve of the bodies were never found . The nineteenth man was killed when while trying to repair his roof during the storm ; winds threw him from his ladder . The islands of Tenerife and La Palma were hardest hit , with many uprooted trees and landslides reported . The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 95 mph ( 152 km / h ) , and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 90 mph ( 147 km / h ) . Some patients at Tenerife 's University Hospital were evacuated to a safer part of the building when paneling from the hospital 's heliport was torn free and smashed some of the building 's windows . Off Santa Cruz 's southern quay a tug boat broke its ties , collided with another vessel , and sank . Passengers at Tenerife North Airport , who were stranded when their flights canceled , witnessed parts of the new international terminal 's roof tear off in the wind . In La Palma a falling palm tree , trunk snapped by the wind , injured the leg of a German tourist . Many palm trees along the Avenida <unk> were also blown down . The storms winds blew out windows and collapsed cornices , although other structural damage was minimal . Metal plates that had been used to board up buildings were strewn all over the island . 
 Over 225 @,@ 000 residents lost electricity and 12 @,@ 000 lost telephone service . Some vandalism and looting was reported during the loss of power , and the police made several arrests during the night . For over 24 hours roads were closed on the islands of El Hierro , Tenerife and La Palma : the first two due to landslides and the third by the collapse of an old house and a massive tree . One of the most famous geological features of the island of Gran Canaria , El <unk> de Dios ( or God 's finger ) , which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium , was destroyed by Delta 's wind and wave action along Gran Canaria 's shore . Upon hearing of the destruction of the natural monument one man , later found to be clinically insane , unsuccessfully tried to kill himself and then stabbed three members of his own family . 
 When the remnants of Delta arrived in Morocco they were described as a " normal atmospheric disturbance " . No damage was reported there and in fact the system was welcomed by farmers who needed the rain to complete the sowing of cereal crops . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 With the Canary Islands ' power grid substantially disrupted , the <unk> @-@ <unk> power company was forced to use temporary generators to boost power at sub @-@ stations far from the main grid . In La <unk> in Santa Úrsula , these generators were poorly received and over 1 @,@ 000 local residents claimed to be affected by the noise and pollution . Children , the elderly and people with respiratory problems suffered most acutely . Roughly € 25 million ( US $ 37 @.@ 25 million ) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction funds . Of this total , € 22 @.@ 5 million ( US $ 33 @.@ 5 million ) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities ; € 1 @.@ 5 million ( US $ 2 @.@ 2 million ) was used for agricultural relief ; and € 1 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 5 million ) was used in home repairs . Due to the severity of crop losses , farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50 % of their losses , including infrastructural . A tax break was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta . 
 Fishermen of the Canary Islands had to return to and remain in port for several days while weathering the storm , and this disruption was blamed for a 10 – 15 % reduction of the islands ' tuna catch . Tropical Storm Delta also had some further @-@ reaching effects . The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man @-@ made disasters . Only five of the island 's many municipalities had an emergency plan , and there was no coordination across the entire island chain . Delta also served to highlight the islands ' aging power grid , prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago . The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change , how they will affect the islands , and how these effects can be avoided . 
 = Ronnie Wallwork = 
 Ronald " Ronnie " Wallwork ( born 10 September 1977 ) is an English former footballer who could play as either a defender or a midfielder . An England under @-@ 20 international , he began his career at Manchester United , where he made his professional debut in 1997 . He never fully established himself in the United first @-@ team however , and was loaned out to Carlisle United and Stockport County . During a further loan spell at Royal Antwerp , he was banned from football for life for attacking a Belgian referee , although the ban was later substantially reduced . He returned to football in 2014 signing for Ashton United . 
 In 2002 , Wallwork moved to West Bromwich Albion , where he was the Player of the Year for 2004 – 05 . He was not always a regular in the side however , and spent time on loan at Bradford City , Barnsley and Huddersfield Town . His spell at Barnsley was cut short when he was stabbed in a nightclub , causing him to miss more than two months of the 2006 – 07 season . Wallwork was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday in January 2008 , but was released just four months later and has since been without a club . In December 2011 , he was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of receiving stolen goods .

 = = = Manchester United = = = 
 Born in Newton Heath , Manchester , Wallwork attended The Football Association 's School of Excellence at Lilleshall as a teenager . A lifelong Manchester United supporter , he joined the club as an apprentice in April 1993 , following a spell playing Sunday league football . Wallwork signed his first trainee contract in July 1994 , before turning professional in March 1995 . He became a regular in the Manchester United junior sides , making 77 appearances for the club 's various youth teams from 1994 to 1997 . Wallwork helped United to win the FA Youth Cup in 1995 and was named as the club 's Young Player of the Year in 1996 . In the summer of 1997 , he represented the England under @-@ 20 team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia , where he played in all four of his country 's matches . England won all three group games to progress to the knockout stages , but lost to Argentina in the round of 16 . 
 By the start of the 1997 – 98 season , he had become a regular in the Manchester United reserve team and made his senior debut on 25 October 1997 , when he came on as a 64th @-@ minute substitute for Gary Pallister in the 7 – 0 home win against Barnsley . Later that season , Wallwork was loaned out twice : firstly to Carlisle United , where he scored his first goal in professional football , and then to Stockport County . He joined Royal Antwerp on loan during the following season and helped them to reach the play @-@ offs , but their hopes of promotion to the First Division were ended by a defeat to La Louvière . After the match , Wallwork grabbed referee Amand Ancion by the throat , for which he was banned from football for life . Another Manchester United loanee , Danny Higginbotham , was banned for a year for his part in the attack . A Belgian court reduced Wallwork 's sentence to a three @-@ year suspension , of which two years were <unk> , while Higginbotham 's ban was reduced to four months . The remaining twelve months of Wallwork 's ban applied only in Belgium , rather than the worldwide ban given under the initial ruling . 
 The 1999 – 2000 season saw Wallwork make further progress at Manchester United as he made seven appearances for the first @-@ team , mostly as a defensive midfielder . Then , in 2000 – 01 , he amassed enough league appearances to qualify for a Premier League winner 's medal . However , his spell in the United first @-@ team was short @-@ lived , as the signings of centre @-@ back Laurent Blanc and central midfielder Juan Sebastián Verón made Wallwork surplus to requirements . He made his final appearance for United on 26 January 2002 , playing 61 minutes of the FA Cup Fourth Round match against Middlesbrough before being replaced by Ryan Giggs . In his seven years at United , Wallwork played just 28 times , and in the summer of 2002 his contract was not renewed . 
 = = = West Bromwich Albion = = = 
 In July 2002 , Wallwork moved on to West Bromwich Albion on a Bosman free transfer , becoming the first player signed by Albion following their promotion to the Premier League . Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him the " best Bosman of the summer " . Before the season started , Wallwork and his Albion team @-@ mates were involved in a dispute over bonuses with the club 's new board of directors . According to his agent , the player was said to be " shocked and disturbed " at the prospect of an 80 % reduction in bonuses compared with that offered by the outgoing board . Wallwork made his Albion debut as a substitute in a 3 – 1 home defeat to Leeds United on 24 August , and he went on to play in 27 of Albion 's 38 Premier League games in 2002 – 03 . Following the death of his mother in February 2003 , he and his team mates each wore a black armband for the match against Bolton Wanderers . The club was eventually relegated at the end of the campaign and Wallwork fell out of favour during 2003 – 04 , taking part in just five league matches during the first half of the season . In January 2004 , he joined Bradford City on an initial month @-@ long loan , during which time he scored in his first and last games . Albion initially refused an extension to the loan , citing concerns over the financial situation at Bradford , who were on the verge of administration . A second loan deal for a further two months at Bradford was agreed shortly afterwards , and Wallwork scored a further two goals , taking his total with Bradford to four in seven games . He attributed his new @-@ found goalscoring form to tactical instructions from manager Bryan Robson , who told him to get forward more often , in contrast to his deeper @-@ lying role at West Bromwich Albion . A broken toe sustained in a match against Rotherham United meant that he returned earlier than scheduled , however . While Wallwork was sidelined for six weeks , his West Bromwich Albion team mates secured promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt . 
 Back in the top division , Wallwork was still unable to force his way back into Albion manager Gary Megson 's matchday squad . However , when Bryan Robson – who had been Wallwork 's manager at Bradford – replaced Megson in November 2004 , Wallwork became an integral part of the team . Robson referred to Wallwork as " an intelligent footballer " who could " sit , pass the ball and change the direction of a game " from central midfield . Wallwork returned to the team the following month and was ever @-@ present throughout the second half of the season , scoring his first Albion goal in a 2 – 0 home win over Manchester City on 22 January 2005 . The club successfully avoided relegation , retaining their top @-@ flight status on the final day of the season , when they beat Portsmouth . Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas . For his efforts , Wallwork was named as Albion 's Player of the Year for 2004 – 05 . In May 2005 , he signed a new contract , to keep him at Albion until June 2007 . 
 The following season Wallwork played in 31 out of 38 Premier League games , but was unable to prevent Albion 's relegation to the Championship . He nevertheless signed a new two @-@ year deal with the club in August 2006 . He remained a regular in the side during the early part of the 2006 – 07 season , but following the appointment of Bryan Robson 's successor Tony Mowbray in October , Wallwork played just once more for the club . Mowbray described Wallwork as " a very good professional " , but preferred a number of other midfielders ahead of him when selecting the team , moving Jonathan Greening from a wide position into the central midfield holding role previously occupied by Wallwork . In order to continue playing first @-@ team football , Wallwork joined Barnsley on loan on 22 November 2006 ; the loan spell was due to last until 1 January 2007 , though West Bromwich Albion had a recall option after 28 days . 
 On 30 November 2006 , Wallwork was attacked while on a night out with his girlfriend Amy Broadbent at the Sugar Lounge night club in Manchester . He was approached by a former boyfriend of Broadbent , Robert Rimmer , who asked him to leave . When Wallwork refused to do so , Rimmer used a fish knife to stab the footballer seven times in the hand , back and stomach . After being rushed to hospital , Wallwork 's condition was said to be stable and his injuries were not thought to be life @-@ threatening . Police investigating the stabbing described the attack as " not random " . They later named 20 @-@ year @-@ old Rimmer as the suspect and appealed for him to contact them . Rimmer handed himself into a police station in Manchester and was arrested on 7 December . In December 2007 , Rimmer , from Gorton , Manchester , was jailed for five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years for stabbing Wallwork after admitting wounding with intent at Manchester Crown Court . Rimmer 's friend , Charles <unk> , a 27 @-@ year @-@ old from Denton , Greater Manchester , was given a suspended jail sentence after he admitted punching Wallwork during the attack . Wallwork was released from hospital on 10 December 2006 , the same day that Barnsley and West Bromwich Albion faced each other in a league game ; Barnsley supporters displayed a " Get well soon Ronnie " banner during the match . After returning to light training in late January , Wallwork made his comeback from the stabbing on 21 February 2007 , playing the full 90 minutes in a West Bromwich Albion reserve team game against Walsall . 
 = = = Huddersfield Town = = = 
 Wallwork was loaned out to Huddersfield Town on 27 September 2007 , joining up once more with manager Andy Ritchie , who had brought him to Barnsley the season before . He made his Huddersfield debut in a 2 – 0 home win over Luton Town on 29 September 2007 . On 20 October , he scored his first goal for Town in a match against Oldham Athletic , which finished 1 – 1 . His loan was extended by another month on 29 October . He was also given permission by West Bromwich Albion to play in Town 's FA Cup first round tie against Accrington Stanley on 10 November .

He lost his place in the team to new signing Adam Bolder , and although he came on as an early substitute for Graham Kavanagh against Charlton Athletic on 12 February 2008 , he did not play for nearly another month until his appearance in a 2 – 1 victory against Queens Park Rangers . Wallwork played just seven games for Wednesday , who released him on 14 May 2008 . He trained with former club Carlisle United in August 2008 , but failed to earn a permanent contract .

 = August Meyszner = 
 August Meyszner ( 3 August 1886 – 24 January 1947 ) was an Austrian Gendarmerie officer and right @-@ wing politician who held the post of Higher SS and Police Leader in the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia from January 1942 to March 1944 , during World War II . 
 Meyszner began his career as an officer in the Gendarmerie , served on the Italian Front during World War I and reached the rank of Major der Polizei by 1921 . He joined the Austrian Nazi Party in September 1925 and became a right @-@ wing parliamentary deputy and provincial minister in the Austrian province of Styria in 1930 . Due to his involvement with the Nazis , Meyszner was forcibly retired in 1933 and arrested in February 1934 , but released after three months at a detention centre in <unk> . That July , he was rearrested following an attempted coup , but escaped police custody and fled to Nazi Germany , where he joined the Ordnungspolizei and then the Allgemeine SS . After police postings in Austria , Germany and Norway , he was appointed as Higher SS and Police Leader in Serbia in early 1942 . 
 Meyszner 's time in Belgrade was characterised by friction and competition with German military , economic and foreign affairs officials and by his visceral hatred and distrust of Serbs . During his tenure , he oversaw regular reprisal killings , and his Gestapo detachment killed as many as 8 @,@ 000 Jewish women and children using a gas van . After the war , the Western Allies extradited Meyszner to Yugoslavia , where he was tried for war crimes . He was found guilty by a Yugoslav military court and executed in January 1947 .

 August Edler von Meyszner was born in Graz , Austria @-@ Hungary on 3 August 1886 , the son of Rudolf Edler von Meyszner , an Oberstleutnant in the Imperial @-@ Royal Landwehr who had been knighted two years earlier , and his wife Therese ( née <unk> ) . His uncle was <unk> Ferdinand von Meyszner . He completed primary and secondary schooling in Graz , before attending a cadet school in Vienna . In 1908 , he was posted to the 3rd Imperial @-@ Royal Landwehr Infantry Regiment in Graz as an officer candidate and on 1 May 1908 was commissioned as a Leutnant . 
 By May 1914 , Meyszner had transferred to the Austrian Gendarmerie as an Oberleutnant and been appointed to command the gendarmerie unit in <unk> ( now the Italian town of Gorizia ) . Later that year , he was appointed to command the coastal gendarmerie section at Grado and then the border guard unit at <unk> , in modern @-@ day Slovenia . A few days after the outbreak of World War I , Meyszner married Pia <unk> from Marburg an der Drau . In 1916 , he was promoted to Rittmeister , and commanded the 12th Alpine Company on the Italian Front in 1917 . He was wounded once , and was also awarded several decorations for his service during the war , including the Order of the Iron Crown 3rd Class , Military Merit Cross 3rd Class , Military Merit Medal with Swords and War Decoration , Karl Troop Cross and Red Cross Decoration 2nd Class . In August 1917 , Meyszner was recalled to the Styrian Gendarmerie Command and was appointed as gendarmerie section commander in Trieste .

 = = = Police and political career in Austria = = = 
 In 1919 , Meyszner was placed in charge of border police at the Styrian town of Judenburg , on the frontier with the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) , and was involved in fighting there . That year , he had become involved with the German @-@ nationalist sporting association Deutsch @-@ <unk> <unk> and was made a leader in the right @-@ wing paramilitary <unk> Heimatschutz ( Styrian Home Guard ) . He later used his senior position in the gendarmerie to funnel arms to the Home Guard . 
 Meyszner remained stationed at Judenburg for the next nine years , although he was sent on several detachments . In 1921 , he was promoted to Major der Polizei . While commanding a gendarmerie detachment sent to oversee the unification of Burgenland with Austria in August 1921 , Meyszner was shot in the leg by local Hungarians rebelling against the transfer . From 1922 , his unit dealt with significant labour unrest , which peaked in the aftermath of the July Revolt of 1927 . Meyszner joined the Austrian Nazi Party in September 1925 and in May 1927 was granted an audience with Adolf Hitler , along with two of his Home Guard comrades , Walter Pfrimer and Hanns Albin Rauter . On 1 January 1929 , Meyszner was transferred to Graz where he came into contact with more right @-@ wing organisations . 
 In 1930 , Meyszner became a right @-@ wing deputy in the Styrian provincial parliament ( German : Landtag ) and a minister of the provincial government . His governmental responsibilities meant that he was unable to take an active part in the abortive coup d 'état led by Pfrimer in 1931 but while claiming he knew nothing of the putsch beforehand , he openly stated in the Landtag that he approved of it . Pfrimer and his co @-@ conspirator Konstantin <unk> went into hiding but Meyszner continued his Home Guard activities and began to forge closer links with Rauter and the Austrian Nazi Party , holding several meetings with Hitler 's delegate in Austria , Theodor Habicht . Habicht met Meyszner and Rauter in Venice to arrange the absorption of the Home Guard into the Nazi Party in early 1933 . The outcome of these discussions subsequently became known as the Venice Agreement . Meyszner 's conversion to Nazi thinking was demonstrated by an anti @-@ Jewish diatribe in the <unk> in April 1933 . From March 1933 , the authoritarian Fatherland Front government of Engelbert Dollfuss prorogued parliamentary government and in June they banned the Austrian Nazi Party , which had absorbed the Home Guard . A few days before this , public servants who were members of the Austrian Nazi Party were classified as subversive . Based on these decrees , Meyszner was denied his seat in parliament and was forcibly retired from the gendarmerie in September 1933 at the age of 47 . 
 As a result of his meetings with Habicht , Meyszner was appointed deputy leader of the Central Styria SA @-@ Brigade . He travelled widely , meeting Nazi leaders in Hungary and Yugoslavia . Consequently , in February 1934 he was interned in <unk> camp for three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half months for Nazi activities . Following a hunger strike and half @-@ hearted prison revolt , he was released . Soon after , the leaders of the Styrian Home Guard were arrested and Meyszner took control of the organisation . Arrested shortly after the July Putsch was launched by the Bavarian branch of the German Nazi Party , during which Dollfuss was assassinated , Meyszner escaped police custody on 27 July and fled to Yugoslavia . His role in the July Putsch is unclear , though Austrian authorities suspected that he had encouraged participation and provided supplies to the conspirators . 
 In Yugoslavia , Meyszner was no longer able to access his pension and had few assets . He travelled to Germany by sea in November 1934 and submitted his résumé to the Allgemeine SS . In it , he emphasised his experience as a political organiser and speaker and suggested that a purely military task would not make best use of his knowledge and skills . 
 = = = Germany = = = 
 Meyszner was briefly given a job coordinating support for Nazi refugees from Austria but soon after he arrived he joined the Schutzpolizei ( protection police ) , a branch of the uniformed Ordnungspolizei ( order police , or Orpo ) , in his previous rank of Major . He received German citizenship in May 1935 . He was honourably discharged from the SA and accepted into the SS but this was short @-@ lived , as police officers were not permitted to be members of the SS at that time . Meyszner was obliged to resign from the SS in October 1935 . On 20 April 1937 , he was promoted to the rank of Oberstleutnant der Polizei . He was allowed to return to the SS in October 1937 and was promoted to the SS rank of Oberführer , backdated to February 1935 . He was appointed to the staff of SS @-@ <unk> III ( SS District III ) , and Schutzpolizei Group East Berlin . In 1937 , Meyszner was appointed as an honorary judge of the People 's Court , and in 1941 this appointment was extended . In March 1938 , he was promoted to the rank of Oberst der Polizei . Following the Anschluss with Germany , Meyszner was elected as a deputy in the Reichstag , a position he retained to the end of World War II . On 12 April 1938 , he was sent to Vienna and appointed as the Inspector of Orpo in Austria , working for the State Secretary for Security in Austria , Ernst Kaltenbrunner . 
 Soon after arriving in Austria , Meyszner and Kaltenbrunner clashed , requiring the intervention of the Chief of the Orpo , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei Kurt Daluege . Meyszner was transferred to the Sudetenland in early October 1938 , after its annexation by Germany , as an Orpo district commander . In June 1939 , he was again transferred , this time to Kassel , as Inspector of Orpo for the Prussian province of Hesse @-@ Nassau .

 With the outbreak of war , Meyszner started being appointed to more senior positions , beginning in the spring of 1940 when he was named a representative of the Higher SS and Police Leader ( German : Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer , HSSPF ) for Fulda @-@ Werra , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Josias Waldeck @-@ Pyrmont . Soon after this , Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler appointed Meyszner to command the Orpo in newly occupied Norway , working with HSSPF Nord , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Wilhelm <unk> . Meyszner remained in Norway until the end of 1941 . During 1941 , Meyszner was awarded the War Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords . In mid @-@ January 1942 , he was recalled to Germany and , despite his low rank , attended a conference of senior SS leaders at <unk> , Himmler 's field headquarters near Hitler 's Wolf 's Lair in East Prussia . The conference discussed the use of forced labour , the coming Final Solution and Generalplan Ost , a plan for the colonisation of Central and Eastern Europe by ethnic Germans . According to the German historian Martin Moll , Meyszner 's attendance at this conference highlighted his suitability for working in the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia due to his relevant language skills .

 The German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia , an area of Yugoslavia roughly corresponding to the borders of the pre @-@ 1912 Kingdom of Serbia , had been retained under military administration following the April 1941 German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia . It included a Serbian puppet regime known as the Government of National Salvation , led by the former Yugoslav Minister of War , Milan Nedić . The appointment of a HSSPF had not been planned and this initially accorded with the preferences of the Wehrmacht commander in the territory . A communist @-@ led uprising had erupted in mid @-@ 1941 and while it had been brutally suppressed during Operation Uzice in December , it was expected to return in the spring of 1942 . To address this , it was decided to appoint a Higher SS and Police Leader for the occupied territory . Meyszner was chosen for the new position , despite the fact that few HSSPF were selected from the Orpo . At 55 years old , Meyszner was also the oldest HSSPF appointed . 
 Meyszner arrived in Belgrade in late January 1942 , inserted into a political maelstrom of conflicting lines of command and authority . Even the military lines of command were confusing , with a Military Commander in Serbia being responsible for the military administration and a Plenipotentiary Commanding General in Serbia being responsible for military operations against the insurgents . A few weeks after Meyszner 's arrival , the two military positions were finally combined into the Commanding General and Military Commander in Serbia , in the person of General der Artillerie Paul Bader , who had previously been the Plenipotentiary Commanding General in Serbia . Bader reported to the Wehrmacht Commander in South @-@ East Europe , General der Pioniere Walter Kuntze , who reported directly to Hitler . The military chain of command considered Meyszner 's appointment " a very peremptory organisational change " , with Kuntze 's chief of staff describing Meyszner as one " for whom we did not ask " . 
 Bader 's staff was split into a military command staff led by Oberst Erich Kewisch and an administrative staff under the control of SS @-@ Gruppenführer Harald Turner . Kewisch 's staff had direct control of the regional defence battalions and worked with the military forces of occupation in the territory . Turner 's staff supervised the Serbian puppet regime , the German commandants of the four military districts and the police and security forces . 
 Overlapping the military chain of command , there was a plenipotentiary of the Foreign Office , Felix Benzler , reporting to the Foreign Minister , Joachim von Ribbentrop and for economic affairs , a representative of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring , Franz Neuhausen . These power structures competed with each other , to a greater extent than anywhere else in occupied Europe . Meyszner 's appointment further complicated an already complex situation , as prior to this decision , Turner had been responsible for police and security matters . Meyszner had to formally acknowledge Bader as his superior but received his orders from Hitler and Himmler . One of his priorities was to improve coordination of policies towards the Volksdeutsche ( or Germans of Yugoslavia ) , concentrated in the Banat region , as the decision had been made in late 1941 to subject them to conscription in order to raise a Waffen @-@ SS division . This decision , approved by Hitler a few days before Meyszner 's appointment , had strengthened Himmler 's case for a HSSPF in Belgrade . 
 Meyszner took control of the police organs that had formerly been under the control of Turner , grouped as Einsatzgruppe Serbien , consisting of Sicherheitsdienst ( Security Service , or SD ) and Sicherheitspolizei ( Security Police , or SiPo ) , as well as the 64th Reserve Police Battalion . These had been commanded by SS @-@ Standartenführer Wilhelm Fuchs , who had overseen the shooting of many Serbian and Jewish males and others , mainly by Wehrmacht units , between August 1941 and the end of that year . Meyszner 's deputy was SS @-@ Standartenführer Emanuel Schäfer and the head of the Belgrade Gestapo was SS @-@ Sturmbannführer Bruno Sattler . The head of the Gestapo Jewish Section was SS @-@ Untersturmführer Fritz <unk> . 
 As soon as he took office , Meyszner embarked on a thorough re @-@ organisation of all police operations in the occupied territory . He created four police area commands , aligned to the four military area commands and ten police districts , corresponding to the military district commands . He took under his command the forces of the Serbian puppet government , known as the Serbian State Guard , and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory . One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop , recruited from Russian Volksdeutsche from the occupied territory but also from Croatia , Bulgaria , Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo . It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but little is known about its activities . 
 As HSSPF , Meyszner was not restricted to police matters . His subordination to Bader was " personal and direct " but this did not mean the police and security apparatus he commanded was subject to day @-@ to @-@ day direction from Bader . Military jurisdiction over Meyszner and his organisation was restricted to matters involving the military security of the territory and military operations . Meyszner 's duties also extended to any matter related to the " strengthening " of the German minority in Serbia , which included authority over the security forces of the puppet regime and collection of revenue and the consolidation and utilisation of existing Volksdeutsche volunteer units in the Waffen @-@ SS . Almost as soon as he arrived in Belgrade , Meyszner met with SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Werner Lorenz , the Chief of the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle ( Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans , or VoMi ) , founded to manage the interests of the Volksdeutsche outside the borders of the Reich . The VoMi was also responsible for orchestrating the Nazi ideology of Lebensraum ( living space ) in Eastern Europe . Meyszner also met with SS @-@ Obersturmführer Sepp Janko , the leader of the Volksdeutsche in the Banat and with SS @-@ Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen SS Artur Phleps , to discuss the formation of the new division , the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen . Plans for more general conscription of the Volksdeutsche did not meet with approval from Berlin . 
 As soon as he took up his role , Meyszner immediately ran into difficulties with Turner , who was responsible for internal affairs and co @-@ operation with the puppet regime . Turner was a proponent of strengthening the puppet regime and making use of all Serbs that were willing to collaborate with the occupiers . Meyszner had a diametrically opposite personal view and throughout his time in Belgrade refused to support or work with the Serb authorities , except at a purely tactical level . His dislike of Serbs was so great that his favourite slogan is said to have been , " I like a dead Serb better than a live one " . Meyszner was also reported to have referred to Serbs as " a people of rats " ( ein <unk> ) . The historian Jonathan Steinberg describes Meyszner as one of Himmler 's most brutal subordinates . 
 In April , Turner wrote in a self @-@ congratulatory tone to Himmler 's personal staff officer , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff , stating that he had already had all the available Jewish men killed and all the women and children placed in the Sajmište concentration camp . He went on to claim that he had arranged , with the help of the SD , a gas van to clear the camp in a period of a fortnight to four weeks . Holocaust historian Christopher Browning considers this claim suspect , stating that Turner 's reports about Jewish affairs were often inaccurate and self @-@ serving in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Hitler and shore up his position . Browning 's view is that a van was dispatched after regular requests from Belgrade for the remaining Jews to be deported directly , so that the local authorities could resolve the matter themselves . When the van arrived in Belgrade , Meyszner was kept informed , and Schäfer asked him for directions . 
 Schäfer delegated the task of killing the Jewish women and children to Sattler . In turn , Sattler tasked the camp commandant , Herbert Andorfer , to accompany the van , which would be operated by two SS @-@ <unk> sent with the van from Berlin . Except for Sundays and public holidays , the van collected groups of about 100 women and children from the camp on a daily basis and drove them to a shooting range outside Belgrade . During the trip , the exhaust would be redirected into the cargo area , killing the occupants . On arrival at the range , a four @-@ man detachment from the 64th Reserve Police Battalion would be waiting with a group of seven Serbian prisoners from the Belgrade prison . The prisoners would unload the van and put the corpses in a pre @-@ dug mass grave . By 10 May 1942 , the camp was empty and as many as 8 @,@ 000 Jewish women and children had been killed by Meyszner 's Gestapo . On 8 June , Schäfer declared to a group of Wehrmacht officers , including Bader and Kuntze , that there was " no longer a Jewish question in Serbia " . 
 Turner and Meyszner clashed continually throughout 1942 , as Meyszner sought to remove all police matters from Turner 's remit , including the supervision of the security forces of the Serbian collaborationist regime . In response , Turner fought hard to maintain control over these areas . Meyszner believed the only way to maintain peace and security was the use of brutal police methods ; Turner wanted to empower the Nedić regime and then replace the military administration with a civil one , akin to the Reichskommissariat Niederlande , with himself as Reichskommissar ( governor ) . Meyszner attempted to have Turner 's staff downgraded and incorporated into Bader 's staff but Wolff 's intervention prevented this . However , Turner 's approach was also seriously out @-@ of @-@ step with the Wehrmacht , which considered the territory a combat zone and wanted to eliminate inefficiencies and overlapping jurisdictions . 
 Despite their initial misgivings , the Wehrmacht established a good working relationship with Meyszner during 1942 . Bader and Meyszner met regularly and supported each other where their interests coincided . By contrast , the conflict between Meyszner and Turner soon became intractable , with the men sending long letters of complaint to each other , with copies to Himmler . Himmler stuck to his general approach , which was that SS officers should resolve their differences face @-@ to @-@ face . Meyszner fundamentally opposed any attempts by Turner to expand the remit of the Serbian puppet regime , including the creation of sporting organisations and the re @-@ opening of Belgrade University , asserting that it could not be in Germany 's interests to " breed hostile Slavic intelligence " . 
 Meyszner 's reports to Himmler fueled distrust of the Serbian security forces , stating that it was " insane " to arm the 16 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Serbian State Guard , as he believed that their loyalties lay with the royalist Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović , not with the Germans or the Nedić regime . The depths to which Turner and Meyszner 's personal vendetta plunged is demonstrated by the fact that they could not agree on how to use the funds stolen from Serbian Jews killed as part of the Final Solution in 1941 and the first half of 1942 . On 1 August 1942 , Kuntze was replaced as Wehrmacht Commander in South @-@ East Europe by Luftwaffe Generaloberst Alexander Löhr , another Austrian . In early September 1942 , Meyszner filed an official report with Himmler alleging that Turner had breached section 90 of the German Penal Code by betraying state secrets . Concerned , in mid @-@ September Turner issued an order to his staff directing them to defer to the authority of the HSSPF and his staff in all police matters and also many other administrative and highly political matters , such as the approval of events , gambling , right of assembly and monitoring of commerce . The dispute was so out @-@ of @-@ hand that only outside intervention would be effective . In October , the Main SS Personnel Office sent an emissary to Belgrade to investigate and report on the situation . This report described the behaviour of both Turner and Meyszner as " shameful " but the die was cast . 
 On 17 October , Himmler met with Meyszner at Kraljevo while inspecting the newly created 7th SS Division . While mildly rebuking Meyszner and warning him that if such behaviour recurred , Himmler would have to dismiss him , Himmler was impressed with the new division . A decisive factor in Himmler 's final decision was undoubtedly the fact that the dismissal of Turner , part of the Wehrmacht command structure , would be much less embarrassing for him than the dismissal of his personal representative , Meyszner . Despite the fact that Turner was " strict and unyielding " , he was far more considerate of the concerns of Nedić , his regime and the Serbian population than any other senior member of the government of occupation . It was not just Meyszner 's machinations that eventually unseated Turner , because he had been joined in his call for Turner 's replacement by Kuntze . On 8 November 1942 , Turner and his deputy Georg <unk> were finally forced out and Turner was succeeded by his legal department chief , Walter <unk> . In December 1942 , Löhr was redesignated as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief South @-@ East Europe and Commander Army Group E but the local command situation did not change . During 1942 , Meyszner was awarded the War Merit Cross 1st Class with Swords .

 In January 1943 , Nedić proposed a fundamental law for Serbia , in effect a constitution creating an authoritarian corporative state similar to that long advocated by Dimitrije Ljotić . Bader asked the various agency heads for their views , and despite some specialists recommending its adoption , Meyszner strongly opposed it , seeing it as a threat to German interests . Passed to Löhr then to Hitler , a response was received in March . Hitler considered it " untimely " . 
 In March 1943 , Meyszner complained to Himmler that Benzler had adopted a " soft " policy towards the Serbs , allowing them to take charge of the supervision of crops . He considered those that granted additional powers and freedoms to the Serbian puppet regime were irresponsible , because they did not understand the real motives of the various Serb groups . One of many matters of concern to Meyszner was the formation of the Serbian Volunteer Corps , which was an extension of Ljotić 's pre @-@ war Yugoslav National Movement . Meyszner thought that Turner and Benzler had erred in allowing its formation and observed that it was spreading royalist propaganda . According to Moll , Meyszner 's perspective was very narrow and did not take into account foreign policy objectives associated with giving some power to the Nedić regime . By the end of 1942 , Meyszner had extracted all the usable military manpower from the Banat and the economy and administration of that territory was suffering . As a consequence , he requested the release of all men aged 40 and over from service in the 7th SS Division . As an alternative , he turned his attention to the minority groups that also lived in the Banat , including Hungarians , Romanians and Slovaks . His recommendation that these people be subjected to conscription was not accepted by Himmler . 
 From the time he had fled to Germany , Meyszner had been engaged in a dispute regarding his membership in the Nazi Party . He had believed that the Venice Agreement meant that he and other members of the Styrian Home Guard had been transferred to the Nazi Party with prestigious low Nazi Party numbers issued prior to Hitler 's seizure of power in 1933 . This became an issue when Hitler decided to mark the 10th anniversary of that event and tasked his private secretary and head of the Nazi Party Chancellery , Reichsleiter Martin Bormann , to determine who should be issued one of a strictly limited number of Golden Party Badges to mark the anniversary . Bormann did not accept the Vienna arrangements , retrospectively determined Meyszner 's party membership date to be 1 June 1938 and allocated him a party number of 6 @,@ 119 @,@ 650 . Due to these decisions , Meyszner did not qualify as an Alter Kämpfer ( Old Fighter ) and Himmler had to intervene on behalf of Meyszner to ensure he received the badge . Meyszner was one of only five SS men that Himmler considered worthy of the award . 
 Using his responsibility for the Volksdeutsche of the Banat as a pretext , Meyszner constantly interfered with operational orders issued to the 7th SS Division . In September 1943 , the total police forces at his disposal comprised the 5th SS @-@ Polizei Regiment , minus one company detached to occupied Greece and seven battalions of Hilfspolizei ( auxiliary police ) of various ethnicities , which had only received 4 – 5 weeks training due to constant employment . 
 The good relationship between Bader and Meyszner continued until spring 1943 , when Bader became aware that Meyszner had been undermining him in his reports to Himmler , blaming the Wehrmacht for the failure to combat the Partisan threat . In April 1943 , Bader wrote to Löhr complaining bitterly about Meyszner allocating 300 Soviet prisoners of war to the Russian Factory Protection Group without consulting him and the fact that he had not been advised of desertions from the Serbian Volunteer Corps . Bader described his situation as " impossible " , observing that Meyszner was disputing his orders through the police chain of command but that he , Bader , was held responsible for all matters concerning the occupied territory . Thereafter , Bader was no longer Meyszner 's ally and this did not bode well for any future clashes with other powerful individuals in the occupation regime . Nedić continued to rail against German occupation policy and the fact that he had to report to four different authorities , who issued sometimes contradictory orders . In May , Meyszner attended a meeting at the Foreign Office , at which he disparaged Nedić and his loyalty to Germany , stating that he could be considered reliable only in fighting the communists . In July and August , some simplification occurred , when Neuhausen was appointed as chief of the military administration staff but Meyszner remained largely independent . Meyszner 's police and security apparatus continued to carry out reprisals when requested by the Wehrmacht . At the end of June , Meyszner ordered the execution of 575 prisoners in response to an attack in which eight German auxiliary police officers were killed and seven were wounded . 
 In September 1943 , a new plenipotentiary of the Foreign Ministry was appointed for the Balkans . This made Benzler 's position redundant and he was recalled to Berlin . Special Envoy Hermann Neubacher arrived in Belgrade armed with orders from Hitler , directing him to undertake a range of tasks aimed at unifying the fight against communist forces in south @-@ east Europe . These orders specifically directed Neubacher to make best use of the local anti @-@ communist forces and to negotiate with them to achieve that goal . He was also empowered to streamline the German occupation administration and transfer more power to local proxies , like the Nedić regime . The orders also placed Neubacher in charge of all decisions regarding the carrying out of reprisals against the local population . But like Meyszner , Neubacher found that the local conditions meant his ability to carry out his mandate was limited . Neuhausen , having recently been appointed as the chief of the military administration , had far more real power than Neubacher and was doing too good a job of exploiting the Serbian economy to hand any of it over to the Serbs . Meyszner himself was strictly opposed to the transfer of any power to the Nedić puppet government and also resisted attempts to conclude agreements with the Chetniks to fight the Partisans , seeing the former as an attempt to return to Turner 's failed policies . The main success Neubacher was able to achieve was a significant reduction in reprisals . Neubacher was contemptuous of Meyszner and what Neubacher called his " totally primitive extermination thesis " . 
 In November , Meyszner 's area of responsibility was expanded to include the German occupied territory of Montenegro . The following month , SS @-@ Standartenführer Paul Blobel 's Kommando 1005 arrived in Belgrade to dig up and burn the bodies of the Jewish women and children killed by Meyszner 's Gestapo . At the end of 1943 , Meyszner was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class . 
 = = = = 1944 = = = = 
 In February 1944 , Meyszner 's campaign against the German @-@ Chetnik agreements escalated sharply . He had unusual allies in this , as Nedić and Ljotić were also against them , in their case because the agreements tended to sideline them in favour of the Chetniks . In particular , Meyszner strongly opposed the further arming of the Chetniks led by Đurišić and Lukačević , on the grounds that they had not upheld their previous agreements and that the Croats , as well as Muslims in Albania , Kosovo and the Sandžak , had expressed concerns about any strengthening of the Chetniks . The commander of the Bulgarian 1st Occupation Corps , General Asen <unk> , also opposed the agreements . Meyszner 's increasing objections to the agreements coincided with growing Partisan pressure from the west and the advance of the Red Army from the east . 
 In April , Neubacher and the Wehrmacht finally managed to get rid of Meyszner . The catalyst for his recall was Meyszner 's public criticism of Neubacher over reprisals , which Neubacher characterised as " undermining official discipline " . Neubacher was assisted in this by <unk> 's old nemesis , Kaltenbrunner , who was now the chief of the RSHA . Even Schäfer was no longer able to work with Meyszner and supported Neubacher 's campaign against his superior . Meyszner was replaced by SS @-@ Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Hermann Behrends , a protégé of the assassinated head of the SD , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei Reinhard Heydrich . Immediately prior to his appointment , Behrends had been serving as an SS @-@ Sturmbannführer der Reserve commanding a mountain artillery battalion in the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar ( 1st Croatian ) . In mid @-@ May 1944 , Meyszner was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class for his efforts fighting the Partisans in Serbia . 
 = = Fate = = 
 While he agreed to relieve Meyszner as HSSPF for Serbia and Montenegro , Himmler did this by transferring him to Berlin and appointing him as Generalinspekteur der Gendarmerie und Schutzpolizei der <unk> ( General Inspector of the Gendarmerie and Schutzpolizei in the Reich ) with the intention of establishing a Europe @-@ wide gendarmerie . Nothing is known about Meyszner 's activities in this role . At the end of the war , he fell into the hands of the Western Allies and his high SS rank ensured attention from investigators . He was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis <unk> , Robert H. Jackson , in June 1945 and was placed into Yugoslav custody soon after . His involvement in the carrying out of reprisal executions both on his own account and on behalf of the Wehrmacht , and the publication of his name along with lists of those executed , meant that his fate was certain . 
 As far as the killing of Jewish women and children is concerned , Meyszner 's direct involvement is less clear . According to Moll , Schäfer claimed that he had received the orders and gas van directly from Berlin and had carried out the killings with little reference to Meyszner . <unk> accepts Schäfer 's assertion , stating that Schäfer also had an independent Gestapo chain of command , over which Meyszner had very limited control . Despite this , as HSSPF he was formally responsible for all his subordinates , including the Gestapo department that killed the Jewish women and children . He was also responsible for carrying out policies that saw 70 @,@ 000 Serbs transported to the Reich as forced labourers , 4 @,@ 000 of whom ended up in occupied Norway . The Holocaust in Serbia played little part in his trial before the Supreme Military Court in Belgrade between 9 and 22 December 1946 . On 22 December , he was sentenced to death , along with most of the 20 leading members of his HSSPF staff who were tried at the same time . On 24 January 1947 , Meyszner was executed by hanging .

 = SMS Friedrich Carl ( 1867 ) = 
 SMS Friedrich Carl was an ironclad warship built for the Prussian Navy in the mid @-@ 1860s . The ship was constructed in the French Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers shipyard in Toulon ; her hull was laid in 1866 and launched in January 1867 . The ship was commissioned into the Prussian Navy in October 1867 . The ship was the third ironclad ordered by the Prussian Navy , after Arminius and Prinz Adalbert , though the fourth ship to be acquired , Kronprinz , was ordered after but commissioned before Friedrich Carl . 
 Friedrich Carl served with the fleet from her commissioning in 1867 until 1895 , when she was removed from front @-@ line service to serve as a training ship . During the Franco @-@ Prussian War in 1870 – 1871 , the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann . Engine trouble , however , plagued the ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron ; as a result , they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade . Neither resulted in combat . 
 Friedrich Carl was also deployed to Spain during an insurrection in 1873 , during which she assisted in the seizure of three rebel vessels in two engagements . The ship was refitted at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven in the 1880s . She was renamed Neptun in 1902 and used as a harbor ship until June 1905 , when she was removed from the naval register . The following year , she was sold to ship breakers in the Netherlands and dismantled for scrap .

 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Friedrich Carl was 91 @.@ 13 meters ( 299 @.@ 0 ft ) long at the waterline and 94 @.@ 14 m ( 308 @.@ 9 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 16 @.@ 60 m ( 54 @.@ 5 ft ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 90 m ( 22 @.@ 6 ft ) forward and 8 @.@ 05 m ( 26 @.@ 4 ft ) aft . The ship was designed to displace 5 @,@ 971 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 877 long tons ; 6 @,@ 582 short tons ) at a normal loading , and up to 6 @,@ 932 t ( 6 @,@ 823 long tons ; 7 @,@ 641 short tons ) with a combat load . The ship 's hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal iron frames . It contained eight watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 76 percent of the length of the vessel . 
 Friedrich Carl was an excellent sea boat ; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius . She was somewhat unbalanced , however , and a 6 degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course . The ship 's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men , and while serving as a flagship , the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men . Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats , including a large tender , two launches , a pinnace , two cutters , two yawls , and one dinghy . 
 A horizontal two @-@ cylinder single expansion steam engine powered the ship . It drove a four @-@ bladed screw 6 m ( 20 ft ) in diameter . Six trunk boilers , divided into two boiler rooms with 11 fireboxes in each , supplied steam to the engine at 2 standard atmospheres ( 200 kPa ) . The propulsion system was rated at 3 @,@ 300 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 500 kW ) and a top speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) , though on trials Friedrich Carl managed to make 3 @,@ 550 ihp ( 2 @,@ 650 kW ) and 13 @.@ 5 knots ( 25 @.@ 0 km / h ; 15 @.@ 5 mph ) . The ship carried 624 t ( 614 long tons ; 688 short tons ) of coal , which enabled a maximum range of 2 @,@ 210 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 090 km ; 2 @,@ 540 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . A barque rig with a surface area of 2 @,@ 010 square meters supplemented the steam engine , though in service they added little to the ship 's performance . Steering was controlled with a single rudder . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 As built , Friedrich Carl was equipped with twenty @-@ six rifled 72 @-@ pounder cannon . After her delivery to Germany , these guns were replaced with a pair of 21 @-@ centimeter ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) L / 22 guns and fourteen 21 cm L / 19 guns . The L / 22 gun could depress to − 5 degrees and elevate to 13 degrees , which provided a range of 5 @,@ 900 m ( 6 @,@ 500 yd ) . The shorter barreled L / 19 guns had a wider range of elevation , from − 8 to 14 @.@ 5 degrees , but the shorter barrel imposed a lower muzzle velocity , which correspondingly reduced the range of the gun to 5 @,@ 200 m ( 5 @,@ 700 yd ) . The two types of gun fired the same shell , of which the total supply numbered 1 @,@ 656 rounds of ammunition . The fourteen L / 19 guns were placed in a central battery amidships , seven on either broadside . The L / 22 guns were placed on either end of the ship . Later in her career , six revolver cannon and five 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes were added . Two of the tubes were placed in the bow , two on the ship 's sides , and one in the stern on the port side . All were placed above water , and were supplied with 12 torpedoes . 
 Friedrich Carl 's armor consisted of wrought iron backed with heavy teak planking . The waterline armored belt consisted of 114 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) of iron backed with 254 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) of teak . The central battery was protected by 114 mm of sloped iron plating on 260 mm ( 10 in ) of timber . The battery 's roof was protected by 9 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 35 in ) thick iron plating . The ship 's conning tower had 114 mm thick iron armor mounted on 400 @-@ millimeter ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) of teak .

 The Prussian Navy ordered Friedrich Carl from a French shipbuilder in 1865 . She was laid down at the Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers La Seyne shipyard in Toulon the following year . The ship was launched on 16 January 1867 ; fitting out work was completed rapidly , and the ship was completed before the end of the year . Friedrich Carl was delivered to Prussia in October 1867 and commissioned into the fleet on the 3rd of the month . 
 = = = Franco @-@ Prussian War = = = 
 At the outbreak of the Franco @-@ Prussian War in 1870 , the greatly numerically inferior Prussian Navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by the French Navy . Friedrich Carl and the broadside ironclads Kronprinz and König Wilhelm , along with the small ironclad ram Prinz Adalbert , had been steaming in the English Channel before the French declared war ; they had left Plymouth on 10 July with the intention of steaming to Fayal in the Azores . On the 13th , however , they put into port and learned of the rising tension between France and Prussia . The ships therefore returned to Wilhelmshaven immediately , arriving on 16 July . France declared war on Prussia three days later on 19 July . Friedrich Carl , Kronprinz , and König Wilhelm were concentrated in the North Sea at the port of Wilhelmshaven . They were subsequently joined there by the turret ship Arminius , which had been stationed in Kiel . 
 Despite the great French naval superiority , the French had conducted insufficient pre @-@ war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations , and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance , which was not forthcoming . The four ships , under the command of Vice Admiral Jachmann , made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank , though they encountered no French warships . Friedrich Carl and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble , which left Arminius alone to conduct operations . Friedrich Carl , Kronprinz , and König Wilhelm stood off the island of Wangerooge for the majority of the conflict , while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river . On 11 September , the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action ; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea . It too did not encounter French opposition , as the French Navy had by this time returned to France . 
 = = = Deployment to Spain = = = 
 In early 1873 , the First Spanish Republic was beset with the Cantonal Revolution . Friedrich Carl , under the command of Vice Admiral Reinhold Werner , steamed to Spanish waters along with a pair of unarmored vessels . The ships joined a British squadron that had been patrolling the southern Spanish coast . A rebel faction of the Spanish Navy had seized four of the country 's seven ironclads . Admiral Werner , the senior commander in the group , was given command of the Anglo @-@ German force . The squadron blockaded two rebel ironclads in the port of Cartagena after they had bombarded a coastal town . While steaming off Alicante , Friedrich Carl encountered the rebel armed steamer Vigilante , seized the vessel , and returned it to the national government . 
 Friedrich Carl and the British ironclad HMS Swiftsure attacked two of the rebel ships — Vitoria and Almansa — without authorization from London or Berlin . The rebel vessels had attempted to extort the port of Almería . In the brief engagement , the Anglo @-@ German force overwhelmed the rebels and seized both ships , which were subsequently turned over to the Spanish government . The rebels considered declaring war on Germany over the affair , but eventually decided against it . A captured rebel leader was briefly held on board Friedrich Carl . Admiral Werner 's blockade eventually forced the rebels to surrender , after which Friedrich Carl returned to Germany . Chancellor Otto von Bismarck ordered a court @-@ martial for Admiral Werner , whose actions Bismarck considered to be excessive . Bismarck prohibited the Imperial Navy from conducting " gunboat diplomacy " in the future . 
 = = = Later service = = = 
 In 1885 , Friedrich Carl had torpedo nets installed ; these remained on the ship until 1897 . In 1895 , the ship was disarmed ; she was placed into service as a torpedo test ship on 11 August of that year . She served in this capacity until 21 January 1902 , when she was renamed Neptun and used as a harbor ship . Her name was then freed to be reused on the new armored cruiser Friedrich Carl , which was launched on 22 June 1902 . Neptun was formally stricken from the naval register on 22 June 1905 and sold to a Dutch ship @-@ breaking firm in March 1906 for 284 @,@ 000 gold marks . The ship was then towed to the Netherlands and broken up for scrap . 
 = James Turner Morehead ( Kentucky ) = 
 James Turner Morehead ( May 24 , 1797 – December 28 , 1854 ) was a United States Senator and the 12th Governor of Kentucky . He was the first native @-@ born Kentuckian to hold the governorship of the state . A member of Henry Clay 's National Republican Party , Morehead entered politics just as his party was beginning to challenge the Democratic Party 's dominance in the state . 
 Morehead was nominated for lieutenant governor at his party 's nominating convention in Baltimore , Maryland in 1831 , and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt . He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt 's death in 1834 . <unk> with a shortened term , Morehead was not able to formulate a significant legislative agenda , and stuck to the politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term . When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly from the Democrats in the summer of 1834 , Morehead hosted the new party 's first nominating convention in Frankfort . 
 Following his term as governor , Morehead returned to the state legislature . An opponent of abolitionism , he accompanied John Speed Smith to Ohio to secure the return of slaves owned by Kentuckians . He was later appointed to the U.S. Senate , where he remained a close ally of Clay 's . In 1847 , he retired to Covington , Kentucky , practicing law until his death in 1854 . The city of Morehead , Kentucky is named in honor of Governor Morehead . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 James Turner Morehead was born on May 24 , 1797 near <unk> , Kentucky in Bullitt County . His parents , Armistead and Lucy ( Latham ) Morehead , moved to Russellville , Kentucky when he was very young , and he was educated at the public schools in that city . He attended Transylvania University in Lexington , Kentucky from 1813 to 1815 . He then returned to Russellville , where he studied law under circuit court judge H. P. Broadnax and John J. Crittenden . He was admitted to the bar in 1818 , and commenced practice in Bowling Green , Kentucky . 
 On May 1 , 1823 , Morehead married Susan A. Roberts ; the couple had two children . He was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Warren County from 1828 to 1831 . While there , he served on the Committee on Internal Improvements , and reported a bill for state subscription to the Maysville @-@ Lexington Turnpike Company in 1831 . 
 = = Governor of Kentucky = = 
 In 1831 , Morehead was also a delegate to the National Republican Party Convention in Baltimore , Maryland that nominated Henry Clay for president . During the convention , he was nominated for the office of lieutenant governor . Though his National Republican running mate , Richard A. Buckner , was defeated by Democrat John Breathitt , Morehead was elected the ninth Lieutenant Governor . 
 Governor Breathitt died of tuberculosis on February 21 , 1834 , and Morehead was sworn in as governor the following day . The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats , but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead 's willingness to retain Breathitt 's secretary of state , Lewis Saunders , did much to allay their fears . 
 Later that year , the National Republican party began to re @-@ brand itself as the Whig Party , a name that first appeared in the Lexington Intelligencer on April 25 , 1834 . On July 4 , 1834 , Governor Morehead hosted the party 's first convention in Frankfort . Kentuckians flocked to the " new " party en masse , and the legislative elections of August 1834 saw the party garner majorities in both houses of the state legislature . Flexing their political muscles , the majority party ousted Guthrie from his post as president of the Senate and by a vote of 90 – 40 , and sent John J. Crittenden instead of Guthrie to the U.S. Senate in 1835 . 
 In his first address to the legislature , Morehead recommended a plan of expanded internal improvements , including improvements along the state 's rivers . The legislature responded by creating a state board of internal improvements , and named Morehead the ex @-@ officio president of the board . In this role , he authorized many surveys of Kentucky 's rivers and formulated several plans for improvements , but most of them were blocked by the Panic of 1837 . One improvement that did proceed was construction of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad , which was completed in 1835 . Though education was not a high priority for Governor Morehead , the Kentucky Common School Society and the Kentucky Association of Professional Teachers were formed during his term . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Following his service as governor , Morehead resumed his legal practice in Frankfort , Kentucky . In March 1837 , he was commissioned by Governor James Clark to act as an agent for the state , selling bonds to fund internal improvements . He returned to the state House from 1837 to 1838 , representing Franklin County . He was president of the Kentucky Board of Internal Improvements from 1838 to 1841 , and in 1839 , he and John Speed Smith were chosen as commissioners to the state of Ohio to secure the return of Kentucky @-@ owned slaves as property of their masters . They were successful in this endeavor . 
 Learned in Kentucky history , Morehead published An Address in Commemoration of the First Settlement of Kentucky , which contained original information regarding the early settlement of Boonesborough , Kentucky , in 1840 . In 1846 , he published another book , Practice in Civil Actions and Proceedings at Law . 
 In 1841 , Morehead was elected to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4 , 1841 to March 3 , 1847 . There he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Retrenchment . During his service in the Senate , he defended a federal bank bill and opposed the annexation of Texas , though he supported the <unk> War after it began . He was also a staunch supporter of fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay . 
 After his time in Congress , he continued the practice of law in Covington , Kentucky until his death . He was interred in the State lot of Frankfort Cemetery , Frankfort , Kentucky . The city of Morehead , Kentucky was named after him . 
 = USS South Carolina ( BB @-@ 26 ) = 
 USS South Carolina ( BB @-@ 26 ) , the lead ship of her class of dreadnought battleships , was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the eighth state . She was also the first American dreadnought ; though she did not incorporate turbine propulsion like HMS Dreadnought , South Carolina 's design included revolutionary aspects as well , primarily the superfiring arrangement of her main battery . The ship was laid down in December 1906 and launched in July 1908 before being commissioned into the US Atlantic Fleet in March 1910 . 
 South Carolina spent much of her career in the Atlantic and Caribbean patrolling the eastern coast of the United States . She made two trips to Europe in 1910 and 1911 and participated in a visit by a German cruiser squadron in 1912 . In 1913 – 14 , she frequently patrolled the coast of Mexico to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution , and in April 1914 she took part in the United States occupation of Veracruz . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , South Carolina trained sailors for the rapidly expanding wartime navy , and in late 1918 , she was assigned to convoy escort duty . An accident with her propellers in September kept her from active service for the remainder of the conflict . In 1919 , she made four trips to bring American soldiers back from Europe . Midshipmen training cruises followed in 1920 – 21 , but the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 cut her career short . She was broken up for scrap as part of the arms limitation treaty , starting in mid @-@ 1924 . 
 = = Design = = 
 South Carolina was 452 ft 9 in ( 138 m ) long overall and had a beam of 80 ft 3 in ( 24 m ) and a draft of 24 ft 6 in ( 7 m ) . She displaced 16 @,@ 000 long tons ( 16 @,@ 257 t ) as designed and up to 17 @,@ 617 long tons ( 17 @,@ 900 t ) at full combat load . The ship was powered by two @-@ shaft vertical triple @-@ expansion engines rated at 16 @,@ 500 ihp ( 12 @,@ 304 kW ) and twelve coal @-@ fired Babcock & Wilcox boilers , generating a top speed of 18 @.@ 5 kn ( 34 km / h ; 21 mph ) . The ship had a cruising range of 5 @,@ 000 nmi ( 9 @,@ 260 km ; 5 @,@ 754 mi ) at a speed of 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 869 officers and men . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of eight 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) / 45 caliber Mark 5 guns in four twin gun turrets on the centerline , which were placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft . The secondary battery consisted of twenty @-@ two 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) / 50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull . As was standard for capital ships of the period , she carried a pair of 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes , submerged in her hull on the broadside . The main armored belt was 12 in ( 305 mm ) thick over the magazines , 10 in ( 254 mm ) over the machinery spaces , and 8 in ( 203 mm ) elsewhere . The armored deck was 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 5 in ( 38 to 64 mm ) thick . The gun turrets had 12 inch thick faces , while the supporting barbettes had 10 inch thick armor plating . Ten inch thick armor also protected the casemate guns . The conning tower had 12 inch thick sides .

 The keel for South Carolina was laid down at the William Cramp & Sons shipyard in Philadelphia on 18 December 1906 . The completed hull was launched on 1 July 1908 , and Frederica Ansel , the daughter of the governor of the ship 's namesake state , Martin Ansel , christened the ship . Fitting @-@ out work was completed by the end of February 1910 , and she was commissioned into the fleet on 1 March . She was then assigned to the Atlantic Fleet . Five days after her commissioning , the ship steamed out of Philadelphia for her shakedown cruise , which took the ship to the Caribbean Sea and included stops in the Danish West Indies and Cuba , before returning to the United States for a visit to Charleston in her namesake state , which lasted from 10 to 15 April . Sea trials followed ; they were conducted off the Virginia Capes and outside Provincetown , Massachusetts . South Carolina then visited New York City on 17 – 18 June to take part in a reception for former President Theodore Roosevelt . The ship spent most of the rest of the year conducting fleet <unk> , training naval militia , and receiving repairs at Norfolk , Virginia . 
 On 1 November 1910 , South Carolina left the United States for a trip to Europe with the 2nd Battleship Division . During the tour , the Division stopped in Cherbourg and Portland . The ships arrived back in Norfolk on 12 January 1911 , where South Carolina entered the shipyard for maintenance . She then returned to the fleet , which conducted battle training off the coast of New England . The ship made a short stop in New York City before joining the 2nd Battleship Division for another tour of Europe . This trip included stops in Copenhagen , Stockholm , and Kronstadt . On the way back from Kronstadt , South Carolina stopped in Kiel , where the German Kaiser Wilhelm II was hosting the annual Kieler Woche ( Kiel Week ) sailing regatta . South Carolina arrived off Provincetown on 13 July and continued to the Chesapeake Bay , where she conducted battle practice . 
 In late 1911 , South Carolina was present for a naval review in New York City before conducting training exercises with the 1st Squadron off Newport , Rhode Island . The ship then steamed south on 3 January 1912 for training exercises off Guantanamo Bay , Cuba before returning to Norfolk on 13 March . She cruised the east coast of the United States from March to late June . That month , she participated in a reception for a visit by the German battlecruiser SMS Moltke and the light cruisers Bremen and Stettin in New York . On 30 June , South Carolina returned to Norfolk for an overhaul . In early October , the ship steamed to New York for a visit that lasted from 11 to 15 October . The first half of November was spent conducting training exercises off New England and the Virginia Capes . She then steamed south with the Special Service Division for a tour of the Caribbean ; stops included Pensacola , New Orleans , Galveston , and Veracruz .

 South Carolina was back in Norfolk by 20 December , where she remained until 6 January 1913 . She then departed for another trip south , this time to Colón , Panama , at the entrance to the recently completed Panama Canal . The ship then took part in maneuvers off Guantanamo Bay before returning to Norfolk on 22 March . Another cruise off the east coast of the United States followed , and included a stop in New York from 28 to 31 May , where the USS Maine National Monument was dedicated . The ship briefly trained midshipmen from the US Naval Academy in June before departing at the end of the month for Mexico . There , she cruised off Tampico and Veracruz to protect American interests during the Mexican Civil War . She returned to Norfolk for an overhaul in September that lasted until January 1914 . 
 South Carolina then took part in training exercises off Culebra Island . On 28 January , the ship sent a contingent of Marines ashore in Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , Haiti , to secure the American embassy during a period of unrest in the country , as well as to set up a radio station there . She left the city on 14 April after tensions calmed following the election of President Oreste <unk> . South Carolina coaled at Key West before continuing on to Veracruz , where she took part in the occupation of the city . The ship left Veracruz in July and spent the next several months cruising off the Dominican Republic and Haiti to monitor the political situations in the neighboring countries . She returned to Norfolk on 24 September ; by this time , World War I had broken out in Europe , though the United States initially remained neutral . 
 On 14 October , the ship went to Philadelphia for an overhaul that lasted until 20 February 1915 . She thereafter steamed to Cuba for the routine peacetime training maneuvers . At the time , tensions between the United States and Germany were high due to the sinking of the passenger ship RMS Lusitania by a U @-@ boat , though the Germans agreed to suspend their unrestricted submarine warfare campaign . For the next two years , she followed the same pattern : training exercises off Cuba in the first quarter of the year , followed by maneuvers off Newport , and periodic maintenance at the end of the year at Philadelphia . On 6 April 1917 , the United States declared war on Germany over the latter 's resumption of the unrestricted submarine campaign earlier that year . South Carolina continued to cruise off the east coast of the United States through August 1918 . 
 Starting in September , South Carolina and the pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the Atlantic Fleet began escorting convoys to France . On 6 September , she departed with the pre @-@ dreadnoughts Kansas and New Hampshire to protect a fast HX troopship convoy . On 16 September , the three battleships left the convoy in the Atlantic and steamed back to the United States , while other escorts brought the convoy into port . On the 17th , South Carolina lost her starboard propeller , which forced her to reduce speed to 11 kn ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) using only the port shaft . On 20 September , the port engine stopped after a throttle valve broke down . She got underway temporarily using an auxiliary throttle before severe vibration forced her to stop for six hours while the main throttle was fixed . Four days later , the ships reached the United States and South Carolina made her way to Philadelphia for repairs . After South Carolina returned to service , she participated in gunnery training , which continued until Germany signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the fighting in Europe . In mid @-@ February 1919 , South Carolina began the first of four round trips between the United States and Brest , France to bring American soldiers back from Europe . In the course of the voyages , the last of which concluded in late July , the ship had carried over 4 @,@ 000 soldiers home . She then went to the Norfolk Navy Yard for a lengthy overhaul . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 After returning to service , the ship took on a contingent of midshipmen for a training cruise to the Pacific . On 5 June 1920 , South Carolina began the voyage , crossing into the Pacific via the Panama Canal . She stopped in Hawaii before continuing on to the west coast of the United States , with visits in Seattle , San Francisco , and San Diego . She left the last port on 11 August and arrived back in Annapolis on 2 September . After disembarking the midshipmen there , she went to Philadelphia , where she remained for seven months . South Carolina returned to sea in early April 1921 for training off Culebra Island , followed by exercises in Chesapeake Bay . Another training cruise for midshipmen began on 29 May , this time to Europe . Ports of call included Christiana , Norway , and Lisbon , Portugal . She returned to Annapolis via <unk> Bay on 30 August before proceeding to Philadelphia the next day . 
 In the years immediately following the end of the Great War , the United States , Britain , and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs . All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill @-@ advised , and so convened the Washington Naval Conference to discuss arms limitations , which produced the Washington Naval Treaty , signed in February 1922 . Under the terms of Article II of the treaty , South Carolina and her sister Michigan were to be scrapped . The ship was decommissioned on 15 December , but was not formally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register until 10 November 1923 . She was sold for scrap on 24 April 1924 and subsequently dismantled . 
 The ship 's silver service was commissioned by the state of South Carolina and was presented on 11 April 1910 . After South Carolina was withdrawn from service in 1922 , the service was given to the South Carolina chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution for display at the Old Exchange . Following the outbreak of World War II , the service was hidden in the basement of the Old Exchange for safekeeping . In 1947 , they were retrieved and sent to the South Carolina Governor 's Mansion , where they are currently on display . 
 = 1999 FA Charity Shield = 
 The 1999 FA Charity Shield ( also known as the One 2 One FA Charity Shield for sponsorship reasons ) was the 77th FA Charity Shield , an annual English football match played between the winners of the previous season 's Premier League and FA Cup competitions . The teams involved were Manchester United , who had won both the Premier League and FA Cup as part of the Treble the previous season , and Arsenal , who finished runners @-@ up in the league . Watched by a crowd of 70 @,@ 185 at Wembley Stadium , Arsenal won the match 2 – 1 . 
 This was Arsenal 's 15th Charity Shield appearance and Manchester United 's 19th . Leading up to the match , both clubs were embroiled in controversy : Manchester United withdrew from English football 's primary cup competition , the FA Cup , in order to take part in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship ; Arsenal were entangled in a transfer saga involving their own player , striker Nicolas Anelka , who vowed to never play for the club again and cited the English media as a reason for wanting to leave . 
 Brazilian midfielder Sylvinho made his debut for Arsenal , while Ukrainian defender Oleh Luzhny was named on the substitutes ' bench . Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich , signed as a replacement for Peter Schmeichel during the summer , made the first appearance of his second spell with the club . Midfielder Roy Keane was absent with an ankle injury , so Denis Irwin stood in as captain . Manchester United went ahead seven minutes before the end of the first half , when David Beckham 's free @-@ kick hit the underside of the crossbar and narrowly crossed the line before Dwight Yorke made sure . Arsenal were awarded a penalty in the second half , which Nwankwo Kanu converted . Kanu then set up Ray Parlour to score the winning goal in the 77th minute . 
 This result marked Manchester United 's first defeat of 1999 . It was the second consecutive year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield . Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described it as psychological boost to beat his opponents and felt it showed that his team were ready for the upcoming season . Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson , on the other hand , believed the defeat highlighted his players needed more game time .

 Founded in 1908 as a successor to the Sheriff of London Charity Shield , the FA Charity Shield began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League , although in 1913 , it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI . In 1921 , it was played by the league champions of the top division and FA Cup winners for the first time . Wembley Stadium acted as the host of the Shield from 1974 . 
 Manchester United qualified for the 1999 FA Charity Shield as winners of the 1998 – 99 FA Premier League . The team overcame close competition from Arsenal to win their fifth league title in seven years . In the 1999 FA Cup Final , Manchester United beat Newcastle United by two goals to nil and completed the domestic double . The team later went on to win the UEFA Champions League after defeating Bayern Munich in the season 's final and became the first English team to acclaim a treble of trophies in one season . Given United won both domestic honours , the other Charity Shield place went to league runners @-@ up Arsenal . United appeared in 18 previous Shields , winning 10 outright ( 1908 , 1911 , 1952 , 1956 , 1957 , 1983 , 1993 , 1994 , 1996 , 1997 ) , sharing four ( 1965 , 1967 , 1977 , 1990 ) and losing four ( 1948 , 1963 , 1985 , 1998 ) . In contrast , Arsenal won eight previous Shields ( 1930 , 1931 , 1933 , 1934 , 1938 , 1948 , 1953 , 1998 ) , shared one with Tottenham Hotspur in 1991 and lost five ( 1935 , 1936 , 1979 , 1989 , 1993 ) . 
 The last league meeting between the teams was at Old Trafford on 17 February 1999 . A goal scored by Andy Cole cancelled out Nicolas Anelka 's opener for Arsenal ; the match ended 1 – 1 after both teams spurred chances to win . Both teams were also drawn together in the FA Cup semi @-@ final two months later , the tie was decided by a replay as the initial game controversially finished goalless . Giggs ran the length of the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal in extra time . In the close season , Anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for Arsenal again . He cited the media in England as a reason for wanting to leave the club : " The one thing I can tell you is that I can 't stand the English Press , who cause me enormous problems on a personal level , " but it was implied that his " gold @-@ digging brothers " wanted Anelka to move abroad to make more money – they served as his agents . 
 In June 1999 , United accepted an offer from the FA to withdraw from the FA Cup in order to participate in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship , staged in Brazil . It was criticised by the new Sports minister Kate Hoey , who suggested the club were treating its supporters in a " shabby way " . Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson however replied that United had been pressurised to make the decision , which aimed to solidify England 's 2006 FIFA World Cup bid : " The Government are saying that we should be in the FA Cup , but they are the very people that were saying originally that we have to go to Brazil . They could tell us quite clearly : ' Do not bother about the World Cup bid , leave that to us . It should not be Manchester United 's responsibility . ' "

 Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger revealed before the Charity Shield game that he was not overly concerned with Anelka leaving , rather the injuries that were depleting his squad : " I cannot forget that it was because of a poor start to last season that we lost the championship to Manchester United . " He refused to categorise the match as a " friendly " much like it is traditionally viewed as : " There is a trophy and medals at stake . We won it last season and our players want to win it again . " Ferguson described the 3 – 0 defeat in the previous season 's Shield as a " humiliation " , before discussing how it made the team prepare for the challenges ahead : " I have reminded the players how hard it is to lose when you are playing for United these days – it makes so many other people happy . " Indeed , United only lost five matches of the whole of last season , with their last defeat coming at home to Middlesbrough in December 1998 .

 Both teams were without several first team players because of injury problems . Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane was absent , which meant defender Denis Irwin took responsibility as the team captain . Ryan Giggs was also ruled out of the game , though his injury was unspecified . Forwards Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke started upfront for United , in a 4 – 4 – 2 formation where David Beckham and Jordi Cruyff acted as the two wide midfield players . Goalkeeper Mark Bosnich , signed as a replacement for Peter Schmeichel , also started , having rejoined the club after a nine @-@ year spell with Aston Villa . 
 For Arsenal , defender Tony Adams was ruled out with injury , as was Dennis Bergkamp , Marc Overmars , and goalkeeper David Seaman . Anelka did not partake , given his transfer to Real Madrid was on the verge of being completed . New signings Oleh Luzhny and Sylvinho were both named in the squad , but whereas Sylvinho started the game , Luzhny was selected as a substitute . Arsenal , like United , lined up in a 4 – 4 – 2 formation . Up front , Fredrik Ljungberg was paired with the club 's only available recognised striker , Nwankwo Kanu .

 The severe heat meant Manchester United and Arsenal found it hard to find any rhythm early on . Sylvinho fashioned an early chance for Arsenal , though his shot was deflected over . Although midfield pair Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit did well to contain their opponents in the opening half @-@ hour , Arsenal 's lack of pace and incisiveness upfront was evident – Ljungberg missed three chances before half @-@ time . Midway through the first half , Beckham was booked by referee Graham Barber for dissent . Moments after Nicky Butt was involved in a brawl with Martin Keown , after the latter nearly caught Butt 's face with his boot . Both players were booked for confronting each other , as was Vieira for getting involved . United performed better as the match went on and scored the opening goal . Beckham 's 30 @-@ yard free @-@ kick hit the underside of the crossbar and bounced out ; Yorke headed the rebounded ball past goalkeeper Alex Manninger . Although replays suggested the goal was Beckham 's as his free @-@ kick crossed the goal line , it was given to Yorke . Arsenal responded for a short while , but missed " three half @-@ chances " . 
 Defender Jaap Stam , " nursing an Achilles injury all summer " , was substituted in the second half for David May . Arsenal began the half the better of the two teams and Vieira believed he earnt his team a penalty in the 49th minute – it was turned down by Barber . The substitution of Sylvinho for Luis Boa Morte in the 64th minute allowed Ljungberg to play in a natural midfield role . Two minutes later , Arsenal were awarded a penalty . Vieira , chasing down the ball was adjudged to have his shirt tugged by Irwin in the 18 @-@ yard box . Kanu converted the penalty , sending Bosnich the wrong way . Yorke soon after mistimed his goal effort after being sent clear by Cole . Substitute Ole Gunnar Solskjær then put Cole through , only for Manninger to produce a one @-@ handed save . Arsenal scored what proved to be the match winner in the 78th minute . A goal @-@ kick by Bosnich was headed back into United 's half by Vieira ; Kanu controlled the ball " deftly " and set up Parlour , whose shot went into the net . Teddy Sheringham was brought on by Ferguson for Butt with nine minutes of normal time remaining , but with a fourth striker on the field , United were unable to score an equaliser . Luzhny later came on for Parlour , the final substitution of the match .

 The result marked the first time that Manchester United had lost in the calendar year , ending a 33 @-@ match unbeaten run . Wenger believed the result showed that Arsenal were " ready for the season " , albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke . He thought it was " ... psychologically important to beat United , especially after the great run they have had " . Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid : " I hope everything will be finalised in the next couple of days . In any case , he is not coming back here , and although the contract is not signed yet , I hope it will be after his medical and that is the end of it . " Kanu , who scored Arsenal 's equaliser and set up the match winner , was pleased with his performance and relished the opportunity of establishing himself in the first team , after Anelka 's departure . 
 Ferguson said the defeat showed that Manchester United needed more games to be ready , " particularly , in the second half " and felt travelling " half way across the world " for pre @-@ season did not aid their preparation . In terms of the result , he said it was " about as significant " as it was last year . Bosnich 's performance in goal received mixed reviews in the English press ; The Sun questioned his positioning and said his kicking was " poor " . The player himself assessed : " My kicking has been atrocious and , generally , my distribution from the back has to improve . "

 Ray of Light is the seventh studio album by American singer Madonna . It was released on February 22 , 1998 by the Maverick and Warner Bros. Records . After giving birth to her first child , Lourdes , Madonna started working on the album with producers Babyface and Patrick Leonard . Following failed sessions with them , Madonna pursued a new musical direction with English producer William Orbit . The recording took place over four months and experienced problems with Orbit 's hardware Pro Tools arrangement , which would break down , and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired . 
 A major departure from her previous work , Ray of Light is an electronica record which incorporates several genres , including techno , trip hop , drum and bass , ambient , rock , and classical music . Vocally , the album saw Madonna sing with greater breadth and a fuller tone . Mystical themes are also strongly present in both lyrics and music as a result of Madonna embracing Kabbalah , her study of Hinduism and Buddhism , as well as her daily practice of Hatha Yoga . 
 The album received universal acclaim with reviews commending the singer 's new musical direction . Called her " most adventurous " record , Ray of Light has been noted for its mature , restrained nature ; reviewers also praised Madonna 's vocals . Ray of Light won four Grammy Awards from a total of six nominations . Commercially , the album peaked at number one in many countries such as Australia , Canada , Germany , and the United Kingdom . On the US Billboard 200 , the album debuted and peaked at number two , with the biggest first week sales by a female artist at the time . Ray of Light has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide . 
 Five singles were released from the album including the international hits " Frozen " and " Ray of Light " . The album 's promotion was later supported by the Drowned World Tour in 2001 . Academics noted the album 's influence on popular music , and how it introduced electronica into mainstream pop culture . They also noted Madonna 's musical re @-@ invention with the album , which helped her remain contemporary among the teenage artists of the period . Ray of Light has been ranked among lists of greatest albums of all time .

 Following the release of her compilation album Something to Remember ( 1995 ) , Madonna started taking vocal lessons in preparation for her role in Evita ( 1996 ) . She also gave birth to her daughter , Lourdes , the same year . These events inspired a period of introspection . " That was a big catalyst for me . It took me on a search for answers to questions I 'd never asked myself before , " she said to Q magazine , in 2002 . During the same period , she embraced Kabbalah and started studying Hinduism and yoga , all of which helped her " step outside [ myself ] and see the world from a different perspective . " Madonna felt that there was a " whole piece " of her voice left unused , which she decided to utilize for the album . By May 1997 , Madonna had started writing songs for the album . She began collaborating with Babyface , who had first worked with her on her previous album Bedtime Stories . The two wrote a couple of songs together before Madonna decided the collaborations were not going in the musical direction she wanted for the album . According to Babyface , the songs " had a ' Take a Bow @-@ ish ' kind of vibe , and Madonna didn 't want , or need , to repeat herself . " 
 After abandoning the songs she had written with Babyface , Madonna turned to musician Rick Nowels , who had previously co @-@ written songs with Stevie Nicks and Celine Dion . The collaboration produced seven songs in nine days , but those songs also did not display the album 's future electronic musical direction . Three of the songs , called : " The Power of Good @-@ Bye " , " To Have and Not to Hold " and " Little Star " , appear on the album . Madonna then began writing songs with Leonard , who had produced many songs for Madonna in the late 1980s . Unlike her previous albums , Leonard 's song writing collaborations were accompanied by very little studio input . Madonna believed that Leonard 's production " would have lent the songs more of a Peter Gabriel vibe " , a sound that she did not want for the album . Guy Oseary , chairman of Maverick Records , then phoned British electronic musician William Orbit , and suggested that he send some songs to Madonna . Orbit sent a 13 @-@ track digital audio tape to Madonna . " I was a huge fan of William 's earlier records , Strange Cargo 1 and 2 and all that . I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that , and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time , " Madonna said .
