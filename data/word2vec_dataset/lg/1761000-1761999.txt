 Among other reforms was the Codex <unk> , begun in 1752 and finished in 1766 , that defined civil rights . In 1776 , Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture . It was later reintroduced , but the progressive nature of these reforms remains noted . Much unlike Joseph , but with the support of religious authorities , Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture . Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras , she found it hard to fit into the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment , which is why she only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent .

 Main reforms concerning the Roman Catholic Church were initiated and carried out under Maria Theresa , while the reforms under her son concerned their non @-@ Catholic subjects .

 Aware of the inadequacy of bureaucracy in Austria , and wishing to improve it , Maria Theresa reformed education in 1775 . In a new school system based on the Prussian one , all children of both genders from the ages of six to twelve had to attend school . Education reform was met with hostility from many villages ; Maria Theresa crushed the dissent by ordering the arrest of all those opposed . Although the idea had merit , the reforms were not as successful as they were expected to be since no funding was offered from the state ; in some parts of Austria , half of the population was illiterate well into the 19th century . 
 The empress permitted non @-@ Catholics to attend university and allowed the introduction of secular subjects ( such as law ) , which influenced the decline of theology as the main foundation of university education . 
 = = Late reign = = 
 Emperor Francis died on 18 August 1765 , while he and the court were in Innsbruck celebrating the wedding of his second son , Leopold . Maria Theresa was devastated . Their eldest son , Joseph , became Holy Roman Emperor . Maria Theresa abandoned all ornamentation , had her hair cut short , painted her rooms black and dressed in mourning for the rest of her life . She completely withdrew from court life , public events , and theater . Throughout her widowhood , she spent the whole of August and the eighteenth of each month alone in her chamber , which negatively affected her mental health . She described her state of mind shortly after Francis 's death : " I hardly know myself now , for I have become like an animal with no true life or reasoning power . " 
 Upon his accession to the imperial throne , Joseph ruled less land than his father had in 1740 . Believing that the emperor must possess enough land to maintain the Empire 's integrity , Maria Theresa , who was used to being assisted in the administration of her vast realms , declared Joseph to be her new co @-@ ruler on 17 September 1765 . From then on , mother and son had frequent ideological disagreements . The 22 million gulden that Joseph inherited from his father was injected into the treasury . Maria Theresa had another loss in February 1766 when Haugwitz died . She gave her son absolute control over the military following the death of Count Leopold Joseph von Daun . 
 According to Robert A. Kann , Maria Theresa was a monarch of above @-@ average qualifications but intellectually inferior to Joseph and Leopold . He asserts that she nevertheless possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch : warm heart , practical mind , firm determination and sound perception . Most importantly , she was ready to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own . Joseph , however , was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers , even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph 's than to Maria Theresa 's . 
 The relationship between Maria Theresa and Joseph was not without warmth but was complicated and their personalities clashed . Despite his intellect , Maria Theresa 's force of personality often made Joseph cower . Sometimes , she openly admired his talents and achievements , but criticised him behind his back . She wrote : " We never see each other except at dinner ... His temper gets worse every day ... Please burn this letter ... I just try to avoid public scandal . " In another letter , also addressed to Joseph 's companion , she complained : " He avoids me ... I am the only person in his way and so I am an obstruction and a burden ... Abdication alone can remedy matters . " 
 After much contemplation , she chose not to abdicate . Joseph himself often threatened to resign as co @-@ regent and emperor , but he , too , was induced not to do so . Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously ; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 was a sign that God wished her to reign until death . It was in Joseph 's interest that she remained sovereign , for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch . 
 Joseph and Prince Kaunitz arranged the First Partition of Poland despite Maria Theresa 's protestations . Her sense of justice pushed her to reject the idea of partition , which would hurt the Polish people . The duo argued that it was too late to abort now . Besides , Maria Theresa herself agreed with the partition when she realised that Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia would do it with or without Austrian participation . Maria Theresa claimed and eventually took Galicia and Lodomeria , a province claimed by Hungarian monarchs since the 13th century ; in the words of Frederick , " the more she cried , the more she took " . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 It is unlikely that Maria Theresa ever completely recovered from the smallpox attack in 1767 , as 18th @-@ century writers asserted . She suffered from shortness of breath , fatigue , cough , distress , <unk> and insomnia . She later developed edema . 
 The empress fell ill on 24 November 1780 , ostensibly of a chill . Her physician Dr. <unk> thought her condition serious . By 28 November , she asked for the last rites , and the next day , at about nine o 'clock in the evening , she died surrounded by her remaining children . With her , the House of Habsburg died out and was replaced by the House of Habsburg @-@ Lorraine . Joseph , already co @-@ sovereign of the Habsburg dominions , succeeded her . Her longtime rival Frederick of Prussia , on hearing of her death , said that she had honored her throne and her sex , and though he had fought against her in three wars , he never considered her his enemy . 
 After several diplomatic failures and military defeats in the 1730s , Austria seemed to be declining , or even on the verge of collapse . After her forty years reign , Maria Theresa left a revitalised empire that influenced the rest of Europe throughout the 19th century . She gave the Habsburg dominions an efficient administrative system that allowed it to remain a great power in its own right , without the support of the Holy Roman Empire . Her descendants followed her example and continued reforming the empire . The acquisition of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria gave the empire an even more multinational character that would ultimately lead to its destruction . Her introduction of compulsory schooling , as a means of Germanisation , eventually triggered the revival of Czech culture .

 = Fusō @-@ class battleship = 
 The Fusō @-@ class battleships ( <unk> , Fusō @-@ gata senkan ) were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during World War I. Both patrolled briefly off the coast of China before being placed in reserve at the war 's end . In 1922 , Yamashiro became the first battleship in the IJN to successfully launch aircraft . 
 During the 1930s , both ships underwent a series of modernizations and reconstructions . Fusō underwent her modernization in two phases ( 1930 – 33 , 1937 – 41 ) , while Yamashiro was reconstructed from 1930 to 1935 . The modernization increased their armor , replaced and upgraded their machinery , and rebuilt their superstructures into the distinctive pagoda mast style . Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolescent by the eve of World War II , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Fusō served as a troop transport in 1943 , while Yamashiro was relegated to training duty in the Inland Sea . Both underwent upgrades to their anti @-@ aircraft suite in 1944 before transferring to Singapore in August 1944 . 
 Fusō and Yamashiro were the only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait , the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf , and both were lost in the early hours of 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire . Some eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half , and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour , but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding . Six battleships and eight cruisers were lying in wait for Yamashiro ; she did not survive the encounter , and Vice @-@ Admiral Shōji Nishimura went down with his ship . Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived . 
 = = Background = = 
 The design of the Fusō @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters . The IJN 's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905 , the last year of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of Tsushima . 
 In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . Satō <unk> , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , Satō theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defense Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armored cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ 289 t ) each . This was the genesis of the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships . 
 The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complicated Japan 's plans . Displacing 17 @,@ 900 long tons ( 18 @,@ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @-@ inch ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) guns , Dreadnought rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison . The launch of the battlecruiser HMS Invincible the following year was a further setback for Japan 's quest for parity . When the two new Satsuma @-@ class battleships and two Tsukuba @-@ class armored cruisers , launched by 1911 , were outclassed by their British counterparts , the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program was restarted . 
 The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the Kawachi class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , the proposal was cut first by the Navy Ministry to seven battleships and three battlecruisers , then by the cabinet to four armored cruisers and a single battleship . The Diet amended this by authorizing the construction of four battlecruisers ( the Kongō class ) and one battleship , later named Fusō , in what became the Naval Emergency Expansion bill . 
 = = Design = = 
 Fusō was designed to work in conjunction with the four battlecruisers . After coordination with the British on the Kongō class , Japanese designers had access to the latest British design studies in naval architecture and were now able to design their own capital ships . In an effort to outmatch the American New York class , planners called for a ship armed with twelve 14 @-@ inch ( 36 cm ) guns and faster than the 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) of their rivals . Vickers files show that the Japanese had access to the designs for double- and triple @-@ gun turrets , yet opted for six double turrets over four triple turrets . 
 The final design — designated A @-@ 64 by the IJN — called for a displacement of 29 @,@ 000 long tons ( 29 @,@ 465 t ) with twelve 14 @-@ inch ( 36 cm ) guns in six double turrets ( two forward , two aft , two separated amidships ) with a top speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . This design was superior to its American counterparts in armament , armor and speed , thus following the doctrine the Japanese had used since the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 of compensating for quantitative inferiority with qualitative superiority . 
 = = Description = = 
 The ships had a length of 202 @.@ 7 meters ( 665 ft 0 in ) overall . They had a beam of 28 @.@ 7 meters ( 94 ft 2 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 7 meters ( 28 ft 7 in ) . They displaced 29 @,@ 326 metric tons ( 28 @,@ 863 long tons ) at standard load . Their crew consisted of 1 @,@ 198 officers and enlisted men in 1915 and 1 @,@ 396 in 1935 . During World War II , the crew probably totalled around 1 @,@ 800 – 1 @,@ 900 men . 
 During the ships ' modernization during the 1930s , their forward superstructures were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod foremasts . The rear superstructures were rebuilt to accommodate mounts for 127 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns and additional fire @-@ control directors . Both ships were also given torpedo bulges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor . In addition , their sterns were lengthened by 7 @.@ 62 meters ( 25 @.@ 0 ft ) . These changes increased their overall length to 212 @.@ 75 m ( 698 @.@ 0 ft ) , their beam to 33 @.@ 1 m ( 108 ft 7 in ) and their draft to 9 @.@ 69 meters ( 31 ft 9 in ) . Their displacement increased nearly 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 100 t ) to 39 @,@ 154 long tons ( 39 @,@ 782 t ) at deep load . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Fusō @-@ class ships had two sets of Brown @-@ Curtis direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each of which drove two propeller shafts . The medium @-@ pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the high- and low @-@ pressure turbines drove the inner shafts . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 40 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam provided by 24 Miyahara @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers , each of which consumed a mixture of coal and oil . The ships had a stowage capacity of 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 100 t ) of coal and 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) of fuel oil , giving them a range of 8 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 000 km ; 9 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . Both ships exceeded their designed speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) during their sea trials ; Fusō reached 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) from 46 @,@ 500 shp ( 34 @,@ 700 kW ) and Yamashiro exceeded that with 23 @.@ 3 knots ( 43 @.@ 2 km / h ; 26 @.@ 8 mph ) from 47 @,@ 730 shp ( 35 @,@ 590 kW ) . 
 During their 1930s modernization , the Miyahara boilers on each ship were replaced by six new Kanpon oil @-@ fired boilers , fitted into the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed . The Brown @-@ Curtis turbines were replaced by four geared Kanpon turbines with a designed output of 75 @,@ 000 shp ( 56 @,@ 000 kW ) . On her trials , Fusō reached a top speed of 24 @.@ 7 knots ( 45 @.@ 7 km / h ; 28 @.@ 4 mph ) from 76 @,@ 889 shp ( 57 @,@ 336 kW ) . The fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of 5 @,@ 100 long tons ( 5 @,@ 200 t ) of fuel oil that gave them a range of 11 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 21 @,@ 900 km ; 13 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The twelve 45 @-@ calibre 14 @-@ inch guns of the Fusō class were mounted in six twin @-@ gun turrets , numbered from front to rear , each of which weighed 615 long tons ( 625 t ) . The turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 / + 20 degrees . They were arranged in an uncommon 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 style with superfiring pairs of turrets fore and aft ; the middle turrets were not superfiring , and had a funnel between them . The decision to use six twin turrets rather than four triple turrets greatly affected the entire design of the class because the two extra turrets required a longer ship and increased the amount of armor required to protect the ship . The location of the third and fourth turrets proved particularly problematic to the design of the class because the amidships turrets were not superfiring as in the subsequent Ise @-@ class battleships . This further increased the length of the ships because the barrels of the upper turret did not protrude over the lower turret , requiring more space than a pair of superfiring turrets . Mounted amidships along the centerline of the ship , they had restricted arcs of fire , and their position forced the boiler rooms to be placed in less than ideal locations . Another complication was the need to fit extra insulation and air conditioning in the magazines of the amidships turrets to protect them from the heat generated in the adjacent boiler rooms . Originally both amidship gun turrets faced to the rear , but Fusō 's turret No. 3 was moved to face forward during her reconstruction in order to accommodate additional platforms around her funnel . 
 The main battery of the Fusō class underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships ' careers . During the first reconstruction of both vessels , the elevation of the main guns was increased to − 5 / + 43 degrees , giving a maximum firing range of 35 @,@ 450 yards ( 32 @,@ 420 m ) . The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system , which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns . 
 By World War II , the guns used Type 91 armor @-@ piercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed 673 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 485 lb ) and had a muzzle velocity of 775 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 540 ft / s ) . They had a maximum range of 27 @,@ 800 meters ( 30 @,@ 400 yd ) at + 30 degrees of elevation and 35 @,@ 450 meters ( 38 @,@ 770 yd ) at + 43 degrees after modernization . Also available was a 625 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 378 lb ) high @-@ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 640 ft / s ) . A special Type 3 Sankaidan incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @-@ aircraft use . 
 As built , the Fusō class was fitted with a secondary armament of sixteen 50 @-@ caliber six @-@ inch guns mounted in single casemates along the sides of the hull at the level of the upper deck . Eight guns were mounted per side , and each had an arc of fire of 130 degrees and a maximum elevation of + 15 degrees . Each gun could fire a 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 @.@ 0 lb ) high @-@ explosive projectile a maximum distance of 22 @,@ 970 yards ( 21 @,@ 000 m ) at a rate of between four and six shots per minute . During their reconstruction in the 1930s , the maximum elevation of the guns was increased to + 30 degrees , which increased their maximum range by approximately 900 metres ( 980 yd ) . 
 The ships also mounted five or six 40 @-@ caliber 76 mm anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns . The 76 @-@ millimetre ( 3 in ) high @-@ angle guns were in single mounts on both sides of the forward superstructure , both sides of the second funnel , and each side of the aft superstructure ( Fusō lacked the starboard side aft gun ) . Each of these guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and could fire a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) projectile with a muzzle velocity of 680 m / s ( 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 7 @,@ 500 metres ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) . Both ships were equipped with six submerged 533 @-@ millimetre ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , three on each broadside . 
 The Fusō class 's secondary armament changed significantly over time . During the modernizations of the 1930s , all of the 76 mm guns were replaced with eight 40 @-@ caliber 127 mm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) dual @-@ purpose guns . These guns were fitted on both sides of the fore and aft superstructures in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a maximum ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 metres ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . During reconstruction , the two foremost 152 mm guns were also removed . 
 The light AA armament of the Fusō class changed dramatically from 1933 to 1944 . During the first reconstruction , Fusō was fitted with four quadruple 13 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) machine @-@ guns , while Yamashiro was fitted with eight twin 25 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) gun mounts . Both weapons were license @-@ built French Hotchkiss designs . The 25 mm guns were mounted on the Fusō class in single , double and triple mounts . This model was the standard Japanese light anti @-@ aircraft gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . The twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . The configuration of the anti @-@ aircraft guns varied significantly ; by the end of their final reconstruction , the Fusō class mounted eight twin mounts . In 1943 , seventeen single and two twin @-@ mounts were added for a total of 37 . In August 1944 , both were fitted with another twenty @-@ three single , six twin and eight triple @-@ mounts , for a total of 95 anti @-@ aircraft guns in their final configuration . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 When the Fusō class was completed , the ships ' armor was " typical for a pre @-@ Jutland battleship " . As built , the armor accounted for a displacement of 8 @,@ 588 long tons ( 8 @,@ 726 t ) , approximately 29 % of the class 's total displacement . Their waterline armor belt was 305 to 229 millimetres ( 12 to 9 in ) thick ; below it was a strake of 102 mm ( 4 in ) armor . The deck armor ranged in thickness from 32 to 51 mm ( 1 @.@ 3 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) . The turrets were protected with an armor thickness of 279 @.@ 4 mm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) on the face , 228 @.@ 6 mm ( 9 @.@ 0 in ) on the sides , and 114 @.@ 5 mm ( 4 @.@ 51 in ) on the roof . The barbettes of the turrets were protected by armor 305 mm thick , while the casemates of the 152 mm guns were protected by 152 mm armor plates . The sides of the conning tower were 351 millimetres ( 13 @.@ 8 in ) thick . Additionally , the vessels contained 737 watertight compartments ( 574 underneath the armor deck , 163 above ) to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage . 
 During their reconstruction , the armor of the battleships was substantially upgraded . Their deck armor was increased to a maximum thickness of 114 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) , and a longitudinal bulkhead of 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) of high @-@ tensile steel was added to improve the underwater protection . This brought the total armor tonnage up to 12 @,@ 199 long tons ( 12 @,@ 395 t ) , approximately 31 % of the total displacement of the Fusō class . Even after these improvements , the armor was still incapable of withstanding 14 @-@ inch shells .

 Yamashiro was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying @-@ off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1922 . She successfully launched Gloster Sparrowhawk and Sopwith Camel fighters from it , becoming the first Japanese ship to launch aircraft . When she was modernized in the 1930s , a catapult and a collapsible crane were fitted on the stern , and both ships were equipped to operate three floatplanes , although no hangar was provided . The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 and then by Mitsubishi F1M biplanes from 1942 on . 
 = = = Fire control and sensors = = = 
 When completed in 1915 , the ships had two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 11 ft 6 in ) and two 1 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 4 ft 11 in ) rangefinders in the forward superstructure , a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 14 ft 9 in ) rangefinder on the roof of Turret No. 2 , and 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter rangefinders in Turrets 3 , 4 , and 5 . In late 1917 a fire @-@ control director was installed on a platform on the foremast . The 4 @.@ 5 @-@ meter rangefinders were replaced by 8 @-@ meter ( 26 ft 3 in ) instruments in 1923 . During Fusō 's first modernization , four directors for the 12 @.@ 7 cm AA guns were added , one on each side of the fore and aft superstructures , and an eight @-@ meter rangefinder was installed at the top of the pagoda mast . This was replaced by a 10 @-@ meter ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinder during 1938 . At the same time , the two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter rangefinders on the forward superstructure were replaced by directors for the 25 mm AA guns . Additional 25 mm directors were installed on platforms on each side of the funnel . 
 While the ships were in drydock in July 1943 , Type 21 air search radar was installed on the roof of the 10 @-@ meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast . In August 1944 , two Type 22 surface search radar units were installed on the pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted . Yamashiro mounted hers on the mainmast , while Fusō was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her funnel .

 Two advanced versions of the class were planned , but the final design differed so markedly from Fusō 's that they became the Ise class . When she was completed in 1915 , Fusō was considered the first modern battleship of the Japanese Navy . She outclassed her American counterparts of the New York class in firepower and speed , and was considered the " most powerfully armed battleship in the world " . Despite extensive modernization in the 1930s , both battleships were considered obsolescent by the commencement of World War II . Following the loss of much of Japan 's aircraft carrier fleet by 1943 , a proposal was floated that would have converted both vessels into hybrid battleship @-@ carriers . Work was scheduled to commence in June 1943 , but the plan was cancelled and the two Ise @-@ class battleships were converted instead .

 Fusō was commissioned on 8 November 1915 and assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet on 13 December . The ship did not take part in any combat during World War I , as there were no longer any forces of the Central Powers in Asia by the time she was completed . She served as the flagship of the 1st Division during 1917 and 1918 , and patrolled off the coast of China during that time . The ship aided survivors of the Great Kanto Earthquake between 9 and 22 September 1923 . In the 1920s , Fusō conducted training off the coast of China and was often placed in reserve . After assignment as a training ship in 1936 and 1937 , she briefly operated in Chinese waters in early 1939 . 
 Yamashiro was completed on 31 March 1917 and assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917 – 18 , though she had no combat role in World War I. Like her sister , she patrolled off the coast of China during the war and assisted during the Great Kanto Earthquake . Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s , although she did make a port visit to Port Arthur , China , on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China . Yamashiro became flagship of the Combined Fleet in 1935 . In early 1941 , the ship experimentally launched radio @-@ controlled Kawanishi E7K2 floatplanes .

 In April and May 1941 , Fusō and Yamashiro were attached to the 2nd Division of the 1st Fleet , but the two ships spent most of the war around Japan , mostly at the anchorage at Hashirajima in Hiroshima Bay . When the war started for Japan on 8 December , the division sortied from Hashirajima to the Bonin Islands as distant support for the 1st Air Fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . On 18 April 1942 , they pursued but did not catch the American carrier force that had launched the Doolittle Raid . Commanded by Vice @-@ Admiral Shirō Takasu , the division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May , at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island ( Operation MI ) . 
 Afterwards , Yamashiro returned to home waters , where she stayed until August 1943 ; the next month , she became a training ship for midshipmen . In July 1943 , Yamashiro was at the Yokosuka drydock , then was briefly assigned as a training ship on 15 September before loading troops on 13 October bound for Truk Naval Base , arriving on the 20th . She sailed for Japan on 31 October . On 8 November , the submarine USS Halibut fired torpedoes at Junyo that missed , but hit Yamashiro with a torpedo that failed to detonate . Returning to Japanese waters , Yamashiro resumed her training duties . 
 During the US invasion of Saipan in June 1944 , Japanese troop ships attempting to reinforce the defenses were sunk by submarines . Shigenori Kami , chief of operations of the Navy Staff , volunteered to command Yamashiro to carry troops and equipment to Saipan . If the ship actually reached the island , he intended to deliberately beach the ship before it could be sunk and to use its artillery to defend the island . After Ryūnosuke Kusaka , Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet , also volunteered to go , Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō approved the plan , known as Operation Y @-@ GO , but the operation was cancelled after the decisive defeat in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June . 
 Fusō was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima , Hiroshima , for use as a training ship between 15 November 1942 and 15 January 1943 . On 8 June , she rescued 353 survivors from Mutsu when that ship exploded at Hashirajima . After carrying supplies to Truk Naval Base in August , Fusō made for Eniwetok two months later to be in a position to intercept an anticipated attack , returning to Truk on October 26 . She arrived on 21 February at Lingga Island , and was employed there as a training ship , before refitting at Singapore between 13 and 27 April and returning to Lingga . She was transferred to Tawi @-@ Tawi on 11 May , and provided cover for the abortive attempts to reinforce Biak Island at the end of the month . Fusō sailed to Tarakan Island off Borneo to refuel in early July before returning to Japan , escaping an attack by the submarine USS Pomfret . She was refitted in early August at Kure . 
 Both ships were transferred to Battleship Division 2 of the 2nd Fleet on 10 September . Yamashiro and Fusō alternated in the role of division flagship under Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura . They departed Kure on 23 September for Lingga Island , carrying the Army 's 25th Independent Mixed Regiment , and escaped an attack by the submarine USS Plaice the next day . They arrived on 4 October , then transferred to Brunei to offload their <unk> and refuel in preparation for Operation Shō @-@ Gō , the attempt to destroy the American fleet conducting the invasion of Luzon . 
 = = = = Battle of Surigao Strait = = = = 
 Nishimura 's " Southern Force " left Brunei at 15 : 30 on 22 October 1944 , heading east into the Sulu Sea and then to the northeast into the Mindanao Sea . Intending to join Vice @-@ Admiral Takeo Kurita 's force in Leyte Gulf , they passed west of Mindanao Island into Surigao Strait , where they met a large force of battleships , cruisers and destroyers lying in wait . The Battle of Surigao Strait would become the southernmost action in the Battle of Leyte Gulf . 
 At 09 : 08 on 24 October , Yamashiro , Fusō and the heavy cruiser Mogami spotted a group of 27 planes , including Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers escorted by Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters , that had been launched from the carrier Enterprise . Around 20 sailors on Yamashiro were killed by strafing and rocket attacks . Fusō 's catapult and both floatplanes were destroyed , and another bomb hit the ship near Turret No. 2 and penetrated the decks , killing everyone in No. 1 secondary battery . 
 Nishimura issued a telegram to Admiral Soemu Toyoda at 20 : 13 : " It is my plan to charge into Leyte Gulf to [ reach ] a point off Dulag at 04 : 00 hours on the 25th . " At 22 : 52 , his force spotted three or four Motor Torpedo Boats and opened fire , damaging PT @-@ 130 and PT @-@ 152 and forcing all of them to retreat before they could launch their torpedoes . 
 One or two torpedoes , possibly fired by the destroyer Melvin , hit Fusō amidships on the starboard side at 03 : 09 on the 25th ; she listed to starboard , slowed down , and fell out of formation . Some Japanese and American eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half , and that both halves remained afloat and burning for an hour , but they specifically mentioned only the size of the fire on the water , and not any details of the ship . Historian John Toland agreed in 1970 that Fusō had broken in two , but according to historian Anthony Tully in 2009 , " Fuso was torpedoed , and as a result of progressive flooding , upended and capsized within forty minutes . " She sank between 03 : 38 and 03 : 50 ; only a few dozen men survived her rapid descent and massive oil fire , and only ten reached shore . 
 At 03 : 52 , Yamashiro was attacked by a large formation to the north commanded by Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf . First came 6- and 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) shells from a line of eight cruisers , then 14 @-@ inch ( 360 mm ) and 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) shells from a line of six battleships . The main bombardment lasted 18 minutes , and Yamashiro was the only target for seven minutes . The first rounds hit the forecastle and pagoda mast , and soon the entire battleship appeared to be ablaze . Yamashiro 's two forward turrets targeted her assailants , and the secondary armament targeted the American destroyers plaguing Mogami and the destroyer Asagumo . There was a big explosion at 04 : 04 , possibly from one of the middle turrets . She was hit between 04 : 03 and 04 : 09 near the starboard engine room by a torpedo , and Nishimura wired to Kurita : " We proceed till totally annihilated . I have definitely accomplished my mission as pre @-@ arranged . Please rest assured . " At the same time , Oldendorf issued a cease @-@ fire order to the entire formation after hearing that the destroyer Albert W. Grant was taking friendly fire , and the Japanese ships also ceased fire . 
 Yamashiro increased speed , but she had been hit by two to four torpedoes , and after two more torpedo hits near the starboard engine room , she was listing 45 degrees to port . Shinoda gave the command to abandon ship , but neither he nor Nishimura made any attempt to leave the conning tower as the ship capsized within five minutes and quickly sank , stern first , vanishing from radar between 04 : 19 and 04 : 21 . Only 10 crewmembers of the estimated 1 @,@ 636 officers and crew on board survived .

 The University of Valle ( Spanish : Universidad del Valle ) , also called <unk> , is a public , departmental , coeducational , research university based primarily in the city of Cali , Valle del Cauca , Colombia . It is the largest higher education institution by student population in the southwest of the country , and the third in Colombia , with more than 30 @,@ 000 students . The university was established by ordinance No. 12 of 1945 , by the Departmental Assembly as the Industrial University of Valle del Cauca ( Spanish : Universidad Industrial del Valle del Cauca ) , under the leadership of Tulio Ramírez Rojas and Severo Reyes Gamboa . 
 The university has two campuses in Cali . The main one , known as University City of Melendez ( Spanish : Ciudad Universitaria Meléndez , <unk> ) , is located in the southern neighborhood of Melendez and hosts the faculties of Engineering , Humanities , Integrated Arts , Sciences , and Social Sciences and Economics , as well as the institutes of Education and Pedagogy , and Psychology . Its second one , located in the centric San Fernando neighborhood , hosts the faculties of Administration Sciences and Health . The university also has several satellite campuses across the department in the cities of Buenaventura , Buga , <unk> , Cartago , Palmira , <unk> , Yumbo , and <unk> , and one campus in the neighboring Cauca department in the city of Santander de <unk> . The university offers education at technological , undergraduate and postgraduate levels , with 258 academic programs , which includes 65 master and medical specialties , and 8 doctorates . Also , it hosts an excellence research center , six research centers , three research institutes , and 204 research groups . 
 The university is member of several university organizations including the Association of Colombian Universities ( ASCUN ) , the <unk> Association of Postgraduate Universities ( <unk> ) , and the <unk> University Network <unk> . The Valle , National and Antioquia universities form what is known as the Golden Triangle of higher education in Colombia , being among the most selective and competitive universities in the country . It is one of the 15 universities in the country to have received a high quality institutional accreditation by the Ministry of Education , through resolution 2020 of June 3 , 2005 . The accreditation was for eight years , making the university one of only a few to be accredited for such a duration . The University is considered a premier school in the country and usually excels in its Health and Engineering programs . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Establishment and early years = = = 
 Since the late 19th century the idea of creating a university in Cali had been an ambition of the people of the city and of the Valle del Cauca Department , and was continuously discussed and mentioned in the local newspapers . At the time , the only further education degrees awarded in the department were awarded by the Santa <unk> College in Cali and the Academic College of Buga , which focused on the liberal arts . In the 1940s , the necessity for qualified professionals that could supply the demand of the new industrial sector of Valle del Cauca made it clear that an institution focusing on scientific and technological education was of strategic importance to the development of the region . Despite the idea of its creation being met with some skepticism , the University of Valle was established by the ordinance number 12 of June 11 , 1945 , by the Departmental Assembly as the Universidad Industrial del Valle del Cauca . The leaders behind the establishment of the university were Tulio Ramírez Rojas , who would become the first rector of the university , and Severo Reyes Gamboa , the departmental secretary of education at the time . 
 The university began its work in 1945 in a small house located in downtown Cali , with faculties of <unk> , Business , and Nursing . In 1946 the Faculty of Chemistry was established , followed by the Faculty of Architecture in 1947 , and in 1948 the Faculty of Electrical Engineering , which changed its name in 1949 to the Faculty of Electromechanical Engineering . At this early stage , the university faced its first financial crisis , a situation that was preceded by the destitution of the rector Ramírez in 1949 by political reasons , and caused by the diminishing support of the local government . The crisis , which almost ended in the university closure in 1950 , would represent one of many chapters of the financial difficulties faced by the university in its history . 
 After the crisis was overcome , in 1950 the Faculty of Medicine was established , and began its work in 1951 on the campus of the Santa <unk> College . Then , in 1954 started the construction of the San Fernando campus for the Faculties of Medicine , Nursing , and Architecture . This same year , by ordinance number 10 of 1954 , the university changed its name to Universidad del Valle , established as part of the university government an Academic Council and an Administrative Council , the latter with the participation of representatives of different sectors of the community . 
 In 1955 , under the tutelage of rector Mario Carvajal , the university opened the School of Graduate Studies in Medicine , and its publishing house was established under the name of University of Valle Library ( Spanish : Biblioteca de la Universidad del Valle ) . In 1957 , the university began its technical and further education programs with the establishment of the schools of Medical Laboratory Technicians and Engineering Auxiliaries in Topography and Roads . At the end of the 1950s , the university comprised five faculties and three schools , 556 students , 174 professors , and 159 administrative staff . Its budget had risen to $ 5 @.@ 73 million COP and its patrimony to approximately $ 20 million COP . 
 = = = Academic consolidation and the student movement = = = 
 In 1962 , the Office of University Planning was established with the objective of developing a general plan for the university , which included the construction of a new campus , and the development of the regional university system by the creation of satellite campuses in the intermediate cities of the department . The new campus , located in the southern part of the city was construed on donated land and financed by a loan requested from the Inter @-@ American Development Bank ( IDB ) , the creation of an revenue stamp , and the request for a part of the land value tax revenues of the adjacent neighborhoods . In 1964 the Schools and Faculties were reorganized into Divisions and Departments , which translated into an increased academic activity . At the time , five divisions were established with the reorganization : Architecture , Economy , Engineering , Health , and Sciences ; and two more were created : Education and Humanities . By 1968 the university begun its internationalization process and an increment of its postgraduate programs , thanks to several donations made by several foreign foundations . By the end of the 1960s , the university had <unk> students , 453 full @-@ time and 174 part @-@ time professors , of which 9 % had a Doctorate , 20 % a Masters , and 21 % a Specialist degree . 
 At this time , the first serious student revolts started to emerge , motivated by the local and global changes of the decade , like the Vietnam war , the European student movement , the presence of the Peace Corps in Latin @-@ America and specially in Colombia , the rejection of the IDB loan and the presence of the foreign foundations . On February 15 , 1971 , after the <unk> election of the Dean of the Division of Social Science and Economics , some students took the rectory . This marked the first incursion of the police force to the university campus . For these events , some professors and students were expelled of the university . Nevertheless , the support for the rector dropped , who had to resign . Since mid February to April , the university was closed until the new rector was appointed . 
 In 1975 the university changed again its organizational structure into Faculties , and new programs were created , for example Social Communication and Journalism , Social Work were established in the Faculty of Humanities . In 1977 , in order to avoid the desertion of several faculty members , it was established the professorship career system based in academic , investigative , and administrative merits . In 1976 , with the creation of the Socio Economical Research Center , the first steps into the creation of the Sociology program in 1978 were taken . 
 = = = Social projection , research and technological development = = = 
 In 1983 , the Department of Administration branched out of the Faculty of Engineering and constituted the actual Faculty of Administration Sciences . In 1985 , the Professorial Statute Committee was created to determine the procedures related to the professorial career . The same year , the first agreements for the development of joint research projects were signed with the Ministry of National Education , COLCIENCIAS , the UNESCO , and the OAS , among others . This agreements are the cornerstone for the development in the 1990s of the Doctoral degrees offered by the university . Also , in the 1980s , and thanks to the establishment of a revenue stamp by the Congress of the Republic , the University began the establishment of its satellite campuses . At first , the courses presented in this campuses were only foundation courses , which required to the students its finalization in the main campus to obtain their degrees , until 1995 , when all the satellite campuses allowed the finalization of the program . 
 In 1994 , the Institute of Education and Pedagogy and the School of Psychology are established . In 1995 , from the fusion of the faculty of Architecture , and the programs of Social Communication , Drama , and Music is established the Faculty of Integrated Arts . This same year , the accreditation process of all the programs was carried out . 
 The incomes from the revenue stamp created a surplus in the university finances , which were poorly administrated . Excessive amounts of the budget were directed to the establishment of research institutes and centers , creation of new professorial chairs , and the construction of several buildings , the establishment of a technological infrastructure , including Internet access , creating a deficit in the universities accounts . This situation , together with the increasing cost of the retirement plans and the delay in its payments , were the causes of the financial and institutional crisis of 1998 , which ended in the closure of the university in the second semester of 1998 and the suspension of payment to all the academic and administrative staff members . 
 = = = Institutional accreditation and current standing = = = 
 In early 1999 , the University restarted its operations after several difficulties . The work of Rectors Emilio <unk> Nasser and Oscar Rojas Rentería , allowed the creation of the Retirement Fund in 2000 with the participation of the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit , the Governor of Valle del Cauca and the University , which has managed since then the retirement plans for all the staff . Also , the debt contracted with the private banking sector was renegotiated and will be paid in full by 2010 , and the wages were paid . 
 In 2000 a new curricular adjustment was made , with the objective to fulfill all the quality accreditation requirements . In 2001 the coverage was increased by the aperture of the programs each semester and the creation of nocturnal courses . The same year , the research system was implemented and the Publishing House was reopened .

It is home to an excellence research center , 6 research centers , 3 research institutes , and 276 groups , of which 122 are recognized by COLCIENCIAS . In 2007 276 research projects were carried out , with an investment totaling $ 8 @.@ 84 billion COP provided by fifteen national and international entities . 
 The Excellence Center for Novel Materials ( Spanish : Centro de <unk> en <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) is part of a high @-@ priority national effort , supported primarily by COLCIENCIAS and implemented by 19 recognized multidisciplinary research groups in 10 universities across the nation . Additionally , it gets international support from four world @-@ renowned institutions : The Nanotechnology center from Northwestern University , the Thin Film and Nanoscience Group from the University of California at San Diego , the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Michigan , and the Center for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research on Materials from the University of Chile . Research work at <unk> is organized around 4 Interdisciplinary Research Themes ( IRT ) , which are : Advanced Coatings , Composite Materials , Nano @-@ magnetism , and Solid State Devices , Sensors , and <unk> Systems . The center acquired in 2008 an Atomic force microscope , the first in South America , with a cost of $ 620 million COP .

 The University of Valle Publishing Program ( Spanish : Programa Editorial de la Universidad del Valle ) , is the publishing arm of the University . While its origins can be traced since 1955 , when it started operation under the name University of Valle Library ( Spanish : Biblioteca de la Universidad del Valle ) , the current publisher was established under Agreement 005 of the University Council on the 29 of April 2002 , and it is regulated by Agreement 006 of 2004 . It is a dependency of the Vice @-@ rectory for Research and its editorial board is comprised by the Vice @-@ rectors for Academics and Research , five tenured Professors , and the manager of the program . The program publishes books and scientific journals , both in print and electronic media with more than 300 titles currently on print . 
 = = Student life = = 
 = = = Activism = = = 
 The university has a student body deeply involved in social activism . Its origins can be traced to the early years of the university . In 1954 the first national student congress took place in Cali , where the main issues that the student movement would tackle were defined : the university 's autonomy , and the freedom and democratization of education . Then , in 1957 , the National Union of University Students was established . The university would become an important member of this organization , whose first significant action would take place in May of the same year that ended the dictatorship of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla . The events started with a strike by students of the university , followed by students of private universities in Bogotá , and then by workers in the industrial , transportation , financial , and commercial sectors . 
 The student movement has not been free from the influence of radical groups . This influence intensified in the 1960s , during the government of Carlos <unk> Restrepo , who initiated a repressive and military approach to the university conflicts . Since then , there have been confrontations between radical groups , from inside and outside of the university , and the police , in the campus grounds and its surroundings . On some occasions this resulted in participants being injured or even killed . On April 4 , 2001 , during a confrontation between masked individuals and the Mobile Anti @-@ Disturbance Squadron ( Spanish : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) , police patrolmen John Arce was killed by an explosive . This incident was followed by the incursion of the police force into the university , which left equipment , buildings , and vehicles damaged . On September 22 , 2005 , during a protest against the Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Colombia , the chemistry student Jhonny Silva <unk> was killed , according by some witnesses , by the police force . 
 While most of the university community is against the actions of the radical movements , this has not prevented the stigmatization of the student body by the general population . This attitude has led to the belief that the guerrilla and subversive groups that operate in Colombia have clandestine operatives inside the university , a belief that has been supported by the discovery of unconventional weaponry inside the university grounds . This has resulted in the targeting of student activists by criminal and paramilitary groups . On October 4 , 2006 , a student of Technology of <unk> Attention and representative at the Academic Council , Julian Andrés Hurtado , was killed by hitmen . In his honor , the Government of Valle del Cauca and the Institute for the Development of Valle del Cauca ( Spanish : Instituto <unk> para el Desarrollo del Valle del Cauca , <unk> ) established a scholarship program that bears his name . Another situation that reflects the stigmatization of the student body is the unfounded arrests of students during the disturbances , such as those that occurred on April 3 , 2008 , when four students were captured without substantial evidence , and eventually released when it was demonstrated that they were not even near the confrontation site at the time of the disturbances .

 The university participates in the Southwest division of the ASCUN tournament , along with other 26 institutions from the departments of Cauca , Nariño , and Valle del Cauca , with student , staff , and faculty teams . These games are qualifiers for the national tournament , which has been held every year since 1996 . The university has male and female varsity teams in Basketball , Billiards , Chess , Cycling , Futsal , Judo , Karate , Rugby , Soccer , Swimming , Taekwondo , table and outdoor Tennis , Track and field , Triathlon , Beach and indoor Volleyball , and Weightlifting . The university also participates in smaller invitational tournaments , such as the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Loyola cups .

 The university has 53 student groups and organizations , involved in research , academic , ecological , social history , and sports activities . Three of the most notable student groups are the " Carmen López " folk dance group , the " El <unk> " storytellers group and the " Coro Magno " choir . 
 = = Noted people = = 
 In over 60 years of history , the university has held among its students , faculty , and staff , many notable people , including politicians , scientists , and artists . This includes the current governor of Nariño Antonio Navarro Wolff , and the former governor of Valle del Cauca Gustavo Álvarez <unk> , who not only are alumni of the university , but at one point in time were also faculty members . The former Ministry of the Interior and Justice and ambassador of Colombia in Italy , <unk> <unk> de la Vega , attended the university as well . 
 Some scientists affiliated to the university are <unk> Herrera Valencia , head of the Immunology Research Institute of the university and creator of a synthetic vaccine against malaria ; and Raúl Cuero , a researcher in biotechnology at the Texas A & M University and an employee at NASA . 
 The faculty of Integrated Arts is also gaining national notability . The film directors Antonio Dorado and Carlos Moreno , both alumni of the university , are part of the new generation of Colombian filmmakers . Dorado , who is also a faculty member , directed the movie The King , which was nominated for the Goya Awards . Moreno directed the movie Dog Eat Dog , which was the first Colombian movie to be shown in the Sundance Film Festival . 
 = Hugh Stewart ( classical scholar ) = 
 Hugh Stewart , CMG , DSO & bar , MC ( 1 September 1884 – 21 September 1934 ) was an academic , military leader and historian whose work had a major impact in both England and New Zealand . 
 Born in Scotland , Stewart worked in Russia teaching English after completing his education . He then taught classical studies , firstly at the University of Liverpool in England and then at Canterbury College in Christchurch , New Zealand . During the First World War , he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force . He participated in several engagements at Gallipoli and on the Western Front , and was decorated for bravery and leadership . He ended the war as a lieutenant @-@ colonel and commanding a battalion of the Canterbury Infantry Regiment , having also briefly led the 2nd Infantry Brigade . 
 After the war , Stewart wrote a history of the New Zealand Division , which was published in 1921 and would be the main reference work for this formation for several decades . He resumed his teaching career at Canterbury College but in 1926 returned to England , as a Professor of Latin at the University of Leeds . In 1929 , he became the principal of University College of Nottingham . He died suddenly in 1934 while in transit to England after a holiday in New Zealand . 
 = = Early life and teaching career = = 
 Stewart was born on 1 September 1884 in <unk> , Aberdeenshire , Scotland , to John Stewart , a Presbyterian minister , and Margaret Mackintosh . He was educated at the local public school in <unk> . An excellent student , he earned a scholarship to Fettes College at Edinburgh . In 1903 , he attended the University of Edinburgh and then transferred to Trinity College , Cambridge , from which he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907 , majoring in Classical Studies . During his tertiary education he also served in the Territorial Force as a lieutenant in the 6th Battalion , King 's Regiment ( Liverpool ) . 
 Stewart spent the next two years working in Russia as a tutor , teaching English . He learned the Russian language and wrote a book describing his experiences and the country , Provincial Russia . Returning to England , he took up an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University of Liverpool . In 1912 , he accepted a professorship teaching classics at Canterbury College , in Christchurch , New Zealand . At the college , later to become the University of Canterbury , he acquired a reputation for his energy and wit . In his leisure time , he often went climbing in the Southern Alps . 
 = = First World War = = 
 When the First World War broke out in August 1914 , Stewart enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( NZEF ) . He received a commission as a lieutenant and was posted to the Canterbury Battalion , New Zealand Infantry Brigade , which embarked from Wellington in October 1914 for Suez , Egypt . In Egypt , the brigade was combined with an Australian infantry brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division , intended for service in the Gallipoli Campaign . 
 Stewart served at Gallipoli and received a head wound during the fighting at Quinn 's Post in June 1915 but , despite this , remained in the frontlines . He was promoted to captain in August , and to major two months later . He was recommended for the Military Cross for his action at Quinn 's Post and this was duly gazetted following the withdrawal of the Allies from Gallipoli . He was also awarded the French Croix de guerre for his " distinguished services rendered during the course of the campaign " . 
 By January 1916 , the manpower of the NZEF had expanded sufficiently that it could field a full infantry division on the Western Front . Accordingly , the New Zealand and Australian Division , which had been evacuated to Egypt from Gallipoli , was disbanded and the New Zealand Division created from the original infantry brigade as well as two new brigades ( the 2nd Infantry Brigade and New Zealand Rifle Brigade ) , which had recently arrived from New Zealand . Promoted to lieutenant @-@ colonel on 27 February 1916 , Stewart took command of the newly formed 2nd Battalion , Canterbury Infantry Regiment , which was attached to the 2nd Infantry Brigade . He led the battalion for nearly the duration of its service on the Western Front . 
 In June 1917 , Stewart was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) in recognition of his leadership of his battalion during the Battle of Flers – Courcelette in September the previous year . He had planned and executed an attack by his battalion on German @-@ held trenches and , once the objective was captured , organised its defence against several counterattacks . He was awarded a bar to his DSO six months later , for his efforts during the Battle of Messines during which he was wounded . His injuries were severe , due to eight separate shrapnel wounds , and he was evacuated to London for treatment . Returning to the field in late 1917 , he was temporary commander of the 2nd Infantry Brigade at various times during 1918 while its regular commander was on leave or employed elsewhere . While on leave , on 21 February 1918 , Stewart married Alexandrina Kathleen Johnston at Uttoxeter , in the county of Staffordshire in England . 
 Just after the cessation of hostilities he was temporarily promoted to colonel , and was appointed Director of Education for the NZEF . He remained at that post through to February 1919 at which time he was discharged from the NZEF , having reverted to his substantive rank of lieutenant colonel . During the course of the war , Stewart had been mentioned in despatches five times . In May 1919 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George , and his citation noted his leadership of his battalion and temporary command of 2nd Infantry Brigade as well as his educational work for the NZEF . 
 = = Postwar life = = 
 Stewart was commissioned by the New Zealand Government to write a history of the New Zealand Division and its service on the Western Front as part of the Official History of New Zealand 's Effort in the Great War . He began work on the first draft in January 1919 , while still in England . He returned to New Zealand in December that year and resumed his prewar teaching position at Canterbury College , while continuing work on his history . The final result , titled The New Zealand Division 1916 – 1919 : A Popular History Based on Official Records , was published in 1921 and remained the primary reference for New Zealand 's contribution to the campaign on the Western Front for several decades . Prior to its publication , Stewart 's wife died shortly after giving birth to a son . 
 Although discharged from the NZEF , Stewart was still in the military reserve and commanded a battalion of the Territorial Force ( TF ) . He was later given command of the TF 's 3rd Infantry Brigade . From 1924 to 1926 , he was president of the New Zealand Returned Servicemen 's Association . His leadership of the association ended when he left New Zealand to become Professor of Latin at the University of Leeds . 
 On 28 July 1927 , Stewart married Margaret Rosamond Poulton at <unk> , Shropshire , England . The marriage was brief ; she , along with the couple 's baby son , died during childbirth in August 1928 . In 1929 Stewart was appointed principal of University College of Nottingham , later to become the University of Nottingham . In a history of the University of Canterbury , published in 1973 , the authors wrote that Stewart was the " most able leader and administrator ... the College [ of Nottingham ] ever had " . The year after his move to Nottingham , Stewart married Margaret Isabel Massey in London . The couple had two children , a daughter and a son . 
 Stewart travelled to New Zealand on holiday in August 1934 , and resumed many of his past military acquaintances . While returning to England he died unexpectedly aboard the ship Akaroa and was buried at sea . He was survived by his third wife and his three children .

 After his death , Stewart was honoured by the renaming of Lenton Hall of Residence at the University of Nottingham to Hugh Stewart Hall . The university also named a scholarship after him . A tablet in his honour was unveiled on 18 January 1935 at the premises of the Christchurch Returned Soldier 's Association by the former commander of the NZEF , Alexander Godley . 
 = Meinhard Michael Moser = 
 Meinhard Michael Moser ( 13 March 1924 – 30 September 2002 ) was an Austrian mycologist . His life 's work principally concerned the taxonomy , chemistry and toxicity of the gilled mushrooms ( Agaricales ) , especially those of the genus Cortinarius , and the ecology of ectomycorrhiza . His contributions to the Kleine <unk> <unk> series of mycological guidebooks were well @-@ regarded and widely used . In particular , his 1953 <unk> und Bauchpilze ( Agaricales und Gastromycetes ) , which became known as simply " Moser " , saw several editions in both the original German and in translation . 
 After showing interest in natural sciences in his youth , he studied at the University of Innsbruck . However , his university career was interrupted by the need to complete military service . He was stationed as a translator in eastern Europe during World War II , before being captured and placed in a prisoner of war camp . He was released in 1948 , subsequently returning to Innsbruck to complete his studies . After completing his doctorate in 1950 , Moser worked in England for six months , researching the symbiotic relationships between plants and fungi . Upon his return to Austria , he took up a position with the Federal Forestry Research Institute , where he remained until 1968 , taking part in influential research on the use of mycorrhizal fungi in reforestation . He began lecturing at the University of Innsbruck in 1956 , and in 1972 he became the inaugural head of the first Institute of Microbiology in Austria . He remained with the Institute until his retirement in 1991 . His studies continued until his death in 2002 . An influential mycologist , he received a number of awards throughout his life , and numerous fungal taxa have been named in his honour .

 = = = Early life , university and military service = = = 
 Moser was born on 13 March 1924 in Innsbruck , Austria , to parents Margaretha and Josef Moser . His father was a teacher at a technical college in the city , while his mother was the daughter of noted botanist Emil Johann Lambert <unk> . Moser attended primary school and grammar school in the city , and showed an interest in natural sciences from a young age . His interest was cultivated by <unk> , and Moser 's earliest paintings of mushrooms date to 1935 when he was 11 years old . 
 In 1942 , Moser enrolled at the University of Innsbruck , taking classes in botany , zoology , geology , physics and chemistry . At this time , Austria was under the control of Nazi Germany and did not exist as an independent state . Moser became an authorised mushroom controller and instructor , and it was officially requested that he attend mycological seminars around Germany and Austria . At these seminars , he met a number of prominent mycologists , including Ernst Thirring . Thirring showed Moser some of the issues surrounding the large genus Cortinarius , which remained an interest for the rest of his life . In 1943 , aged 19 and after only three terms at Innsbruck , his studies were interrupted so he could perform military service . Having shown earlier promise in languages , he was trained as an interpreter , then sent to the Balkan Peninsula . He continued to show an active interest in mycology , collecting and identifying mushrooms and reading Rolf Singer 's Das System der Agaricales . 
 In 1945 , when Moser was 21 years old and still carrying out active military service , he was captured in Czechoslovakia by Soviet soldiers and made a prisoner of war . He was imprisoned in a labour camp in Crimea , in the Ukraine . While a prisoner , he was involved in repairing the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas , Sevastopol . His time at the camp was not easy ; working in construction , he had to work to his physical limits , and was involved in a serious crash that killed several other prisoners . Moser was released in 1948 , and chose to return to his studies at the University of Innsbruck . His first publication came in 1949 ; " Über das <unk> von Formen der Gattung Morchella auf <unk> " [ " Mass @-@ fruiting of forms of the genus Morchella on forest @-@ ﬁre areas " ] was published in the journal Sydowia . In 1950 , under the supervision of Arthur Pisek , Moser completed his doctoral thesis , " Zur <unk> der <unk> <unk> , mit <unk> <unk> von <unk> " [ " Water relations in higher fungi with special emphasis on forest @-@ ﬁre areas " ] . During his time at university , he became a member of both the Société <unk> de France and the British Mycological Society . Having become friends with prominent German mycologists during the War , he was keen to re @-@ establish academic relationships throughout Europe in the years following the conflict . 
 = = = England and the Federal Institute for Forestry Research = = = 
 Due to the quality of his doctoral work , Moser received a grant from the British Council and , in 1951 , he moved to England , where he stayed for six months . There , he performed research in the laboratory of Jack Harley in Oxford , looking into the symbiosis between fungi and forest trees , and spent some time performing taxonomic studies at the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew . After his return to Austria , he was , in 1952 , offered a post at the Federal Institute for Forestry Research at Imst , which he accepted . There , he applied what he had learnt about the symbiosis of fungi and trees to the practical issue of reforestation in the Alps , and developed a method for the use of ectomycorrhizal fungi for the " inoculation " of trees , which later became standard practice around the world . Moser remained with the institute until 1968 . 
 In his time with the institute , Moser continued his taxonomic studies . In 1953 , he published the first edition of his Die Blätter und Bauchpilze ( Agaricales und Gastromycetes ) , a monograph of the Agaricales and Gastromycetes of central Europe , containing 3150 taxa . The work served as an update on Adalbert Ricken 's <unk> für <unk> ( 1918 ) , though reflecting Moser 's taxonomic views , which were highly influenced by Singer . The book was part of a series named Kleine <unk> Mitteleuropa , edited by Helmut <unk> . The work , which became known simply as " Moser " , was updated and republished numerous times over the following decades , and translated into both Italian and English , with the latter translation being sponsored by Roger Phillips . His monograph on the Agaricales was also published separately from this work . René Pomerleau described a 1967 reprint of the Agaricales monograph , containing descriptions of <unk> species , as " probably the most complete and up @-@ to @-@ date descriptive flora of this group of fungi for central Europe " . Die Blätter und Bauchpilze ( Agaricales und Gastromycetes ) became important for the study of biodiversity in and out of Europe , and was a " much used and appreciated field manual " . The work continued to be used as an authoritative reference for several decades ; in 1981 , it was still being called " the most @-@ used and most authoritative handbook on larger European fleshy fungi " . 
 = = = University of Innsbruck = = = 
 In 1956 , while still a researcher at the Federal Institute , Moser began lecturing on microbiology at the University of Innsbruck , with the title of " Privatdozent " . During this time , he continued to publish . His monograph on the genus <unk> , a taxon now considered to be part of Cortinarius , was published in 1960 as part of Die <unk> <unk> series . Unlike the previous three books in the series , which were all written by German authors , the work addressed mushrooms that were of less interest to amateur mycologists ; for instance , the genus was not considered to contain any significant edible species . The book drew upon Moser 's expertise concerning mycorrhizal relationships . It listed 166 species , including some " exotic " taxa . Some of the listed species were described for the first time in that volume . The illustrations , which came in the form of a number of coloured plates , were mostly Moser 's own work ; Singer described these in a review of the book as " both in original execution and reproduction among the best that have been published " . Discussing the book as a whole , Singer said that the volume , " outstanding for its good print , attractive appearance , and interesting contents , should be present in every mycological library " . 
 In 1963 , Moser published a second work in the Kleine <unk> von Mitteleuropa series , <unk> ( <unk> ) . This work was a monograph on the Ascomycetes , focussing on the Discomycetes . Though not as well known as his earlier book , it was well received in the mycological community . The mycologist Richard Korf , reviewing the work in an article published in Mycologia , said that " the book belongs on the shelf of every mycological library in Europe " , praising the " [ e ] <unk> , workable keys to the orders , families , genera , and European species " . Korf wrote that , " [ i ] f a single fault can be found , it is surely the lack of documentation provided " . However , a combination of a lack of time and Moser 's comparative lack of expertise in Ascomycetes prevented subsequent editions of the work . 
 Moser was promoted to Associate University Professor in 1964 . Two years later , the Faculty of Science of the University of Innsbruck recommended that a chair of microbiology should be created at the Botanical Institute in Innsbruck . The Federal Ministry of Education accepted the recommendation . Moser was the only candidate for the position , and was unanimously named by a number of leading European botanists and mycologists for the post in 1967 . Subsequently , in 1968 , Moser was promoted to full professor , and , in 1972 , Moser became the head of the newly established Institute of Microbiology , the first of its kind in Austria . He remained in charge of the Institute until his retirement . He taught on a wide range of subjects , including the taxonomy of fungi , ecology of fungi , <unk> , bacteria , viruses , chemotaxonomy , molecular genetics , microbial toxicology , immunology and symbiosis . During his career at the university , he oversaw over 60 doctoral theses , in addition to a number of diploma theses . In 1970 , Moser became the president of the Austrian Mycological Society , taking over after the death of the previous post @-@ holder , Kurt <unk> . <unk> , in turn , had taken up the position after the death of his predecessor , Thirring , earlier that year . Moser remained the society 's president for 21 years . 
 Moser published Cortinarius Fr. und nahe <unk> <unk> in <unk> in 1975 , which was coauthored by Egon Horak . The work , along with his earlier monograph on " <unk> " , proved to be some of Moser 's most important , serving to encourage others to engage with Cortinarius in a meaningful way . Cortinarius Fr. und nahe <unk> <unk> in <unk> was a study of Cortinarius , <unk> and <unk> , a new genus first described in that work , in South America , and was dedicated to Singer . The work contained descriptions of 276 new species . Alexander H. Smith stressed the significance of the work , saying " Anyone who has not worked in the systematics of Cortinarius cannot fully appreciate the magnitude and importance of this work to the general subject of the distribution and speciation of the higher fungi . " 
 In 1983 , in recognition of his forthcoming 60th birthday , an article dedicated to Moser was published in Sydowia . The piece , compiled by Franz <unk> , C. <unk> @-@ <unk> and Egon Horak , contained a detailed biography and a full bibliography of the 116 research publications Moser had authored or co @-@ authored between 1949 and 1983 . Moser , writing with Walter Jülich , published the first volume of the book series <unk> der <unk> in 1985 , presenting specimens of various Basidiomycota taxa . By the time of Moser 's death , 19 volumes had been published ; some subsequently published volumes have listed Moser as an author . 
 = = = Retirement and death = = = 
 In 1991 , at the earliest possible date , Moser retired from his teaching position to avoid the administrative burden and to focus on his research into Cortinarius and related genera . After his retirement , he continued to work heavily , typically beginning at 5 am . In 1992 , he researched the presence of Agaricales in the Crimean Mountains , identifying 70 previously undocumented species , including some new to science . In 1995 , in celebration of Moser 's 70th birthday , a supplement of Sydowia was published in his honour . 
 Moser died on 30 September 2002 . After returning from 7th International Congress in Oslo , Norway , he suffered a series of heart attacks . After being admitted to hospital , his condition rapidly declined before his death . Obituaries were published in a variety of academic journals , including Mycological Progress , Mycological Research , Sydowia , Österreichische Zeitschrift für Pilzkunde , and Berichte des <unk> @-@ <unk> Verein Innsbruck . Horak and colleagues , writing for the journal Mycological Research , described Moser 's death as " an irreplaceable loss to the international community of mycological science " , and , writing in Sydowia , they said that the " mycological world has lost one of its pillars of taxonomy for agarics and boletes . His former students , assistants and collaborators at the Microbiological Institute at the University of Innsbruck , his professional colleagues in the mycological community worldwide and his many friends will deeply regret the loss of a distinguished researcher , teacher , leader and mentor . " In a short obituary of Moser as part of their report on the Eighth International Symposium on Arctic @-@ Alpine Mycology , mycologists Cathy Cripps and Joe Ammirati called him a " gentlemanly scholar " who " led us in his quiet way across the tundra and down many dichotomous paths " . 
 = = Research = = 
 Over the course of his career , Moser collected over 25 @,@ 000 mycological specimens . He first described around 420 Cortinarius species and around 80 other species , including both agarics and boletes . He circumscribed three new genera : <unk> ( 1966 ) , <unk> ( 1975 ) and <unk> ( 2002 ) . Much of his research covered four key areas : the taxonomy of Agaricales — including the classical <unk> and the chemotaxonomy of the order — the toxicity of the chemical constituents of members of the same order , and the ecology of ectomycorrhiza . 
 In the early decades of his careers , Moser sought to clarify the taxonomic identity of European fungi by collecting specimens to be described as <unk> in the localities studied by Elias Magnus Fries , but this was no longer necessary after changes to nomenclatural rules that took effect in 1981 . Among the Agaricales , Moser 's interest was primarily in the complex genus Cortinarius . He published book @-@ length works addressing Cortinarius taxa found in Europe and , co @-@ writing with Horak , South America . Moser , working with Joe Ammirati , contributed to research on the genus in North America , and also examined Asian and Australasian taxa . He had a particular interest in Arctic – alpine habitats , and he documented , painted and published on his collections in these and other sites around the world . Moser initially doubted the usefulness of molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Agaricales , but later contributed to research in this area . 
 Cortinarius mushrooms are often highly colourful . Moser " made the first successful steps " towards studying the pigments in these mushrooms , hoping to find criteria for separating taxa , and some of his PhD students studied these elements in depth . Cooperating with biochemists , he produced important work on the biosynthesis of pigments . Moser was also interested in the toxicity of the Agaricales , and was — with his students — involved with research on the toxin <unk> . 
 Moser 's work on ectomycorrhiza , though perhaps unknown to many researchers familiar with his taxonomic work , was notable due to its focus on the fungal partners in the relationship . He engaged in a large amount of research on woodland in the transitional zone between subalpine and alpine habitats . His published results included the description of new taxa . In 1960 , Singer referred to Moser as " one of the pioneers of mycorrhiza research , both basic and applied " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 At the end of his life , Moser lived in the village of Vill , near Innsbruck . According to some of his colleagues , " Moser was rather shy , taciturn , formal and constrained in public or in official functions . In a relaxed atmosphere among students , collaborators or friends , he became extrovert and surprised many by his sense of humour and ready wit . " He had a commitment to both mycological research and mycological education , and was fluent in several languages . He was known as an intellectual and a wide @-@ reader , with interests in fine art , classical music , literature , exploration , geography and botany . In addition to reading and walking , he enjoyed stamp collecting and growing plants from seeds he had collected on his research trips . He was a capable cook , often creating mushroom @-@ based dishes for guests , though was on one occasion poisoned during " gastronomic experiments with <unk> and Agaricus " . He was also known to make chanterelle schnapps , drinking it with his students and sharing his recipe with colleagues . 
 = = Recognition = = 
 Throughout his life , Moser received a number of awards , including the Clusius Medal ( Budapest 1978 ) and the Kardinal <unk> Preis ( Vienna 1985 ) . In 1986 , he was made a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences . Having already been elected as an honorary member of the Ukrainian Botanical Society , he became a foreign member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in 1992 , the first mycologist to be elected . He was recognised by a number of mycological societies , including becoming an honorary member of the Mycological Society of America in 1987 , and Centenary Fellow of the British Mycological Society in 1996 . He also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Lyon in 1984 , and in 1990 was awarded honorary citizenship of Borgotaro , Italy .

The IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington , D.C. , United States . It was established in 1956 as the private sector arm of the World Bank Group to advance economic development by investing in strictly for @-@ profit and commercial projects that purport to reduce poverty and promote development . The IFC 's stated aim is to create opportunities for people to escape poverty and achieve better living standards by mobilizing financial resources for private enterprise , promoting accessible and competitive markets , supporting businesses and other private sector entities , and creating jobs and delivering necessary services to those who are poverty @-@ stricken or otherwise vulnerable . Since 2009 , the IFC has focused on a set of development goals that its projects are expected to target . Its goals are to increase sustainable agriculture opportunities , improve health and education , increase access to financing for microfinance and business clients , advance infrastructure , help small businesses grow revenues , and invest in climate health . 
 The IFC is owned and governed by its member countries , but has its own executive leadership and staff that conduct its normal business operations . It is a corporation whose shareholders are member governments that provide paid @-@ in capital and which have the right to vote on its matters . Originally more financially integrated with the World Bank Group , the IFC was established separately and eventually became authorized to operate as a financially autonomous entity and make independent investment decisions . It offers an array of debt and equity financing services and helps companies face their risk exposures , while refraining from participating in a management capacity . The corporation also offers advice to companies on making decisions , evaluating their impact on the environment and society , and being responsible . It advises governments on building infrastructure and partnerships to further support private sector development . 
 The corporation is assessed by an independent evaluator each year . In 2011 , its evaluation report recognized that its investments performed well and reduced poverty , but recommended that the corporation define poverty and expected outcomes more explicitly to better @-@ understand its effectiveness and approach poverty reduction more strategically . The corporation 's total investments in 2011 amounted to $ 18 @.@ 66 billion . It committed $ 820 million to advisory services for 642 projects in 2011 , and held $ 24 @.@ 5 billion worth of liquid assets . The IFC is in good financial standing and received the highest ratings from two independent credit rating agencies in 2010 and 2011 . 
 = = History = = 
 The World Bank and International Monetary Fund were designed by delegates at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 and the World Bank , then consisting of only the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , became operational in 1946 . Robert L. Garner joined the World Bank in 1947 as a senior executive and expressed his view that private business could play an important role in international development . In 1950 , Garner and his colleagues proposed establishing a new institution for the purpose of making private investments in the developing countries served by the Bank . The U.S. government encouraged the idea of an international corporation working in tandem with the World Bank to invest in private enterprises without accepting guarantees from governments , without managing those enterprises , and by collaborating with third party investors . When describing the IFC in 1955 , World Bank President Eugene R. Black said that the IFC would only invest in private firms , rather than make loans to governments , and it would not manage the projects in which it invests . In 1956 the International Finance Corporation became operational under the leadership of Garner . It initially had 12 staff members and $ 100 million ( $ 844 @.@ 9 million in 2012 dollars ) in capital . The corporation made its inaugural investment in 1957 by making a $ 2 million ( $ 16 @.@ 4 million in 2012 dollars ) loan to a Brazil @-@ based affiliate of Siemens & Halske ( now Siemens AG ) . In 2007 , IFC bought 18 % stake in the Indian Financial firm , Angel <unk> . In December 2015 IFC supported Greek banks with 150 million euros by buying shares in four of them : Alpha Bank ( 60 million ) , <unk> ( 50 million ) , Piraeus Bank ( 20 million ) and National Bank of Greece ( 20 million ) . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The IFC is governed by its Board of Governors which meets annually and consists of one governor per member country ( most often the country 's finance minister or treasury secretary ) . Each member typically appoints one governor and also one alternate . Although corporate authority rests with the Board of Governors , the governors delegate most of their corporate powers and their authority over daily matters such as lending and business operations to the Board of Directors . The IFC 's Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors who meet regularly and work at the IFC 's headquarters , and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group . The executive directors collectively represent all 184 member countries . When the IFC 's Board of Directors votes on matters brought before it , each executive director 's vote is weighted according to the total share capital of the member countries represented by that director . The IFC 's Executive Vice President and CEO oversees its overall direction and daily operations . As of October 2012 , Jin @-@ Yong Cai serves as the Executive Vice President and CEO of the IFC . President of the World Bank Group Jim Yong Kim appointed Jin @-@ Yong Cai to serve as the new Executive Vice President and CEO of the IFC . Cai is a Chinese citizen who formerly served as a managing director for Goldman Sachs and has over 20 years of financial sector experience . 
 Although the IFC coordinates its activities in many areas with the other World Bank Group institutions , it generally operates independently as it is a separate entity with legal and financial autonomy , established by its own Articles of Agreement . The corporation operates with a staff of over 3 @,@ 400 employees , of which half are stationed in field offices across its member nations .

Of that total investment commitment , approximately 39 % ( $ 4 @.@ 9 billion ) was invested into 255 projects across 58 member nations of the World Bank 's International Development Association ( IDA ) . 
 The IFC makes loans to businesses and private projects generally with maturities of seven to twelve years . It determines a suitable repayment schedule and grace period for each loan individually to meet borrowers ' currency and cash flow requirements . The IFC may provide longer @-@ term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it . Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive loans from the IFC . Though loans have traditionally been denominated in hard currencies , the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies . Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local currencies in 2010 , and 45 local currencies in 2011 , funded largely through swap markets .

The IFC invests in businesses ' equity either directly or via private equity funds , generally from five up to twenty percent of a company 's total equity . IFC ’ s private equity portfolio currently stands at roughly $ 3 @.@ 0 billion committed to about 180 funds .

When the IFC invests in a company , it does not assume an active role in management of the company . 
 Through its Global Trade Finance Program , the IFC guarantees trade payment obligations of more than 200 approved banks in over 80 countries to mitigate risk for international transactions .

The program was created in 1957 and as of 2011 has channeled approximately $ 38 billion from over 550 financial institutions toward development projects in over 100 different emerging markets . The IFC syndicated a total of $ 4 @.@ 7 billion in loans in 2011 , twice that of its $ 2 billion worth of <unk> in 2010 . Due to banks <unk> from lending across borders in emerging markets , in 2009 the IFC started to syndicate parallel loans to the international financial institutions and other participants . 
 To service clients without ready access to low @-@ cost financing , the IFC relies on structured or securitized financial products such as partial credit guarantees , portfolio risk transfers , and Islamic finance . The IFC committed $ 797 million in the form of structured and securitized financing in 2010 . For companies that face difficulty in obtaining financing due to a perception of high credit risk , the IFC <unk> assets with predictable cash flows , such as mortgages , credit cards , loans , corporate debt instruments , and revenue streams , in an effort to enhance those companies ' credit . 
 Financial derivative products are made available to the IFC 's clients strictly for hedging interest rate risk , exchange rate risk , and commodity risk exposure . It serves as an intermediary between emerging market businesses and international derivatives market makers to increase access to risk management instruments . 
 The IFC fulfills a treasury role by borrowing international capital to fund lending activities . It is usually one of the first institutions to issue bonds or to do swaps in emerging markets denominated in those markets ' local currencies . The IFC 's new international borrowings amounted to $ 8 @.@ 8 billion in 2010 and $ 9 @.@ 8 billion in 2011 .

Despite being owned by the IFC , the AMC has investment decision autonomy and is charged with a fiduciary responsibility to the four individual funds under its management . It also aims to mobilize additional capital for IFC investments as it can make certain types of investments which the IFC cannot .

" Rami Yacoub who co @-@ produced Spears 's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented , " I know from Denniz Pop and Max 's previous productions , when we do songs , there 's kind of a nasal thing . With N ' Sync and the Backstreet Boys , we had to push for that mid @-@ nasal voice . When Britney did that , she got this kind of raspy , sexy voice . " Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed , " Spears has become a consummate performer , with snappy dance moves , a clearly real @-@ albeit young @-@ and <unk> voice ... " ( You Drive Me ) Crazy " , her third single ... demonstrates Spears ' own development , proving that the 17 @-@ year @-@ old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice .

 = Captain John Hart ( Torchwood ) = 
 Captain John Hart , played by James Marsters , is a fictional character from the BBC science fiction television programme Torchwood . He is introduced in the episode " Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang " — the first episode of Torchwood 's second series . Whilst the character has not featured subsequently to the second series finale , he went on to appear in a Torchwood Magazine comic strip and Marsters has stated his interest in reprising the role on more than one occasion . 
 In his first appearance , John Hart is as a rogue Time Agent and former partner of the series ' lead male character Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ) both professionally and sexually . Whilst the original function of the Time Agency — stated to have ceased operation by the time Hart appears — is left unspecified , John 's own backstory is briefly given , as well as having had a relationship with Jack he has been in rehab for an addiction to alcohol , drugs , sex and murder . John leaves earth disgraced after his initial self @-@ interested plot is foiled by Harkness ' Torchwood team , though returns in the series finale " Exit Wounds " where he is eventually given a chance to redeem himself . 
 The role of John Hart in Torchwood was written with the casting of Marsters in mind after he contacted the shows ' producers expressing his interest in appearing in the programme 's parent show , Doctor Who . The character is used to illuminate some of Jack 's own characteristics as a doppelgänger who provides both an exaggerated version of , and a parallel to , aspects of Jack 's persona . Both Marsters and the general media also compared aspects of Hart 's character to Marsters 's role as Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel . Whilst a few reviewers criticised the character in relation to his impact of the show 's tone , a larger number welcomed the character and the energy Marsters brought to the role .

 = = = Television = = = 
 Captain John Hart appears through the Cardiff space @-@ time Rift using a vortex manipulator and asks Jack Harkness for help in locating three radioactive cluster bombs , apparently scattered across Cardiff . Jack Harkness tells his team that John cannot be trusted but agrees to help him . True to Jack 's word , Captain John is lying and seizes the containers , trying to kill Gwen Cooper ( Eve Myles ) using a paralyzing lip gloss , shooting Owen Harper ( Burn Gorman ) and pushing Jack off the top of a building , thinking he 's dead . However the containers , which are supposed to contain the location of an valuable diamond hidden by the lover he murdered , instead contain an explosive which latches on the DNA signature of her killer . As insurance against Torchwood leaving him to die , John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key . After superficially altering his DNA using that of the Torchwood staff , Jack and Owen are able to save John 's life before banishing him . Spurned by his former lover , John leaves by means of his Vortex Manipulator . 
 In " Fragments " , Captain John returned in holographic form , stating that he is going to destroy Jack 's life , revealing a holographic image of his lost brother Gray . Continuing in " Exit Wounds " , Captain John is revealed to have rescued Jack 's brother Gray from a group of sadistic captors , only to learn too late that Gray had been driven insane through being tortured over the years . <unk> bonding a bomb to John 's wrist to force him to obey his orders , Gray had John set off multiple bombs throughout Cardiff before taking Jack back in time to <unk> , where Jack is buried alive at the site that would become Cardiff in the future . However , John betrays Gray by leaving a tracking device on Jack in the shape of a ring , thus allowing Jack to be recovered by the Torchwood Institute and frozen in the morgue , escaping at the right moment to stop his brother . Having frozen Gray in cryopreservation , unwilling to witness any more death that day , Jack offers to help pinpoint another Rift event to allow John to leave , but John instead states his desire to travel Earth , commenting that he 'd like to learn what Jack finds so fascinating about the planet . 
 An image of John Hart is briefly seen in the 2014 Doctor Who episode " Time Heist " , as part of a montage of the galaxy 's most notorious criminals . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 The character has a prominent role in the Torchwood magazine comic strip " Shrouded " set between Torchwood 's third television series , subtitled Children of Earth , and fourth series Miracle Day and written by Gareth David @-@ Lloyd who portrayed Ianto Jones in the first three series of Torchwood . John Hart is seen to have observed Ianto 's funeral from a distance before later settling in Mexico , earning a living by buying and selling alien artefacts washed up from a rift similar to the one in Cardiff . A past version of Ianto is then contacted by a malevolent time @-@ travelling seductress seeking to use the knowledge of his death to alter time for her own gain . As Jack has left Earth and Gwen has a newborn child , John is required to team up with Gwen 's husband Rhys Williams in order to restore the original timeline .

 = = = Casting and concept = = = 
 Head writer Chris Chibnall had originally conceived the idea of a " rogue Time Agent " character during the production of Torchwood series 1 , but the idea never made it to TV screens . After watching episodes of executive producer Russell T Davies ' revival of Torchwood 's parent series Doctor Who , Marsters and his agent got in touch with Davies about appearing in the series . Davies vetoed the idea , but suggested that Marsters be part of Torchwood 's second series instead . After Marsters expressed interest in Torchwood , Chibnall and Davies felt that he would be perfect for the role of the Time Agent character . Chibnall immediately produced the script for " Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang " , which introduced the character . He sent it off to Marsters " and essentially got agreement straight away " . Masters accepted the role on the basis of a " really good script " and " a really fun character " stating that as an actor he is attracted to " playing people who are evil , don 't care , and have no guilt . " In an interview published to the BBC online news website in July 2007 , Marsters indicated that he was " really " excited about his character , who he revealed would be " naughty " and " a bit of a psychopath . " 
 = = = Characterisation = = = 
 The character shares many similarities with Marsters 's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel character , Spike , with Marsters commenting " In a lot of ways , this role is very much like Spike was in my first three episodes of Buffy . " The Torchwood writers conceived John as a classical nemesis for Captain Jack , with Chibnall commenting , " In seeing John you see the way Jack could have gone , and probably did , for a little while . " James Marsters further discussed ways in which John is a doppelgänger or foil to Captain Jack : both are pansexual time travellers , with their key difference being that John never reformed . The character exaggerates many of Jack 's qualities , for example displaying <unk> attraction to non @-@ humanoids such as <unk> , in addition to men and women . John and Jack 's intentional similarities extend to their penchant for period war clothing : 
 He 's got a jacket from fighting in the Napoleonic Wars ; he 's got a snakeskin sword from Korea that I think he had to kill someone for ; his boots are from Italy circa 1640 and he 's got gun holsters from the American West . " 
 Teasing John 's role in " Exit Wounds " Marsters stated that he 's someone " who 's in way over his head and doesn 't even know it yet " and that " things do change " in regards to his character . Chibnall , Marsters and producer Richard Stokes discuss the role of " Exit Wounds " in developing John 's character and placing him on a redemptive path . Marsters felt the character to be on a " journey " whilst Chibnall deliberately played upon the question of " can you trust him , or can 't you ? " Stokes commented that the character isn 't the " selfish and anarchic " character seen in " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang " and that his " affection and love for Captain Jack are enough to make him try and do the noble thing " . Stephen James Walker , a writer of reference works on Doctor Who and its spin @-@ offs , notes that because of the reluctance of Hart 's collaboration with Gray and his remorse for his actions the episode leaves the audience " a little more favourably disposed " towards the character . In April 2008 Marsters indicated that he expected to return to Torchwood in the near future . He later expressed a desire to be part of Torchwood 's fourth series after it was revealed the show would be largely produced in Los Angeles . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Reviewing the episode " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang " for The Daily Telegraph James Walton was sceptical about the fact that " some of the fawning [ over Captain Jack ] even came from the main baddie " and what he felt to be the indication that the character was " thrown into the mix on the principle that one glamorous space @-@ travelling bisexual isn ’ t enough . " Whilst The Daily Mirror 's Jane Simon expected that the physical contact between Marsters and Barrowman would result in " somebody 's sci @-@ fi fantasy " being realised she saw it dashing her " hopes series two might serve less sex , less rubbish aliens and more credible drama " . However , Dan Martin of The Guardian described the character as the " best thing about the opener " and stated that " he stole every scene he was in " . He felt the production team " shamelessly and brilliantly .... transplanted " the character of Spike into the series . Richard Edwards of SFX magazine also gave particular praise to Marsters portrayal and like Martin , stated that he " steals the show " . Ben Rawson @-@ Jones of Digital Spy felt Hart 's arrival to be " self @-@ consciously iconic " in providing " swagger , innuendo and a wonderful Star Wars reference " . He felt that overall the characterisation verged " dangerously close to parody at times " but this didn 't detract from Marsters being " a joy to watch , in a similar vein to his role in Buffy . " Charlie Jane Anders commented in regards to the episode that " " Spike " is pretty great in his Adam Ant jacket , with his paralyzing lip gloss and his zany sexual innuendo " . IGN felt John to be a " lot of fun " and a " good character to add to the mix " who showed the team " just how much of a mess they are " . 
 In regards to " Exit Wounds " Anders felt that the " campy " John " felt like he didn 't quite belong in such a serious episode " . Conversely , Mark Wright of The Stage opined that the character was " rather better second time round " . SFX 's Edwards felt the character to be " not as fun " as in episode one but observed that his " heroic side makes for a more rounded character " and anticipated a return in future . IGN 's Travis Fickett felt Hart to be " a far more interesting adversary " than Jack 's brother Gray and once he had been unmasked as a " red herring " the episode " has some life taken out of it " . Subsequent to his last appearance , the character has continued to be mentioned in relation to Torchwood . In June 2010 — following the announcement of a fourth series to be produced as an American co @-@ production — Dan Martin felt that James Masters would be the " obvious first box to tick " in regards to new cast members for the programme . In March 2012 , John Hart made SFX magazine 's reader voted list of the 100 sexiest male characters in the history of film and television science fiction and fantasy . He ranked # 82 . 
 = Flag of South Africa ( 1928 – 1994 ) = 
 The flag of South Africa between 1928 and 1994 was the flag of the Union of South Africa and its successor state , the Republic of South Africa , as well as the former territory of South @-@ West Africa ( Namibia ) . Based on the Dutch Prince 's Flag , it contained the flag of the United Kingdom , the flag of the Orange Free State and the flag of the South African Republic in the centre . It was nicknamed Oranje , Blanje , Blou ( Afrikaans : ' orange , white , blue ' ) . It was adopted in 1928 by an act of Parliament from the first Afrikaner majority government and was replaced by the current flag of South Africa in 1994 with the commencement of the republic 's transitional constitution and end of apartheid . The flag has been a centre of controversy , with some people viewing it as a symbol of history and Afrikaner heritage while others view it as a symbol of apartheid and of white supremacy . 
 = = Adoption = = 
 Before 1928 the only flag that had official status in the Union of South Africa was the United Kingdom 's Union Jack as South Africa was part of the British Empire . The South African Red Ensign was used as an unofficial flag . In 1925 , discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found the Union Jack unacceptable after the Boer War . In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa <unk> status and a new flag was to be used to represent them . British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not . A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince 's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and a badge of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic . The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others . 
 In 1927 , the Afrikaner majority Parliament of South Africa passed the Union Nationality & Flag Act , which stated that the Union Jack and the new Flag of the Union of South Africa were to have equal status as the flag of South Africa . The act came into force in 1928 when both flags were raised over the Houses of Parliament , Cape Town and the Union Buildings in Pretoria This dual status was ended in 1957 with the passing of the Flags Amendment Act which declared that the Oranje , Blanje , Blou would be the sole flag of South Africa with the act also declaring that Die Stem van Suid @-@ Afrika would be the country 's sole anthem and dropping God Save the Queen . 
 When South Africa became a republic in 1961 , the flag remained the same . The Afrikaner voting majority disliked the flag retaining the Union Jack in the centre . Repeated calls were made for it to be removed or for a new flag but no action was taken by the ruling National Party until 1968 . B. J. Vorster convened a commission in that year to create a new flag in time for the 10th anniversary of South Africa 's declaration of independence in 1971 , but no changes were eventually made . The flag was treated with respect by Afrikaners with daily flag salutes in schools . It was also used as part of celebrations of the inauguration of the State President . 
 = = Opposition = = 
 Gradually , the " Oranje , Blanje , Blou " became associated with the apartheid regime . Movements like the Black Sash and Umkhonto we Sizwe started protesting against it with their own symbols . Often the flag of South Africa would be removed from public display and replaced with the banned ANC flag . The flag would also be the subject of public burnings during anti @-@ apartheid protests . 
 After 1989 , F. W. de Klerk was elected president and immediately <unk> the African National Congress ( ANC ) and released their leader Nelson Mandela from prison . De Klerk instigated negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa with Mandela 's ANC . One of the ANC 's demands was that the flag gradually decrease in usage in South African life as well as requesting that a new flag be created as black South Africans associated the current one with apartheid and Afrikaner nationalism . 
 The negotiations led to the South African apartheid referendum , 1992 where voters approved the ending of apartheid . The referendum decision resulted in the International Rugby Board allowing the South Africa national rugby union team to play test matches again . The ANC agreed to endorse the team on the provision that the flag not be used . During the return test , the Conservative Party handed out numerous flags to the majority white crowd as a symbol of defiance against the ANC . At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , the South African team performed under a specially designed flag for the National Olympic Committee of South Africa , although white South African spectators at the games waved the then national flag , despite attempts by officials to stop them . 
 In 1994 the State Herald of South Africa , Fred Brownell , was approached to design a new national flag for South Africa to replace the " Oranje , Blanje , Blou " in time for the first elections after apartheid . He designed the new flag of South Africa with a combination of the " Oranje , Blanje , Blou " and the colours of the ANC flag . The new flag design was approved personally by both de Klerk and Mandela before being unanimously approved by the Transitional Executive Council on 15 March 1994 . De Klerk made the public proclamation of the replacement of the old flag on 20 April , seven days before the 1994 South African general election on 27 April 1994 . 
 = = Post 1994 = = 
 Following its official retirement as the flag of South Africa , the Oranje , Blanje , Blou was adopted by some white South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history . Many South Africans still view it as a symbol of apartheid , and therefore strongly discouraged its use . Despite the negative associations , it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post @-@ 1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech . In the 21st century , usage of the " Oranje , Blanje , Blou " experienced a revival of display as a symbol by white supremacists worldwide . A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston , South Carolina black church in 2015 , as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the " Oranje , Blanje , Blou " and the flag of Rhodesia on it . This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context , to be removed from display . An example of this is Cooma , Australia , where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian Red Ensign and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created . 
 The flag has also been used as a symbol of protest post @-@ 1994 . In 2005 , a statue of King <unk> was vandalised in Louis <unk> with the colours of the flag as a protest against a proposal to change the name of the town to <unk> . Some South Africans in the 21st century started to fly the flag as a protest against a perceived failure of the ANC to make progress in governing South Africa as a democracy . 
 At Cape Town 's Castle of Good Hope , the flag was flown from the castle alongside the Union Jack , flag of the Netherlands and the current flag of South Africa to display the powers that ruled South Africa through history . In 1994 it was agreed that they would remain on the castle parapet as historical reference . In 2012 following complaints from the ANC member of parliament <unk> <unk> , all the flags were removed from the parapet apart from the current flag of South Africa and the removed flags were placed in the castle 's museum .

 He was born in <unk> , Virginia , a small unincorporated community near Williamsburg , in 1923 . He graduated from the Virginia Military Institute ( VMI ) in Lexington , Virginia with a bachelor of science degree in 1944 . While attending the Medical College of Virginia ( MCV ) in Richmond , Virginia , he married Ann Carter Garnett in 1946 . Following his graduation from MCV with a doctor of medicine degree ( M.D. ) in 1947 , he received a Rhodes Scholarship to attend the University of Oxford in Oxford , England . While studying at Oxford 's Lincoln College , Marston worked under Nobel Prize @-@ winner Howard Florey , Norman Heatley and other scientists from the research team that developed penicillin as the first antibiotic , and graduated with a degree in research science .

 After completing his internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , Maryland , and a one @-@ year residency at Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville , Tennessee , Marston joined the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) as a medical researcher with the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project , examining the infectious after @-@ effects of whole @-@ body irradiation , from 1951 to 1953 . He finished his residency at MCV in 1954 . 
 The Markle Foundation awarded Marston a grant as a " gifted practitioner " in the <unk> of his academic medical career . Thereafter , he taught for three years on the MCV faculty , and lectured at the University of Minnesota 's Medical School for a year as an assistant professor of bacteriology and immunology . He rejoined MCV in 1959 , as the assistant student affairs dean and an associate medical professor . 
 Marston was chosen to be the dean of the University of Mississippi 's School of Medicine and director of the university 's Medical Center in Jackson , Mississippi in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement in 1961 . Marston was hired with the tacit understanding that he would integrate the medical school and medical center to comply with Federal law and maintain the medical school 's accreditation . Under his politically understated guidance , and in the face of continued political opposition from Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett , his administration admitted the first African @-@ American medical students , hired the first black medical professor , integrated the medical center 's patients , and set new precedents for the non @-@ violent racial desegregation of Southern medical schools and teaching hospitals . Later , in 1965 , he was chosen to be the university 's vice chancellor . 
 He rejoined the NIH in 1966 , first as NIH associate director and the director of the fledgling Regional Medical Programs Division , charged with cancer , heart disease and stroke research . Then , during an April 1968 internal reorganization of NIH , he was selected to be the new administrator of the Health Services and Mental Health Administration . Only five months later , in September , Marston was chosen to be the NIH director . 
 During his last year as the NIH director , Marston became embroiled in a funding controversy with the Nixon administration , which wanted to place greater funding emphasis on a " war on cancer . " Marston believed that emphasizing one disease at the expense of other medical research was bad policy , and continued to support balanced , comprehensive funding priorities . He eventually resigned from NIH in April 1973 , after nearly five years as director . Afterward , he became a scholar @-@ in @-@ residence at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville , Virginia .

 = Channel Orange = 
 Channel Orange ( stylized as channel ORANGE ) is the debut studio album by American recording artist Frank Ocean , released on July 10 , 2012 , by Def Jam Recordings . After releasing his 2011 mixtape Nostalgia , Ultra , Ocean began writing the album with creative partner Malay , who assisted him with its recording at EastWest Studio in Hollywood . Rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape , Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange . He titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon grapheme – color synesthesia and the color he perceived during the summer he first fell in love . 
 Channel Orange has an unconventional musical style , film @-@ inspired segue tracks , and songs that draw on electro @-@ funk , pop @-@ soul , jazz @-@ funk , and psychedelic music . Ocean 's songwriting touches on themes such as unrequited love , decadence , class , and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery , conversational devices , and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters . His baritone singing on the album exhibits free @-@ form flow and alternating falsetto and tenor registers . 
 To prevent it from leaking onto the Internet , Ocean released the album digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date . He promoted it with five singles , including his highest charting single " Thinkin Bout You " — number 32 on the Hot 100 — and a supporting tour in July 2012 . Channel Orange debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and sold 131 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . It received widespread acclaim from critics and was named the best album of 2012 by numerous publications . As of September 2014 , the album has sold 621 @,@ 000 copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 Frustrated with Def Jam Recordings ' inactivity in his recording career , Ocean released his debut mixtape Nostalgia , Ultra online for free in February 2011 . It showcased Ocean 's original tracks , repurposed songs by other recording acts , and featured musical and lyrical elements unconventional in R & B. Although it lacked conventional promotion , the mixtape attained a following among listeners and received critical acclaim . Ocean and Def Jam subsequently mended their relationship , and although a contracted edition of Nostalgia , Ultra never materialized , the label released two of its songs as singles , including the Billboard charting " Novacane " . They subsequently agreed to release a tentative follow @-@ up album for 2012 . 
 Ocean started writing songs for Channel Orange in February 2011 with songwriter and producer Malay , his friend and creative partner since their start in the music industry as songwriters . They originally met in Atlanta and worked for the same publishing company , through which they reconnected after Malay moved to Los Angeles . Ocean started hanging out with Malay , introduced him to his Odd Future collective , and connected creatively through their respective songwriting , which led to their partnership for Channel Orange . For the album , Ocean wrote his lyrics to complement Malay 's ideas for the music . Occasionally , they wrote songs together by improvising musical ideas from Malay 's keyboard and guitar playing . 
 Although Ocean had creative freedom for both projects , he felt more confident as a songwriter for Channel Orange and typed his lyrics on a laptop rather than composing in his head as he had done for Nostalgia , Ultra . Since transitioning from writing for other artists , he had been influenced by his " gloriously painful love life " when writing songs . For his lyrics , Ocean used both his past personal experiences and imagination to compose narratives for songs . He was inspired to write the song " Crack Rock " by stories he heard sitting in on Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous groups mentored by his grandfather , who also dealt with substance abuse in his youth . In an interview for The Guardian , Ocean expressed uncertainty about his penchant for darker subject matter , but speculated that " those were the colours I had to work with on those days . ... I mean , ' experience ' is an interesting word . I just bear witness . " 
 In June 2012 , news outlets and music journalists from pre @-@ release listening events for Channel Orange raised questions about certain songs ' lyrics and Ocean 's sexuality . The lyrics addressed a male object of love and deviated from the heterosexual perspective of his past songs . Scrapping his original plan of including it in the album 's liner notes , Ocean published a <unk> file as an open letter through his Tumblr blog on July 4 . Originally written in December 2011 , it recounted his unrequited feelings for a man when he was 19 years old , citing the experience as his first love . Ocean 's disclosure was received with support from Def Jam and praise from other recording artists and cultural commentators . He also remarked on writing Channel Orange after years of emotional struggle with the experience , stating in the letter , " I wrote to keep myself busy and sane . I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine . I tried to channel overwhelming emotions . " 
 During their writing sessions , Malay noticed Ocean 's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics , but attributed it to Ocean 's poetic license rather than his sexuality . In an interview after Ocean 's open letter , Malay called him " the new hybrid of what an MC used to be in the ' 80s or ' 90s ... the true storyteller " and said of the lyrics , " I don 't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he 's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever , it 's a story , it 's a world that he created . It 's not necessarily his personal — like something that he ’ s experiencing . Maybe it is and it 's a metaphor the way he did it " . They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months . Ocean said of the album 's development in an interview for Rap @-@ Up , " It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim . It 's about the stories . If I write 14 stories that I love , then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness . " 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Once the songs were written , Ocean ordered them into what ultimately became the album 's track listing and began recording them in that order . He recorded most of the album at EastWest Studio in Hollywood , near where he was renting a home at the time . The studio complex featured recording equipment from the 1960s . Other recording locations included Henson Recording Studios and the Record Plant in Hollywood , Westlake Recording Studios and Studio for the Talented & Gifted in Los Angeles , Manhattan Sound Recording in New York City , and San Ysidro in Beverly Hills . He originally planned to rent recording equipment and the Beverly Hills mansion alone rather than rent a studio for $ 1 @,@ 600 a day . He had a maid at the mansion and enjoyed amenities such as a pool and a sauna , but ended up recording only three songs there — " Lost " , " Pyramids " , and " Analog 2 " , a collaboration with fellow Odd Future member Tyler , The Creator . 
 Ocean recorded his vocals alone for several months , striving intensively for high performance standards , before rejoining Malay for the album 's production . Ocean produced most of Channel Orange and was assisted by Malay , who also played guitar , bass , keyboards , and brass instruments . He described his own contributions as " behind the scenes " to Ocean 's " diligent " work ethic . Ocean wanted to experiment sonically and approach song structure differently than he had before . For inspiration , he and Malay listened to older records to either use as musical references or set a mood at the studio , listening to music by Stevie Wonder , Marvin Gaye , Sly and the Family Stone , Pink Floyd , and Jimi Hendrix . They also put up posters of Pink Floyd and Bruce Lee , and projected inaudible old movies in the studio 's background . 
 Their production also emphasized instrumentation and was a departure for Ocean after Nostalgia , Ultra 's reliance on samples . In the studio , they reworked the musical ideas from their writing sessions , incorporated live production , and ornamented their songs musically . Ocean enlisted Los Angeles @-@ based producer Om 'mas Keith to help him rework the songs . They added live drums to " Crack Rock " , " Monks " , and " Sweet Life " , which was originally produced as a digital track . Originally written by Ocean for singer Bridget Kelly , " Thinkin Bout You " had been recorded as an early take by him and posted on his Tumblr account in July . Ocean and Malay 's final mix of the song for the album added a strings intro . For " Bad Religion " , engineer Jeff Ellis tried to compensate for the few string players they had by arranging seating for a large string section in EastWest 's Studio 1 and using a pair of old stereo ribbon microphones to capture the sound . They sat players in different seats each time they played along with the track in order to mix all of the takes together and give the impression of a larger ensemble . 
 In the wake of Nostalgia , Ultra , other artists took interest in Ocean and contacted him about working together , leading to collaborations on Channel Orange . He previewed songs at different stages of completion to get feedback from guest artists , some of whom he cited as his " creative heroes " , including record producer Pharrell , who co @-@ wrote and co @-@ produced " Sweet Life " with Ocean . Ocean and Malay previewed songs to rock musician John Mayer , which inspired his guitar playing for both " Pyramids " and " White " . For the latter track , they used the instrumental of the song of the same name from Odd Future 's 2012 album The OF Tape Vol . 2 , recorded atmospheric instrumentation by Mayer and other musicians , and tracked it to the original instrumental . Ocean reached out to rappers André 3000 and Big Boi of hip hop duo OutKast to appear on " Pink Matter " . However , André 3000 did not want to reunite with Big Boi as a duo on another artist 's album . The former ended up rapping alone and playing guitar on the song . Ocean told him to tell any kind of story with his verse for " Pink Matter " , of which André 3000 later said , " when I got the track , I just started writing to it and I was just , I 'm just happy to be a part of that whole movement and his whole movement because he has become a whole ' nother kind of icon in today 's age . " 
 Ocean and Malay mixed Channel Orange at Studio for the Talented & Gifted , and engineer Spike Stent mixed parts of the album at The Mix Suite in Los Angeles . It was mastered by Vlado Meller at Masterdisk in New York City . Malay said that he and Ocean focused on sonic " intricacies " such as interludes and skits on tracks when mixing the album , which he referred to as their " art project " . Ocean said that he admires " the anonymity that directors can have about their films " and explained his use of interludes on the album , saying that " the work is the work . The work is not me ... Even though it 's my voice , I 'm a storyteller . " According to Malay , Kanye West helped Ocean during the album 's final stages by providing " a mentorship situation " and connecting him with his " visual people " . Malay recalled in an interview for Complex how he and Ocean were " somewhat oblivious to how quickly everything happened " as they were finishing the album , as Ocean 's name was " continuing to get bigger and bigger . " To downplay himself from being " the focal point " of the album , Ocean did not want his name on the cover and had Everest , his Bernese Mountain Dog , credited as the executive producer instead . 
 Ocean titled the album as a reference to grapheme – color synesthesia , a neurological phenomenon in which an individual 's perception of numbers and letters is associated with the experience of colors . He discussed the phenomenon with Pharrell , who had also experienced it and similarly referenced it for the title of his side project N.E.R.D 's 2008 album Seeing Sounds . West also experienced it as a youth and used it as an inspiration when creating his short film Cruel Summer in 2012 . The title also alludes to the first time that Ocean fell in love , as it was summer and he perceived everything to be orange . Ocean 's mother called it " a perfect summertime album " after attending a listening session . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 According to music journalists , Channel Orange has an unconventional musical style , with influences from psychedelic , pop @-@ soul , jazz @-@ funk , and electro @-@ funk genres . HipHopDX categorized it as an alternative R & B album , while Evan Rytlewski from The A.V. Club called it a neo soul record . Sputnikmusic 's Sobhi Youssef remarked that , although its production " pull [ s ] from a spectrum of popular modern and classic influences " , they are used " within the ' constraints ' of R & B without any singular genre taking over the record . " Songs on the album are characterized by electronic keyboard , muted percussion , fluctuating backing tracks , shifting synthesizers , vamps , vibrant guitar , and hazy electronic effects such as dub reverb . Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that first half 's " spacious " production recalls the " electric soul influence " of Shuggie Otis , while Jody Rosen observed " chord changes straight out of [ Stevie ] Wonder 's Innervisions , airy vamps that nod to [ Marvin ] Gaye 's Here , My Dear , [ and ] snarling guitars that recall Prince 's Purple Rain " . Chris Richards of The Washington Post compared its melodic sensibilities to those of Gaye and Wonder , and its loose song structures to those of D 'Angelo , Maxwell , and Erykah Badu . Time magazine 's Melissa Locker noted melodramatic elements such as " haunting melodies " similar to The @-@ Dream 's 2007 album Love Hate . 
 Less melodic and hook @-@ oriented than Nostalgia , Ultra , Channel Orange has soft melodies , gentle articulation , spatial arrangements , and mid @-@ tempo drum beats , although the more ruminative songs feature slower tempos . Robert Christgau asserted that , without its predecessor 's reliance on samples , " Ocean resists making a show of himself — resists the dope hook , the smart tempo , the transcendent falsetto itself . " Ocean , a baritone , sings with casually expressive vocals , free @-@ form flow , conversational crooning , and alternating falsetto and tenor registers . Similar to Nostalgia , Ultra , Channel Orange has interludes that feature sounds of organs , waves , tape decks , car doors , channel surfing , white noise , and dialogue . They exhibit an analog sound quality , and some end abruptly . Writers interpreted them to represent the limited attention span of listeners , moments in Ocean 's life , the distortion inside his mind , nostalgic ephemera , or a synesthesia @-@ inspired theme . Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine viewed that the segues , along with the other songs ' disparate lengths , give the album the feel of a mixtape . 
 Channel Orange has themes of unrequited love , sex , and existential longing . Allusions to Ocean 's own experience with unrequited love are featured in several songs , including " Thinkin Bout You " , " Bad Religion " , and " Forrest Gump " . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found the album to be " rife with the sting of unrequited love , both on the receiving and inflicting ends " , with " lovers who tantalize but remain at arm 's length . " Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork Media said Ocean exhibits " a timeless philosophy ... one of hard @-@ won acceptance and the acknowledgement that love and sex and loss will always draw legends to them . " The album also explores decadence , the trappings of class disparity , drug dependency , and the tension between spirituality and secularity , a prevalent theme in soul music . Music journalist Sasha Frere @-@ Jones noted " a combination of decadence and spiritual ache similar to Prince 's " . Greg Kot wrote that Ocean presents " a dialogue between his self @-@ gratifying lust and more selfless conscience " , with Prince @-@ like " psychedelic @-@ gospel inflections " and Marvin Gaye @-@ like overdubbing of Ocean 's vocals , which give the impression of voices in conversation with one another . Jason Lipshutz of Billboard viewed that Ocean examines love in the context of money , drugs , and sex . 
 Ocean 's songwriting uses descriptive narratives , dense metre , surrealistic imagery , empathic sentiments , deadpan humor , overt metaphors , and conversational devices . John Calvert of The Quietus wrote that his lyrics treat love as " innocent " , and feature " flying @-@ as @-@ love " metaphors and " respectful euphemisms " for sex such as a flight on a " fighter jet " . Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes regarded Channel Orange as a " songwriter 's album " and views that , although " the emotions , mood , and melodies are broad enough to draw listeners in " , Ocean 's lyrics are " apocryphal , allowing for personal interpretations " . Ocean 's narratives generally depict dark , broken characters , and a Southern California setting , with references to its sunny , coastal environment in both the lyrics and melodies . Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times categorized Channel Orange as a concept album about " the twentysomething experience in Los Angeles " , while Greg Kot interpreted the California setting to be " a state of mind in Ocean [ ' s ] world : numb , deceptively luxurious and self @-@ satisfied , where the denizens live disconnected from one another and the world . " 
 The opening track " Start " is a snippet of ambient sounds , bits of silence , and flickers of noise , including a PlayStation booting up . The low @-@ key torch song " Thinkin Bout You " features soothing synth cycles , sparse keyboards , muffled electronic percussion , and lyrics addressing a lover with white lies in the verses and thoughts of eternal love in the chorus . " Fertilizer " is based on James Fauntleroy II 's 2010 song of the same name , repurposed on the album as an AM radio jingle and interlude about " bullshit " . " Sierra Leone " incorporates chillwave and quiet storm styles , wind chime sounds , lo @-@ fi beats , and polyphony similar to Prince 's 1985 song " Paisley Park " . Its lyrics address sex , conception , early parenthood , and childhood dreams . It recounts the narrator 's lust for a girl as a teenager , and compares their relationship to the vicissitudes of Sierra Leone such as diamonds and civil war . Ocean 's singing exhibits quickly descending chord succession and is overdubbed against his spoken vocals . 
 " Sweet Life " and " Super Rich Kids " depict decadent , alluring rich people , and are tied together by " Not Just Money " , a spoken interlude with a woman discussing the importance of money on happiness . " Super Rich Kids " references the thumping piano line of Elton John 's 1973 song " Bennie and the Jets " and addresses young , wealthy characters ' ennui and fears of the financial crisis with dry humor . " Pilot Jones " employs magic realism and escapist imagery , and depicts an emotional dependency between drug addicts , who confuse friendship with sexual love in their support of each other . The swooning song contains hazy electronic blips , impressionistic textures , experimental beat patterns , refracted sound effects , and vocal improvisation expressing the narrator 's " high " . " Crack Rock " depicts a crack addict , likens love to the highs and lows of drug use , and broadly addresses corruption , broken homes , gun violence , and government indifference to rising crack @-@ related deaths . It has fleeting multi @-@ tracked harmonies , a non @-@ sequitur chorus , and Ocean 's occasionally fractured breathiness conveying an addict 's voice . 
 " Pyramids " is cited by writers as the album 's centerpiece . Brice Ezell from PopMatters wrote that it denotes " the vital midpoint of the overarching narrative " , where " the wittier tone of the record 's front half gives way to an emotionally dense second half . " Veering from synth @-@ funk to slow jam styles , the song has a lyrical conceit that uses Ancient Egyptian and Biblical imagery , and contrasts the legendary fall of Cleopatra VII with the circumstances of a latter @-@ day working girl , who dances at a strip club called the Pyramid to support her man 's gaudy aspirations . The new wave @-@ styled " Lost " is about a perplexed addict , who hopes for a better life for him and his drug @-@ cooking girlfriend . " Monks " , a funk rock song , is about finding nirvana and deals with topics such as casual sex and devout religion in a narrative that shifts from an exciting concert to a metaphorical jungle . " Bad Religion " features melodramatic , orchestral music and a series of figures , including strings , handclaps , marching band snare drums , and mournful organ chords . The lyrics follow an emotional confession to a taxi driver by a narrator brooding over a secretive intimate relationship . Music journalist Alexis Petridis asserted that the song " <unk> [ es ] the battle between religion and lust that 's been at the heart of soul music since it ceded from gospel " . 
 " Pink Matter " is a bluesy lament with themes of sex and betrayal , as its narrator struggles between pleasure and universal meaning . Its lyrics allude to philosophical conundrums , extraterrestrial life , Japanese manga comics , and cotton candy . The playful " Forrest Gump " likens the titular film character to an adolescent crush , with homoerotic , tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek lyrics , and allusions to scenes in the film . It has a bright , Motown @-@ inspired chorus , a simple rhythmic cadence , gently strummed guitar , wistful vocals , and a <unk> whistled coda . The skit " End " depicts an exchange between Ocean and a woman as they make love in the backseat of a car with his 2012 song " Voodoo " playing over the stereo . She says to him , " You 're special . I wish you could see what I see " , repurposing a line from the 2006 film ATL , and Ocean leaves the car in response , walks home through the rain , and sets his keys down with a sigh . The lighthearted , lovelorn " Golden Girl " has up @-@ tempo synths , gradual fades , and Tyler , The Creator rapping in a low @-@ pitched , demonic voice . It is about a girl that provides salvation and peace of mind for the narrator , who likens her to an island .

 To prevent Channel Orange from leaking onto the Internet , Ocean planned to release it digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date . He was inspired by Jay @-@ Z and Kanye West , who prevented their 2011 album Watch the Throne from leaking by announcing several misleading release dates . On June 8 , Ocean announced a July 17 release date and released a trailer for the album directed by Nabil Elderkin . On July 9 , he made his television debut on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and performed " Bad Religion " with backing from the show 's house band The Roots and a strings section . The show announced the album 's actual release date and vendor , Universal Music Group , who made it available on July 10 as a digital download on iTunes . Ocean said at the time , " I haven 't even held one in my hands ... The [ CDs ] are done , but when we sent them in , they were locked down at the manufacturer . They haven 't left . They never went on trucks [ to stores ] because that 's where things leak . " 
 Channel Orange was sold exclusively through iTunes until July 17 , when it was released to other digital retailers . Although its wide physical release was scheduled for July 17 , Universal encouraged physical retailers to start selling it immediately after they receive shipments of the album . Retail company Target did not approve of its early release to iTunes and chose not to stock the album . Ocean 's manager Christian Clancy responded in a message on Twitter that he found it " interesting " that Target " also donates to non @-@ equal rights organizations " , suggesting their decision was influenced by Ocean 's coming out . Target representatives dismissed Clancy 's claims as " absolutely false " in a subsequent statement to MTV News , saying that the company " supports inclusivity and diversity in every aspect of our business . Our assortment decisions are based on a number of factors , including guest demand . " 
 Channel Orange debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and sold 131 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . The majority of its first @-@ week sales were digital copies from iTunes , while approximately 3 @,@ 000 of the sales were physical copies . Digital copies sold for $ 2 @.@ 99 at Amazon.com were excluded from Nielsen SoundScan 's sales data , as Billboard 's chart policy disqualified albums sold for less than $ 3 @.@ 49 from charting . The album sold 54 @,@ 000 copies in its second week , excluding discounted copies sold by Amazon.com , which Billboard estimated to be approximately 15 @,@ 000 copies . Channel Orange also debuted at number two on the British albums chart with first @-@ week sales of 13 @,@ 000 copies . It was the first album to chart within the top 20 in the United Kingdom solely on digital sales . In Canada , the album debuted at number three on first @-@ week sales of 6 @,@ 700 copies . Five singles were released from the album — " Thinkin Bout You " on April 17 , " Pyramids " on June 8 , " Sweet Life " on July 6 , " Lost " on December 17 , and " Super Rich Kids " on March 17 , 2013 . " Thinkin Bout You " became Ocean 's highest charting single in the US , peaking at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 . Ocean performed the song on the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards on September 6 , 2012 @.@ and the following week , Channel Orange sold almost 14 @,@ 000 more copies . By September 2014 , it had sold 621 @,@ 000 copies in the US . 
 Channel Orange received widespread acclaim from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 92 , based on 46 reviews . AllMusic 's Andy Kellman wrote that Ocean 's " descriptive and subtle storytelling is taken to a higher level " than on Nostalgia , Ultra , while Mike Powell of Spin found his tempered singing to be a sign of " exceptional wisdom and repose " . State journalist Fintan Walsh said Ocean captured " the modern youth " with his lyrics just as Brian Wilson had with the 1966 album Pet Sounds while calling Channel Orange " a masterful , dynamic and evocative collection of conversations between his inner @-@ self and the listener . " It was called " an expansive , slow @-@ burning classic that repays patience and close attention " by Killian Fox in The Observer , while musicOMH critic Laurence Green described the music as " a cherry @-@ picking of life 's cacophony repainted into the most enchanting of collages " . Slant Magazine 's Jesse Cataldo hailed it as a " mosaic work ... so textured , complex , and mature that Ocean 's recent coming out feels like a footnote " . Jody Rosen was less impressed in Rolling Stone , preferring the album 's more structured songs while arguing that Ocean sometimes seemed to be " less a songwriter than a purveyor of formless grooves " . Priya Elan of NME wrote that the " inventive and spirited " album 's music was occasionally overindulgent . Robert Christgau from MSN Music , on the other hand , felt Ocean 's musical compositions were more consistent here than on Nostalgia , Ultra but questioned his topical fascinations with the " haut @-@ monde demimonde " . 
 At the end of 2012 , Channel Orange was named the year 's best album by numerous publications , including the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Chicago Tribune , Billboard , Entertainment Weekly , The Guardian , the Los Angeles Times , The Sydney Morning Herald , Now , Paste , PopMatters , Slant Magazine , Spin , and The Washington Post . It was named " Album of the Year " in HMV 's Poll of Polls , an annual survey of British journalists from national print and online publications . It was also voted the best album of 2012 in the Pazz & Jop , an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice . In an essay for the poll , the newspaper 's Eric Sundermann deemed the victory unsurprising as Ocean " dominated most music discussions this past year " and had an equalizing effect on listeners of all music genres . Metacritic cited it as both the " top @-@ ranked " and " best @-@ reviewed major album " of 2012 , as well as " one of the best @-@ reviewed albums of the past decade " . Channel Orange won the Album of the Year award at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards , and earned Ocean nominations for the 2013 Grammy Awards in the categories of Album of the Year , Best New Artist , and Record of the Year ( for " Thinkin Bout You " ) , winning for Best Urban Contemporary Album . Ocean agreed to perform at the awards show only if they let him play the song he wanted , " Forrest Gump " . 
 = = Touring = = 
 Ocean supported the album with a 14 @-@ date North American tour during July 2012 . Announced on June 8 , the tour had sold out by July 9 . On its number of shows , Ocean explained that he wanted to provide quality over quantity and said that " it 's not about let 's do a million things right now . It 's about let 's just do our best to do the best things right now . " Malay joined him as the tour 's musical director and said that it would expand on the production of Ocean 's previous concerts for Nostalgia , Ultra . Their stage setup featured a guitarist , bassist , drummer , two pianos , and a DJ setup behind television monitor props , which showed ever @-@ changing images . 
 Along with songs from Nostalgia , Ultra and Channel Orange , Ocean performed " Made in America " , his unreleased songs " Summer Remains " and " Voodoo " , and covers of Prince 's " When You Were Mine " ( 1980 ) , Beyoncé 's " I Miss You " ( 2011 ) , and Sade 's " By Your Side " ( 2000 ) . Reviewers of the shows noted Ocean 's low @-@ key stage presence and observed crowd screams and audience members singing @-@ along to songs . After his performance at the 9 : 30 Club in Washington , D.C. , Ocean reflected on the tour and wrote on his Twitter account , " This <unk> takes some getting used to . I get to zone out and be <unk> hero or deviant fantasy or whatever for a hour [ sic ] and some change every night though . That 's special , and the women still scream in the front row . " Ocean cancelled his tour @-@ closing show at Saint Andrew 's Hall in Detroit on August 1 due to illness . 
 After the tour , Ocean was slated to perform at several music festivals , including Lollapalooza , where he headlined the second day of the festival . However , during his performance at Øyafestivalen in Norway , Ocean lost his voice and ended his set early . He subsequently withdrew from his European tour dates , including English rock band Coldplay 's Mylo Xyloto Tour , on which he would have been the opening act during the tour 's European leg in August and September . Although he did not specify his reason , Ocean issued a statement to organizers of the Way Out West Festival in Sweden , saying that " Let me start by saying I feel like an asshole right now , but a tough decision had to be made in regard to my schedule over the next months ... Sorry as fuck , I 'll be back if you 'll have me . " He subsequently performed at All Tomorrow 's Parties in New York City on September 21 .

 John Breathitt ( September 9 , 1786 – February 21 , 1834 ) was the 11th Governor of Kentucky . He was the first Democrat to hold this office and was the second Kentucky governor to die in office . Shortly after his death , Breathitt County , Kentucky was created and named in his honor . 
 Early in life , Breathitt was appointed a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory . On his return to Kentucky , he taught at a country school , and through wise investments , amassed enough wealth to sustain him while he studied law with Judge Caleb Wallace . In 1811 , he was elected to the first of several terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives . He was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 1828 . Although his running mate William T. Barry lost the office of governor to Thomas Metcalfe , Breathitt defeated his opponent for lieutenant governor . 
 During his term as lieutenant governor , Breathitt was one of several proposed candidates to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate , but the General Assembly deadlocked over the appointment and the seat went unfilled until the Assembly 's next term . In the next gubernatorial election in 1832 , Breathitt was the Democratic nominee for governor . Again , Breathitt won , but James Turner Morehead , the Whig candidate for lieutenant governor , defeated Breathitt 's running mate . Initially , Breathitt enjoyed popularity for his public condemnation of John C. Calhoun 's doctrine of nullification , but he did not fare well in state politics because the Whigs controlled the legislature . He died in office of tuberculosis on February 21 , 1834 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Breathitt was born near New London , Henry County , Virginia on September 9 , 1786 . He was the eldest of five sons and four daughters born to William and Elizabeth ( Whitsett ) Breathitt . William Breathitt immigrated to Maryland from Scotland , then settled in Virginia . John Breathitt 's brother , George , became a private secretary to President Andrew Jackson . Another brother , James , became Commonwealth 's Attorney for the state of Kentucky . 
 Breathitt was educated at home and in the public schools of his native state . His family moved to Logan County , Kentucky in 1800 , and he continued his education there . In early adulthood , he was appointed as a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory . He then returned to Kentucky to teach in a country school . He invested his income in land purchases , and shortly amassed enough wealth to sustain him for a few years . Financially stable , he resolved to read law under Judge Caleb Wallace . He was admitted to the bar of Russellville , Kentucky in 1810 and opened his practice there . 
 In 1812 , Breathitt married Caroline Whitaker of Logan County . The couple had a son and a daughter . When his first wife died , he married Susan M. Harris of Chesterfield County , Virginia . Breathitt had another daughter by his second wife . Though Breathitt himself died at age 47 , he survived both of his wives .

 Breathitt was elected to represent Logan County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1811 , and was re @-@ elected every year until 1815 . In the gubernatorial election of 1828 , the Democrats chose William T. Barry as their candidate for governor . Initially , they offered the nomination for lieutenant governor to Judge John P. Oldham , but Oldham declined , and Breathitt was chosen as his replacement . Barry lost the governorship to National Republican Thomas Metcalfe , but Breathitt defeated Metcalfe 's running mate Joseph R. Underwood by more than 1 @,@ 000 votes . 
 As lieutenant governor , Breathitt promoted the creation of public schools in the state . On December 31 , 1829 , he was elected president of the Kentucky Educational Society whose stated mission was to " promote improvement and diffusion of popular education by the circulation of information , by enlisting the pulpit and the press , by procuring the delivery of popular addresses on the subject on the 4th day of July , and in different neighborhoods , and by other means that may be found practicable . " In 1833 , he became president of the Kentucky Common School Society . 
 In 1831 , Breathitt was one of several candidates put before the General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the United States Senate . He received 66 of 137 votes , 3 votes short of a majority . Other unsuccessful nominees included John J. Crittenden ( 68 votes ) , Richard Mentor Johnson ( 64 votes ) , and Charles A. Wickliffe ( 49 votes ) . After 15 ballots , the Assembly still had not chosen a nominee , and postponed the matter until the next session . At that session , Henry Clay was chosen to fill the seat .

 In 1832 , the Democrats selected Breathitt and Benjamin Taylor as their candidates for governor and lieutenant governor , respectively . They faced a Whig ( formerly National Republican ) ticket of Richard Aylett Buckner and James Turner Morehead . Buckner was hurt by his extremely religious ideals , including opposition to handling mail on Sunday , and failed to garner the support of some of his own party 's newspapers . Breathitt defeated Buckner by a small margin , but Morehead defeated Taylor , Breathitt 's little @-@ known running mate . Breathitt 's election marked the first time a Democrat had ascended to the governorship of Kentucky . The election was marred by fraud , however . In Oldham County , the number of votes tallied represented 162 @.@ 9 % of the eligible voters in the county , and these votes broke two @-@ to @-@ one in favor of Breathitt . Most Kentuckians were more concerned about the upcoming presidential election , hoping Whig and native son Henry Clay would defeat Democrat Andrew Jackson . Because of this , most of the other state offices went to Whig candidates . 
 Early in his term , Breathitt won favor from both Whigs and Democrats by opposing South Carolina 's actions during the Nullification Crisis . Following Breathitt 's lead , the state legislature passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2 , 1833 . This action was particularly significant because John C. Calhoun 's justification for nullification was largely based on the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions . 
 Breathitt did not fare as well in state politics . He ardently supported Jacksonian principles , and wielded his veto against bills critical of President Jackson 's land policy . He supported Jackson 's desire to dissolve the Second Bank of the United States . Instead , he favored opening a number of state banks , but faced with a Whig majority in the legislature , he succeeded only in chartering the Louisville Bank of Kentucky . He also favored completion of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad , and supported a $ 300 @,@ 000 loan from the state Board of Internal Improvements for that purpose . In 1833 , a loan for half the amount was approved , and the railroad was not completed until 1851 . Breathitt was also part of the temperance movement in Kentucky . In an 1832 address , he blamed consumption of alcohol for the high murder rate in the state . When the Kentucky Legislative Temperance Society was formed at a meeting in the state house on January 13 , 1834 , Breathitt was chosen as its president and Lieutenant Governor Morehead served as one of five vice @-@ presidents . 
 Breathitt died of tuberculosis in the governor 's mansion in Frankfort on February 21 , 1834 . He was the second sitting governor of Kentucky to die in office . Originally buried in the Breathitt family cemetery , he was later re @-@ interred at Maple Grove Cemetery in Russellville . Breathitt County , Kentucky was formed in 1839 and named in his honor . On March 5 , 1872 , the Kentucky General Assembly resolved to erect a monument over Breathitt 's grave in Russellville . 
 = Tylopilus alboater = 
 Tylopilus alboater , commonly known as the black velvet bolete , is a bolete fungus in the Boletaceae family . The species is found in North America east of the Rocky Mountains , and in eastern Asia , including China , Japan , Taiwan , and Thailand . A mycorrhizal species , it grows solitarily , scattered , or in groups on the ground usually under deciduous trees , particularly oak , although it has been recorded from deciduous , coniferous , and mixed forests . 
 The fruit bodies have a black to grayish @-@ brown cap that measures up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter . The caps of young specimens have a velvety texture and are covered with a whitish to gray powdery coating ; this texture and coating is gradually lost as the mushroom matures , and the cap often develops cracks . The pores on the underside of the cap are small and pinkish . The stem is bluish @-@ purple to black , and measures up to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) long by 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick . Both the pore surface and the whitish cap flesh will stain pink to reddish @-@ gray , and eventually turn black after being cut or injured . The mushroom is edible , and generally considered one of the best edible Tylopilus species . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The species was first described in 1822 as Boletus alboater by Lewis David de Schweinitz from specimens he collected in North Carolina . Elias Magnus Fries sanctioned this name in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum . The species was one of several Boletus species that Otto Kuntze transferred to Suillus in his 1898 Revisio Generum Plantarum . American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill transferred it to the genus Tylopilus in 1909 . In 1931 , French mycologist Jean @-@ Edouard Gilbert transferred the species to his newly created genus Porphyrellus , but this name has since been subsumed into Tylopilus . 
 In 1875 , Charles Horton Peck described Boletus <unk> from specimens he collected in Sand Lake , New York . Murrill reduced this name to synonymy with T. alboater in 1916 , and noted that Peck 's description was made from young material obtained " before the white tubes had been colored by mature spores " . Several later authorities have treated Peck 's species as a synonym of Tylopilus alboater ; this synonymy , however , is not indicated by either of the taxonomic authorities Index Fungorum or MycoBank . 
 The specific epithet alboater means " white and black " . It is commonly known as the " black velvet bolete " ; Murrill called it the " blackish bolete " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The shape of the cap is initially convex before later becoming broadly convex to eventually flattened in maturity ; the diameter of the cap is typically between 3 and 15 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 and 5 @.@ 9 in ) . The cap surface is dry , with a velvet @-@ like texture , although in age it can become <unk> ( developing a network of cracks and small crevices ) . The cap color is initially black to dark grayish @-@ brown ; young specimens can have a whitish bloom ( resembling a dusting of fine powder ) on the surface . Fruit bodies , especially young specimens , tend to be free of maggots and other insect larvae . As the mushroom matures , the bloom disappears and the color fades to become grayish to grayish @-@ brown . The cap flesh is whitish , but after it is cut or injured , it will stain pink to reddish @-@ gray , and eventually turn black . 
 Spores are produced in basidia that are arranged in a vertically arranged layer of minute tubes on the underside of the cap that create a surface of pores . This surface is whitish when young before turning dull pink or flesh @-@ colored in maturity . When bruised , the pore surface initially stains reddish and slowly turns black . The shape of the pores is angular to irregular , and they are small , with roughly two pores per millimeter . The tubes are 5 – 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 in ) deep , and usually sunken around the area of attachment to the stem . The stem is 4 – 10 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) long by 2 – 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick , and is equal in width throughout its length , slightly thicker towards the base , or somewhat thicker in the middle . It is the same color as the cap , or paler . The surface texture of the stem is usually smooth , although some specimens may be slightly reticulated near the top . The spore print can range from pinkish to a deep flesh color . 
 The spores are oval to ellipsoid in shape , smooth , hyaline ( translucent ) , and measure 7 – 11 by 3 @.@ 5 – 5 μm . The basidia are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 15 – 24 by 6 – 7 @.@ 5 μm . Pleurocystidia ( cystidia found on the tube faces ) are irregularly club @-@ shaped , with dimensions of 20 – 36 by 7 – 10 μm , while cheilocystidia ( found on the tube edge ) are club @-@ shaped , rare , occur singly , and measure 18 – 32 by 7 – 9 μm . Although rare , there are also caulocystidia ( occurring on the stem ) that are arranged in groups , and which measure individually 24 – 30 by 6 – 9 μm . Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of T. alboater . 
 Tylopilus alboater is an edible mushroom with a pleasant odor and a mild taste . It is considered one of the best of the edible Tylopilus — a genus that is usually associated with bitter @-@ tasting , unpalatable species . Frying slices of the mushroom brings out a " delicate , earthy , nutty flavor " ; longer frying times make the cap " pleasantly crisp " . The mushrooms can be used in mushroom dying . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Some Tylopilus species have a superficial resemblance to T. alboater and might be confused with it , including T. <unk> , T. atratus , and T. griseocarneus . T. atratus produces smaller fruit bodies with caps up to 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter , and its whitish flesh directly stains black without any intermediate reddish phase when injured . It is known from only from western New York state . The " false black velvet bolete " , T. <unk> , has a brownish cap that lacks the velvety texture of T. alboater , and has stems that are minutely velvety and almost black near the base . T. griseocarneus , found in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains of North America , is readily distinguished from T. alboater by the strong orange to red discoloration that results when cutting or damaging the flesh of a fresh specimen . Furthermore , T. griseocarneus lacks the whitish bloom present on young caps of T. alboater , and typically has a more prominently reticulated stem . Specimens of T. alboater that are paler than usual can be confused with T. ferrugineus , but the latter has yellow cystidia when mounted in KOH , while the cystidia of the former are brownish @-@ yellow under similar conditions .

 Tylopilus alboater is a mycorrhizal species , and its fruit bodies grow on the ground solitarily , scattered , or in groups under deciduous trees , particularly oak . Fruiting occurs in deciduous , coniferous , and mixed forests . Its dark color makes it difficult to notice in the field . 
 In North America , the mushroom is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains . The distribution ranges from Quebec in Canada , south to the New England states down to Florida , extending west to Missouri , Michigan , and Texas . It is also found in Mexico . In Asia , it has been recorded from China ( Anhui , Fujian , Guangdong , Guangxi , and Sichuan ) , Japan , Taiwan , and Thailand . 
 = SMS Kaiser Friedrich III = 
 SMS Kaiser Friedrich III ( " His Majesty 's Ship Emperor Frederick III " ) was the lead ship of the Kaiser Friedrich III class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships . She was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven in 1895 , and finished in October 1898 . The ship was armed with a main battery of four 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in two twin gun turrets . 
 After she was commissioned on 7 October 1898 , the ship became the flagship of Prince Henry in the I Squadron of the German Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) . In 1901 , the ship was severely damaged after striking an underwater obstacle in the Baltic , though she was subsequently repaired . The ship took part in extensive fleet maneuvers in 1900 and 1902 . In 1907 , the Heimatflotte was reorganized as the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . In 1908 , Kaiser Friedrich III was modernized ; her secondary guns were reorganized and her superstructure was cut down to reduce top @-@ heaviness . 
 Obsolete by the beginning of World War I , Kaiser Friedrich III and her sister ships served in a limited capacity as coastal defense ships in the V Battle Squadron in the early months of the war . By January 1915 , Kaiser Friedrich was withdrawn from service and employed as a prison ship . She was scrapped in 1919 , following the end of the war . 
 = = Design = = 
 Kaiser Friedrich III was 125 @.@ 3 m ( 411 ft 1 in ) long overall and had a beam of 20 @.@ 4 m ( 66 ft 11 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 89 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 25 m ( 27 ft 1 in ) aft . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines that drove three screw propellers . Steam was provided by four Marine @-@ type and eight cylindrical boilers , all of which burned coal . Kaiser Friedrich III 's powerplant was rated at 13 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 12 @,@ 822 ihp ; 9 @,@ 561 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . 
 Kaiser Friedrich III 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns . She also carried twelve machine guns , but these were later removed . The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all in above @-@ water swivel mounts . The ship 's belt armor was 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick , and the deck was 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor plating , and the secondary casemates received 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) of armor protection .

 Kaiser Friedrich III 's keel was laid on 5 March 1895 , at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven , under construction number 22 . Kaiser Wilhelm II , the son of the ship 's namesake , hammered the first rivet into the keel . She was ordered under the contract name Ersatz Preussen , to replace the elderly armored frigate Preussen . Kaiser Friedrich III was launched on 1 July 1896 and Wilhelm II was again present , this time to give the launching speech . The ship was commissioned on 7 October 1898 and began sea trials in the Baltic Sea . 
 After commissioning , Kaiser Friedrich III was assigned to the I Squadron of the Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) . Prince Henry — the commander in chief of the I Squadron — raised his flag aboard Kaiser Friedrich III . From 15 August 1900 to 15 September , the Heimatflotte conducted a series of fleet maneuvers in the North and Baltic seas . The four Brandenburg @-@ class battleships were deployed to China to assist in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion , so the fleet was greatly reduced in strength . Kaiser Friedrich III and her sister Kaiser Wilhelm II were the only battleships available for the maneuvers . They were joined by the armored frigates Sachsen and Württemberg and six Siegfried and Odin @-@ class coastal defense ships . Throughout the maneuvers , Kaiser Friedrich III was assigned to the " German " force , which had to combat a hostile " Yellow " squadron . 
 On 17 November 1900 , Kaiser Friedrich III was steaming to Kiel after conducting exercises with the fleet . Kaiser Wilhelm II attempted to pass Kaiser Friedrich III , so the latter stopped and allowed the former to pass to port . However , the order to resume steaming was given too quickly , so the ship accidentally rammed Kaiser Wilhelm II . Kaiser Friedrich III suffered minor damage to her bow , while her sister was slightly damaged in the compartment that housed the steering engines . Repairs were completed within three days , without the need for either vessel to enter drydock . 
 = = = Collision , 1901 = = = 
 While en route from Danzig to Kiel on 2 January 1901 , Kaiser Friedrich III struck an underwater obstacle while in company with Kaiser Wilhelm II . The impact damaged four of the ship 's watertight compartments , which then filled with water and caused the ship to list to port . The shock from the collision damaged the ship 's boilers and started a fire in the coal bunkers . All of the ship 's ammunition magazines , engine rooms , and storage compartments had to be flooded in order to prevent the fire from spreading . Two men were seriously injured while fighting the fire , and a third died of his injuries . Kaiser Wilhelm II took her sister in tow , although after several hours the fire was extinguished and the engines were restarted . Throughout the incident , Prince Henry adamantly refused requests that he depart the ship , stating " I shall be the last to leave the ship . " 
 The ships reached Kiel , where it was thoroughly examined . The dockyard workers found that eight of the ship 's boilers had been badly damaged , and many bulkheads had been bent from the pressure of the water . The keel was extensively damaged , with large holes torn in several places . All three of the ship 's propellers were damaged as well . Temporary repairs were effected in Kiel , which included sealing the holes with cement and wood . On 23 April the ship was moved to Wilhelmshaven , where she was completely repaired . A subsequent investigation found that the nearby lightship — which was used to navigate the channel at night — was 700 meters ( 2 @,@ 296 ft 7 in ) from its assigned location , and there were several uncharted rocks in the area of the accident . 
 On 31 August 1902 , the annual summer maneuvers were begun by the fleet . Kaiser Friedrich III was assigned to the " hostile " force , and was first tasked with preventing the " German " squadron from passing through the Great Belt in the Baltic . Kaiser Friedrich III and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the Elbe River , where the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and Hamburg could be seized . The " hostile " flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days . 
 In 1903 , the fleet , which was composed of only one squadron of battleships , was reorganized as the " Active Battle Fleet . " Kaiser Friedrich III remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest Wittelsbach @-@ class battleships , while the older Brandenburg @-@ class ships were placed in reserve in order to be rebuilt . 
 = = = Fleet reorganization , 1905 = = = 
 In October 1905 , the Heimatflotte was again reorganized ; Kaiser Friedrich III was reassigned to the I Division of the II Squadron , alongside her sister @-@ ship Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and the older battleship Wörth . The Heimatflotte in 1905 consisted of another division of three battleships in the II Squadron and two more three @-@ ship divisions in the I Squadron . This was supported by a cruiser division , composed of two armored cruisers and six protected cruisers . The divisions were not organized by ship class , as would be the case in later years . In 1907 , the newest Deutschland @-@ class battleships were coming into service ; along with the Braunschweig @-@ class battleships , these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons . As a result , the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . 
 In 1908 , Kaiser Friedrich III was taken into drydock for an extensive modernization , which lasted until 1909 . Four of her 15 cm guns were removed , though two 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were added . All twelve machine guns were removed , as was the ship 's stern @-@ mounted torpedo tube . Kaiser Friedrich III 's superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship 's tendency to roll excessively . The ship 's funnels were also lengthened . Kaiser Friedrich III served with the active fleet for a total span of ten years , by which time the ship was moved to the III Squadron . However , in 1910 , the new dreadnought battleships were beginning to come into service . Kaiser Friedrich III was then decommissioned and placed into reserve .

 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Kaiser Friedrich III and her sisters were brought back to active service and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron . They were assigned to coastal defense in the Baltic , though they served in this capacity for a very short time . In February 1915 , they were again withdrawn from service and placed in reserve . Kaiser Friedrich III was used as a floating prison stationed in Kiel after 1916 . The following year , the ship was moved to Flensburg , where she was used as a barracks ; later that year she was again moved to Swinemünde . Kaiser Friedrich III was stricken from the navy list on 6 December 1919 and subsequently sold to a ship @-@ breaking firm based in Berlin . The ship was ultimately broken up at Kiel @-@ Nordmole in 1920 . Her bow ornament is on display at the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden .

During the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 78 , she was one of the ironclads sent to Constantinople to forestall a Russian occupation of the Ottoman capital . Agincourt participated in Queen Victoria 's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887 . The ship was placed in reserve two years later and served as a training ship from 1893 to 1909 . That year she was converted into a coal hulk and renamed as <unk> Agincourt served at Sheerness until sold for scrap in 1960 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The three Minotaur @-@ class armoured frigates were essentially enlarged versions of the ironclad HMS Achilles with heavier armament , armour , and more powerful engines . They retained the broadside ironclad layout of their predecessor , but their sides were fully armoured to protect the 50 guns they were designed to carry . Their plough @-@ shaped ram was also more prominent than that of Achilles . 
 The ships were 400 feet ( 121 @.@ 9 m ) long between perpendiculars and 407 feet ( 124 @.@ 1 m ) long overall . They had a beam of 58 feet 6 inches ( 17 @.@ 8 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 10 inches ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . The Minotaur @-@ class ships displaced 10 @,@ 627 long tons ( 10 @,@ 798 t ) . Their hull was subdivided by 15 watertight transverse bulkheads and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms . 
 Agincourt was considered " an excellent sea @-@ boat and a steady gun platform , but unhandy under steam and practically unmanageable under sail " as built . The ship 's steadiness was partially a result of her metacentric height of 3 @.@ 87 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Agincourt had one 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal return connecting rod @-@ steam engine , made by Maudslay , driving a single propeller using steam provided by 10 rectangular fire @-@ tube boilers . It produced a total of 4 @,@ 426 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 300 kW ) during the ship 's sea trials on 12 December 1865 and Agincourt had a maximum speed of 13 @.@ 55 knots ( 25 @.@ 09 km / h ; 15 @.@ 59 mph ) . The ship carried 750 long tons ( 760 t ) of coal , enough to steam 1 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 800 km ; 1 @,@ 700 mi ) at 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ; 8 @.@ 6 mph ) . 
 Agincourt had five masts and a sail area of 32 @,@ 377 square feet ( 3 @,@ 008 m2 ) . Agincourt only made 9 @.@ 5 knots ( 17 @.@ 6 km / h ; 10 @.@ 9 mph ) under sail mainly because the ship 's propeller could only be disconnected and not hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag . Both funnels were semi @-@ retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail . Admiral George A. Ballard described Agincourt and her sisters as " the dullest performers under canvas of the whole masted fleet of their day , and no ships ever carried so much dress to so little purpose . " In 1893 – 4 , after her withdrawal from active service , Agincourt had two masts removed and was re @-@ rigged as a barque . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The armament of the Minotaur @-@ class ships was intended to be 40 rifled 110 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading guns on the main deck and 10 more on the upper deck on pivot mounts . The gun was a new design from Armstrong , but proved a failure a few years after its introduction . The gun was withdrawn before any were received by any of the Minotaur @-@ class ships . They were armed , instead , with a mix of seven @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) and nine @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . All 4 nine @-@ inch and 20 seven @-@ inch guns were mounted on the main deck while 4 seven @-@ inch guns were fitted on the upper deck as chase guns . The ship also received eight brass howitzers for use as saluting guns . The gun ports were 30 inches ( 0 @.@ 8 m ) wide which allowed each gun to fire 30 ° fore and aft of the beam . 
 The shell of the nine @-@ inch gun weighed 254 pounds ( 115 @.@ 2 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 12 long tons ( 12 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 420 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a 11 @.@ 3 inches ( 287 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The seven @-@ inch gun weighed 6 @.@ 5 long tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) and fired a 112 @-@ pound ( 50 @.@ 8 kg ) shell . It was credited with the ability to penetrate 7 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 196 mm ) armour . 
 Agincourt was rearmed in 1875 with a uniform armament of 17 nine @-@ inch guns , 14 on the main deck , 2 forward chase guns and 1 rear chase gun . The gun ports had to be enlarged to accommodate the larger guns by hand , at a cost of £ 250 each . About 1883 two six inches ( 152 mm ) breech @-@ loading guns replaced 2 nine @-@ inch muzzle @-@ loading guns . Four quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 @-@ mm ) guns , eight QF 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns , eight machine guns and two torpedo tubes were installed in 1891 – 2 .

 HMS Agincourt , named after the victory at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 , was originally ordered on 2 September 1861 as HMS Captain , but her name was changed during construction . She was laid down on 30 October 1861 by Laird 's at its shipyard in Birkenhead . The ship was launched on 27 March 1865 , commissioned in June 1868 for sea trials and completed on 19 December . The lengthy delay in completion was due to frequent changes in design details , and experiments with her armament and with her sailing rig . The ship cost a total of £ 483 @,@ 003 . 
 Agincourt 's first assignment , together with her half @-@ sister Northumberland , was to tow a floating drydock from England to Madeira where it would be picked up by Warrior and Black Prince and taken to Bermuda . The ships departed the Nore on 23 June 1869 , loaded down with 500 long tons ( 510 t ) of coal stowed in bags on their gun decks , and transferred the floating dock 11 days later after an uneventful voyage .

 It was during this assignment that she suffered a near @-@ catastrophe when she ran aground on Pearl Rock , near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank . Agincourt was leading the inshore column of ships , contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the inshore column , and gently ran aground sideways when the senior flagship 's navigator failed to compensate for the set of the tide . Warrior , immediately following her , nearly collided with her , but managed to sheer off in time . 
 Agincourt was stuck fast and had to be lightened ; her guns were removed and much of her coal was tossed overboard before she was towed off by Hercules , commanded by Lord Gilford , four days later . Heavy weather set in the night after Agincourt was freed and it would have wrecked her if she had still been aground . Both the fleet commander and his deputy were relieved of their commands as a result of the incident . The ship was repaired in Devonport and Captain <unk> Hopkins assumed command in September with Commander Charles Penrose @-@ Fitzgerald as his executive officer . Hopkins later commented : " We turned the Agincourt from the noisiest and the worst disciplined ship in the squadron into the quietest and the smartest ; and a few months after we commissioned we went out to the Mediterranean for the Lord Clyde court @-@ martial , and beat the whole Mediterranean fleet in their drills and exercises , which was a great triumph . " 
 In 1873 , Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hornby , commander of the Channel Fleet , transferred his flag to Agincourt as her sister Minotaur , his former flagship , was taken in hand for a refit that lasted until 1875 . That year Agincourt was paid off in turn for a refit and re @-@ armament that lasted until 1877 . During the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 78 , the government became concerned that the Russians might advance on the Ottoman capital of Constantinople and ordered Hornby to form a Particular Service Squadron to show the flag at Constantinople and deter any Russian threat . Agincourt served as the flagship for his second @-@ in @-@ command and the squadron sailed up the Dardanelles in a blinding snowstorm in February 1878 . After those tensions faded , the ship returned to the Channel , where she served as second flag until 1889 including during Queen Victoria 's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887 . Over her active career , she served as flagship to no less than 15 admirals . That year she was again paid off and was subsequently held in reserve at Portsmouth until 1893 , when she was transferred to Portland for use as a training ship . 
 Agincourt served twelve years at Portland , as a depot ship for boys . She was renamed Boscawen III in March , 1904 . In 1905 she was moved to Harwich and renamed as Ganges II . After four years at Harwich , Ganges II made her final journey , to Sheerness , in 1909 . After her arrival the old ship was converted into a coal hulk known simply as <unk> After five ignominious decades as what naval historian Oscar Parkes called " a grimy , dilapidated and incredibly shrunken relic " of her former self , she was scrapped beginning on 21 October 1960 .

 = Russian battleship Peresvet = 
 Peresvet ( Russian : <unk> ) was the lead ship of the three Peresvet @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy at the end of the nineteenth century . The ship was transferred to the Pacific Squadron upon completion and based at Port Arthur from 1903 . During the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 , she participated in the Battle of Port Arthur and was seriously damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and again in the Siege of Port Arthur . The ship was scuttled before the Russians surrendered , then salvaged by the Japanese and placed into service with the name Sagami ( <unk> ) . 
 Partially rearmed , Sagami was reclassified by the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) as a coastal defense ship in 1912 . In 1916 , the Japanese sold her to the Russians , their allies since the beginning of World War I. En route to the White Sea in early 1917 , she sank off Port Said , Egypt , after striking mines laid by a German submarine . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The design of the Peresvet class was inspired by the British second @-@ class battleships of the Centurion class . The British ships were intended to defeat commerce @-@ raiding armored cruisers like the Russian ships Rossia and Rurik , and the Peresvet class was designed to support their armored cruisers . This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor . 
 Peresvet was 434 feet 5 inches ( 132 @.@ 4 m ) long overall , and had a beam of 71 feet 6 inches ( 21 @.@ 8 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . Designed to displace 12 @,@ 674 long tons ( 12 @,@ 877 t ) , she was almost 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 1 @,@ 219 t ) overweight and displaced 13 @,@ 810 long tons ( 14 @,@ 030 t ) . Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men . The ship was powered by three vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines using steam generated by 30 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 800 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Peresvet , however , reached a top speed of 18 @.@ 44 knots ( 34 @.@ 15 km / h ; 21 @.@ 22 mph ) from 14 @,@ 532 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 837 kW ) during her sea trials in November 1899 . She carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 060 long tons ( 2 @,@ 090 t ) of coal , which allowed her to steam for 6 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 500 km ; 7 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship 's main battery consisted of four 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one forward and one aft of the superstructure . The secondary armament consisted of eleven Canet 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and in the bow , underneath the forecastle . Several smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included twenty 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) QF guns , twenty 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns and eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . She was also armed with five 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , three above water and two submerged . The ship carried 45 mines to be used to protect her anchorage . Peresvet 's waterline armor belt consisted of Harvey armor and was 4 – 9 inches ( 102 – 229 mm ) thick . The Krupp cemented armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 9 inches ( 229 mm ) and her deck ranged from 2 to 3 inches ( 51 to 76 mm ) in thickness .

 Peresvet was named after Alexander Peresvet , a Russian Orthodox monk who fought and died at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380 , against a Mongolian army . Her keel was laid down on 21 November 1895 by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg and she launched on 19 May 1898 . She was not completed , however , until July 1901 , at the cost of 10 @,@ 540 @,@ 000 rubles . Peresvet entered service in August , and was sent to Port Arthur in October 1901 . En route , she ran aground on the tip of Langeland Island while passing through the Danish Great Belt on 1 November , but was apparently not seriously damaged . Upon arrival she was assigned to the Pacific Squadron and became the flagship of the squadron 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky . 
 = = = Battle of Port Arthur = = = 
 After the Japanese victory in the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 , tensions had arisen between Russia and Japan over their ambitions to control both Manchuria and Korea . A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised . Japan had begun negotiations to ease the situation in 1901 , but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems . Japan interpreted these as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs . The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea . These led the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable . The Pacific Squadron began mooring in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased , in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea . 
 On the night of 8 / 9 February 1904 , the IJN launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur . Peresvet was not hit by the initial torpedo @-@ boat incursion and sortied the following morning when the Combined Fleet , commanded by Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō , attacked . Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his assault . The Japanese vessels had been spotted by the protected cruiser Boyarin , which was patrolling offshore , and alerted the Russian defenses . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted inconsequential damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on their opponents with some effect . Peresvet was hit three times with little effect during the battle . 
 On 22 March , Peresvet joined several other battleships firing indirectly at Japanese ships bombarding Port Arthur 's harbor . While training outside Port Arthur on 26 March , she accidentally collided with the battleship Sevastopol and sustained minor damage . Peresvet participated in the action of 13 April , when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov 's flagship , the battleship Petropavlovsk . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships , he turned back for Port Arthur and Petropavlovsk struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night . The ship sank in less than two minutes following the explosion of one of her magazines , and Makarov was one of the 677 killed . Emboldened by his success , Tōgō resumed long @-@ range bombardment missions . Two days later , Peresvet hit the armored cruiser Nisshin once as the latter ship was bombarding Port Arthur . 
 Peresvet sailed with the rest of the Pacific Squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok . The new squadron commander , Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft , ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese fleet shortly before sunset , as he did not wish to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle . Peresvet bombarded Japanese positions besieging the port on 28 July . Some of the ship 's guns were removed during the summer to reinforce the defenses of the port . Peresvet lost a total of three 6 @-@ inch , two 75 @-@ millimeter , two 47 @-@ millimeter and four 37 @-@ millimeter guns . She was hit on 9 August by two 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) shells fired by a battery with a narrow view of the harbor , but they caused only slight damage . 
 = = = Battle of the Yellow Sea = = = 
 The Japanese bombardment , coupled with a direct order from Tsar Nicholas II , forced Vitgeft to make an attempt to reach Vladivostok . The squadron sortied in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok in the morning of 10 August . At 12 : 25 , it was spotted by Japanese cruisers and intercepted by the Combined Fleet in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea . Peresvet was fourth in line during the battle , and was not seriously damaged during the early long @-@ range stage of the action . Around 18 : 00 her topmasts were destroyed and two 12 @-@ inch shells from the battleship Asahi penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship Tsesarevich , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman , severely wounding the captain , and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn . Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft , the Russian battleline started to execute the same turn , causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich , including Peresvet , to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship . 
 As the Japanese ships continued to pound the Tsesarevich , the battleship Retvizan , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet , boldly charged Tōgō 's battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire . The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships , badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away . Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur , but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized . Peresvet received a total of 39 hits of all sizes that killed 13 men and wounded 69 . Her forward 12 @-@ inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding ; compartments of the double bottom had to be <unk> to restore some of her stability . Repairs took until late September . 
 = = = Siege of Port Arthur = = = 
 Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August , the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by Baron Nogi Maresuke . The new commander , Rear Admiral Robert N. Viren , decided to use the men and guns of the Pacific Squadron to reinforce the defenses of Port Arthur and even more guns were stripped from the squadron 's ships . On 20 – 22 September Japanese troops attacked 203 Hill , which overlooked the harbor ; Peresvet , Retvizan , the battleship Poltava and the gunboat <unk> bombarded the Japanese positions to support the successful defense of the hill . The Japanese began firing blindly into the harbor on 30 September and hit Peresvet with at least six 5 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) and 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch shells . She was struck once more the following day . On 2 October she was hit by nine 11 @-@ inch ( 280 mm ) shells that failed to penetrate her deck armor , but did considerable damage to the unprotected portions of the ship . The Japanese troops were able to seize Hill 203 on 5 December . This allowed the Imperial Japanese Army 's siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships and they hit Peresvet many times . The Russians scuttled her in shallow water on 7 December 1904 without , however , seriously damaging her , possibly in the hope of fooling the Japanese into switching targets . 
 = = = Japanese career = = = 
 Peresvet was refloated by Japanese engineers on 29 June 1905 and steamed under her own power to Sasebo Naval Arsenal , where she arrived on 25 August . She was renamed Sagami , after the eponymous ancient province . She was classified as a 1st @-@ class battleship on 25 August and arrived at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 16 September . Her repairs began on 30 September and continued until 20 July 1908 , although she participated in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905 . 
 To improve her stability , Sagami 's forward fighting top was removed . The bow six @-@ inch gun was also removed and all of her light guns were replaced by 20 QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns . Two above @-@ water 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament and her crew now numbered 791 officers and enlisted men . She was one of the reception ships when the American Great White Fleet visited Japan in late 1908 and was often used as an " enemy " ship during the annual fleet maneuvers . Sagami was reclassified as a 1st @-@ class coastal defense ship on 28 August 1912 .

 In 1916 the Russian government decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the Baltic and Black Seas . As Japan and Russia were allies during World War I , the Japanese government sold Sagami and some other ex @-@ Russian warships back to Russia in March . She arrived in Vladivostok on 3 April , where she re @-@ assumed her former name of Peresvet , and was classified as an armored cruiser two days later . The ship ran aground on 23 May while conducting trials and was refloated by the IJN on 9 July . Peresvet arrived at Maizuru Naval Arsenal for repairs on 30 July and sailed for European Russia on 18 October . She was intended to serve with the White Sea Fleet and paused en route in Port Said for machinery repairs at the beginning of 1917 . On 4 January 1917 , about 10 nautical miles ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) north of the harbor , the ship struck two mines that had been laid by the submarine SM U @-@ 73 . <unk> forward and abreast one of her boiler rooms , Peresvet sank after catching fire . Losses were reported as either 167 or 116 men . 
 = Al @-@ Azhar Mosque = 
 Al @-@ Azhar Mosque ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Azhar , " mosque of the most resplendent " ) is a mosque in Islamic Cairo in Egypt . Al @-@ Mu 'izz li @-@ Din Allah of the Fatimid Caliphate commissioned its construction for the newly established capital city in 970 . Its name is usually thought to allude to the Islamic prophet Muhammad 's daughter Fatimah , a revered figure in Islam who was given the title az @-@ <unk> ′ ( " the shining or resplendent one " ) . It was the first mosque established in Cairo , a city that has since gained the nickname " the City of a Thousand Minarets . " 
 After its dedication in 972 , and with the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989 , the mosque slowly developed into what is today the second oldest continuously run university in the world after Al <unk> in Umayyad Fes . Al @-@ Azhar University has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world for the study of Sunni theology and sharia , or Islamic law . The university , integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception , was nationalized and officially designated an independent university in 1961 , following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 . 
 Over the course of its over a millennium @-@ long history , the mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded . Because it was founded as a Shiite Ismaili institution , Saladin and the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned al @-@ Azhar , removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school . These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate , under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place . Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque and provided widely varying levels of financial assistance , both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque . Today , al @-@ Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society that is highly revered in the Sunni Muslim world and a symbol of Islamic Egypt .

 The city of Cairo was established by Gawhar al @-@ <unk> , a Fatimid general of Greek extraction from Sicily . He originally named it al @-@ Mansuriyya ( <unk> ) after the prior seat of the Fatimid caliphate , al @-@ Mansuriya in modern Tunisia . The mosque , first used in 972 , may have initially been named Jāmi ' al @-@ Mansuriyya ( جامع <unk> , " the mosque of Mansuriyya " ) , as was common practice at the time . It was the Caliph al @-@ Mu ’ izz li @-@ Dīn Allāh who renamed the city al @-@ Qāhira ( <unk> , " Cairo " , meaning , " the Victorious " ) . The name of the mosque thus became Jāmi ' al @-@ Qāhira ( جامع <unk> , " the mosque of Cairo " ) , the first transcribed in Arabic sources . 
 The mosque acquired its current name , al @-@ Azhar , sometime between the caliphate of al @-@ Mu ’ izz and the end of the reign of the second Fatimid caliph in Egypt , al @-@ Aziz Billah . Azhar is the masculine form for <unk> ′ , meaning " splendid " or " most resplendent . " <unk> ′ is an epithet applied to Muhammad 's daughter Fatimah , wife of caliph Alī ibn Abī <unk> . She was claimed as the ancestress of al @-@ Mu ’ izz and the imams of the Fatimid dynasty ; one theory is that her epithet is the source for the name al @-@ Azhar . The theory , however , is not confirmed in any Arabic source and its plausibility has been both supported and denied by later Western sources . 
 An alternative theory is that the mosque 's name is derived from the names given by the Fatimid caliphs to their palaces . Those near the mosque were collectively named al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , " the Brilliant Palaces " ) by al @-@ Aziz Billah , and the royal gardens were named after another derivative of the word <unk> . The palaces had been completed and named prior to the mosque changing its name from Jāmi ' al @-@ Qāhira to al @-@ Azhar . 
 The word Jāmi ' is derived from the Arabic root word <unk> ( g @-@ m @-@ <unk> ) , meaning " to gather " . The word is used for large congregational mosques . While in classical Arabic the name for al @-@ Azhar remains Jāmi ' al @-@ Azhar , the pronunciation of the word Jāmi ' changes to <unk> ' in Egyptian Arabic .

 = = = Fatimid Caliphate = = = 
 Caliph al @-@ Mu ’ izz li @-@ Din Allāh , the fourth Ismāʿīli Imam , conquered Egypt through his general Gawhar , wresting it from the Sunni Ikhshidid dynasty . By order of the Caliph , Gawhar then oversaw the construction of the royal enclosure of the Fatimid Caliphate and its army , and had al @-@ Azhar built as a base to spread Ismāʿīli Shi 'a Islam . Located near the densely populated Sunni city of Fustat , Cairo became the center of the Ismāʿīli sect of Shi 'a Islam , and seat of the Fatimid empire . 
 Gawhar ordered the construction of a congregational mosque for the new city and work commenced on April 4 , 970 . The mosque was completed in 972 and the first Friday prayers were held there on June 22 , 972 during Ramadan . 
 Al @-@ Azhar soon became a center of learning in the Islamic world , and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there . Under Fatimid rule , the previously secretive teachings of the Ismāʿīli madh 'hab ( school of law ) were made available to the general public . Al @-@ Nu ‘ man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi ( judge ) under al @-@ Mu ’ izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Ismāʿīli madh 'hab . Classes were taught at the palace of the Caliph , as well as at al @-@ Azhar , with separate sessions available to women . During Eid ul @-@ Fitr in 973 , the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo . Al @-@ Mu ’ izz , and his son — when he in turn became caliph — would preach at least one Friday <unk> ( sermon ) during Ramadan at al @-@ Azhar . 
 Yaqub ibn Killis , a polymath , jurist and the first official vizier of the Fatimids , made al @-@ Azhar a key center for instruction in Islamic law in 988 . The following year , 45 scholars were hired to give lessons , laying the foundation for what would become the leading university in the Muslim world . 
 The mosque was expanded during the rule of the caliph al @-@ Aziz ( 975 – 996 ) . According to al @-@ Mufaddal , he ordered the restoration of portions of the mosque and had the ceiling raised by one cubit . The next Fatimid caliph , al @-@ Hakim , would continue to renovate the mosque , providing a new wooden door in 1010 . However , al @-@ Hakim 's reign saw the completion of the al @-@ Hakim Mosque , and al @-@ Azhar lost its status as Cairo 's primary congregational mosque . In May 1009 the al @-@ Hakim Mosque became the sole location for the caliph 's sermons ; prior to this , al @-@ Hakim would rotate where the Friday sermon was held . Following al @-@ Hakim 's reign , al @-@ Azhar was restored by al @-@ <unk> . Additions and renovations were carried during the reign of the remaining Fatimid caliphs . 
 Initially lacking a library , al @-@ Azhar was endowed by the Fatimid caliph in 1005 with thousands of manuscripts that formed the basis of its collection . Fatimid efforts to establish Ismāʿīli practice among the population were , however largely unsuccessful . Much of its manuscript collection was dispersed in the chaos that ensued with the fall of the Fatimid Caliphate , and Al @-@ Azhar became a Sunni institution shortly thereafter . 
 = = = Ayyubid dynasty = = = 
 Saladin , who overthrew the Fatimids in 1171 , was hostile to the Shi ’ ite principles of learning propounded at al @-@ Azhar during the Fatimid Caliphate , and under his Ayyubid dynasty the mosque suffered from neglect . Congregational prayers were banned by Sadr al @-@ Din ibn <unk> , appointed qadi by Saladin . The reason for this edict may have been Shāfi ‘ ī teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community to only one mosque , or mistrust of the former Shi 'a institution by the new Sunni ruler . By this time , the much larger al @-@ Hakim Mosque was completed ; congregational prayers in Cairo were held there . 
 In addition to stripping al @-@ Azhar of its status as congregational mosque , Saladin also ordered the removal from the mihrab of the mosque a silver band on which the names of the Fatimid caliphs had been inscribed . This and similar silver bands removed from other mosques totaled 5 @,@ 000 <unk> . Saladin did not completely disregard the upkeep of the mosque and according to al @-@ Mufaddal one of the mosque 's minarets was raised during Saladin 's rule . 
 The teaching center at the mosque also suffered . The once well stocked library at al @-@ Azhar was neglected , and manuscripts of Fatimid teachings that were held at al @-@ Azhar were destroyed . The Ayyubid dynasty promoted the teaching of Sunni theology in subsidized madrasas ( schools ) built throughout Cairo . Student funding was withdrawn , organized classes were no longer held at the mosque , and the professors that had prospered under the Fatimids were forced to find other means to earn their living . 
 Al @-@ Azhar nevertheless remained the seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period . While official classes were discontinued , private lessons were still offered in the mosque . There are reports that a scholar , possibly al @-@ Baghdadi , taught a number of subjects , such as law and medicine , at al @-@ Azhar . Saladin reportedly paid him a salary of 30 dinars , which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin 's heirs . While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs , the policies of the Sunni Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al @-@ Azhar . Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi 'a Islam . These colleges , ranging in size , focused on teaching Sunni doctrine , had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics , such as rhetorics , math , and science . No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin 's conquest . Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty @-@ six colleges in Egypt , among them the <unk> Madrasa . 
 Al @-@ Azhar eventually adopted Saladin 's educational reforms modeled on the college system he instituted , and its fortunes improved under the Mamluks , who restored student stipends and salaries for the <unk> ( teaching staff ) . 
 = = = Mamluk Sultanate = = = 
 Congregational prayers were reestablished at al @-@ Azhar during the Mamluk Sultanate by Sultan Baibars in 1266 . While Shāfi ‘ ī teachings , which Saladin and the Ayyubids followed , stipulated that only one mosque should be used as a congregational mosque in a community , the Hanafi madh 'hab , to which the Mamluks adhered , placed no such restriction . Al @-@ Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and Ismāʿīli doctrines , and with Cairo 's rapid expansion , the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al @-@ Azhar 's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence . Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate , al @-@ Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and teachers , as well as the onset of work to repair the mosque , which had been neglected for nearly 100 years . According to al @-@ Mufaddal , the emir ' Izz al @-@ Din <unk> al @-@ <unk> built his house next to the mosque and while doing so repaired the mosque . Al @-@ Maqrizi reports that the emir repaired the walls and roof as well as repaving and providing new floor mats . The first <unk> since the reign of the Fatimid caliph al @-@ Hakim took place on January 16 , 1266 with the sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier . 
 An earthquake in 1302 caused damage to al @-@ Azhar and a number of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory . The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs ( princes ) of the Sultanate and the head of the army , Amir Salar , who was tasked with repairing the damage . These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars . Seven years later a dedicated school , the Madrasa al @-@ Aqbaghawiyya , was built along the northwest wall of the mosque . Portions of the wall of the mosque were removed to accommodate the new building . Construction of another school , the Madrasa al @-@ Taybarsiyya began in 1332 – 1333 . This building , which was completed in 1339 @-@ 1340 , would also impact the structure of the mosque as it was built over the site of the <unk> 'a , the fountain for ablution . Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al @-@ Azhar , with separate entrances and prayer halls . 
 Though the mosque had regained its standing in Cairo , repairs and additional work were carried out by those in positions lower than sultan . This changed under the rule of al @-@ Zahir Barquq , the first sultan of the Burji dynasty . The resumption of direct patronage by those in the highest positions of government continued through to the end of Mamluk rule . Improvements and additions were made by the sultans Qaytbay and Qansuh al @-@ Ghuri , each of whom oversaw numerous repairs and erected minarets . It was common practice among the Mamluk sultans to build minarets , perceived as symbols of power and the most effective way of cementing one 's position in the Cairo cityscape . The sultans wished to have a noticeable association with the prestigious al @-@ Azhar . 
 Although the mosque @-@ school was the leading university in the Islamic world and had regained royal patronage , it did not overtake the madrasas as the favored place of education among Cairo 's elite . Al @-@ Azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning , whereas the madrasas that had first been constructed during Saladin 's rule were fully integrated into the state educational system . Al @-@ Azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in Egypt and the Middle East , far surpassing the numbers attending the madrasas . Al @-@ Azhar 's student body was organized in riwaqs ( fraternities ) along national lines , and the branches of Islamic law were studied . The average degree required six years of study . 
 By the 14th century , al @-@ Azhar had achieved a preeminent place as the center for studies in law , theology , and Arabic , becoming a cynosure for students all around the Islamic world . However , only one third of the ulema ( Islamic scholars ) of Egypt were reported to have either attended or taught at al @-@ Azhar . One account , by Muhammad ibn Iyas , reports that the <unk> Madrasa , and not al @-@ Azhar , was viewed as the " citadel of the ulema " at the end of the Mamluk Sultanate . 
 = = = Province of the Ottoman Empire = = = 
 With the Ottoman annexation of 1517 , despite the mayhem their fight to control the city engendered , the Turks showed great deference to the mosque and its college , though direct royal patronage ceased . Sultan Selim I , the first Ottoman ruler of Egypt , attended al @-@ Azhar for the congregational Friday prayer during his last week in Egypt , but did not donate anything to the upkeep of the mosque . Later Ottoman amirs likewise regularly attended Friday prayers at al @-@ Azhar , but rarely provided subsidies for the maintenance of the mosque , though they did on occasion provide stipends for students and teachers . In contrast to the expansions and additions undertaken during the Mamluk Sultanate , only two Ottoman <unk> ( governors ) restored al @-@ Azhar in the early Ottoman period . 
 Despite their defeat by Selim I and the Ottomans in 1517 , the Mamluks remained influential in Egyptian society , becoming beys ( " chieftains " ) , nominally under the control of the Ottoman governors , instead of amirs at the head of an empire . The first governor of Egypt under Selim I was Khai 'r Bey , a Mamluk amir who had defected to the Ottomans during the Battle of Marj Dabiq . Though the Mamluks launched multiple revolts to reinstate their Sultanate , including two in 1523 , the Ottomans refrained from completely destroying the Mamluk hold over the power structure of Egypt . The Mamluks did suffer losses — both economic and military — in the immediate aftermath of the Ottoman victory , and this was reflected in the lack of financial assistance provided to al @-@ Azhar in the first hundred years of Ottoman rule . By the 18th century the Mamluk elite had regained much of its influence and began to sponsor numerous renovations throughout Cairo and at al @-@ Azhar specifically . 
 Al @-@ <unk> , a powerful Mamluk bey , sponsored several additions and renovations in the early 18th century . Under his direction , a <unk> for blind students was added in 1735 . He also sponsored the rebuilding of the Turkish and Syrian riwaqs , both of which had originally been built by Qaytbay . 
 This marked the beginning of the largest set of renovations to be undertaken since the expansions conducted under the Mamluk Sultanate . Abd al @-@ Rahman Katkhuda was appointed <unk> ( head of the Janissaries ) in 1749 and embarked on several projects throughout Cairo and at al @-@ Azhar . Under his direction , three new gates were built : the Bab al @-@ Muzayinīn ( the Gate of the Barbers ) , so named because students would have their heads shaved outside of the gate , which eventually became the main entrance to the mosque ; the Bab al @-@ Sa <unk> ( the Gate of the Sa <unk> ) , named for the Sa <unk> people of Upper Egypt ; and , several years later , the Bab al @-@ <unk> ( the Soup Gate ) , from which food , often rice soup , would be served to the students . A prayer hall was added to the south of the original one , doubling the size of the available prayer space . Katkhuda also refurbished or rebuilt several of the riwaqs that surrounded the mosque . Katkhuda was buried in a mausoleum he himself had built in Al @-@ Azhar ; in 1776 , he became the first person ( and the last ) to be interred within the mosque since <unk> al @-@ <unk> , a female mystic who had died around 1588 . 
 During the Ottoman period , al @-@ Azhar regained its status as a favored institution of learning in Egypt , overtaking the madrasas that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks . By the end of the 18th century , al @-@ Azhar had become inextricably linked to the ulema of Egypt . The ulema also were able to influence the government in an official capacity , with several sheikhs appointed to advisory councils that reported to the pasha ( honorary governor ) , who in turn was appointed for only one year . This period also saw the introduction of more secular courses taught at al @-@ Azhar , with science and logic joining philosophy in the curriculum . During this period , al @-@ Azhar saw its first non @-@ Maliki rector ; Abdullah al @-@ <unk> , a follower of the <unk> <unk> , was appointed rector . No follower of the Maliki <unk> would serve as rector until 1899 when Salim al @-@ <unk> was appointed to the post . 
 Al @-@ Azhar also served as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman occupation of Egypt , both from within the ulema and from among the general public . Student protests at al @-@ Azhar were common , and shops in the vicinity of the mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students . The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government . In one instance , in 1730 – 31 , Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al @-@ Azhar while pursuing three fugitives . The gates at al @-@ Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor , fearing a larger uprising , ordered the aghas to refrain from going near al @-@ Azhar . Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al @-@ Hussein Mosque , who then went to al @-@ Azhar to demonstrate . The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post .

 Napoleon invaded Egypt in July 1798 , arriving in Alexandria on July 2 and moving on to Cairo on July 22 . In a bid to placate both the Egyptian population and the Ottoman Empire , Napoleon gave a speech in Alexandria in which he proclaimed his respect for Islam and the Sultan : 
 People of Egypt , you will be told that I have come to destroy your religion : do not believe it ! Answer that I have come to restore your rights and punish the usurpers , and that , more than the Mamluks , I respect God , his Prophet and the Koran ... Is it not we who have been through the centuries the friends of the Sultan ? 
 On July 25 Napoleon set up a diwan made up of nine al @-@ Azhar sheikhs tasked with governing Cairo , the first body of Egyptians to hold official powers since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation . This practice of forming councils among the ulema of a city , first instituted in Alexandria , was put in place throughout French @-@ occupied Egypt . Napoleon also unsuccessfully sought a fatwa from the al @-@ Azhar imams that would deem it permissible under Islamic law to declare allegiance to Napoleon . 
 Napoleon 's efforts to win over both the Egyptians and the Ottomans proved unsuccessful ; the Ottoman Empire declared war on September 9 , 1798 , and a revolt against French troops was launched from al @-@ Azhar on October 21 , 1798 . Egyptians armed with stones , spears , and knives rioted and looted . The following morning the diwan met with Napoleon in an attempt to bring about a peaceful conclusion to the hostilities . Napoleon , initially incensed , agreed to attempt a peaceful resolution and asked the sheikhs of the diwan to organize talks with the rebels . The rebels , believing the move indicated weakness among the French , refused . Napoleon then ordered that the city be fired upon from the Cairo Citadel , aiming directly at al @-@ Azhar . During the revolt two to three hundred French soldiers were killed , with 3 @,@ 000 Egyptian casualties . Six of the ulema of al @-@ Azhar were killed following summary judgments laid against them , with several more condemned . Any Egyptian caught by French troops was imprisoned or , if caught bearing weapons , beheaded . The French troops intentionally desecrated the mosque , walking in with their shoes on and guns displayed . The troops tied their horses to the mihrab and ransacked the student quarters and libraries , throwing copies of the Quran on the floor . The leaders of the revolt then attempted to negotiate a settlement with Napoleon , but were rebuffed . 
 Napoleon , who had been well respected in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el @-@ Kebir ( the Great Sultan ) among the people of Cairo , lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed . In March 1800 , French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al @-@ Halabi , a student at al @-@ Azhar . Following the assassination , Napoleon ordered the closing of the mosque ; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801 . 
 The conservative tradition of the mosque , with its lack of attention to science , was shaken by Napoleon 's invasion . A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt , finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text , though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930 . Upon the withdrawal of the French , Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning , and history , math , and modern science were adopted into the curriculum . By 1872 , under the direction of <unk> al @-@ Dīn al @-@ <unk> , European philosophy was also added to the study program . 
 = = = Muhammad Ali Dynasty and British occupation = = = 
 Following the French withdrawal , Ali , the wāli ( governor ) and self @-@ declared khedive ( viceroy ) of Egypt , sought to consolidate his newfound control of the country . To achieve this goal he took a number of steps to limit , and eventually eliminate , the ability of the al @-@ Azhar ulema to influence the government . He imposed taxes on <unk> lands ( tax @-@ free property owned by mosques ) and madrasas , from which al @-@ Azhar drew a major portion of its income . In June 1809 , he ordered that the deeds to all <unk> lands be forfeited to the state in a move that provoked outrage among the ulema . As a result , Umar Makram , the <unk> al @-@ <unk> , a prestigious Islamic post , led a revolt in July 1809 . The revolt failed and Makram , an influential ally of the ulema , was exiled to Damietta . 
 Ali also sought to limit the influence of the al @-@ Azhar sheikhs by allocating positions within the government to those educated outside of al @-@ Azhar . He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to , and thus bypassed , the system of al @-@ Azhar . 
 Under the rule of Isma 'il Pasha , the grandson of Muhammad Ali , major public works projects were initiated with the aim of transforming Cairo into a European styled city . These projects , at first funded by a boom in the cotton industry , eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British , providing an excuse for the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having pushed out Isma 'il Pasha in 1879 . 
 The reign of Isma 'il Pasha also saw the return of royal patronage to al @-@ Azhar . As khedive , Isma 'il restored the Bab al @-@ Sa <unk> ( first built by Katkhuda ) and the Madrasa al @-@ Aqbaghawiyya . Tewfik Pasha , Isma 'il 's son , who became khedive when his father was deposed as a result of British pressure , continued to restore the mosque . Tewfik renovated the prayer hall that was added by Katkhuda , also aligning the southeastern facade of the hall with the street behind it , and remodeling several other areas of the mosque . Abbas II succeeded his father Tewfik as khedive of Egypt and Sudan in 1892 , and continued the renovations started by his grandfather Isma 'il . He restructured the main facade of the mosque and built a new <unk> . Under his rule , the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art ( initially formed under French occupation ) , also restored the original Fatimid sahn . These renovations were both needed and helped modernize al @-@ Azhar and harmonize it with what was becoming a metropolis . 
 The major set of reforms that began under the rule of Isma 'il Pasha continued under the British occupation . Muhammad Mahdi al- ' Abbasi , sheikh al @-@ Azhar , had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to the hiring practices of the university as well as to standardize the examinations taken by students . Further efforts to modernize the educational system were made under Hilmi 's rule during the British occupation . The mosque 's manuscripts were gathered into a centralized library , sanitation for students improved , and a regular system of exams instituted . From 1885 , other colleges in Egypt were placed directly under the administration of the al @-@ Azhar Mosque . 
 During Sa 'ad <unk> 's term as minister of education , before he went on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 , further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al @-@ Azhar . While a bastion of conservatism in many regards , the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism , especially as espoused by the Muslim Brotherhood , founded in 1928 . The school attracted students from throughout the world , including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia , providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia . 
 Under the reign of King Fuad I , two laws were passed that reorganized the educational structure at al @-@ Azhar . The first of these , in 1930 , split the school into three departments : Arabic language , sharia , and theology , with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo . Additionally , formal examinations were required to earn a degree in one of these three fields of study . Six years later , a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed building across the street from the mosque . Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings . 
 The ideas advocated by several influential reformers in the early 1900s , such as Muhammad Abduh and Muhammad al @-@ Ahmadi al @-@ Zawahiri , began to take hold at al @-@ Azhar in 1928 , with the appointment of Mustafa al @-@ Maraghi as rector . A follower of Abduh , the majority of the ulema opposed his appointment . Al @-@ Maraghi and his successors began a series of modernizing reforms of the mosque and its school , expanding programs outside of the traditional subjects . Fuad disliked al @-@ Maraghi , and had him replaced after one year by al @-@ Zawahiri , but al @-@ Maraghi would return to the post of rector in 1935 , serving until his death in 1945 . Under his leadership , al @-@ Azhar 's curriculum was expanded to include non @-@ Arabic languages and modern sciences . Al @-@ Zawahiri , who had also been opposed by the ulema of the early 1900s , continued the efforts to modernize and reform al @-@ Azhar . Following al @-@ Maraghi 's second term as rector , another student of Abduh was appointed rector . 
 = = = Post 1952 revolution = = = 
 Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 , led by the Free Officers Movement of Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser , in which the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown , the university began to be separated from the mosque . A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955 . The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school , and the college was officially designated a university in 1961 . The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world . The law also created secular departments within al @-@ Azhar , such as colleges of medicine , engineering , and economics , furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation . The reforms of the curriculum have led to a massive growth in the number of Egyptian students attending al @-@ Azhar run schools , specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al @-@ Azhar system . The number of students reported to attend al @-@ Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90 @,@ 000 in 1970 to 300 @,@ 000 in the early in 1980s , up to nearly one million in the early 1990s , and exceeding 1 @.@ 3 million students in 2001 . 
 During his tenure as Prime Minister , and later President , Nasser continued the efforts to limit the power of the ulema of al @-@ Azhar and to use its influence to his advantage . In 1952 , the <unk> were nationalized and placed under the authority of the newly created Ministry of Religious Endowments , cutting off the ability of the mosque to control its financial affairs . He abolished the sharia courts , merging religious courts with the state judicial system in 1955 , severely limiting the independence of the ulema . The 1961 reform law , which invalidated an earlier law passed in 1936 that had guaranteed the independence of al @-@ Azhar , gave the President of Egypt the authority to appoint the sheikh al @-@ Azhar , a position first created during Ottoman rule and chosen from and by the ulema since its inception . Al @-@ Azhar , which remained a symbol of the Islamic character of both the nation and the state , continued to influence the population while being unable to exert its will over the state . Al @-@ Azhar became increasingly co @-@ opted into the state bureaucracy after the revolution — independence of its curriculum and its function as a mosque ceased . The authority of the ulema were further weakened by the creation of government agencies responsible for providing interpretations of religious laws . While these reforms dramatically curtailed the independence of the ulema , they also had the effect of reestablishing their influence by integrating them further into the state apparatus . The 1961 reform law also provided the ulema with the resources of the state , though the purse strings were outside of their control . While Nasser sought to subjugate the ulema beneath the state , he did not allow more extreme proposals to limit the influence of al @-@ Azhar . One such proposal was made by Taha Hussein in 1955 . Hussein sought to dismantle the <unk> primary and secondary educational system and transform the university into a faculty of theology which would be included within the modern , secular , collegiate educational system . The ulema opposed this plan , though Nasser 's choice of maintaining al @-@ Azhar 's status was due more to personal political considerations , such as the use of al @-@ Azhar to grant legitimacy to the regime , than on the opposition of the ulema . 
 Al @-@ Azhar , now fully integrated as an arm of the government , was then used to justify actions of the government . Although the ulema had in the past issued rulings that socialism is irreconcilable with Islam , following the Revolution 's land reforms new rulings were supplied giving Nasser a religious justification for what he termed an " Islamic " socialism . The ulema would also serve as a counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood , and to Saudi Arabia 's Wahhabi influence . An assassination attempt on Nasser was blamed on the Brotherhood , and the organization was outlawed . Nasser , needing support from the ulema as he initiated mass arrests of Brotherhood members , relaxed some of the restrictions placed on al @-@ Azhar . The ulema of al @-@ Azhar in turn consistently supported him in his attempts to dismantle the Brotherhood , and continued to do so in subsequent regimes . Despite the efforts of Nasser and al @-@ Azhar to discredit the Brotherhood , the organization continued to function . Al @-@ Azhar also provided legitimacy for war with Israel in 1967 , declaring the conflict against Israel a " holy struggle . " 
 Following Nasser 's death in 1970 , Anwar Sadat became President of Egypt . Sadat wished to restore al @-@ Azhar as a symbol of Egyptian leadership throughout the Arab world , saying that " the Arab world cannot function without Egypt and its Azhar . " Recognizing the growing influence of the Muslim Brotherhood , Sadat relaxed several restrictions on the Brotherhood and the ulema as a whole . However , in an abrupt about @-@ face , in September 1971 a crackdown was launched on journalists and organizations that Sadat felt were undermining or attacking his positions . As part of this effort to silence criticism of his policies , Sadat instituted sanctions against any of the ulema who criticized or contradicted official state policies . The ulema of al @-@ Azhar continued to be used as a tool of the government , sparking criticism among several groups , including Islamist and other more moderate groups . Shukri Mustafa , an influential Islamist figure , accused the ulema of providing religious judgments for the sole purpose of government convenience . When Sadat needed support for making peace with Israel , which the vast majority of the Egyptian population regarded as an enemy , al @-@ Azhar provided a decree stating that the time had come to make peace . 
 Hosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat as President of Egypt following Sadat 's assassination in 1981 . While al @-@ Azhar would continue to oblige the government in granting a religious legitimacy to its dictates , the mosque and its clergy were given more autonomy under Mubarak 's regime . Under Jad al @-@ Haq , the sheikh of al @-@ Azhar from 1982 until his death in 1994 , al @-@ Azhar asserted its independence from the state , at times criticizing policies of the state for instigating extremist Islamist sects . Al @-@ Haq argued that if the government wished al @-@ Azhar to effectively combat groups such as al @-@ Gama 'a al @-@ Islamiyya then al @-@ Azhar must be permitted greater independence from the state and for it to be allowed to make religious declarations without interference . Under Mubarak , a number of powers of the state were ceded to al @-@ Azhar . During the 1990s , modifications to existing censorship laws gave al @-@ Azhar the ability to censor both print and electronic media . Though the law stipulates that al @-@ Azhar may only become involved following a complaint , in practice its role has been much more pervasive ; for example , television scripts were routinely sent to al @-@ Azhar for approval prior to airing . 
 Al @-@ Azhar continues to hold a status above other Sunni religious authorities throughout the world , and as Sunnis form a large majority of the total Muslim population al @-@ Azhar exerts considerable influence on the Islamic world as a whole . In addition to being the default authority within Egypt , al @-@ Azhar has been looked to outside of Egypt for religious judgments . Prior to the Gulf War , Saudi Arabia 's King Fahd asked for a fatwa authorizing the stationing of foreign troops within the kingdom , and despite Islam 's two holiest sites being located within Saudi Arabia , he asked the head sheikh of al @-@ Azhar instead of the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia . In 2003 , Nicolas Sarkozy , at the time French Minister of the Interior , requested a judgment from al @-@ Azhar allowing Muslim girls to not wear the hijab in French public schools , despite the existence of the French Council of Islam . The sheikh of al @-@ Azhar provided the ruling , saying that while wearing the hijab is an " Islamic duty " the Muslim women of France are obligated to respect and follow French laws . The ruling drew much criticism within Egypt as compromising Islamic principles to convenience the French government , and in turn the Egyptian government . 
 = = = Post 2011 revolution = = = 
 Al @-@ Azhar was not unaffected by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt . Student government elections in the months following the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood . Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque 's independence from the state broke out , and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al @-@ Azhar greater independence from the government . Within al @-@ Azhar , debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single @-@ voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime . The various views on al @-@ Azhar 's future role in Egypt come from several parties , including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood , liberal voices that wish to see al @-@ Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra @-@ conservative Islamists ( known as Salafists ) , and those that hope to see al @-@ Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances , leadership , and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The architecture of al @-@ Azhar is closely tied to the history of Cairo . Materials taken from multiple periods of Egyptian history , from the Ancient Egyptians , through Greek and Roman rule , to the Coptic Christian era , were used in the early mosque structure , which drew on other Fatimid structures in Ifriqiya . Later additions from the different rulers of Egypt likewise show influences from both within and outside of Egypt . Sections of the mosque show many of these influences blended together while others show a single inspiration , such as domes from the Ottoman period and minarets built by the Mamluks . 
 Initially built as a prayer hall with five aisles and a modest central courtyard , the mosque has since been expanded multiple times with additional installations completely surrounding the original structure . Many of Egypt 's rulers have shaped the art and architecture of al @-@ Azhar , from the minarets added by the Mamluks and the gates added during Ottoman rule to more recent renovations such as the installation of a new mihrab . None of the original minarets or domes have survived , with some of the current minarets having been rebuilt several times . 
 = = = Structural evolution under Fatimids = = = 
 Completely surrounded by dependencies added as the mosque was used over time , the original structure was 280 feet ( 85 m ) in length and 227 feet ( 69 m ) wide , and comprised three arcades situated around a courtyard . To the southeast of the courtyard , the original prayer hall was built as a hypostyle hall , five aisles deep . Measuring 260 feet ( 79 m ) by 75 feet ( 23 m ) , the qibla wall was slightly off the correct angle . The marble columns supporting the four arcades that made up the prayer hall were reused from sites extant at different times in Egyptian history , from Pharaonic times through Roman rule to Coptic dominance . The different heights of the columns were made level by using bases of varying thickness . The stucco exterior shows influences from Abbasid , Coptic and Byzantine architecture . 
 Ultimately a total of three domes were built , a common trait among early north African mosques , although none of them have survived Al @-@ Azhar 's many renovations . The historian al @-@ Maqrizi recorded that in the original dome al @-@ Siqilli inscribed the following : 
 In the name of Allah , the Merciful , the Compassionate ; according to the command for its building from the servant of Allah , His governor abu Tamim Ma 'ad , the Imam al @-@ Mu ‘ izz li @-@ Dīn Allāh , Amir al @-@ Mu <unk> , for whom and his illustrious forefathers and his sons may there be the blessings of Allah : By the hand of his servant Jawhar , the Secretary , the <unk> in the year 360 . 
 Gawhar included the honorific Amir al @-@ Mu <unk> , Commander of the Faithful , as the Caliphs title and also included his nickname " the Secretary " which he had earned serving as a secretary prior to becoming a general . 
 The original mihrab , uncovered in 1933 , has a semi @-@ dome above it with a marble column on either side . Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque , with the mihrab and the walls ornately decorated . The mihrab had two sets of verses from the Quran inscribed in the conch , which is still intact . The first set of verses are the three that open al @-@ Mu ’ <unk> : 
 Successful indeed are the believers – who are humble in their prayers – and who avoid vain talk 
 The next inscription is made up of verses 162 and 163 of al @-@ An 'am : 
 Say : Surely my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are ( all ) for Allah , the Lord of the worlds – No associate has He ; and this am I commanded , and I am the first of those who submit . 
 These inscriptions are the only surviving piece of decoration that has been definitively traced to the Fatimids . 
 The marble paved central courtyard was added between 1009 and 1010 . The arcades that surround the courtyard have keel shaped arches with stucco inscriptions . The arches were built during the reign of al @-@ Hafiz li @-@ Din Allah . The stucco ornaments also date to his rule and were redone in 1891 . Two types of ornaments are used . The first appears above the center of the arch and consists of a sunken roundel and twenty @-@ four lobes . A circular band of vegetal motifs was added in 1893 . The second ornament used , which alternates with the first appearing in between each arch , consists of shallow niches below a fluted hood . The hood rests on engaged columns which are surrounded by band of Qu 'ranic writing in Kufic script . The Qu 'ranic script was added after the rule of al @-@ Hafiz but during the Fatimid period . The walls are topped by a star shaped band with tiered triangular crenellations . The southeastern arcade of the courtyard contains the main entrance to the prayer hall . A Persian framing gate , in which the central arch of the arcade is further in with a higher rectangular pattern above it , opens into the prayer hall . 
 A new wooden door was installed during the reign of al @-@ Hakim in 1009 . In 1125 , al @-@ Amir installed a new wooden mihrab . An additional dome was constructed during the reign of al @-@ Hafiz li @-@ Din Allah . He additionally ordered the creation of a fourth arcade around the courtyard and had a porch built on the western end of the sahn . 
 = = = Mamluk additions = = = 
 The Fatimid dynasty was succeeded by the rule of Saladin and his Ayyubid dynasty . Initially appointed vizier by the last Fatimid Caliph Al- ' <unk> ( who incorrectly thought he could be easily manipulated ) , Saladin consolidated power in Egypt , allying that country with the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad . Distrusting al @-@ Azhar for its Shi 'a history , the mosque lost prestige during his rule . However , the succeeding Mamluk dynasty made restorations and additions to the mosque , overseeing a rapid expansion of its educational programs . Among the restorations was a modification of the mihrab , with the installation of a polychrome marble facing . 
 A dome and minaret cover the Madrasa al @-@ Aqbaghawiyya , which contains the tomb of Amir <unk> , which was built in 1339 . Intended by its founder , <unk> ' Abd al @-@ Wahid , to be a stand @-@ alone mosque and school , the madrasa has since become integrated with the rest of the mosque . The entrance , qibla wall , and glass mosaic in the mihrab are all original with the dome dating to the Ottoman period . 
 Built in 1440 , the Madrasa <unk> contains the tomb of Gawhar al @-@ <unk> 'i , a Sudanese eunuch who became treasurer to the sultan . The floor of the madrasa is marble , the walls lined with cupboards , decoratively inlaid with ebony , ivory , and nacre . The tomb chamber is covered by small arabesque dome . 
 = = = = Madrasa al @-@ Taybarsiyya = = = = 
 The Madrasa al @-@ Taybarsiyya , which contains the tomb of Amir <unk> , was built in 1309 . Originally intended to function as a complementary mosque to al @-@ Azhar it has since been integrated with the rest of the mosque . The Maliki and Shāfi ‘ ī madh 'hab were studied in this madrasa , though it now is used to hold manuscripts from the library . The only surviving piece from the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome mihrab . Al @-@ Maqrizi reported that the madrasa was used only for studying the Shāfi ‘ ī while the historian Ibn <unk> reported that one of the <unk> in the madrasa was reserved for Shāfi ‘ ī teachings while the other was for Maliki teachings . 
 The madrasa was completely rebuilt by Abd al @-@ Rahman Katkhuda , leaving only the southeastern wall and its mihrab untouched . The mihrab was described by K. A. C. Creswell as being " one of the finest in Cairo " . The niche of the mihrab is 1 @.@ 13 meters ( 3 @.@ 7 ft ) wide and 76 centimeters ( 30 in ) deep . On each side of the niche stands a 2 @.@ 78 meters ( 9 @.@ 1 ft ) high porphyry column . Above the columns are impost blocks decorated with colored geometrical designs . The semi @-@ dome at the top of the mihrab is set within an outer arch . Surrounding this arch is a molding that forms a rectangular outer frame . This is the first mihrab in Egypt to have this type of frame . 
 = = = = Minaret of Qaytbay = = = = 
 Built in 1483 with two octagonal and one cylindrical shafts , the Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies , supported by muqarnas , a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one ( first recorded to have been used in Egypt in 1085 ) , that adorn the minaret . The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel @-@ arched panels on each side , with a cluster of three columns separating each panel . Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting . A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft , decorated with four arches . Above this is the third balcony , crowned by the finial top of the minaret . 
 The minaret is believed to have been built in the area of an earlier , Fatimid @-@ era brick minaret that had itself been rebuilt several times . Contemporary accounts suggest that the Fatimid minaret had defects in its construction and needed to be rebuilt several times , including once under the direction of Sadr al @-@ Din al @-@ <unk> 'i al @-@ Dimashqi al @-@ Hanafi , the qadi al @-@ <unk> ( Chief Justice of the Highest Court ) during the rule of Sultan Baibars . Recorded to have been rebuilt again under Barquq in 1397 , the minaret began to lean at a dangerous angle and was rebuilt in 1414 by Taj al @-@ Din al @-@ <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> of Cairo , and again in 1432 . The Qaytbay minaret was built in its place as part of a reconstruction of the entrance to the mosque .

 The double finial minaret was built in 1509 by <unk> al @-@ Ghuri . Sitting on a square base , the first shaft is octagonal , and four sides have a decorative keel arch , separated from the adjacent sides with two columns . The second shaft , separated from the first by a fretted balconies supported by muqarnas , is also octagonal and decorated with blue faience . A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft . The third level is made up of two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts . Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial , with a balcony separating the finials from the shafts . 
 = = = Ottoman renovations and additions = = = 
 Several additions and restorations were made during Ottoman reign in Egypt , many of which were completed under the direction of Abd al @-@ Rahman Katkhuda who nearly doubled the size of the mosque . Three gates were added by Katkhuda , the Bab al @-@ Muzayinīn , which became the main entrance to the mosque , the Bab al @-@ <unk> , and the Bab al @-@ Sa <unk> . Several riwaqs were added , including one for the blind students of al @-@ Azhar , as well as refurbished during the Ottoman period . Katkhuda also added an additional prayer hall south of the original Fatimid hall , with an additional mihrab , doubling the total prayer area . 
 = = = = Bab al @-@ Muzayinīn = = = = 
 The Bab al @-@ Muzayinīn ( <unk> <unk> was built in 1753 . Credited to Katkhuda the gate has two doors , each surrounded by recessed arches . Two molded semi @-@ circular arches with <unk> decorated with trefoils stand above the doors . Above the arches is a frieze with panels of cypress trees , a common trait of Ottoman work . 
 A free @-@ standing minaret , built by Katkhuda , originally stood outside the gate . The minaret was demolished prior to the opening of al @-@ Azhar street by Tewfik Pasha during modernization efforts which took place throughout Cairo . 
 = = = Current layout and structure = = = 
 The present main entrance to the mosque is the Bab al @-@ Muzayinīn , which opens into the white marble @-@ paved courtyard at the opposite end of the main prayer hall . To the northeast of the Bab al @-@ Muzayinīn , the courtyard is flanked by the façade of the Madrasa al @-@ Aqbaghawiyya ; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the Madrasa al @-@ Taybarsiyya . Directly across the courtyard from the entrance to the Bab al @-@ Muzayinīn is the Bab al @-@ Gindi ( Gate of Qaytbay ) , built in 1495 , above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay . Through this gate lies the courtyard of the prayer hall . 
 The mihrab has recently been changed to a plain marble facing with gold patterns .

 = Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle = 
 The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle is a collection of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo @-@ Saxons . The original manuscript of the Chronicle was created late in the 9th century , probably in Wessex , during the reign of Alfred the Great . Multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across England , where they were independently updated . In one case , the Chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154 . 
 Nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part , though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version . The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred 's reign , while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116 . Almost all of the material in the Chronicle is in the form of annals , by year ; the earliest are dated at 60 BC ( the annals ' date for Caesar 's invasions of Britain ) , and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written , at which point contemporary records begin . These manuscripts collectively are known as the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . 
 The Chronicle is not unbiased : there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one @-@ sided versions of stories ; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other . Taken as a whole , however , the Chronicle is the single most important historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman conquest . Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere . In addition , the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language ; in particular , the later Peterborough text is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence . 
 Seven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments now reside in the British Library . The remaining two are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College , Cambridge . 
 = = Composition = = 
 All of the surviving manuscripts are copies , so it is not known for certain where or when the first version of the Chronicle was composed . It is generally agreed that the original version was written in the late 9th century by a scribe in Wessex . After the original Chronicle was compiled , copies were made and distributed to various monasteries . Additional copies were made , for further distribution or to replace lost manuscripts , and some copies were updated independently of each other . Some of these later copies are those that have survived . 
 The earliest extant manuscript , the Winchester Chronicle , was written by a single scribe up to the year 891 . The scribe wrote the year number , <unk> , in the margin of the next line ; subsequent material was written by other scribes . This appears to place the composition of the chronicle at no later than 892 ; further evidence is provided by Bishop Asser 's use of a version of the Chronicle in his work Life of King Alfred , known to have been composed in 893 . It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from the original Chronicle ; as a result , there is no proof that the Chronicle was compiled at Winchester . It is also difficult to fix the date of composition , but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign of Alfred the Great ( 871 – 99 ) , as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign , and encouraged the use of English as a written language . The Chronicle , as well as the distribution of copies to other centres of learning , may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced . 
 = = Surviving manuscripts = = 
 Of the nine surviving manuscripts , seven are written entirely in Old English ( also known as Anglo @-@ Saxon ) . One , known as the Bilingual Canterbury Epitome , is in Old English with a translation of each annal into Latin . Another , the Peterborough Chronicle , is in Old English except for the last entry , which is in early Middle English . The oldest ( Corp. Chris . MS 173 ) is known as the Winchester Chronicle or the Parker Chronicle ( after Matthew Parker , an Archbishop of Canterbury , who once owned it ) . Six of the manuscripts were printed in an 1861 edition for the Rolls Series by Benjamin Thorpe with the text laid out in columns labelled A to F. Following this convention , the three additional manuscripts are often called [ G ] , [ H ] and [ I ] . The surviving manuscripts are listed below . 
 = = Relationships between the manuscripts = = 
 The manuscripts are all thought to derive from a common original , but the connections between the texts are more complex than simple inheritance via copying . The diagram at right gives an overview of the relationships between the manuscripts . The following is a summary of the relationships that are known . 
 [ A2 ] was a copy of [ A ] , made in Winchester , probably between 1001 and 1013 . 
 [ B ] was used in the compilation of [ C ] at Abingdon , in the mid @-@ 11th century . However , the scribe for [ C ] also had access to another version , which has not survived . 
 [ D ] includes material from Bede 's Ecclesiastical History and from a set of 8th @-@ century Northumbrian annals and is thought to have been copied from a northern version that has not survived . 
 [ E ] has material that appears to derive from the same sources as [ D ] but does not include some additions that appear only in [ D ] , such as the Mercian Register . This manuscript was composed at the monastery in Peterborough , some time after a fire there in 1116 that probably destroyed their copy of the Chronicle ; [ E ] appears to have been created thereafter as a copy of a Kentish version , probably from Canterbury . 
 [ F ] appears to include material from the same Canterbury version that was used to create [ E ] . 
 Asser 's Life of King Alfred , which was written in 893 , includes a translation of the Chronicle 's entries from 849 to 887 . Only [ A ] , of surviving manuscripts , could have been in existence by 893 , but there are places where Asser departs from the text in [ A ] , so it is possible that Asser used a version that has not survived . 
 Æthelweard wrote a translation of the Chronicle into Latin in the late 10th century ; the version he used probably came from the same branch in the tree of relationships that [ A ] comes from . 
 Asser 's text agrees with [ A ] and with Æthelweard 's text in some places against the combined testimony of [ B ] , [ C ] , [ D ] and [ E ] , implying that there is a common ancestor for the latter four manuscripts . 
 At Abingdon , some time between 1120 and 1140 , an unknown author wrote a Latin chronicle known as the Annals of St Neots . This work includes material from a copy of the Chronicle , but it is very difficult to tell which version because the annalist was selective about his use of the material . It may have been a northern recension , or a Latin derivative of that recension . 
 All the manuscripts described above share a chronological error between the years 756 and 845 , but it is apparent that the composer of the Annals of St Neots was using a copy that did not have this error and which must have preceded them . Æthelweard 's copy did have the chronological error but it had not lost a whole sentence from annal 885 ; all the surviving manuscripts have lost this sentence . Hence the error and the missing sentence must have been introduced in separate copying steps , implying that none of the surviving manuscripts are closer than two removes from the original version .

 = = = The Winchester Chronicle = = = 
 [ A ] : The Winchester ( or Parker ) Chronicle is the oldest manuscript of the Chronicle that survives . It was begun at Old Minster , Winchester , towards the end of Alfred 's reign . The manuscript begins with a genealogy of Alfred , and the first chronicle entry is for the year 60 BC . The section containing the Chronicle takes up folios 1 – 32 . Unlike the other manuscripts , [ A ] is of early enough composition to show entries dating back to the late 9th century in the hands of different scribes as the entries were made . The first scribe 's hand is dateable to the late 9th or very early 10th century ; his entries cease in late 891 , and the following entries were made at intervals throughout the 10th century by several scribes . The eighth scribe wrote the annals for the years 925 – 955 , and was clearly at Winchester when he wrote them since he adds some material related to events there ; he also uses ceaster , or " city " , to mean Winchester . The manuscript becomes independent of the other recensions after the entry for 975 . The book , which also had a copy of the Laws of Alfred and Ine bound in after the entry for 924 , was transferred to Canterbury some time in the early 11th century , as evidenced by a list of books that Archbishop Parker gave to Corpus Christi . While at Canterbury , some interpolations were made ; this required some <unk> in the manuscript . The additional entries appear to have been taken from a version of the manuscript from which [ E ] descends . The last entry in the vernacular is for 1070 . After this comes the Latin Acta <unk> , which covers church events from 1070 – 1093 . This is followed by a list of popes and the Archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the pallium . The manuscript was acquired by Matthew Parker , Archbishop of Canterbury ( 1559 – 1575 ) and master of Corpus Christi College , Cambridge , following the dissolution of the monasteries , and bequeathed to the college on his death . It now forms part of the Parker Library . 
 = = = The Abingdon Chronicle I = = = 
 [ B ] The Abingdon Chronicle I was written by a single scribe in the second half of the 10th century . The Chronicle takes up folios 1 – 34 . It begins with an entry for 60 BC and ends with the entry for 977 . A manuscript that is now separate ( British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius <unk> , f . 178 ) was originally the introduction to this chronicle ; it contains a genealogy , as does [ A ] , but extends it to the late 10th century . [ B ] was at Abingdon in the mid @-@ 11th century , because it was used in the composition of [ C ] . Shortly after this it went to Canterbury , where interpolations and corrections were made . As with [ A ] , it ends with a list of popes and the archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the pallium . 
 = = = The Abingdon Chronicle II = = = 
 [ C ] includes additional material from local annals at Abingdon , where it was composed . The section containing the Chronicle ( folios 115 – 64 ) is preceded by King Alfred 's Old English translation of Orosius 's world history , followed by a <unk> and some gnomic verses of the laws of the natural world and of humanity . Then follows a copy of the chronicle , beginning with 60 BC ; the first scribe copied up to the entry for 490 , and a second scribe took over up to the entry for 1048 . [ B ] and [ C ] are identical between 491 and 652 , but differences thereafter make it clear that the second scribe was also using another copy of the Chronicle . This scribe also inserted , after the annal for 915 , the Mercian Register , which covers the years 902 – 924 , and which focuses on Æthelflæd . The manuscript continues to 1066 and stops in the middle of the description of the Battle of Stamford Bridge . In the 12th century a few lines were added to complete the account .
