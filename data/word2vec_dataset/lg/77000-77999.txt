 Quite heavy compared with other mushrooms of similar size , the stocky fruit body contains relatively high amounts of chitin . Holding the brawny bolete has been described as " having a stone in your hand " . The cap is 6 – 20 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 7 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter . <unk> when young , it extends and flattens into a convex and finally a flattish shape , sometimes forming a slight depression in the centre . Initially curled downward and inward , the cap margin gradually turns outward , eventually flattening in maturity , and sometimes protruding beyond the pored undersurface . The surface texture starts out slightly velvety , but becomes smoother and hairless with age ; in moist weather , the cap is slightly sticky . Changing over time , the colour of the cap is initially vivid yellow or golden yellow , then ochre , then darkening in age to brown . However , if the cap cuticle is bruised , or even touched , there are sudden changes in the colour that depend on the age of the mushroom : young , yellow caps become cherry @-@ red , while ochre @-@ brown cap tissue bruises to reddish @-@ purple . These colour changes soon give way to bluish or greyish tones , which , when combined , give the cap a variegated appearance . 
 The pores on the cap underside are round and small , the sulfur @-@ yellow colour of the pore surface becoming less intense with age . The squat stipe measures 6 – 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long by 3 – 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick . Egg @-@ shaped when young , it lengthens somewhat as the mushroom grows , but is still bulbous in maturity ; a mature stipe is typically a little shorter than the diameter of the cap . It is initially roughly the same colour as the cap , but as it matures , develops a wine @-@ red colouration near the base and a dirty brown to bluish @-@ black colouration elsewhere . The surface has a mesh @-@ like pattern ( reticulation ) that has a colour development similar to that of the cap : initially yellow , then purplish , and finally dark brown . The flesh is thick and hard . It is yellow , except for the stipe base where it is deep red , or dark brownish in older mushrooms . The pores , stipe and flesh turn greenish @-@ blue with bruising or cutting . The smell is unpleasant , but the taste is mild . 
 The spore print is olive @-@ brown . The smooth oval spores measure 12 – 15 by 5 – 6 μm , and sometimes have an internal oil drop . Basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 22 – 34 by 8 – 9 μm . The fusiform ( fuse @-@ shaped ) cystidia are colourless with oil droplets , and have dimensions of 40 – 50 by 7 – 8 μm . Cap cuticle tissue is in the form of a trichoderm , where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel , like hairs , perpendicular to the cap surface . These cylindrical , interwoven hyphae contain septa .

 The Mediterranean species Boletus <unk> somewhat resembles I. torosus , but can usually be distinguished by a smaller fruit body , a cylindrical stipe , and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms . Also , B. <unk> does not feature the colour change of the stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I. torosus . Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of the former are red and the flesh of latter has a bitter taste . 
 Several chemical tests can be used to distinguish I. torosus from other similar boletes , such as I. <unk> . I. torosus displays the following characteristic colour changes with tests performed on cut flesh less than 12 hours old : ammonium hydroxide ( NH4OH ) – yellow centre bordered by a blue circular outer ring ; potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) – deep buff ( instantly ) ; ferrous sulphate ( <unk> ) – no change ; Melzer 's reagent – dark blue ; phenol – blue green ( very slow ) ; formalin – mid blue ( slow ) .

 Like many boletes , Imperator torosus causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain , diarrhoea and vomiting when eaten raw . These reactions can also happen to some people when the mushroom is eaten cooked , though others have consumed it with no ill effects . In a 1994 study , researchers Ulrich <unk> and Hartmut Laatsch looked for the antabuse @-@ like compound coprine in Suillellus luridus and similar species that had been suspected of inducing antabuse @-@ like reactions with alcohol . <unk> ingestion results in heat and flushing in the face , tingling in arms and legs , nausea and vomiting , and increased heart rate within five to ten minutes of consuming alcohol . They found none in the suspect species , but did find indications for it in Imperator torosus . They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical poisoning incidents was a misidentification of I. torosus with Suillellus luridus , though they could not rule out the latter species containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol @-@ related reactions . No clinical cases of alcohol @-@ related sensitivity have been recorded for I. torosus .

 Imperator torosus is native to southern Europe east to the Caucasus and Israel . A mycorrhizal species , the fungus is generally associated with deciduous trees such as hornbeam ( Carpinus ) , oak ( Quercus ) and beech ( Fagus ) in warm , dry locales , and is generally rare in Europe . In the United Kingdom , it is listed as a " priority species " — a threatened species requiring conservation action under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan . Similarly , it is on the list of protected species of macrofungi in Montenegro . It appears to be relatively common in Hungary . It is found under Palestine oak ( Quercus <unk> ) in the Bar 'am forest in Upper Galilee . <unk> typically occur from July to September in calcareous ( chalky ) soil , with fruit bodies appearing either singly or in small groups .

 = = Early life and background = = 
 Born on 21 September 1980 in Bombay ( now Mumbai ) , Kapoor ( often informally referred to as ' Bebo ' ) is the younger daughter of Randhir Kapoor and <unk> ( née Shivdasani ) ; her elder sister Karisma is also an actress . She is the paternal granddaughter of actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor , maternal granddaughter of actor Hari Shivdasani , and niece of actor Rishi Kapoor . According to Kapoor , the name " Kareena " was derived from the book Anna Karenina , which her mother read while she was pregnant with her . She is of Punjabi descent on her father 's side , and on her mother 's side she is of Sindhi and British descent . As a child , Kapoor regularly practised Hinduism with her family , but was also exposed to Christianity from her mother . 
 Describing herself as a " very naughty [ and ] spoilt child " , Kapoor 's exposure to films from a young age kindled her interest in acting ; she was particularly inspired by the work of actresses Nargis and Meena Kumari . Despite her family background , her father disapproved of women entering films because he believed it conflicted with the traditional maternal duties and responsibility of women in the family . This led to a conflict between her parents , and they separated . She was then raised by her mother , who worked several jobs to support her daughters until Karisma debuted as an actress in 1991 . After living separately for several years , her parents reconciled in October 2007 . Kapoor remarked " My father is also an important factor in my life [ ... ] [ Al ] though we did not see him often in our initial years , we are a family now . " 
 Kapoor attended <unk> Narsee School in Mumbai , followed by Welham Girls ' School in Dehradun . She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother , though later admitted to liking the experience . According to Kapoor , she wasn 't inclined towards academics though received good grades in all her classes except mathematics . After graduating from Welham she studied commerce for two years at Mithibai College in Vile Parle ( Mumbai ) . Kapoor then registered for a three @-@ month summer course in microcomputers at Harvard University in the United States . She later developed an interest in law , and enrolled at the Government Law College , Mumbai ; during this period , she developed a long @-@ lasting passion for reading . However , after completing her first year , Kapoor decided to pursue her interest to become an actress . She began training at an acting institute in Mumbai mentored by Kishore <unk> Kapoor , a member of the Film and Television Institute of India ( FTII ) .

 While training at the institute , Kapoor was cast as the female lead in Rakesh Roshan 's Kaho Naa ... Pyaar Hai ( 2000 ) opposite his son , Hrithik Roshan . Several days into the filming , however , she abandoned the project ; Kapoor later explained that she had benefited by not doing the film since more prominence was given to the director 's son . She debuted later that year alongside Abhishek Bachchan in J. P. Dutta 's war drama Refugee . Set during the Indo @-@ Pakistani war of 1971 , the film centers on a man who illegally transports civilians back and forth across the border . Kapoor portrayed <unk> , a Bangladeshi girl who falls in love with Bachchan 's character while illegally migrating to Pakistan with her family . Her performance was acclaimed by critics ; Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama described her as " a natural performer " and noted " the ease with which she emotes the most difficult of scenes " , while India Today reported that Kapoor belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors that breaks away from character stereotypes . On the experience of acting in her first film , Kapoor described it as " tough ... [ but ] also a great learning experience " . Refugee was a moderate box @-@ office success in India and Kapoor 's performance earned her the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut . 
 For her second release , Kapoor was paired opposite Tusshar Kapoor in Satish Kaushik 's box @-@ office hit Mujhe <unk> Kehna Hai ( 2001 ) . A review in The Hindu noted that based on her first two films , she was " definitely the actress to watch out for " . She next starred alongside Jackie Shroff and Hrithik Roshan in Subhash Ghai 's flop <unk> , followed by Abbas @-@ Mustan 's moderately successful thriller <unk> , co @-@ starring Akshay Kumar , Bobby Deol and Bipasha Basu . Later that year , she appeared in Santosh Sivan 's period epic Aśoka , a partly fictionalized account of the life of the Indian emperor of the same name . Featured opposite Shah Rukh Khan , Kapoor found herself challenged playing the complex personality of her character <unk> ( a <unk> princess ) with whom Ashoka falls in love . Aśoka was screened at the Venice and 2001 Toronto International Film Festivals , and received generally positive reviews internationally but failed to do well in India , which was attributed by critics to the way Ashoka was portrayed . Jeff Vice of The Deseret News described Kapoor as " riveting " and commended her screen presence . Rediff.com , however , was more critical concluding that her presence in the film was primarily used for aesthetic purposes . At the 47th Filmfare Awards , Aśoka was nominated for five awards including a Best Actress nomination for Kapoor . 
 A key point in Kapoor 's career came when she was cast by Karan Johar as Pooja ( " Poo " , a good @-@ natured , superficial girl ) in the 2001 melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham ... alongside an ensemble cast . Filming the big @-@ budget production was a new experience for Kapoor , and she recalls it fondly : " [ I ] t was great fun doing [ the film and ] we had a blast . [ W ] <unk> with the unit and the six mega star set was a dream come true . " Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham ... was an immensely popular release , finishing as India 's second highest @-@ grossing film of the year and Kapoor 's highest @-@ grossing film to that point . It also became one of the biggest Bollywood success of all time in the overseas market , earning over ₹ 1 billion ( US $ 15 million ) worldwide . Taran Adarsh described Kapoor as " one of the main highlights of the film " , and she received her second Filmfare nomination for the role — her first for Best Supporting Actress — as well as nominations at the International Indian Academy ( IIFA ) and Screen Awards . 
 Box Office India reported that the success of Mujhe <unk> Kehna Hai and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham ... established Kapoor as a leading actress of Hindi cinema , and Rediff.com published that with Aśoka she had become the highest @-@ paid Indian actress to that point earning ₹ 15 million ( US $ 220 @,@ 000 ) per film . During 2002 and 2003 , Kapoor continued to work in a number of projects but experienced a setback . All six films in which she starred — Mujhse Dosti Karoge ! , <unk> <unk> <unk> Liye , Talaash : The Hunt Begins ... , Khushi , Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon , and the four @-@ hour war epic LOC Kargil — were critically and commercially unsuccessful . Critics described her performances in these films as " variations of the same character " she played in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham ... , and expressed concern that she was becoming typecast .

 By 2004 , Kapoor was keen on broadening her range as an actress and thus decided to portray more challenging roles . Under the direction of Sudhir Mishra , Kapoor played the role of a golden @-@ hearted prostitute in Chameli , a film relating the story of a young prostitute who meets with a widowed investment banker ( played by Rahul Bose ) . When Kapoor was initially offered the film she refused it , explaining that she would be uncomfortable in the role . She relented when Mishra approached her for the second time , and in preparation for the role , visited several of Mumbai 's red @-@ light districts at night to study the mannerisms of sex workers and the way they dressed . Chameli was well received by critics and the film marked a significant turning point in her career , earning Kapoor a special jury recognition at the 49th Filmfare Awards . Indiatimes praised her " intuitive brilliance " and stated that she had exceeded all expectations . Rediff.com , however , found her portrayal unconvincing and excessively stereotypical , describing her as " sounding more like a teenager playacting than a brash , hardened streetwalker " and comparing her mannerisms to a caricature . 
 Kapoor next co @-@ starred in Mani Ratnam 's bilingual project Yuva alongside Ajay Devgan , Abhishek Bachchan , Vivek Oberoi , Rani Mukerji and Esha Deol . The film , consisting of three chapters , tells the story of six individuals linked by a car accident . Kapoor is featured in the third chapter as Oberoi 's love interest ( Mira , a witty young woman ) . In a Times of India review film critic Subhash K. Jha described her role as " fey and insubstantial " , but further stated that " she turns these character traits to her own advantage to create a girl who is at once enigmatic and all @-@ there " . She then appeared alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Fardeen Khan in Govind Nihalani 's critically acclaimed film Dev , which revolved around the 2002 Hindu @-@ Muslim riots in the Indian state of Gujarat . Kapoor 's role was that of a Muslim victim named <unk> , modelled after <unk> Sheikh ( a key witness in Vadodara 's Best Bakery case ) . It earned her a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and nominations for Best Actress at various award ceremonies . Taran Adarsh described her as " first @-@ rate " and in particular noted her scene with Bachchan 's character . 
 Shortly afterwards , Kapoor was cast for the first time as a villain in the thriller Fida . Set against the backdrop of the Mumbai underworld , the film follows the story of an online heist in which her character , Neha Mehra , becomes involved . Although the film was unsuccessful at the box office , Kapoor received positive reviews for her performance , and some critics noted a distinct progression from her earlier roles . Her subsequent releases that year included Abbas @-@ Mustan 's thriller Aitraaz and Priyadarshan 's comedy <unk> , both of which were successful at the Indian box office . Following the success of her last two releases , she was cast as the protagonist of the 2005 drama Bewafaa . The feature received mostly negative reviews , and Kapoor 's portrayal of Anjali Sahai ( an unfaithful woman ) was not well received . Nikhat Kazmi of Indiatimes believed that to become a serious actress Kapoor was embodying a maturer , more @-@ jaded character beyond her years in Bewafaa . That same year , she starred in the romantic dramas <unk> Ki and Dosti : Friends Forever , both of which underperformed at the box office ; however , Kapoor 's performance in <unk> Ki was generally well received by critics ( with the BBC describing her as " a pure natural " ) . 
 In 2006 , Kapoor appeared in three films . She first starred in the thriller 36 China Town , followed by the comedy Chup Chup Ke ; both were moderately successful . She next portrayed the character of Desdemona in Omkara — the Hindi adaptation of William Shakespeare 's Othello . The film ( directed by Vishal Bhardwaj ) is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set against the backdrop of the political system in Uttar Pradesh . Describing Bhardwaj as a " world @-@ class director [ with ] a unique style " , Kapoor was cast in the project after the director had seen her performance in Yuva , and was subsequently required to attend script @-@ reading sessions along with the entire cast . The feature premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was screened at the Cairo International Film Festival . Omkara was received positively by critics , and Kapoor 's portrayal earned her a fourth Filmfare Award and first Screen Award . In a 2010 retrospective of the " Top 80 Iconic Performances " of Hindi cinema , Filmfare wrote that she was " brilliant " and praised her ability to " effortless [ ly ] " convey the various emotions her character went through . Kapoor considered her role in Omkara as a " new benchmark " in her career , and compared her portrayal of Dolly with her own evolving maturity as a woman . 
 Following Omkara , Kapoor took a short break from acting , as she felt that " nothing [ was ] challenging enough for me to say yes " . In an interview with The Times of India Kapoor commented , " In my initial years in the industry , I pushed myself to do a lot of work because I was greedy . I did some films — which I now regret — purely for the money . Today , I want to do selective films . " Later that year , she appeared briefly in one of the year 's biggest hits , the Farhan Akhtar action @-@ thriller Don ( a remake of the 1978 film of the same name ) .

 Kapoor returned to film as the female protagonist Geet Dhillon , a vivacious Sikh girl with a zest for life , in the romantic comedy Jab We Met ( 2007 ) . Director Imtiaz Ali was not a well @-@ known figure before its production , with only one feature credit to his name , but Kapoor agreed to the film after being impressed with his " mind @-@ blowing " script . Featured opposite Shahid Kapoor , the film relates the story of two people with contrasting personalities who meet on a train and eventually fall in love . The film was received favourably by critics and became successful at the box office with gross earnings of ₹ 303 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 5 million ) . Kapoor won several awards for her performance , including her second Screen Award and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress . Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC commented that the role required a mixture of naivety and spontaneity , and was impressed with Kapoor 's effort . The critic Rajeev Masand labelled her the film 's " biggest strength , as she brings alive her character with not just those smart lines , but with the kind of candor actors seldom invest in their work . " While shooting for Jab We Met , Kapoor and Shahid ended their three @-@ year relationship . When asked by Mumbai Mirror , she stated " I hold him in utmost regard , and I hope one day we could be good friends . He is a great guy . " 
 The following year , Kapoor co @-@ starred in Vijay Krishna Acharya 's action @-@ thriller <unk> , where she met her future husband in actor Saif Ali Khan . Although a poll ( conducted by Bollywood Hungama ) named it the most anticipated release of the year , the film underperformed at the box office grossing ₹ 279 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 1 million ) in India . After providing her voice for the character of Laila , the love interest of a street dog named Romeo , in the Yash Raj Films and Walt Disney Pictures animated film Roadside Romeo , Kapoor played a mistrustful wife who believed her husband was unfaithful in Rohit Shetty 's comedy Golmaal Returns . A sequel to the 2006 film Golmaal : Fun Unlimited , the film had an ambivalent reception from critics , and Kapoor received mixed reviews . The Indian Express believed the screenplay was derivative , concluding : " There is nothing particularly new about a suspicious wife keeping tabs on her husband , and there is nothing particularly new in the way Kareena plays it . " Golmaal Returns was a financial success with global revenues of ₹ 793 million ( US $ 12 million ) . 
 In 2009 , Kapoor was cast as <unk> Rai ( a surgeon who moonlights as a model ) in <unk> Khan 's battle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ sexes comedy <unk> Ishq , opposite Akshay Kumar . Set in Los Angeles , it was the first Indian film to be shot at Universal Studios and featured cameo appearances by Hollywood actors . The film was poorly received by critics but became an economic success , earning over ₹ 840 million ( US $ 12 million ) worldwide ; a review in Times of India described Kapoor 's performance as " a complete let @-@ down " and " unconvincing " . The box @-@ office flop Main <unk> Mrs Khanna came next , following which she played the leading lady in the dramatic thriller Kurbaan , alongside Saif Ali Khan and Vivek Oberoi . The film ( which marked the directorial debut of Rensil D 'Silva ) featured Kapoor as <unk> Ahuja , a woman who is confined to house arrest after discovering that her husband is a terrorist . Describing the film as " an emotionally draining experience " , Kapoor explained that it was difficult to disconnect from her character . The film was critically praised , and Kapoor received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination . Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times commented that after a long time the actress was given " a role of substance that brings her performing potential to the fore " , while Subhash K. Jha described it as her " most consistently pitched performance to date " played " with splendid sensitivity " and " <unk> [ <unk> ] " . 
 Kapoor 's second Filmfare nomination that year came for Rajkumar Hirani 's National Film Award @-@ winning 3 Idiots , a film loosely based on the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat . Co @-@ starring alongside Aamir Khan , R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi , Kapoor played Pia ( a medical student and Khan 's love interest ) . Several actresses were considered for the role , though Kapoor was eventually cast under the recommendation of Khan . The film received critical acclaim and emerged as the highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of all time up until then , grossing ₹ 2 @.@ 03 billion ( US $ 30 million ) in India . It also did well internationally , earning over ₹ 1 @.@ 08 billion ( US $ 16 million ) , the second biggest Bollywood success ever in the overseas market . The Deccan Herald opined that Kapoor " brings a dollop of sunshine and feminine grace to an otherwise masculine tale . She is so spunky and spontaneous you wish there was room for more of her . " 3 Idiots received several Best Movie recognitions at major Indian award functions , and Kapoor was awarded the IIFA Award for Best Actress , among others . 
 In 2010 , Kapoor appeared in the romantic comedy Milenge Milenge , a production delayed since 2005 . The feature garnered negative reviews and poor box @-@ office returns . Kapoor 's role was small , and not well received . She next starred alongside Kajol and Arjun Rampal in We Are Family , an official adaptation of the Hollywood tearjerker <unk> ( 1998 ) from director Siddharth Malhotra . Kapoor played the role of the career @-@ oriented Shreya Arora ( a character originally played by Julia Roberts ) and refrained from watching the film again so she could bring her own interpretation to it . Priyanka Roy of The Telegraph criticized the film for being " superficial and unnecessarily melodramatic " , but praised Kapoor for " breath [ ing ] life and a new @-@ found maturity into what is largely a uni @-@ dimensional character " . We Are Family emerged a moderate success and Kapoor was awarded the Best Supporting Actress at the 56th Filmfare Awards . At the end of the year , she reunited with director Rohit Shetty for Golmaal 3 , a sequel to Golmaal Returns . Like its predecessor , the film received mixed reviews though emerged as the most successful entry in the Golmaal series , earning more than ₹ 1 billion ( US $ 15 million ) domestically . For her portrayal of the tomboy Daboo , Kapoor received Best Actress nominations at various award ceremonies including Filmfare . 
 Kapoor had further success in 2011 as the love interest of Salman Khan 's character in the romantic drama Bodyguard , a remake of the 2010 Malayalam film of the same name . The film was not well received by critics , though became a financial success , with a domestic total of ₹ 1 @.@ 4 billion ( US $ 21 million ) — India 's highest @-@ earning film of the year . A review in Mint dismissed Kapoor 's role as the " sacrificial , ornamental [ and ] submissive female " ; Mid Day referred to her as " bright " , arguing that she " actually manages to bring her caricature of a role alive " . She next appeared in Anubhav Sinha 's science fiction film Ra.One with Shah Rukh Khan and Arjun Rampal . Made on a budget of ₹ 1 @.@ 5 billion ( US $ 22 million ) — " India 's most expensive film " at the time — the film follows the story of a London @-@ based videogame designer creating a villainous character who escapes into the real world . Despite negative media coverage of the film 's box office performance , Ra.One became one of the biggest earners of the year with a worldwide total of over ₹ 2 @.@ 4 billion ( US $ 36 million ) , and Kapoor 's fourth major commercial success in two consecutive years .

 Kapoor followed her success in Bodyguard and Ra.One with a role in Shakun Batra 's directorial debut Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu ( 2012 ) opposite Imran Khan . Set in Las Vegas , the romantic comedy follows the story of two strangers who get married one night after getting drunk . She played Riana Braganza , a carefree young woman , and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character : " Riana knows what she is doing . Even though she does not have a house or a job , she is a positive person [ ... ] very similar to the way I am . " The film received positive reviews and was an economic success , grossing a total of ₹ 530 million ( US $ 7 @.@ 9 million ) in India and abroad . The Hollywood Reporter found her " endearingly natural " ; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com asserted that " after doing ornamental roles in films like Bodyguard and Ra.One , it is nice to see the spunky actress in her element again since Jab We Met . " She next appeared in Agent Vinod , an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan . Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project , but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast . When asked why she had taken the role , Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before . 
 For her next feature , Kapoor was cast as the protagonist of Madhur Bhandarkar 's Heroine , a drama revolving around the Bollywood film industry . Originally the first choice for the role , Kapoor was hesitant to take on the project when Bhandarkar approached her with the film 's initial concept . With reservations about the criticism her character might evoke , she was replaced by Aishwarya Rai . Days after production began , Rai left the film ( due to her pregnancy ) and Bhandarkar re @-@ approached Kapoor with the film . When the director reinforced his faith in her , she agreed to do the film after having read the completed script . Kapoor ( who described her character of Mahi Arora — a fading star — as " bipolar and schizophrenic " ) refrained from taking on any other projects , since she found Heroine " very aggressive and tiring " . Reviewers found the film to be " drably monotonous " , but noted that it was watchable primarily due to Kapoor 's performance . Rajeev Masand described it as " a deliciously camp performance , " played " with utmost sincerity " . Bollywood Hungama opined that it was her best work to date and concluded that " [ t ] hough her character is inconsistent [ ... ] Kareena furnishes the heroine 's character with a rare vulnerability and an exceptional inner life . " At the annual Stardust Awards , Kapoor garnered the Editor 's Choice for Best Actress , and received additional nominations at Filmfare , IIFA , Producers Guild , Screen and Stardust . 
 On 16 October 2012 , Kapoor married actor Saif Ali Khan in a private ceremony in Bandra , Mumbai , and a reception was later held at The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Lutyens Bungalow Zone in Mumbai and Delhi respectively . Kapoor stated that despite adding Khan to her name she would continue practising Hinduism after her marriage . At the end of the year , she co @-@ starred alongside Aamir Khan and Rani Mukerji as the " tantalisingly seductive prostitute " Rosie , in Reema Kagti 's crime mystery Talaash : The Answer Lies Within . Set against the backdrop of Mumbai 's red @-@ light districts , it follows the travails of its personnel and principal , Inspector Surjan Singh <unk> ( Khan ) who is assigned the duty of solving a mysterious car accident . Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph found Kapoor to be a standout among the ensemble , adding that " she brings an unseen mix of oomph and emotion that becomes the [ film 's ] centrepiece " . With global revenues of ₹ 1 @.@ 74 billion ( US $ 26 million ) , the film emerged as a box office hit , and earned Kapoor Best Actress nominations at the Screen , Stardust and Zee Cine award ceremonies . 
 In 2013 , Kapoor collaborated with Ajay Devgan for the fourth time ( alongside Amitabh Bachchan , Arjun Rampal , Manoj Bajpayee and Amrita Rao ) in Prakash Jha 's Satyagraha , an ensemble socio @-@ political drama loosely inspired by social activist Anna Hazare 's fight against corruption in 2011 . The film was highly anticipated by trade journalists due to its release coinciding with the Mumbai and Delhi gang rape public protests , and Kapoor hoped that the film would help inspire people to stop violence against women in India . Satyagraha received little praise from critics and underperformed at the box office earning ₹ 675 million ( US $ 10 million ) domestically . A review in the Daily News and Analysis noted that Kapoor 's role as reporter Yasmin Ahmed was " limited to mouthing a few ' important ' dialogues and being present in crucial scenes like any leading lady " . 
 Following an appearance in the poorly received romantic comedy Gori Tere Pyaar Mein ( 2013 ) , Kapoor decreased her workload for the next two years to focus on her marriage and family . She took on smaller parts where she played the love @-@ interest of Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan in the dramas Singham Returns ( 2014 ) and Bajrangi Bhaijaan ( 2015 ) respectively . Singham Returns served as a sequel to the 2011 film Singham and Kapoor 's role was written specifically for her by Rohit Shetty — the third time the pair collaborated . Reviews for the film were generally mixed with Kapoor being criticized for taking a role of minimal importance , but the film was a financial success with a revenue of over ₹ 1 @.@ 4 billion ( US $ 21 million ) . Kabir Khan 's Bajrangi Bhaijaan emerged as India 's highest @-@ earning film of the year grossing a total of ₹ 3 @.@ 20 billion ( US $ 48 million ) , and earned the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 63rd National Film Awards .

 The following year , Kapoor took on a starring role opposite Arjun Kapoor in Ki & Ka , a romantic comedy about gender stereotypes from the writer @-@ director R. Balki . She was cast as the ambitious and career @-@ oriented Kia , and was particularly drawn to the project for its relevance and novel concept . Upon release , critics were divided in their opinion of the film , but with a worldwide gross of over ₹ 1 billion ( US $ 15 million ) the film was a financial success . Meena Iyer of The Times of India mentioned Kapoor as " terrific " and Sukanya Verma considered the actress to be the film 's prime asset noting her ease at " smoothly transition [ ing ] between fragile and volatile to reveal a woman comfortable in her own skin , unapologetic about living life on her terms and never missing an occasion to mince words .

 Kapoor next played the role of Dr. Preet Sahni in Abhishek Chaubey 's critically acclaimed Udta Punjab ( 2016 ) , a crime drama that documents the substance abuse endemic in the Indian state of Punjab . Co @-@ starring alongside Shahid Kapoor , Alia Bhatt and <unk> Dosanjh , Kapoor was initially reluctant to do the film due to the length of her role , but agreed after having read the completed script and waived half of her fees to star in it . Udta Punjab generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification deemed that the film represented Punjab in a negative light and demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release . The Bombay High Court later cleared the film for exhibition with one scene cut . In a highly positive review , Rediff.com stated that despite being " the narrative ’ s most conventional character , " the film " greatly relies on [ her ] for warmth and virtue " and Mehul S.

 Known for her nonchalant relationship with the media , Kapoor has gained a reputation for discussing her private life with no reservations . As a child she regularly attended award ceremonies and events with her family , and would also accompany Karisma on @-@ set during filming . In an interview with Filmfare , she explained that growing up in a film family helped her develop a sense of professionalism and dedication towards her craft . Kapoor 's private life has been the subject of media attention in India , with frequent press coverage of her weight and relationship with actor Saif Ali Khan . The couple — dubbed " <unk> " by the entertainment media — has been one of the country 's most @-@ reported celebrity stories since 2007 . In July 2016 , Khan confirmed to the media that they were expecting their first child , due in December 2016 . 
 While a segment of the press has described Kapoor as friendly and extremely close to her family , others have criticized her for being arrogant and vain — an image she gained in the wake of her superficial character , Poo , in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham ... ( 2001 ) . She subsequently featured in films portraying similar characters , and this further established her off- and on @-@ screen personae . Before the release of Chameli ( 2004 ) ( in which she played a sex worker ) , Kapoor stated that " there is a certain image that people identify you with [ and ] [ i ] t always follows you whichever role you play . I am trying to transgress this image and become more screen @-@ friendly than image @-@ friendly . " Chameli helped Kapoor reinvent her on @-@ screen persona , and she later explained that her honesty and openness was often perceived by the media as arrogance . 
 Kapoor is also known for her assertive and moody nature , and her outspoken views and independence have been singled out for making major contributions to her career ; they " add to her superstar aura " . In an early interview , she confessed to being an " introvert , yet [ ... ] extremely candid and blunt " , reasoning : " Total faith and complete belief in myself is my attitude towards life , films and virtually everything else . I am all about doing what I feel is right . It is not easy to pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions . " Journalist Subhash K Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities , it " makes her such a favourite among the generation that believes in self regard being the highest form of creativity [ ... ] She lives for the moment and crams all her intensity into it , not sparing a single thought for what is gone and what is waiting around the corner . " Meanwhile , Anu Ahuja suggested that Kapoor 's demeanour is an act ; she is " cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her " . 
 Today , Kapoor is considered as one of the most popular Bollywood celebrities in India . Her look and performances have established her as a style icon for young women . In a 2009 poll conducted by the newspaper Daily News and Analysis Kapoor was voted one of India 's most popular icons ; with her partner Saif Ali Khan , she was listed amongst the top celebrity endorsers for brands and products worldwide . She became the only Indian actress to be featured on <unk> 's list of " Who <unk> Most in India " , and was later selected by Verve for its list of the country 's most powerful women from 2008 to 2013 .

She ranked among the top 25 each year , peaking at the seventh position in 2012 with an estimated annual earning of ₹ 735 million ( US $ 11 million ) .

 According to media reports , Kapoor relies on her instincts and spontaneity as an actor . She is known to commit heavily to each role , and refrains from rehearsing for a project . Commenting on this , director Rajkumar Hirani said " I usually have a habit of conducting rehearsals for my actors , but she insisted on not having them as it would affect her spontaneity . She really surprised me with a couple of emotional scenes which we canned in just one take . " Karan Johar described Kapoor as a " natural " , explaining that " she has no craft , grammar or process attached to her acting [ ... ] It is a great sense of cinema that can keep her going . " According to Rensil D 'Silva ( who directed her in Kurbaan ) , " Kareena [ .. ] is instinctive and has emotional intelligence . She absorbs the situation and performs accordingly . Discussing the scene , in fact , harms her . " 
 While discussing her career highlights in a 2010 article , Rediff.com noted : " [ E ] ven though a lot of her starring roles have been forgettable , [ a ] look at her filmography now , however , would show a more thoughtful selection of roles [ ... ] playing to her strengths . " Her portrayal of a series of superficial characters at the start of her career were criticized ; film historian Gyan Prakash explained that these roles " tended to <unk> her , packaging her as daddy 's little girl , all bubble and no fizz " . Critics noted Chameli ( 2004 ) as her coming of age , claiming that " a new actor in her was discovered " . Following her portrayal of a variety of character types in Chameli , Dev ( 2004 ) , Omkara ( 2006 ) and Jab We Met ( 2007 ) , Kapoor was noted for her versatility . In 2010 , Filmfare Magazine included two of her performances — from Omkara and Jab We Met — in its list of " 80 Iconic Performances " . India Today labelled her " the most versatile female lead in the industry " , noting that she " play [ s ] her roles with trademark spunk " . 
 Manjula Sen of The Telegraph wrote that although she has " the worst success ratio among her contemporaries " , it does not affect her marketability . Sen further explained that Kapoor 's strength lies in her being versatile ; she is " effortlessly honest in her performances . It is a candour that spills over in her personal conduct . " Writing for CNN @-@ News18 , Rituparna Chatterjee spoke of her transformation to date : " [ A ] fter 40 films and 10 years of fighting off competition from some of the most versatile actors of her generation , Kareena has matured into a bankable actor reinventing herself with surprising ease . " In 2004 , Kapoor placed third on Rediff 's list of " Top Bollywood Female Stars " . She was later ranked seventh and fifth in 2005 and 2006 , respectively , and returned to third place in 2007 . In January 2011 , Kapoor placed fourth on Rediff 's list of " Top 10 Actresses of 2000 – 2010 " .

 = SS Pennsylvanian = 
 SS Pennsylvanian was a cargo ship built in 1913 for the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company . During World War I she was requisitioned by the United States Navy and commissioned as USS Pennsylvanian ( ID @-@ 3511 ) in September 1918 , and renamed two months later to USS Scranton . After her naval service , her original name of Pennsylvanian was restored . 
 Pennsylvanian was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company , and was employed in inter @-@ coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened . Pennsylvanian was one of the first two steamships to travel eastbound through the canal when it opened in August 1914 . During World War I , as both SS Pennsylvanian and USS Scranton , the ship carried cargo and animals to France , and returned American troops after the Armistice in 1918 . 
 After her naval service ended in 1919 , she was returned to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years . Early in World War II , the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration , and shipped cargo on New York – Caribbean routes and transatlantic routes . In mid @-@ July 1944 , Pennsylvanian was scuttled as part of the breakwater for one of the Mulberry artificial harbors built to support the Normandy Invasion . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 In September 1911 , the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point , Maryland , for four new cargo ships — Minnesotan , Dakotan , Montanan , and Pennsylvanian . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8 % profit for Maryland Steel , with a maximum cost of $ 640 @,@ 000 each . The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5 % down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance . Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer @-@ term notes or mortgages . The final cost of Pennsylvanian , including financing costs , was $ 70 @.@ 35 per deadweight ton , which came out to just under $ 716 @,@ 000 . 
 Pennsylvanian ( Maryland Steel yard no . 127 ) was the final ship built under the original contract . She was launched on 29 March 1913 , and delivered to American @-@ Hawaiian in June . Pennsylvanian was 6 @,@ 547 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 429 feet 2 inches ( 130 @.@ 81 m ) in length and 53 feet 6 inches ( 16 @.@ 31 m ) abeam . She had a deadweight tonnage of 10 @,@ 175 LT DWT and a storage capacity of 491 @,@ 084 cubic feet ( 13 @,@ 906 @.@ 0 m3 ) . Pennsylvanian had a single quadruple expansion steam engine powered by oil @-@ fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller . It could propel the ship at a speed of 15 knots ( 28 km / h ) . The engine had cylinders of 25 ½ inches ( 65 cm ) , 37 inches ( 94 cm ) , 53 ½ inches ( 136 cm ) and 78 inches ( 200 cm ) diameter by 54 inches ( 140 cm ) stroke . It was built by the Maryland Steel Company , Sparrows Point , Maryland . 
 = = Early career = = 
 When Pennsylvanian began sailing for American @-@ Hawaiian , the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii , and vice versa . Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports — Salina Cruz , Oaxaca , for eastbound cargo , and Coatzacoalcos for westbound cargo — and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway . Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii , while westbound cargoes were more general in nature . Pennsylvanian sailed in this service on the west side of North America . 
 After the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 ( which found six American @-@ Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports ) , the Huerta @-@ led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping . This loss of access , coupled with the fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open , caused American @-@ Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan . With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August , American @-@ Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route . Pennsylvanian , on the west side of the canal when it opened , was one of the first two eastbound steamers to traverse the canal during her trip to New York . In late August , American @-@ Hawaiian announced that Pennsylvanian would sail on a San Francisco – Panama Canal – Boston route , sailing opposite of Mexican , Honolulan , and sister ship Washingtonian . When landslides closed the canal in October 1915 , all American @-@ Hawaiian ships , including Pennsylvanian , returned to the Straits of Magellan route again . 
 Pennsylvanian 's exact movements during 1916 and 1917 are unclear . She may have been in the half of the American @-@ Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service . She may also have been in the group of American @-@ Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America , delivering coal , gasoline , and steel in exchange for coffee , nitrates , cocoa , rubber , and manganese ore . However , when the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , the entire American @-@ Hawaiian fleet , including Pennsylvanian , was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) , which then returned the ships for operation by American @-@ Hawaiian . 
 = = U.S. Navy service = = 
 On 13 September 1918 , Pennsylvanian was transferred to the U.S. Navy at New York and commissioned USS Pennsylvanian ( ID @-@ 3511 ) the same day . Assigned to the Navy 's Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) , Pennsylvanian loaded a general cargo and sailed for Brest , France , on 30 September . She arrived there on 15 October and sailed for La Pallice the next day , where she unloaded her cargo before departing for New York on 5 November . 
 Arriving at New York on 15 November , four days after the Armistice , Pennsylvanian was refitted as an animal transport ship , which , among other things , required the building of ramps and stalls for the animals . Sometime in November , probably during her refit , she was renamed USS Scranton , becoming the first U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the Pennsylvania city . Scranton sailed for France on 12 December , arriving at Saint @-@ Nazaire on 29 December , and returning to New York on 29 January 1919 . 
 On 5 February , Scranton was transferred from the NOTS to the Navy 's Cruiser and Transport Force , and began conversion to a troop transport to carry American personnel home from France . While sailing to France to begin her first troop @-@ carrying duties in late March , Scranton suffered damage to her rudder and was disabled 900 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 700 km ) east of New York . Navy transport El Sol responded to Scranton 's distress call , and attempted to take Scranton under tow . During the day on 28 March , Scranton attempted to run a towline to El Sol by sending a launch in the rolling seas , but it capsized , drowning three men . El Sol stood by Scranton for over 40 hours until minesweeper Penguin arrived and took Scranton under tow . Penguin and Scranton arrived in New York on 3 April , where Scranton entered drydock to undergo repairs . 
 After repairs , Scranton made three roundtrips to France and carried some 6 @,@ 000 troops and passengers home to the United States before she was decommissioned on 19 July . The ship was handed over to the USSB for return to American @-@ Hawaiian , who restored her original name .

 Pennsylvanian resumed cargo service with American @-@ Hawaiian after her return from World War I service . Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time , Pennsylvanian continued inter @-@ coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful career . One incident of note occurred on 28 November 1930 , when Pennsylvanian hit a Southern Pacific ferry near Goat Island ( present @-@ day Yerba Buena Island ) in a dense fog in San Francisco Bay . Pennsylvanian hit the stern of the ferry and caused damage to the ferry 's superstructure and destroyed about 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) of the ferry 's railing . No one on either ship was injured . 
 Other hints of Pennsylvanian 's activities throughout the rest of her career can be found from contemporary newspaper reports . In October 1929 , the Los Angeles Times reported on a shipment that included 2 @,@ 500 to 3 @,@ 000 radio sets among Pennsylvanian 's 2 @,@ 300 long tons ( 2 @,@ 340 t ) of cargo . In March 1938 , The Christian Science Monitor reported that Pennsylvanian 's captain , C.

He expected to have the boat finished when Pennsylvanian arrived in Boston on 22 April . 
 In October the same year , Pennsylvanian delivered 325 long tons ( 330 t ) of steel parts for the Hale Telescope then under construction at the Palomar Observatory outside San Diego . The ship had picked up the $ 375 @,@ 000 cargo in Philadelphia before sailing for San Diego .

 At some point after the United States entered World War II , Pennsylvanian was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration ( WSA ) , and , as with her pre @-@ U.S. Navy service in World War I , she continued to be operated by American @-@ Hawaiian . From July to September 1942 , Pennsylvanian sailed between New York and Caribbean ports , calling at Trinidad , Key West , Hampton Roads , Guantánamo Bay , and Cristóbal . In January 1943 , Pennsylvanian called at Bandar Abbas , Iran , on the Persian Gulf , and returned to Caribbean sailings again by March 1943 . 
 Between May and September 1943 , Pennsylvanian made four transatlantic crossings between New York and Liverpool , making intermediate stops in Loch Ewe and Methil while in the United Kingdom . The cargo ship made two New York – Guantánamo Bay roundtrips between September and December before resuming transatlantic sailings . After two New York – Liverpool roundtrips between late December 1943 and April 1944 , Pennsylvanian left the United States for the final time on 19 May 1944 , arriving in Liverpool on 2 June . She called at the British ports of Methil , Loch Ewe , Clyde , and Milford Haven in late June and early July , and , sailing from Barry in mid July , Pennsylvanian arrived at Saint @-@ Laurent @-@ sur @-@ Mer , France . There she was scuttled as part of the breakwater for the Mulberry artificial harbor built to support the Normandy Invasion . 
 In March 1945 , the WSA offered a payment of $ 565 @,@ 910 to American @-@ Hawaiian for Pennsylvanian as part of a $ 7 @.@ 2 million settlement for eleven requisitioned American @-@ Hawaiian ships that had either been sunk , scuttled , or were to be retained by the government . 
 = Cabell Breckinridge = 
 Joseph " Cabell " Breckinridge ( July 14 , 1788 – September 1 , 1823 ) was a lawyer and politician in the U.S. state of Kentucky . From 1816 to 1819 , he was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives , serving as speaker from 1817 to 1819 . In 1820 , he was appointed Kentucky Secretary of State by Governor John Adair . A member of the Breckinridge political family , he was the son of U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge and the father of U.S. Vice President John C. Breckinridge . 
 Born in Albemarle County , Virginia to John Breckinridge ( 1760 @-@ 1806 ) and Mary Hopkins Cabell Breckinridge ( 1769 @-@ 1858 ) , Breckinridge moved to Kentucky with his parents in 1793 . When John Breckinridge was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1801 , Cabell traveled with him to Washington , D.C. , and completed preparatory studies at New London Academy ( now Colby – Sawyer College ) . In 1806 , he enrolled in the College of New Jersey ( now Princeton University ) . His studies were interrupted in 1807 when he participated in a student protest against the strict rules and rigorous curriculum at the institution , but after a year @-@ long break , he returned and completed his bachelor 's degree in 1810 . After graduation , he married Mary Clay Smith , daughter of Samuel Stanhope Smith , the university 's president . 
 Breckinridge intended to begin practicing law in Lexington , Kentucky , but he enlisted for service in the War of 1812 instead . After the war , he opened his practice and was elected to the Kentucky House , where he led an unsuccessful attempt to oust Gabriel Slaughter after he ascended to the governorship upon the death of George Madison . He served as Speaker of the House from 1817 to 1819 , and was appointed as Adair 's Secretary of State in 1820 . He moved to Frankfort , the state capital , so that he could attend to the duties of his office , but fell ill with a fever in August 1823 and died in office on September 1 . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Joseph Cabell Breckinridge was born in Albemarle County , Virginia , on July 14 , 1788 . He was the second child and first son of John and Mary Hopkins " Polly " ( née Cabell ) Breckinridge . He was named for his maternal grandfather , Joseph Cabell , of Virginia 's Cabell political family but was known as " Cabell " throughout his life . 
 In 1793 , the family moved to Lexington , Kentucky . Late in the year , a smallpox epidemic struck the city . <unk> came too late , and Breckinridge , his mother , and three of his siblings were infected . Breckinridge , his mother , and his sister Letitia survived , but his sister Mary and brother Robert died . Other than this , historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that " little is known of his boyhood " , although he speculates that he probably attended some local schools and read from his father 's extensive library . 
 In 1801 , when Breckinridge was 12 years old , his father was elected to the U.S. Senate . The family moved to Bedford County , Virginia , where they lived with relatives in order to be closer to the elder Breckinridge during the congressional session at Washington , D.C .. While there , Cabell Breckinridge attended New London Academy ( now Colby – Sawyer College ) . A case of measles prevented him from attending William and Mary College ( now College of William & Mary ) , his father 's alma mater , where his cousin , future Congressman James Breckinridge , was enrolled . In 1803 , he accompanied his father to the capital where he witnessed the debates over the Louisiana Purchase before returning to college in October . After Congress adjourned in March , John Breckinridge met his son in Virginia , and they arrived back at Cabell 's Dale , the family estate near Lexington , on April 18 , 1804 . He did not return to Virginia with his father in late 1804 , instead pursuing preparatory studies under Colonel Samuel Wilson in advance of his enrollment at the College of New Jersey ( now Princeton University ) . 
 = = Studies at Princeton University = = 
 Breckinridge arrived in Princeton , New Jersey , in late December 1805 . He had completed his final exams by April 5 , but he declined his father 's offer to come to Washington because he needed to catch up on his studies in arithmetic . When the next term began in May , he joined the American Whig – Cliosophic Society , a debating society founded by James Madison , Philip Freneau , Aaron Burr , and Henry Lee in 1769 . 
 In mid @-@ 1806 , Cabell learned that his father was sick . Not long after , however , he received word that his father was improving and expected to meet him in Virginia en route to the capital . Although a rendezvous location had not been set , he assumed it would be in Lynchburg , where the Breckinridges had relatives . In October , he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge 's home to wait for his father , but he never came . Disappointed , he returned to Princeton for the beginning of the new term , unaware that his father 's recovery had been short @-@ lived . Later he learned that his father had attempted to leave Cabell 's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off his horse and returned to his sick bed ; he died December 14 , 1806 . 
 In January 1807 , travelers from Kentucky finally brought news of John Breckinridge 's death . Despite Cabell 's declaration to a relative that , " I consider my life dedicated to my mother 's ease " , Breckinridge continued his studies . John Breckinridge died intestate , complicating the settlement of his estate and creating financial difficulties for Cabell , who had been receiving support from his father . Desperate , he appealed to Alfred Grayson , his sister Letitia 's husband and son of Senator William Grayson , for assistance . 
 In March 1807 , about 125 students organized a protest against the college 's strict conduct policies and rigorous study requirements . The protest included signing a formal petition of protest ; college administrators subsequently suspended everyone who refused to withdraw his name from the petition . Breckinridge was required to apologize for his part in the protest in order to return to school , but he refused to do so . In May , he left Princeton for Cabell 's Dale , but in Philadelphia he found that there were no available stages heading west for two weeks . Unable to afford room and board for that long , he went to Fincastle , Virginia , to stay with relatives . He considered enrolling at the College of William and Mary for the fall term in 1807 , believing he could complete his studies in nine months but ultimately decided against it . Harrison surmises that the lack of correspondence between Breckinridge and his family in Kentucky between July 1807 to July 1808 indicated that he was at Cabell 's Dale during most or all of that period . 
 By July 1808 , Breckinridge had decided to return to Princeton in October to finish his studies . His roommate , James G. Birney , and the university president , Samuel Stanhope Smith , were both ardent abolitionists , and through their influence , he became convinced that slavery must be ended , but only by voluntary emancipation , not by government interference . He completed his bachelor 's degree in 1810 . 
 = = Marriage and law practice = = 
 While completing his degree , Breckinridge began courting Mary Clay Smith , the daughter the university president and granddaughter of John Witherspoon , a signer of the Declaration of Independence . After graduation , he journeyed home , but returned to Princeton where he and Smith were married on May 11 , 1811 . The couple had five children – Frances ( b . 1812 ) , Caroline ( b . 1813 ) , Mary Cabell ( b . 1815 ) , John Cabell ( b . 1821 ) , and Laetitia ( b . 1822 ) . John Cabell Breckinridge went on to represent Kentucky in both houses of Congress , was elected Vice President of the United States in 1856 , and was the fifth and final Confederate States Secretary of War . 
 After attending wedding celebrations with friends and relatives in Princeton , Philadelphia , and New York City , the couple moved in with Breckinridge 's widowed mother at Cabell 's Dale . Before Breckinridge could commence practice , the U.S. entered the War of 1812 . He was commissioned a major and served as aide @-@ de @-@ camp under Samuel Hopkins . He would later refer to the war as " a foolish and ineffectual brace of campaigns on the Illinois and Wabash " . After the war , Breckinridge returned to Kentucky , was admitted to the bar in 1814 , and opened a practice in Lexington . Concurrent with his practice , he served as a professor of religion . He also helped found the Second Presbyterian Church in Lexington and became one of its ruling elders . In 1815 , he purchased Thorn Hill , a home in Lexington , from John W. Hunt . 
 = = Political career = = 
 In 1816 , Breckinridge was elected as a Democratic @-@ Republican to represent Fayette <unk> the Kentucky House of Representatives , gaining the largest majority given to a candidate for office in that county to that point . Historian Lewis Collins notes that Breckinridge 's legislative career began during the national " Era of Good Feelings " , largely congruent with the presidency of James Monroe , when political disagreements were relatively few . Nevertheless , dissension erupted in Kentucky in October 1816 after the death of Governor George Madison just three weeks into his term . Lieutenant Governor Gabriel Slaughter , as acting governor , rescinded Madison 's appointment of Charles Stewart Todd as Secretary of State , replacing him with former Senator John Pope , who was unpopular because of his vote against declaring the War of 1812 . Slaughter followed this up by appointing Martin D. Hardin , widely regarded as a Federalist despite his nominal identification with the Democratic @-@ Republicans , to fill the Senate vacancy caused by the resignation of William T. Barry . 
 Both appointments were unpopular in the state , and on January 27 , 1817 , Breckinridge formed a coalition of legislators in the House that sponsored a bill to elect " a governor to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of " Madison , essentially an attempt to oust Slaughter from the governorship . The bill passed the House by a vote of 56 – 30 , but the Senate refused to concur . Madison 's death was the first time the lieutenant governor succeeded permanently to the governorship , establishing the precedent for future instances . Nevertheless , several anti @-@ Slaughter candidates were elected in the 1817 legislative elections . Breckinridge was re @-@ elected in both 1817 and 1818 and was chosen Speaker of the House both years . 
 In 1820 , Breckinridge 's friend , newly elected Governor John Adair , appointed him as Kentucky Secretary of State . Of this appointment , historian William C. Davis wrote , " It was a prestigious , albeit not too influential , position and would require his full @-@ time presence at the capital . " He remained in Lexington until the birth of his son in January 1821 ; in February , the family moved to the Governor 's Mansion in Frankfort to live with Adair . Although his mother opposed the move to Frankfort , he intended for it to be permanent ; an acquaintance wrote that " his plans were extensive and his hopes high " for his family 's life in the state capital . In addition to his duties as secretary of state , he continued to practice law . 
 = = Death = = 
 Throughout his term , Breckinridge 's health became increasingly fragile . When an illness described in contemporary accounts as " the prevailing fever " struck Lexington in 1823 , he took the children to Cabell 's Dale to prevent them from becoming ill . When he returned in late August , he contracted the fever . Despite the care of his brother , John , and the local doctors , he died on September 1 , 1823 , just over a week after falling ill . Originally buried on the grounds at Cabell 's Dale , he and several family members were re @-@ interred at Lexington Cemetery near the grave of his brother Robert Jefferson Breckinridge . 
 Breckinridge left behind $ 15 @,@ 000 in debts , and with the nation still in the throes of the Panic of 1819 , his assets were not enough to pay off the obligations . His wife , who also fell ill and was pregnant with the couple 's sixth child , was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage . She and the children moved in with Cabell 's widowed mother at Cabell 's Dale . For several years , she was dependent upon her in @-@ laws for survival ; Breckinridge 's brother , Robert , assumed Cabell 's debts , which he paid in full in 1832 . 
 = Typhoon Oliwa = 
 Typhoon Oliwa was one of a record eleven super typhoons in the 1997 Pacific typhoon season . It formed in the central Pacific Ocean on September 2 to the southwest of Hawaii , but it became a typhoon in the western Pacific . Oliwa explosively deepened on September 8 , increasing its winds from 85 mph to 160 mph in a 24 ‑ hour period . Afterward , it slowly weakened , and after passing east of Okinawa , Oliwa turned northeast and struck Japan with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . There , it affected 30 @,@ 000 people and killed 13 ; thousands of houses were flooded , and some were destroyed . Offshore South Korea , the winds and waves wrecked 28 boats , while one boat went missing with a crew of 10 people . Typhoon Oliwa dissipated on September 19 in northern Pacific Ocean near the International Date Line . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Typhoon Oliwa were from an unusually eastward extension of the monsoon trough in late August 1997 . The tropical disturbance organized southwest of Hawaii , and slowly organized . On September 2 , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Two @-@ C about 590 miles ( 950 km ) southwest of Johnston Island , slightly east of the International Date Line . The depression quickly attained tropical storm status , and the CPHC gave it the name " Oliwa " , meaning " Oliver " in the Hawaiian language . 
 A moderately powerful ridge persisted north of Tropical Storm Oliwa , which caused a slow west to west @-@ northwest track . Water temperatures were slightly warmer than usual , and there was a favorable upper @-@ level environment for strengthening . Initially , however , Oliwa was somewhat disorganized on satellite imagery , and on September 4 , as it crossed the International Date Line , there may have been multiple circulations . Upon entering the western Pacific Ocean , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) and the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began issuing advisories on the system ( <unk> ) . Despite the favorable conditions , further intensification was slow , and it reached typhoon status - winds of at least 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) - on September 8 . Prior to that time , Oliwa co @-@ existed with a weak tropical cyclone that formed in a similar location in the south Pacific . 
 About twelve hours after reaching typhoon status , Oliwa began to undergo unexpected explosive deepening . In a 24 ‑ hour period , the JTWC assessed the typhoon as nearly doubling in intensity , from 85 to 160 mph ( 140 to 260 km / h 1 @-@ min winds ) , while the pressure dropped 69 mbar to a minimum of 898 mbar ; based on the estimated intensity , the JTWC classified Oliwa as a super typhoon . The JMA , which is the official agency of the western Pacific , assessed Oliwa as reaching a peak of 115 mph ( 185 km / h 10 @-@ min winds ) , with a pressure of 915 mbar . Around that time , satellite imagery indicated a possible eyewall <unk> , which is a small scale rotational feature found in the eyewall of an intense tropical cyclone . Additionally , concentric eyewalls developed in the center of Oliwa , which typically occur in strong typhoons . 
 After maintaining peak intensity for 36 hours , Oliwa gradually weakened as it continued to the west @-@ northwest , during which it passed through the Northern Marianas Islands . On September 14 , the typhoon slowed to the north of Okinawa , and it turned to the northeast toward Japan . As a weakened typhoon , Oliwa moved ashore on <unk> , Kagoshima , Kyushu with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) late on September 15 . It weakened to tropical storm strength while crossing Japan , and deteriorated further to tropical depression status on September 16 . On September 17 , the JTWC issued the final advisory on Oliwa while it was in the eastern portion of the Sea of Japan . The JMA maintained advisories as the storm crossed northern Japan , and it accelerated over the open Pacific Ocean . On September 19 , Oliwa dissipated near the International Date Line to the south of the Aleutian Islands . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 While weakening after peaking in intensity , Oliwa passed about 60 miles ( 95 km ) north of Agrihan in the Northern Marianas Islands . Sustained winds on the island reached 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , with gusts to 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . The winds downed two coconut trees onto a radio antenna , which left the island temporarily without contact to the outside world . On the Japanese island of Kyushu , where Oliwa made landfall as a weakened typhoon , thousands of homes were flooded , and dozens were destroyed . Its slow movement caused heavy rainfall that created a mudslide in Tashiro , Kagoshima , killing three people . Across Kagoshima Prefecture , officials issued evacuations due to flooding , although many did not heed the warnings . In the prefecture , the typhoon destroyed 131 buildings and damaged about 1 @,@ 700 more . Damage there was estimated at 14 million yen ( 1997 JPY , $ 150 @,@ 000 in 1997 USD ) . Across Japan , Typhoon Oliwa caused 12 fatalities and displaced a total of 30 @,@ 000 people . Total damage amounted to 4 @.@ 36 billion yen ( $ 50 @.@ 1 million USD ) . Offshore the South Korea coast , the winds and strong waves wrecked 28 vessels , and 10 people were reported missing from one ship . 
 Typhoon Oliwa was one of eleven super typhoons in the western Pacific , which is tied to the previous record of eleven ; a typical typhoon season has four super typhoons . The period of heightened activity was the result of one of the most powerful El Niño events on record . The track Oliwa was unusual , due to its origin as a cyclone from the central Pacific Ocean and its path over the Northern Marianas Islands and Japan . The typhoon was one of only two during the season to undergo explosive deepening , which is a decrease in barometric pressure of ≥ 2 @.@ 5 mbar per hour for a period of at least 12 hours . In 24 hours , the pressure dropped 69 mbar , which averages 2 @.@ 9 mbar per hour ; such values are usually estimated in the western Pacific using the Dvorak technique . 
 The name was not retired , although due to the low activity in the central Pacific Ocean , the name will not be used for several years .

 Tops in Science Fiction was a science fiction magazine which was launched in 1953 . The publisher , Love Romances Publishing , created it as a vehicle to reprint stories from Planet Stories . It was unsuccessful and only lasted for two issues . Although it contained no original stories , it did print some original artwork , including some of Kelly Freas 's early work . A British reprint edition appeared in the mid @-@ 1950s . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The early 1950s saw dramatic changes in the world of U.S. science fiction publishing . At the start of 1949 , all but one of the major magazines in the field were in pulp format ; by the end of 1955 , almost all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format . Despite the rapid decline of the pulp market , several new science fiction magazines were launched in pulp format during these years ; Tops in Science Fiction was one of the last of these . The publisher , Love Romances Inc . , also published Planet Stories , and Malcolm Reiss , Planet 's editorial director , decided to try to take advantage of the backfile of stories and artwork from Planet 's 14 years of publication . He may have been inspired by the example of Fantastic Story Magazine , which was published by Standard Magazines as a vehicle to reprint their extensive backfile of science fiction . If so , he was evidently not aware that by 1953 Fantastic Story was not doing well financially . 
 The first issue was dated Spring 1953 , and was edited by Jack O 'Sullivan . The cover , by Alexander Leydenfrost , was reprinted from a 1942 issue of Planet Stories . The fiction included " Black Friar of the Flame " by Isaac Asimov , and " The Million Year Picnic " , by Ray Bradbury — the first of his " Martian Chronicles " stories . Interior art included some of Kelly Freas ' earliest work . The issue was only modestly successful , and on the advice of his distributor , who told Reiss that they were having trouble getting the magazine distributed , Reiss decided to switch to the digest format for the second issue : digests were starting to become more popular than the pulps , which would be almost completely gone from the market within only a couple more years . The second issue was dated Fall 1953 ; the cover , by Freas , illustrated " Lorelei of the Red Mist " , by Bradbury and Leigh Brackett . Freas also did the interior illustrations for the story , and later commented that he was delighted by the results but felt he was " never quite able to repeat it . A hex , of course . " Interior artists for the second issue also included Emsh ; the fiction included stories by Fredric Brown and Horace Gold . However , this issue received only limited distribution , and Reiss decided against continuing with the magazine .

 = John Gardner ( British writer ) = 
 Not to be confused with John Gardner ( American writer ) 
 John Edmund Gardner ( 20 November 1926 – 3 August 2007 ) was an English spy and thriller novelist , best known for his James Bond continuation novels , but also for his series of Boysie Oakes books and three continuation novels containing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's fictional villain , Professor Moriarty . 
 Gardner , an ex @-@ Royal Marine commando , worked for a period as an Anglican priest , but he lost his faith and left the church after a short time . After a battle with alcohol addiction he wrote his first book , the autobiographical Spin the Bottle , published in 1964 . 
 Gardner went on to write over fifty works of fiction , including fourteen original James Bond novels , and the novel versions of two Bond films . He died from suspected heart failure on 3 August 2007 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Edmund Gardner was born on 20 November 1926 in Seaton Delaval , a small village in Northumberland . His parents were Cyril Gardner , a London @-@ born Anglican priest who had been ordained in Wallsend in 1921 , and Lena Henderson , a local girl ; the couple were married in 1925 . In 1933 the family moved to the market town of Wantage in what was then Berkshire , where Cyril took up the position of Chaplain at St Mary 's , Wantage and Gardner was educated at the local King Alfred 's School . 
 During the Second World War he joined the Home Guard , despite being only 13 at the time . Gardner subsequently served in the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm , before transferring to the Royal Marines 42 Commando for service in the Middle and Far East . Gardner considered himself " the worst commando in the world " and , despite being " a small @-@ arms expert ... [ who ] also knew a lot about explosives " , he admitted that " I bent an aeroplane I was learning to fly " . 
 After the war he went up to St John 's College , Cambridge , to study theology and was subsequently ordained as an Anglican priest in 1953 . He realised that he had lost his faith and made an error in his career ; he later admitted that during one sermon , " I didn 't believe a word I was saying " . He was released from the church in 1958 and took up a position as a drama critic with the Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon Herald . It was whilst at the Herald — aged 33 — that Gardner realised he was an alcoholic , drinking two bottles of gin a day . He overcame his addiction and produced his first book as part of his therapy : the autobiographical Spin the Bottle , published in 1964 . Critic and scholar John Sutherland says that of all the books Gardner published , " it 's the one that most deserves to survive . " 
 = = Writing career = = 
 In 1964 , Gardner began his novelist career with The Liquidator , in which he created the character Boysie Oakes who inadvertently is mistaken to be a tough , pitiless man of action and is thereupon recruited into a British spy agency . In fact , Oakes was a devout coward who was terrified of violence , suffered from airsickness and was afraid of heights and Gardner admitted of him that , " though I have denied it many times — he was of course a complete piss @-@ take of J. Bond " . The book appeared at the height of the fictional spy mania and , as a send @-@ up of the whole business , was an immediate success . Upon reviewing the novel in The New York Times , Anthony Boucher wrote , " Mr. Gardner succeeds in having it both ways : He has written a clever parody which is also a genuinely satisfactory thriller . " The book was made into a film of the same name by MGM and another seven light @-@ hearted novels and two short stories about the cowardly Oakes appeared over the next eleven years . 
 Following the success of his Oakes books , Gardner created new characters : Derek Torry — a Scotland Yard inspector of Italian descent — and Herbie Kruger , the latter of which appeared in a series of novels published simultaneously with his Bond works . In the mid @-@ 1970s Gardner also wrote the first of three novels using the character of Professor Moriarty from the Sherlock Holmes series , the last of which was published posthumously . The third of this series , titled simply Moriarty , was delayed due to a dispute with the publisher , but was finally released shortly after his death . Erik Lee Preminger bought the film rights to the first of the trilogy - The Return of Moriarty - and wrote a script . Edgar Bronfman , Jr . , for Sagittarius Entertainment and Nat Cohen , for EMI Productions were to produce . Donald Sutherland was to portray Moriarty . Funding however fell through shortly before filming was to begin . 
 In 1979 Glidrose Publications ( now Ian Fleming Publications ) approached Gardner and asked him to revive Ian Fleming 's James Bond series of novels . Between 1981 and 1996 , Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels , and the novelizations of two Bond films . Gardner stated that he wanted " to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s " , although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them . Even though Gardner kept the ages the same , he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years . With the influence of the American publishers , Putnam 's , the Gardner novels showed an increase in the number of Americanisms used in the book , such as a waiter wearing " pants " , rather than trousers , in The Man from Barbarossa . James Harker , writing in The Guardian , considered that the Gardner books were " dogged by silliness " , giving examples of Scorpius , where much of the action is set in Chippenham , and Win , Lose or Die , where " Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher " . Whilst Gardner 's Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics , they were popular and a number appeared in The New York Times Best Seller list , bringing the author commercial success . Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author , once saying that " I 'm very grateful to have been selected to keep Bond alive . But I 'd much rather be remembered for my own work than I would for Bond " , while saying on another occasion that " I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development " . In the mid @-@ 1990s , after discovering he had esophageal cancer , Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond . 
 His break from writing lasted for five years , following the death of his wife , but after battling his illness he returned to print in 2000 with a new novel , Day of Absolution . Gardner also began a series of books with a new character , Suzie Mountford , a 1930s police detective . 
 The Globe and Mail crime critic Derrick Murdoch said , " John Gardner is technically a highly competent thriller novelist who never seems to be quite at ease unless he is writing in the same vein as another writer .

 = TNA X Division Championship = 
 The TNA X Division Championship is a professional wrestling championship owned by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) professional wrestling promotion . It is primarily defended in TNA and ( as per a talent exchange agreement ) also formerly in Wrestle @-@ 1 as well . It debuted on June 19 , 2002 at the taping of TNA 's second weekly pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event . 
 Like most professional wrestling championships , the title is won as a result of a scripted match . There have been 68 reigns among 30 wrestlers . The title has previously been known as the NWA X Championship , the NWA – TNA X Championship , and the NWA – TNA X Division Championship . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = X Division = = = 
 The TNA X Division was established on June 19 , 2002 at Total Nonstop Action 's first weekly PPV event with a Six Man Tag Team match resulting in Jimmy Yang , Jorge Estrada , and Sonny Siaki — collectively known as The Flying <unk> — defeating A.J. Styles , Jerry Lynn , and Low Ki . Later that day at the taping of the next weekly PPV event , TNA introduced the X Division Championship — then known as the X Championship — to showcase the division more prominently . The division is described as wrestling reinvented , as it takes traditional wrestling and mixes it with the fast paced , high – risk style of wrestling incorporated in cruiserweight divisions and lucha libre . The division was until 2011 promoted under the motto " It is not about weight limits , it is about no limits " by commentator Mike Tenay . On the August 11 , 2011 , edition of TNA 's primary television program , Impact Wrestling , TNA authority figure Eric Bischoff announced that from that point onwards the X Division would have a weight limit of 225 lb ( 102 kg ) . Following Hulk Hogan becoming the new on @-@ screen General Manager in March 2012 , the weight limit was ignored on June 10 , 2012 , at Slammiversary when the 280 lb ( 130 kg ) Samoa Joe was allowed to challenge for the belt . On October 2012 , the weight limit was officially repealed when 237 lb ( 108 kg ) Rob Van Dam challenged for , and eventually won , the title at Bound for Glory . In March 2013 , the X Division was given a new set of rules , which meant all matches were wrestled in Triple Threat format , and a new weight limit of 230 lbs . This proved to be extremely unpopular with fans , and the rules and weight limit were repealed once again in August of that year . 
 = = = = Speciality matches = = = = 
 The Total Nonstop Action X Division has multiple styles of match types used to showcase the talent within the division and to defend the TNA X Division Championship in more marketable matches . Three of the matches used in TNA are the Ultimate X match , The Steel Asylum , and the Xscape match . 
 The Ultimate X match was introduced in 2003 . It involves multiple competitors racing to retrieve the X Division Championship or a giant red letter " X " , which is suspended above the ring by two cables . The cables are attached to posts that stand behind the turnbuckles of the ring . These cables intertwine to form an " X " over the center of the ring . This match has become successful in TNA ; it was featured in the 2008 DVD " TNA : Ultimate Matches " , released by TNA Home Video . 
 The Steel Asylum made its debut in May 2008 at TNA 's Sacrifice PPV event , under the name " The TerrorDome " . It was used once again in October 2008 at their Bound for Glory IV PPV event , under the new and current moniker " The Steel Asylum " . As of July 2016 , this match has only been used to determine the number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship . The layout of the match involves the ring being surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed ceiling . The only way to achieve victory is to escape the cage through a hole in the center of the ceiling . 
 The Xscape match is the third specialty match primarily used in TNA . It is held annually at TNA 's Lockdown PPV event in April — an all – steel cage format PPV event . The first two Xscape matches were held to determine the number one contender to the TNA X Division Championship , while , since 2007 , it has been contested for the X Division Championship . The contest involves four to six participants . To win this match , two or more participants — depending on how many are involved in the encounter — must be eliminated by pinfall or submission leaving only two participants . These two men then race to see who escapes the cage first to claim victory . 
 = = = Creation = = = 
 The championship was created and debuted before the main event at the taping of TNA 's second weekly PPV event on June 19 , 2002 ; the event aired on June 26 , 2002 . Later , A.J. Styles defeated Low Ki , Jerry Lynn , and Psicosis in a Four Way Double Elimination match to be crowned the inaugural champion ; this match was announced as being for the NWA X Championship on the onscreen graphic while the ring announcer stated it was for the " NWA – TNA X Championship " . Afterwards , the title was renamed the NWA – TNA X Division Championship and then shortened to just the TNA X Division Championship . This is the oldest title in TNA . 
 = = = Option C = = = 
 Option C is a concept in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the championship in exchange for a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match at that year 's Destination X event . It began in June 2012 when then @-@ champion Austin Aries said that he was not satisfied with being just the X Division Champion , which led to then @-@ General Manager Hulk Hogan offering him a match for the World Heavyweight Championship , but only if he first vacated the X Division Championship ( as Hogan didn 't want the same wrestler holding both titles ) . Aries agreed to Hogan 's terms , on the condition that the X Division Champion be given the same opportunity in future years . Aries would then relinquish the X Division Championship and successfully defeated Booby Roode for the World title . 
 The following year , Hogan asked then @-@ champion Chris Sabin if he wanted to vacate the championship and challenge for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship , which Sabin accepted , and later defeated Bully Ray to win the title . On June 24 , 2014 , a mere five days after regaining the X Division Championship for his fifth reign , Austin Aries invoked Option C once again , but failed to defeat then champion Lashley . On May 10 , 2015 , one day after regaining the title for his second reign , Rockstar Spud invoked Option C , and was defeated by then champion Kurt Angle . On the July 5 , 2016 episode of Impact Wrestling , TNA World Heavyweight Champion Lashley offered a winner take all match to X Division Champion Eddie Edwards in lieu of Edwards invoking Option C. The match ended in a no @-@ contest after an interference from Mike Bennett and Edwards was attacked the debuting Moose . 
 = = <unk> and outside defenses = = 
 In July 2002 , the X Division Champion AJ Styles defended the title against Adam Jacobs and David Young at Ring of Honor 's Crowning a Champion , the first defense outside TNA . In May 2003 , before the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling All @-@ Stars ' ( WWA ) foreclosure , then NWA – TNA X Division champion Chris Sabin defeated WWA International Cruiserweight Champion Jerry Lynn , Frankie Kazarian , and Johnny Swinger in a Four Corners championship unification match to unify the X Division Championship with the WWA International Cruiserweight Championship . On Winter 2004 , Petey Williams defended the title in various IWA @-@ Mid South events . 
 During Christopher Daniels ' first reign in mid @-@ 2005 , he defended the X Division Championship at several Pro Wrestling Guerrilla shows . The first defense happened at All Star Weekend - Night One on April 1 against Alex Shelley , while the second occurred at All Star Weekend – Night Two on April 2 against Chris Hero ; Daniels won both encounters retaining the championship . At Jason Takes PWG on May 13 , Daniels fought A.J. Styles for the X Division Championship and Styles ' PWG Championship to a one @-@ hour time @-@ limit draw . Daniels successfully defended the X Division Title two more times in PWG ; once at <unk> on June 11 against El Generico , while once at The 2nd Annual PWG Bicentennial Birthday Extravaganza - Night One on July 9 against fellow TNA wrestler Chris Sabin . In September 2005 at TNA 's Unbreakable PPV event , the TNA X Division Championship was defended in the main event for the first time at a monthly PPV event ; then @-@ champion Christopher Daniels defended the championship against A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe . 
 The title was once again defended in the main event of a monthly event at TNA 's August 2007 Hard Justice PPV event , where Kurt Angle defeated Samoa Joe to win the TNA X Division and the TNA World Tag Team Championship and retain the TNA World Heavyweight and IGF 's version of the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship . This win made Angle the only person in the history of TNA to hold every active championship at the same time ; TNA World , X Division , and World Tag Team . 
 On March 4 , 2014 , The title was defended in Japan as part of Kaisen : Outbreak - a supershow event promoted by Wrestle @-@ 1 in partnership with TNA - where the title was won by Wrestle @-@ 1 star Seiya Sanada . On March 22 , Sanada defended and successfully retained the title on a Wrestle @-@ 1 show .

 = Andrianjaka = 
 Andrianjaka reigned over the Kingdom of Imerina in the central highlands region of Madagascar from around 1612 to 1630 . Despite being the younger of King Ralambo 's two sons , Andrianjaka succeeded to the throne on the basis of his strength of character and skill as a military tactician . The most celebrated accomplishment of his reign was the capture of the hill of Analamanga from a Vazimba king . There he established the fortified compound ( rova ) that would form the heart of his new capital city of Antananarivo . Upon his orders , the first structures within this fortified compound ( known as the Rova of Antananarivo ) were constructed : several traditional royal houses were built , and plans for a series of royal tombs were designed . These buildings took on an enduring political and spiritual significance , ensuring their preservation until being destroyed by fire in 1995 . Andrianjaka obtained a sizable cache of firearms and gunpowder , materials that helped to establish and preserve his dominance and expand his rule over greater Imerina . 
 Many of the cultural practices that were to define Merina social and political life for centuries are credited to Andrianjaka . He designated the twelve sacred hills of Imerina that were to become the spiritual and political heartland of the Merina empire , contributing to the establishment of the kingdom 's traditional boundaries ; clans were assigned to specific regions within his kingdom , further defining the cultural landscape . He consolidated power through such measures as appropriating the folk tradition of sampy ( community talismans ) , thereby ensuring all the powers traditionally attributed to these idols were under the control of the sovereign alone . Merina traditions related to the burial and mourning of sovereigns are also traced back to Andrianjaka 's reign . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Andrianjaka was the second son of Ralambo , ruler of the Kingdom of Imerina in the central highlands of Madagascar . As a young man , Andrianjaka married <unk> , a daughter of Prince <unk> . The marriage produced one daughter and one son , Andriantsitakatrandriana , who would rule after his father from 1630 to 1650 . Andrianjaka was also actively involved in providing support to his father 's military campaigns to expand and defend Ralambo 's realm . Oral history describes an incident wherein Andrianjaka and Ralambo were engaged in the defense of Ralambo 's capital at Ambohidrabiby , which was threatened by the advance of <unk> warriors . Andrianjaka reportedly suggested an innovative defensive tactic to annihilate the enemy by filling the town 's hadivory ( defensive trenches ) with cow dung and rice husks , lighting it on fire , and covering the smoldering embers with burnt rice stalks so that the area resembled a patch of land recently re @-@ cleared for planting through tavy ( slash and burn agriculture ) . The enemy troops reportedly marched into the trap , sinking into the embers and burning or suffocating to death . 
 Oral history provides two different accounts of Andrianjaka 's succession to the throne of the Kingdom of Imerina . According to popular legend , Ralambo devised a test to determine which of his two sons was most fit to rule : he would summon them both to join him at his capital in Ambohidrabiby , and whichever of his two sons reached him soonest would inherit his kingdom . In one account of this legend , Andrianjaka was reportedly engrossed in strategizing a win in a difficult game of fanorona and so refused to admit audience to the royal messenger until after the game was over . During this delay , his older brother Andriantompokoindrindra received his father 's message and rushed home ; he was thus awarded Ralambo 's title and kingdom . However , this tale continues , Andriantompokoindrindra 's claim to power was rejected by the public , and he was soon forced to cede the throne to Andrianjaka . In an alternate account of the succession tale , it is Andriantompokoindrindra ( not Andrianjaka ) who was said to be preoccupied with the fanorona game — a version in keeping with the oral tradition that credits him with the game 's invention and popularization at court — and his refusal to return to his father until after the game had finished led Ralambo to choose Andrianjaka as his successor . One source states that the summons was not a test , but rather occurred during the aforementioned incident when Ralambo was besieged in his capital by the <unk> warriors and was genuinely in need of his sons ' assistance . 
 It is generally accepted by historians that Andrianjaka did indeed succeed to the throne around 1610 or 1612 after his older brother 's claim was rejected by the public . All speculation about fanorona and royal summons aside , Ralambo may have chosen Andrianjaka based on the simple fact that he was the son of Ralambo 's first wife . Ralambo 's father , Andriamanelo , had established rules of succession by which Ralambo 's first son by his first wife must rule after his father in order to fulfill a mandate established by his Vazimba antecedents Rafohy and Rangita . The passing over of Andriantompokoindrindra in favor of his younger brother was partially mitigated by the establishment of a royal tradition maintaining that all reigning descendants of Andrianjaka would henceforth be required to marry a princess directly descended from Andriantompokoindrindra , thereby preserving the royal status of descendants in both brothers ' bloodlines . 
 = = Reign = = 
 Andrianjaka moved his capital from Ambohidrabiby to Ambohimanga upon ascending to the throne around 1610 or 1612 . He was reportedly the first Merina leader to receive Europeans around 1620 and traded slaves in exchange for guns and other firearms to aid in the pacification of rival principalities , obtaining 50 guns and three barrels of gunpowder to equip his army . He unified the principalities on what he later designated as the twelve sacred hills of Imerina at <unk> , Ambohimanga , Ilafy , Alasora , <unk> , <unk> , Analamanga , Ambohitrabiby , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina , which was further expanded over a century later when Andrianampoinimerina redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites . 
 His policies and tactics highlighted and increased the separation between the king and his subjects . Andrianjaka transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom . He made a demonstration of royal power by appropriating the local tradition of sampy ( talismans ) , previously created by village chiefs and others for personal or local spiritual ends , restricting their number to twelve and declaring their creation a strictly royal prerogative . The king also imposed an intimidating change to the traditional form of justice , the trial by ordeal : Andrianjaka ordered that rather than administering tangena poison to an accused person 's rooster to determine their innocence by the creature 's survival , the poison would instead be ingested by the accused himself . 
 = = = Founding of Antananarivo = = = 
 Around 1610 or 1625 according to various estimations , Andrianjaka commanded a garrison of 1 @,@ 000 soldiers to seize the hill of Analamanga ( " Blue Forest " ) — at 1 @,@ 480 metres ( 4 @,@ 860 ft ) above sea level , then the highest and most strategically important in the region — from its Vazimba inhabitants . He constructed a royal fortified compound ( rova ) on the hilltop as the capitol of a new town at the site which he named Antananarivo ( " the city of the thousand " ) in honor of the thousand soldiers who aided in capturing and protecting the hill . He reportedly succeeded with minimal bloodshed : according to oral history , the encampment of his army at the foot of Analamanga was sufficient to secure the submission of the Vazimba . Andrianjaka made Antananarivo the capital of his realm . From his position atop Analamanga , he was well @-@ placed to exert control over the vast plains of Betsimitatatra below . Under his command the plains were gradually transformed into vast , surplus @-@ producing rice paddies . This feat was accomplished by mobilizing large numbers of his able @-@ bodied subjects to construct dikes that enabled the redirection of rainwater for controlled flooding of planted areas . 
 Andrianjaka 's fortified compound came to be known as the Rova of Antananarivo and constituted the heart of his newly founded city of Antananarivo . Prior to Andrianjaka 's rule , Merina sovereigns shifted their capital from one town to another , but with the establishment of the rova on the peak of Analamanga hill , Antananarivo was to become the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina ( and , ultimately , the 19th @-@ century Kingdom of Madagascar ) for generations of Merina sovereigns . The heart of the town was built in stages : first , the army cleared the forest covering the hill 's summit and constructed the rova compound to serve as an initial garrison enclosing a traditional @-@ style wooden house ( lapa ) that served as a residence for the king . Soon thereafter , two more houses were constructed ; Andrianjaka also designated the construction space and design for a row of royal tombs . In keeping with Merina aristocratic tradition , each structure in the compound was given a name . The row of tombs was named Fitomiandalana ( " Seven Aligned Tombs " ) , Andrianjaka 's own tomb being the first of these constructed . According to one account , the very first royal house constructed within the Rova of Antananarivo was named Besakana ( " Great Breadth " ) and served as the personal residence of Andrianjaka . This account is contradicted by another source that states the second and third houses were called Masoandrotsiroa and Besakana , with the latter again characterized as Andrianjaka 's personal residence , leaving the precise origins of Besakana unclear . 
 The Besakana , Masoandrotsiroa and Fitomiandalana structures at the Rova of Antananarivo were preserved and maintained over the centuries by successive generations of Merina sovereigns , imbuing the structures with deep symbolic and spiritual meaning . As Andrianjaka 's residence , the Besakana was particularly significant : the original building was torn down and reconstructed in the same design by Andriamasinavalona around 1680 , and again by Andrianampoinimerina in 1800 , each of whom inhabited the building in turn as their personal residence . King Radama I likewise inhabited the building for much of his time at the Rova , and in 1820 he designated the building as the first site to house what came to be known as the Palace School , the first formal European @-@ style school in Imerina . Sovereigns were enthroned in this building and their mortal remains were displayed here before burial , rendering Besakana " the official state room for civil affairs ... regarded as the throne of the kingdom . " 
 = = Death and succession = = 
 The rule of Andrianjaka continued uninterrupted until his death at the Rova of Antananarivo around 1630 . He was the first king to be buried on the grounds of the Rova , his tomb forming the first of the Fitomiandalana . To commemorate his greatness , his subjects erected a small wooden house called a trano masina on top of his tomb . Future Merina sovereigns and nobles continued to construct similar tomb houses on their tombs well into the 19th century . According to oral history , the institution of lengthy formal mourning periods for deceased sovereigns in Imerina may also have begun with the death of Andrianjaka . He was succeeded by his son , Andriantsitakatrandriana .

 No Way Out ( 2004 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , which took place on February 15 , 2004 , at the Cow Palace in San Francisco , California . It was presented by THQ 's MX Unleashed . It was the sixth event produced under the No Way Out name and starred wrestlers from the SmackDown ! brand . 
 In the main event , Eddie Guerrero defeated WWE Champion Brock Lesnar to win the title - his sole World Championship before his death in 2005 . On the undercard Kurt Angle defeated The Big Show and John Cena in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XX . Furthermore , Chavo Guerrero defeated Rey Mysterio . 
 No Way Out grossed over $ 450 @,@ 000 ticket sales from an attendance of approximately 11 @,@ 000 and received 350 @,@ 000 pay @-@ per @-@ view buys , and was instrumental in helping WWE increase its pay @-@ per @-@ view revenue by $ 11 @.@ 9 million compared to the previous year . Like the event , the DVD received favorable reviews . 
 = = Background = = 
 The event consisted of eight professional wrestling matches with wrestlers involved in pre @-@ existing scripted feuds , and storylines . Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension @-@ building events , which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . All wrestlers belonged to the SmackDown ! brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program , the other being Raw . 
 After winning a 15 @-@ man battle royal ( a match in which participants are eliminated until one person remains as the winner ) on the January 29 , 2004 episode of SmackDown ! , Eddie Guerrero earned the right to challenge for the WWE Championship at No Way Out against the champion , Brock Lesnar in a standard wrestling match , also known as a singles match . Outside the storyline with Guerrero , Lesnar was involved in a staged rivalry with Goldberg , a member of the Raw program . The feud between Lesnar and Goldberg began at the Royal Rumble , WWE 's previous pay @-@ per @-@ view event which involved both brands . Lesnar interfered in the Royal Rumble match , a 30 @-@ man battle royal , attacking and eliminating Goldberg from the match . On the week of January 26 , 2004 , Lesnar and Goldberg conducted promotional in @-@ ring segments on respective episodes of Raw and SmackDown ! , in which they insulted each other . The following week on an episode of Raw , as a result of the rivalry extending between the two programs , General Manager Steve Austin gave Goldberg the option of attending No Way Out by giving him a front @-@ row ticket . That Thursday on SmackDown ! , the storyline between Guerrero and Lesnar was enhanced when they began a brawl after an in @-@ ring interview segment . 
 On the February 5 , 2004 episode of SmackDown ! , The General Manager Paul Heyman scheduled a Triple Threat match between The Big Show , Kurt Angle and John Cena for No Way Out . The winner of that match would face the WWE Champion at WrestleMania XX for the title . The rivalry continued to develop the following week , when Angle was scheduled to team with Guerrero to face The Big Show and Lesnar , though the latter was portrayed as being unconscious backstage . Cena then replaced Angle in the match and defeated the opposition with Guerrero . 
 In February 2004 , WWE Cruiserweight Champion Rey Mysterio produced " Crossing Borders " , which was No Way Out 's official theme song . In this storyline , Chavo Guerrero became jealous of the attention Mysterio garnered as a result of recording the song . Therefore , Heyman promoted a match between the two at No Way Out for the WWE Cruiserweight title during the February 5 , 2004 episode of SmackDown ! . The following week on SmackDown ! , Mysterio was accompanied by Jorge Páez , a professional boxer and childhood friend of Mysterio who appeared in his " Crossing Borders " music video , to his match against Tajiri . Mysterio defeated Tajiri but was attacked by Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero , Sr. after the match until Paez intervened and helped Mysterio . 
 = = Event = = 
 Before the event began and aired live on pay @-@ per @-@ view , an episode of Sunday Night Heat , one of WWE 's secondary television programs , was taped live . In a six @-@ person tag team match , the team of Tajiri , <unk> , and Akio defeated Último Dragón , Billy Kidman , and Paul London . 
 = = = Preliminary matches = = = 
 After Sunday Night Heat , the pay @-@ per @-@ view began with a handicap match - a tag team match in which a team of two wrestlers face a team of three . WWE Tag Team Champions Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty defended their titles against The Basham Brothers ( Doug and Danny Basham ) and Shaniqua . During the match Hotty attempted to hit Shaniqua , who was lying on her back , with a slap over her chest , but Shaniqua countered by hitting him with her forearm . The challengers had the advantage until Hotty hit both Basham brothers with his forearm , causing them to flip over the top ring rope and into ringside . Afterwards , Rikishi lifted Shaniqua over his shoulders before falling backwards in a Samoan drop . Rikishi then covered Shaniqua to pin her , a move that allowed Rikishi and Hotty to retain their championships . Next was a Singles match , in which Jamie Noble was blindfolded as he faced his storyline girlfriend Nidia . Nidia would take advantage of Noble 's inability to see by performing antics that caused him to fall . Eventually , Noble was able to apply the guillotine choke on Nidia . Noble won the match after he forced her to submit with this move . 
 The third contest was a tag team match , in which The World 's Greatest Tag Team ( Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas ) faced the APA ( Bradshaw and Faarooq ) . At one point , Bradshaw performed a high @-@ impact forearm " Clothesline from Hell " attack on Haas . Benjamin then hit Bradshaw with a superkick and pinned him to gain the win for his team . After the match , Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his seat by arena security . In the ring , General Manager Paul Heyman gave a promotional in @-@ ring segment on how SmackDown ! was the better program over Raw . Lesnar would come down to the ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg . As part of the storyline , Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade into the ring , where Lesnar performed a spear , a running shoulder block to Goldberg 's stomach ; however he recuperated and lifted Lesnar vertically in the air before slamming him down to perform the Jackhammer . Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security . This altercation was followed by a singles match between Hardcore Holly and Rhyno . Before the match began , Holly and Rhyno brawled on the entrance ramp , before they entered the ring . Once there , Holly slammed Rhyno off the top rope with a superplex , though , as they recuperated , Rhyno hit Holly with a spear that caused Holly to roll out of the ring . Afterwards , Holly lifted Rhyno by his legs over his shoulders before throwing him down with an Alabama slam ; Holly covered Rhyno for a pinfall .

 In the fifth match Rey Mysterio ( managed by Jorge Paez ) , defended his WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Chavo Guerrero ( managed by his father Chavo Guerrero , Sr. ) During the fight , Mysterio performed a 619 on Guerrero ( at the time positioned on the second ring rope ) and hit him in the face with both legs while using the ropes for leverage , leading to an attack by Paez on Guerrero , Sr. The referee ordered Paez backstage . Both fighters wrestled inconclusively until Mysterio hit a second 619 . During the second sequence of the move , Guerrero grabbed Mysterio 's legs and achieved a position with his shoulders spread so as to win both a pinfall and the WWE Cruiserweight title . 
 The following match was the Triple Threat between The Big Show , John Cena , and Kurt Angle fighting for the opportunity to face the WWE Champion at WrestleMania XX . For the duration of the match , The Big Show , who stood at 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 18 m ) and weighed 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) , used his body size to his advantage as he squashed , or easily and quickly performed moves on , Cena and Angle . Thereafter , Cena lifted The Big Show over his shoulders and threw him down to execute the FU , while Angle lifted The Big Show by the side to throw him out of the ring . Angle then applied an ankle lock on Cena , forcing him to submit . As a result , Angle won a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania XX . 
 The main event was a singles match in which WWE Champion Brock Lesnar defended his title against Eddie Guerrero . Lesnar did not show any effect from the Jackhammer Goldberg performed on him earlier in the event ; similar to the prior match , Lesnar used his size advantage over Guerrero throughout the match . As Lesnar lifted Guerrero over his shoulders to slam his face down to perform an " F @-@ 5 " , he knocked down the referee . Lesnar then attempted to take advantage of the referee 's state , as he went to retrieve the WWE title belt to hit Guerrero . Meanwhile , Goldberg came down into the ring and hit a spear on Lesnar . Because the referee was incapacitated , Guerrero could not be disqualified for Goldberg 's interference . As Goldberg retreated , Guerrero countered Lesnar 's 2nd F5 into a DDT on the title belt while the referee regained consciousness . Guerrero kicked the belt out of the ring to prevent the referee from seeing it and performed his Frog splash to pin Lesnar and win the WWE Championship from him .

 At WrestleMania XX , WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero defeated challenger Kurt Angle via pinfall and retained his title . John " Bradshaw " Layfield , portraying a new character after the semi @-@ retirement of his tag team partner Faarooq , challenged Guerrero for the WWE Championship and defeated him at The Great American Bash to win the title . Guerrero failed to recapture the title from Layfield in a steel cage match on SmackDown ! . After Guerrero 's death in November 2005 , WWE held Tribute Shows on Raw and SmackDown ! During these programs , No Way Out was the main highlight of Guerrero 's career , as it was where he won his only World Championship . John Cena began a rivalry with The Big Show over his WWE United States Championship and , at WrestleMania XX , Cena defeated Show to win the title . Goldberg and Lesnar continued their rivalry , leading to a match promoted at WrestleMania XX , in which Goldberg defeated Lesnar . After their match , Goldberg and Lesnar left the company , although Lesnar would make his return in April 2012 . 
 Rey Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero 's storyline over the WWE Cruiserweight Championship also continued , culminating in a battle royal match at WrestleMania XX involving other wrestlers . Guerrero last eliminated Mysterio to retain his title in this match . After the Draft Lottery , a mock sports draft lottery in which wrestlers switched programs , Rico was drafted to SmackDown ! , while Shelton Benjamin was drafted to Raw , in the process splitting up The World 's Greatest Tag Team . Afterward , Haas and Rico won the WWE Tag Team Championship from Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty on SmackDown !

 = Goin ' Home ( Archie Shepp and Horace Parlan album ) = 
 Goin ' Home is a studio album by American saxophonist Archie Shepp and pianist Horace Parlan . After their respective work in the avant @-@ garde jazz movement of the 1960s , Shepp and Parlan both faced career challenges as the jazz scene diverged stylistically . They left the United States for Europe during the 1970s and met each other in Denmark before recording the album on April 25 , 1977 , at Sweet Silence Studio in Copenhagen . 
 A jazz and gospel album , Goin ' Home features Shepp and Parlan 's interpretations of African @-@ American folk melodies and spirituals . Its title is an allusion to Shepp 's return to his African cultural roots . Shepp had never recorded spirituals before and was overcome with emotion during the album 's recording because of the historical and cultural context of the songs . 
 Although it surprised jazz listeners upon its release in 1977 , Goin ' Home was praised by music critics for its reverent tone and stylistic deviation from Shepp 's previous free jazz works . Shepp and Parlan were artistically satisfied with the album and subsequently recorded another album together , Trouble in Mind , in 1980 . Goin ' Home was reissued on CD by SteepleChase Records on May 3 , 1994 . 
 = = Background = = 
 After surging to the forefront of the avant @-@ garde jazz movement during the 1960s , both Archie Shepp and Horace Parlan faced career challenges during the 1970s after their style lost popularity in the jazz scene , which had split between artists who played either a tamer or a more experimental sound . Like Parlan , Shepp became a more mainstream performer , mostly playing hard bop , although he occasionally return to his free jazz sound . To support himself financially , he spent most of his time playing in Europe . In 1972 , Parlan also left the United States and eventually made his residence in Denmark , where Shepp had signed to SteepleChase Records . 
 Shepp became interested in recording gospel and , at the request of his producer at SteepleChase , recorded Goin ' Home with Parlan . They recorded the album on April 25 , 1977 , at Sweet Silence Studio in Copenhagen , Denmark . Shepp played tenor saxophone on six pieces and soprano saxophone on three others . 
 = = Music = = 
 According to music journalist Tom Moon , Goin ' Home is a reverent jazz and gospel album played with straightforward simplicity by Shepp and Parlan . They interpret nine traditional Negro spirituals , featuring African @-@ American folk melodies that originated from the 1920s and before . Along with Trouble in Mind and Looking at Bird in 1980 , Goin ' Home is part of a series of albums delineated in Shepp 's discography as " modular explorations of traditional musical styles " , which is itself in Shepp 's broader series of musical " portraits of the Diaspora " . The album 's title alludes to a return to African cultural roots . 
 Shepp viewed Goin ' Home as his attempt to cross the span of time and history between modern African Americans and the black slaves symbolized by the spirituals . In an interview for Down Beat , Shepp said that it was the first time he had recorded spirituals or made " any kind of serious statement about them " , and said that he started to cry when he started playing on the album due to " the strain , the spiritual weight of the moment " . He recalled being momentarily afraid that he would not be able to go through with the album 's recording because of his emotional state , which he explained : 
 The album has a melodic form , and employs pentatonic scales for melodic development , a practice common in African and African @-@ American folk music . Goin ' Home is mostly <unk> , as most of the pieces are performed in a rubato @-@ like free rhythm . Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and halts , particularly at the end of bars , phrases , and sections in a piece . Most of the spirituals have a thirty @-@ two @-@ bar form , with the eight @-@ bar section comprising four two @-@ bar phrases wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played . Shepp and Parlan 's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals . 
 Eschewing common jazz practice , Shepp does not improvise new melodic lines within the spirituals ' harmonic framework , but plays short , impromptu passages around a melodic idea . Parlan plays piano solos on only two of the album 's pieces . Shepp contributes a tonal roughness to the songs with growled sounds , which he plays by singing or humming into his saxophone . He also uses harmonic overtones , breathy tonal weight , and expressive chromatic development of melody to add textural and timbral variety to the songs . Shepp and Parlan 's reverent takes on " Amazing Grace " and Go Down Moses " exhibit split tones and <unk> . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Goin ' Home was released in 1977 by Danish record label SteepleChase Records . Jazz listeners were divided in their reaction to the album . According to Doug Ramsey of Texas Monthly , some listeners were surprised by Shepp 's stylistic change , while others viewed the record as a " fulfillment of promise " . Ramsey believed it revealed a " tenderness and humor " from Shepp that his 1960s work only hinted at , writing that it " disclosed an Archie Shepp that many had never known , warm rather than blistering hot , witty rather than contemptuously sardonic " . John Swenson , writing in The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide ( 1985 ) , praised Shepp 's work with Parlan and gave Goin ' Home a five @-@ star rating , finding it " particularly heartfelt . " Fernando Gonzalez of The Boston Globe called it " exquisite " , and C. Gerald Fraser of The New York Times wrote in 1987 that " this marriage of avant @-@ garde and soul " is " regarded as a classic . " Art Lange of CODA magazine praised Shepp 's " exquisite control " of his instrument , which he " quite literally " makes " able [ to ] talk " , and found the spirituals to have been " sung " rather than just performed . Lange added that the emotional aspect is more impressive than the technical skill and stated : 
 Both Shepp and Parlan were artistically satisfied with Goin ' Home and recorded another album together , the blues @-@ inspired Trouble in Mind , in 1980 . On May 3 , 1994 , the former album was reissued on CD by SteepleChase . 
 In The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide ( 1985 ) , Goin ' Home was given five stars and called " particularly heartfelt " . In a retrospective review for AllMusic , jazz critic Scott Yanow gave it four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars and found the performances " compelling " . He said listeners who are " only familiar with Shepp 's earlier Fire Music " will see the album as a " revelation . " Moon believed its <unk> mood " gives the themes an extra shot of majesty " and found it " supremely melodic " , writing that both Shepp and Parlan " do whatever is necessary to bring the spirit to the forefront . " Richard Cook gave it four out of four stars in The Penguin Guide to Jazz ( 2002 ) . JazzTimes cited Goin ' Home as one of " the finest [ albums ] of his career " , and Tom Hull of The Village Voice cited it as SteepleChase 's best release . Phil Johnson of The Independent wrote that the album " can be listened to almost without cease . " Jazz historian Eric <unk> called it " one of the most moving albums of the Seventies " , but qualified his praise by critiquing that Shepp , an iconic figure in free jazz , " was no longer the firebrand who had so frightened and unsettled some white critics and jazz fans . " <unk> felt that , like Pharoah Sanders , Shepp 's " trial by fire at the heart of the Sixties avant @-@ garde had made him an unusually expressive musician , " and Goin ' Home showed that he was " finding inspiration in the entire black musical tradition .

 = Hurricane Humberto ( 2007 ) = 
 Hurricane Humberto was a minimal hurricane that formed and intensified faster than any other North Atlantic tropical cyclone on record before landfall . Developing on September 12 , 2007 , in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico , the tropical cyclone rapidly strengthened and struck High Island , Texas , with winds of about 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) early on September 13 . It steadily weakened after moving ashore , and on September 14 it began dissipating over northwestern Georgia as it interacted with an approaching cold front . 
 Damage was fairly light , estimated at approximately $ 50 million ( 2007 USD ) . Precipitation peaked at 14 @.@ 13 inches ( 358 @.@ 9 mm ) , while wind gusts to 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) were reported . The heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding , which damaged or destroyed dozens of homes , and closed several highways . Trees and power lines were downed , knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of customers . The hurricane caused one fatality in the State of Texas . Additionally , as the storm progressed inland , rainfall was reported throughout the Southeast United States . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Humberto are from the remnants of a frontal trough — the same that spawned Tropical Storm Gabrielle — that moved offshore south Florida on September 5 . The combination of a weak surface trough and an upper @-@ level low pressure system produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms from western Cuba into the eastern Gulf of Mexico . Tracking slowly west @-@ northwestward , unfavorable wind shear initially inhibited tropical cyclone development . By late on September 11 , environmental conditions became more favorable , and the following morning convection increased over the disturbance . Tracking around the western periphery of a mid @-@ level ridge , the system turned on a slow northwest drift and quickly organized . Radar imagery reported loose banding features , and buoy data indicated the presence of a surface circulation ; based on the observations , the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Tropical Depression Nine , while located roughly 60 miles ( 100 km ) southeast of Matagorda , Texas . 
 Upon becoming a tropical cyclone , the depression was forecast to strengthen slowly to reach peak winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Within three hours of forming , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto . A small cyclone , the storm continued to organize quickly as it turned north @-@ northeastward , while radar imagery suggested the formation of an eye by early on September 13 . Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters , Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 0515 UTC on September 13 , while located about 15 miles ( 20 km ) off the coast of Texas . The hurricane made landfall a few miles to the east of High Island at around 0700 UTC . A well @-@ defined eye was maintained with strong convection around it , and Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) about two hours after landfall . However , post @-@ storm analysis later determined that the winds were a bit stronger — about 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . 
 Based on operational estimates of a wind speed increase of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , the National Hurricane Center reported that " no tropical cyclone in the historic record has ever reached this intensity at a faster rate near landfall . " The path of the eye continued northeastward and passed over Port Arthur , Nederland , Port Neches , Groves , and Bridge City , Texas at Category 1 hurricane strength . This was the second time within two years ( following Hurricane Rita on September 24 , 2005 ) that these cities experienced a direct hit from a hurricane . By eight hours after landfall , Humberto weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed into southwestern Louisiana . Increased upper @-@ level wind shear caused the storm to weaken rapidly over land , and late on September 13 Humberto weakened to a tropical depression . Upon issuing its last advisory , the National Hurricane Center remarked on the potential for the remnants of the storm to turn southward into the Gulf of Mexico . However , the storm continued northeastward through the southeastern United States , and on September 14 , the storm began dissipating over northwestern Georgia , and shortly thereafter degenerated into a remnant low pressure area . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Upon becoming a tropical cyclone , a tropical storm warning was issued from Port O 'Connor , Texas , to Cameron , Louisiana , and a tropical storm watch was posted from Cameron to Intracoastal City , Louisiana ; after Humberto became a tropical storm , the watch was upgraded to a warning . Upon reaching hurricane status , the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from High Island , Texas , to Cameron , Louisiana . An inland tropical storm warning was declared for several parishes in southwestern Louisiana . The National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center posted a tornado watch for southwestern coastal parishes . 
 Prior to moving ashore , officials in Calcasieu Parish , Louisiana , advised residents in low @-@ lying or flood @-@ prone areas to consider moving to a safer location . A shelter was opened in Lake Charles , where 29 people stayed during the storm . Flood watches and warnings were issued for portions of Mississippi and Louisiana as the storm tracked across the region . Texas Governor Rick Perry , prepared state resources for the potentially impacted areas , including the deployment of 200 Texas Military Forces soldiers and six Black Hawk helicopters and two water rescue teams for search and rescue missions . The Texas State Operations Center was activated shortly after the cyclone developed .

 A few hours prior to its development , outer rainbands from the depression began moving over portions of the Texas coast . Heavy rainfall from intense thunderstorms caused minor flooding as they crossed the coastline during the subsequent days ; precipitation in the state peaked at 14 @.@ 13 inches ( 358 @.@ 9 mm ) at East Bay Bayou , the highest recorded rainfall total in association with the hurricane . Sustained winds peaked at 69 mph ( 112 km / h ) with gusts to 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) at Sea Rim State Park ; the National Weather Service estimates gusts exceeded 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) in southwestern Jefferson County and extreme southeastern Chambers County . In the Golden Pass Ship Channel , an unofficial report of a 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) wind gust was relayed to the National Hurricane Center . Upon moving ashore , Humberto produced a minor storm surge in the state , peaking at 2 @.@ 86 feet ( 0 @.@ 87 m ) at <unk> Pass ; the combination of surge and waves resulted in light beach erosion . 
 Hurricane Humberto left 10 homes completely destroyed in Galveston County , with an additional 19 severely damaged in the county ; several homes received minor shingle damage , and road closures left about 5 @,@ 000 houses isolated in the county . The combination of saturated grounds and strong winds uprooted many trees and downed power lines across the path of the hurricane , with at least 50 high voltage transmission poles blown down or seriously damaged ; over 120 @,@ 000 power customers in Orange and Jefferson counties lost power , with 118 @,@ 000 <unk> customers in the state without electricity . Widespread flooding occurred in Jefferson and Orange counties , and at least 20 homes in Beaumont were flooded . Additionally , several roadways were flooded . The passage of the hurricane caused one fatality in the state ; a Bridge City man was killed when his carport crashed on him outside his house . Initially , press reports indicated that the storm wrought up to $ 500 million in damage ; however , final damage estimates were about $ 50 million . 
 Oil production was slowed as a result of Humberto , as at least four refineries — the Valero , ExxonMobil , Total SA and <unk> Enterprises LLC plants in Port Arthur — were halted due to the loss of power . Oil prices rose above $ 80 a barrel in <unk> trading on September 12 as a result , ending the next day at a record high of $ 80 @.@ 09 a barrel . Natural gas futures rose 8 percent ahead of the storm , but lost most of those gains the next day . 
 According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , 1 @,@ 464 residences throughout Texas were affected by Hurricane Humberto . Of these , 25 were destroyed , 96 sustained major damage and 240 sustained minor damage . The cost of individual assistance for those impacted by Humberto would cost $ 4 @,@ 776 @,@ 334 ; the cost of debris removal and other public assistance amounted to $ 6 @,@ 682 @,@ 074 . In terms of per capita income , Jefferson County sustained the most impact , decreasing by $ 22 @.@ 38 .

 Tracking through the state as a weakening tropical storm , Humberto produced light to moderate winds across southwestern Louisiana . Gusts officially peaked at 43 mph ( 69 km / h ) in the state , although an unofficial reading of 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) was reported in Vinton . Heavy rainfall occurred across the area , reaching a peak of 8 @.@ 25 inches ( 210 mm ) in <unk> . The rainfall triggered minor river flooding along the Vermilion River in Lafayette . Storm surge was minor in the state , peaking at 2 @.@ 13 feet ( 0 @.@ 65 m ) in <unk> Point ; no beach erosion was reported . 
 Widespread freshwater flooding occurred in Beauregard Parish , leaving homes in <unk> flooded . High water across the southwestern portion of the state resulted in the closure of several roadways , including U.S. Route 171 and various state highways . Isolated wind damage was reported , particularly near the Texas border , with some trees and power lines blown down . A total of about 13 @,@ 000 power customers lost electricity in southwestern Louisiana . One F1 tornado briefly touched down in Vermilion Parish , blowing the roof off one home and downing trees and power lines . Damage throughout Louisiana was estimated at $ 525 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Southeast United States = = = 
 After the circulation dissipated , the remnants of Humberto brought moderate rainfall to the southeastern states and spawned several tornadoes across portions of South Carolina and North Carolina and caused widespread damage in some locations . Heavy rains in Mississippi led to flooding in low @-@ lying areas . In Hinds County , a small rail bridge was washed out , forcing all passengers Amtrak train to take a bus to their destinations . One person was injured after driving his car into a flooded street . In Alabama , rainfall up to 5 @.@ 06 in ( 129 mm ) caused minor ponding in low @-@ lying areas but aided in short @-@ term drought relief . In northern Georgia , locally heavy rainfall led to flash flooding , resulting in several road closures . Strong thunderstorms associated with the remnants of Humberto also produced winds up to 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) and penny @-@ sized hail . Throughout North Carolina , ten F0 tornadoes were confirmed , resulting in minor damage to homes , though none caused injuries or fatalities . Heavy rains associated with the system also triggered flash flooding along some roads , resulting in their closure . In South Carolina , one F1 tornado touched down in Laurens County , causing moderate damage to several homes before lifting .

 Hours after Humberto made landfall , Rick Perry declared Galveston , Jefferson , and Orange counties as disaster areas , which allocated state resources to assist the affected residents . The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21 . Four Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three most affected counties . Following their assessment , they determined that the damage caused by Humberto was not significant enough to require a disaster declaration . As such , Governor Rick Perry 's request from FEMA was denied . Across the Bolivar Peninsula , an estimated 1 @,@ 500 cubic yards of structural debris and 3 @,@ 000 cubic yards of tree limbs were needed to be removed in the wake of the storm .

 Theoren Wallace " Theo " Fleury ( born June 29 , 1968 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player . Fleury played for the Calgary Flames , Colorado Avalanche , New York Rangers , and Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , Tappara of Finland 's SM @-@ liiga , and the Belfast Giants of the UK 's Elite Ice Hockey League . He was drafted by the Flames in the 8th round , 166th overall , at the 1987 NHL Entry Draft , and played over 1 @,@ 000 games in the NHL between 1989 and 2003 . 
 One of the smallest players of his generation , Fleury played a physical style that often led to altercations . As a junior , he was at the centre of the infamous Punch @-@ up in Piestany , a brawl that resulted in the disqualification of both Canada and the Soviet Union from the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships . Once considered unlikely to play in the NHL due to his small size , Fleury scored over 1 @,@ 000 points in his career and won the Stanley Cup in 1989 with the Flames . He twice represented Canada at the Winter Olympics , winning a gold medal in 2002 . Throughout his career , he battled drug and alcohol addictions that ultimately forced him out of the NHL in 2003 . He played one season in the British Elite Ice Hockey League in 2005 – 06 , and made two attempts to win the Allan Cup . After an unsuccessful NHL comeback attempt with the Flames , he retired in 2009 . 
 Outside of hockey , Fleury overcame his addictions , operated a concrete business in Calgary with his family , and filmed a pilot for a reality television show about it . He marketed his own brand of clothing , which led him to play two professional baseball games for the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League . In 1995 , he was diagnosed with Crohn 's disease , and his annual charity golf tournament has helped raise more than $ 1 million for the Crohn 's and Colitis Foundation of Canada . 
 Fleury co @-@ wrote Playing with Fire , a best @-@ selling autobiography released in October 2009 , in which he revealed that he had been sexually abused by former coach Graham James . Fleury filed a criminal complaint against James , who subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of sexual assault . Fleury has since become an advocate for sexual abuse victims and developed a career as a public speaker . He was a recipient of the <unk> Award in the sports category in 2013 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Fleury was born on June 29 , 1968 , in Oxbow , Saskatchewan , the first of Wally and Donna Fleury 's three sons . Wally was a hockey player whose dreams of a professional career ended when he broke his leg playing baseball in the summer of 1963 ; the injury helped fuel a drinking problem . Donna was a quiet , religious woman who battled drug addiction for many years . Fleury is of Métis heritage , as his grandmother Mary was Cree . The <unk> lived in Williams Lake , British Columbia , for four years , a period that saw Theo 's brother Ted born in 1970 , before settling in Russell , Manitoba , by 1973 , the year his youngest brother Travis was born . Wally worked as a truck driver and maintenance worker at the arena in Russell . 
 Always one of the smallest children in his class and without stable supervision at home , Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully . He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five . From that point on , he played hockey at every opportunity , often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre @-@ dawn hours . He was described by his teachers as a determined youth , who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right . 
 Although his mother was a Jehovah 's Witness , Fleury was raised as a Roman Catholic . He attended mass from age 6 to 12 , serving as an altar boy until the church 's priest died of a heart attack , depriving Fleury of one of his earliest positive influences . Always lacking money and a stable home , Fleury received support from the community , in particular the Peltz family in Russell , who ensured that he and his brothers were fed and bought them new clothes when required . In January 1982 , Fleury 's dreams of playing in the NHL nearly ended at the age of 13 when , during a game , he suffered a deep cut under his arm that severed his brachial artery . He missed nearly a year of contact hockey as a result . Five months after the incident , the community raised money to send him to the Andy Murray Hockey School in Brandon , Manitoba . It was there that Fleury met Graham James , who was working as a scout for the Winnipeg Warriors of the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) . James told Fleury that he had the skill to play in the NHL despite his size , and promised to recruit him to play junior hockey for the Warriors when he was old enough .

 = = = Junior = = = 
 Fleury began his junior career in 1983 – 84 as a 15 @-@ year @-@ old with the St. James Canadians of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League , scoring 33 goals and 64 points in 22 games , an incredible pace of nearly three points per game . In 1984 – 85 he moved to the Moose Jaw Warriors , who had just relocated from Winnipeg , scoring 29 goals and 75 points in 71 games as a 16 @-@ year @-@ old . He improved his totals in each of his four years in the WHL , culminating with a 68 @-@ goal , 92 @-@ assist season in 1987 – 88 . Fleury 's 160 points tied him for the league lead with Joe Sakic , and the two players shared the Bob Clarke Trophy as the WHL 's top scorers . Fleury 's 92 assists and 160 points remain team records ; he also holds the Warriors ' career records for goals ( 201 ) , assists ( 271 ) and points ( 472 ) . As of 2014 , he remains 10th all @-@ time in WHL scoring . 
 Always one of the smallest players in the game , Fleury learned early that he had to play an unpredictable style of game to survive against players much larger than he was . He found that the best way to protect himself was to intimidate his opponents by playing a feisty , physical game , which he said led to many retaliatory penalties and several arguments with his coaches . He recorded 235 minutes in penalties in his final year of junior , nearly 100 more than any of the other top 10 WHL scorers . Fleury retained this style of play throughout his hockey career , routinely surprising opponents who felt their size was an advantage . 
 Fleury twice represented Canada at the World Junior Hockey Championships . He first joined the team for the 1987 tournament in Piešťany , Czechoslovakia . The tournament is best remembered for the " Punch @-@ up in Piestany " on January 4 , 1987 , an infamous bench @-@ clearing brawl between the Canadians and the Soviet Union . Fleury scored the first goal of the game and , as part of his celebration , used his stick to mimic firing a machine gun at the Soviet bench , a move that was criticized by Canadian officials . The brawl began early in the second period with Canada leading 4 – 2 , when Pavel <unk> slashed Fleury , leading to a fight between the two . It quickly escalated into a line brawl involving all skaters on the ice , after which the Soviet players left their bench , followed closely by the Canadians . Both teams were disqualified from the tournament , costing Fleury and the Canadians a medal - – potentially the gold . 
 The International Ice Hockey Federation suspended all players involved in the brawl from participating in international tournaments for 18 months , though the bans were later reduced to 6 months on appeal . This reduction allowed Fleury to participate in the 1988 tournament in Moscow . He was named captain , finished second in team scoring with eight points in seven games , and was named a tournament all @-@ star as Canada won the gold medal . 
 Although he scored 129 points for the Warriors in 1986 – 87 , Fleury 's small stature led many teams to doubt that he could play in the NHL . The Calgary Flames drafted him in the 8th round , 166th overall , of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft . Upon completing his junior season in 1988 , Fleury signed his first professional contract , worth C $ 415 @,@ 000 , and joined the Flames ' International Hockey League ( IHL ) affiliate , the Salt Lake Golden Eagles . He scored seven points in two regular season games , then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the Turner Cup championship . 
 = = = Calgary Flames = = = 
 Fleury arrived at the Flames ' 1988 training camp 20 pounds ( 9 @.@ 1 kg ) overweight , and was assigned back to Salt Lake to begin the 1988 – 89 season . He averaged nearly two points per game , recording 37 goals and 37 assists to lead the IHL in scoring after 40 games . Mired in a slump , the Flames recalled Fleury on January 1 , 1989 , in the hope he could help their offence . He played his first NHL game against the Quebec Nordiques two nights later and recorded his first points – three assists – on January 5 against the Los Angeles Kings . He scored his first two NHL goals in a 7 – 2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on January 7 . Fleury continued to score , and finished with 34 points in 36 games in his NHL rookie season . He added 11 points in the playoffs , helping the Flames to the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history . 
 After improving to 33 goals in his first full season , Fleury broke out in 1990 – 91 , scoring 51 goals and 104 points to lead the Flames offensively . He played in the 1991 All @-@ Star Game , scoring a goal in an 11 – 5 victory by the Campbell Conference over the Wales Conference . Towards the end of the season , Fleury set a league record by scoring three shorthanded goals in one game against the St. Louis Blues . He shared the NHL Plus @-@ Minus Award with Marty McSorley , whom he tied for the league lead with + 48 . Fleury scored only two goals in the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs , but after his overtime winner in game six against the Oilers he famously slid the entire length of the ice in jubilation before crashing into the boards as his teammates attempted to catch up to him . The Flames were defeated in game seven , which ended their season . 
 Fleury fell back to 33 goals in 1991 – 92 as the Flames missed the playoffs . That season , he made his second All @-@ Star Game appearance , recording a goal for the Campbell Conference . Fleury finished with over 100 points for the second time in his career in 1992 – 93 to lead the team in scoring , and set a franchise record by going + 9 in a 13 – 1 victory over the San Jose Sharks on February 10 , 1993 , in which he scored six points . 
 The 1994 – 95 NHL lockout reduced the season to 48 games from 84 . During the lockout , Fleury played for Tappara in Finland 's top league , the SM @-@ liiga . He recorded 17 points in ten games before the NHL 's labour dispute was resolved , bringing him back to Calgary . Late in the season , Fleury recorded two goals and an assist against the Oilers on March 31 , 1995 , to surpass 500 career points . 
 Lacking a contract prior to the 1995 – 96 season , Fleury staged a brief hold @-@ out during training camp before signing a five @-@ year , $ 12 million deal with the Flames . He agreed to take less money than he could have received on the open market out of loyalty to the franchise that had given him his NHL opportunity . He missed much of the pre @-@ season with a stomach ailment , but joined the team for the season opener . Although he felt like somebody was " stabbing a knife in [ his ] gut every five minutes " , Fleury had played every game for the Flames when he revealed in December 1995 that he had been diagnosed with Crohn 's Disease and doctors had finally found the correct medication to control it . Despite the ailment , Fleury led the team in goals , assists and points , and played in his third All @-@ Star Game , serving as Calgary 's only representative . 
 When Joe Nieuwendyk refused to report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season , they named Fleury interim captain . The title was made permanent when Nieuwendyk was traded in December . Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy , but did so out of loyalty to the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role . He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach Pierre Pagé . 
 The Flames struggled in 1996 – 97 , finishing last in the Pacific Division and missing the playoffs for only the second time since their arrival in Calgary in 1980 . Fleury again led the team in scoring , but his 29 goals were the fewest he had scored in a full season in the NHL . He was the Flames ' lone representative at the 1997 All @-@ Star Game . He scored only 27 goals in 1997 – 98 , but increased his point total from 67 to 78 while also leading the team with 197 penalties in minutes . On November 29 , 1997 , Fleury scored his 315th career goal , breaking Nieuwendyk 's franchise record . The same day , he was named to Team Canada for the 1998 Winter Olympics . Fleury participated in his fifth All @-@ Star Game that season , but the Flames again missed the playoffs . 
 On February 19 , 1999 , he surpassed Al MacInnis as the franchise scoring leader with his <unk> career point . He held the record for ten years until surpassed by Jarome Iginla in 2009 . The Flames , who had been struggling financially and were unable to sign Fleury to a new contract , chose to trade him less than two weeks after he broke the record rather than risk losing him to free agency . He was dealt to the Colorado Avalanche on February 28 for René Corbet , Wade Belak and Robyn Regehr . Although it was expected to a certain extent , the trade nonetheless stunned fans in Calgary . His popularity was such that during a game in 1999 , after Fleury was sent off the ice to change a bloody jersey , a fan threw his own souvenir jersey over the boards so that Fleury would not miss a shift . He put the jersey on before realizing it was autographed and handed it back . 
 The trade was viewed as another sign that small @-@ market Canadian teams could no longer compete in the NHL . The economics of hockey had changed such that the Flames felt that they had to deal their top player despite being just two points out of a playoff spot . Following the trade , Fleury said that any team looking to sign him to a new contract would have to pay him $ 7 million per year . In his autobiography , Playing with Fire , Fleury claims that he was offered $ 16 million over four years by the Flames before the trade , and countered with an offer of $ 25 million over five years . 
 = = = Colorado , New York , and Chicago = = = 
 Fleury made his debut for the Avalanche the day after the trade and was met with loud cheers from the Denver crowd . He scored a goal in a 4 – 3 loss to Edmonton , but also sprained his knee and missed the next two weeks . He had missed only seven games during his 11 @-@ year career in Calgary . He played in 15 regular @-@ season games for the Avalanche , scoring 10 goals and 14 assists , and another 5 goals and 12 assists in 18 playoff games before the Avalanche were eliminated by the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Finals . 
 The Avalanche chose not to re @-@ sign Fleury , and he joined the New York Rangers on a three @-@ year contract worth $ 21 million that included a club option for a fourth year at $ 7 million . He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary , comments he later stated were directed at the Flames ' owners and not the team 's fans , whom he said always supported him . Fleury 's first year in Manhattan was a disappointment . He scored only 15 goals in 1999 – 2000 , struggling under the pressure of trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in New York . After the season , he voluntarily entered a league @-@ operated program that treats substance abuse and emotional problems , though he denied that either had any effect on his play . 
 Fleury rebounded to score 30 goals in 2000 – 01 and participated in his seventh All @-@ Star Game . He scored his 400th NHL goal on November 4 , 2000 , in a 5 – 2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens . Fleury was leading his team , and was fourth in the league , with 74 points in 62 games , when the Rangers announced that he had again entered the league 's substance abuse program . The decision ended his season . 
 Prior to the 2001 – 02 season Fleury said that he continued to struggle with substance abuse and had difficulty adapting to life in Manhattan after growing up in a Canadian prairie town of 1 @,@ 500 . He played all 82 games in 2001 – 02 , but his problems affected his behavior on the ice . After receiving a major and game misconduct penalty in a game against the San Jose Sharks on December 28 , he wound up in a confrontation with the Sharks ' mascot , S.J. <unk> , in a hallway of the HP Pavilion , reportedly breaking the rib of the mascot portrayer . Fleury himself later downplayed the incident , saying that he " nudged " <unk> . Upon taking a penalty in a January 2002 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins , Fleury left the arena rather than skate to the penalty box . He later apologized to his teammates , claiming he was deeply stressed by family problems . Two weeks later , he was fined $ 1 @,@ 000 for making an obscene gesture to fans of the New York Islanders who had been taunting him over his drug use . Towards the end of February , he lashed out against the league 's officials . He claimed they were not judging him fairly , and threatened to retire . The league dismissed his complaints . He did achieve a personal milestone during the season , however : on October 27 , 2001 , Fleury assisted on a goal by Mike York , scoring the 1,000th point of his NHL career . The Rangers presented him with a silver stick in honour of the achievement . 
 Following the season , the Rangers did not exercise their option , and traded Fleury 's playing rights to the San Jose Sharks , which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere . He did so with a two @-@ year , $ 8 @.@ 5 million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks . Two days prior to the opening of the 2002 – 03 season , he was suspended by the NHL for violating the terms of the league 's substance abuse program . The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury 's friends , also a recovering alcoholic , to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL 's aftercare program . 
 Fleury missed the first two months of the season before being reinstated . While out with teammates in January 2003 , he was involved in a drunken brawl with bouncers at a strip club in Columbus , Ohio , that left him bloodied ; he has no memory of the night and described it as among the lowest points of his life . He was not suspended , but the incident contributed to a collapse in the standings by the Blackhawks , and they placed him on waivers in March . No team claimed him , and Fleury finished the season with the Blackhawks , recording 12 goals and 21 assists in 54 games . Following the season , in April 2003 , he was suspended again by the league for violations of its substance abuse program . The suspension ended his NHL career .

 In January 2005 , Fleury announced that he had joined his cousin Todd Holt and former NHL players Gino Odjick , Sasha <unk> and Dody Wood in playing for the Horse Lake Thunder of the North Peace Hockey League for the Allan Cup , Canada 's national senior amateur championship . He also hoped to serve as a role model for kids on the Horse Lake First Nation . Hockey Alberta initially ruled that he was ineligible to play senior hockey in 2004 – 05 because he had been signed to a professional contract during the 2003 – 04 season . Hockey Alberta denied an appeal , citing a new policy it had put in effect to prevent NHL players from joining senior teams during the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout . It reversed its decision on a second appeal after the NHL and National Hockey League Players Association both agreed that Fleury was a free agent , and not a locked @-@ out player . Fleury played his first game for the Thunder on January 22 , 2005 , scoring a goal and two assists . 
 Fleury remained embroiled in controversy at the 2005 Allan Cup tournament . The Thunder were repeatedly accused of paying players despite being an amateur team , and Fleury angrily denied rumours that he was secretly being paid $ 100 @,@ 000 . Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder , and after it was eliminated in the semi @-@ finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal : " The one thing that 's really bothered me through this whole thing is the prejudice , still , in this country when it comes to native people . I 've seen it first @-@ hand in every building we go into , how these people are treated , and it 's absolutely embarrassing to be a Canadian and know that stuff is still going on . " 
 Fleury was convinced by a friend to move to Northern Ireland to play with the Belfast Giants of the Elite Ice Hockey League ( EIHL ) for the 2005 – 06 season . He scored three goals and added four assists and a fight in his first game , against the Edinburgh Capitals . He scored 22 goals and 52 assists in 34 games , as Belfast won the regular season league title . Described as the " most talented " player ever to play in the United Kingdom , Fleury was named the EIHL 's Player of the Year and voted a first team All @-@ Star by the British Ice Hockey Writers Association . Fleury argued with visiting fans , as well as officials , which led him not to return to Belfast in 2006 – 07 . 
 In late 2008 , Fleury joined his brother Ted with the Steinbach North Stars in a second bid to win the Allan Cup . He played 13 league games , scoring eight goals and 19 assists . At the 2009 Allan Cup tournament , he recorded a goal and an assist to lead the host North Stars to a 5 – 0 win in their opening game , and finished tied for the lead in tournament scoring at seven points . The North Stars lost the semi @-@ finals to the South East Prairie Thunder , 4 – 2 . 
 = = = NHL comeback attempt = = = 
 Unhappy with how his NHL career ended , Fleury hired a personal trainer in February 2009 and began an attempt to return to the NHL . By August , he petitioned Commissioner Gary Bettman to lift his suspension . He was reinstated on September 10 following a meeting with Bettman , Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and league doctors . Fleury then accepted a try @-@ out offer from the Flames . He said he wanted to prove to himself that he could still play at the NHL level , though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments and the failure of his concrete business , as well as the planned release of his autobiography , and argued Fleury 's comeback was financially motivated . 
 He made his return to the NHL in an exhibition game in Calgary against the New York Islanders on September 17 on a line with Daymond Langkow and Nigel Dawes . Fleury was met with loud cheers throughout the game , and scored the only goal in a shootout to give the Flames a 5 – 4 win . After the game , he saluted the crowd as the fans chanted " Theo ! Theo ! Theo ! " Three nights later , he scored a goal and an assist in a 5 – 2 victory over the Florida Panthers . 
 Fleury played four exhibition games , scoring four points , before being released by the Flames . General Manager Darryl Sutter expressed his pride in Fleury 's attempt and commended his effort , but decided he was not one of the top six wingers in camp , which Sutter and Fleury had agreed was a condition of the tryout continuing . On September 28 , 2009 , Fleury announced his retirement at a news conference at the Saddledome . He thanked the Flames for allowing him to attempt the comeback , and expressed satisfaction at how his career ended . " I get to retire a Calgary Flame . I <unk> to retire a Calgary Flame . It ’ s been a long journey . It ’ s time to put down some roots . And there ’ s no better place than here , " said Fleury of his decision not to seek an offer from another team .

 Fleury made his debut with the Canadian senior team at the 1990 World Hockey Championships , scoring 11 points in nine games for the fourth @-@ place Canadians . He returned the following year despite a knee injury , helping Canada win the silver medal at the 1991 tournament . His 51 @-@ goal NHL season in 1990 – 91 also earned Fleury a spot at the 1991 Canada Cup , where he scored a goal and four assists in seven games for the tournament champion Canadians . Five years later , he played in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey , the successor to the Canada Cup . He finished fourth in the tournament with four goals , but Canada finished in second place after giving up four goals in the final four minutes of the championship game against the American team . 
 National Hockey League players were first allowed to participate in the Olympic ice hockey tournament at the 1998 games . Invited to join Canada 's " Dream Team " , Fleury described his selection as a highlight of his life . He scored a goal for Canada , who lost their semi @-@ final match @-@ up against the Czech Republic in a shootout and failed to medal . Four years later , Fleury was invited by General Manager Wayne Gretzky to participate in Canada 's selection camp for the 2002 Olympics . The invitation was controversial , as his behavioural and substance abuse issues had become increasingly public in previous months . Fleury wanted to justify Gretzky 's support and , knowing that he would be removed from consideration if he failed , refrained from drinking or taking drugs during the 2001 – 02 NHL season , later describing himself as a " dry drunk " . He earned a spot on the team and recorded two assists in six games as the Canadian hockey team won its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years . Fleury considers the championship to be the pinnacle of his career . 
 = = Off the ice = = 
 Fleury continued to battle drug and alcohol addictions , revealing in a November 2004 interview that he had not overcome the problems that ended his NHL career a year and a half earlier . He credits his second wife , Jennifer , with turning his life around after they met when he was playing for Horse Lake in 2005 . Fleury feared that Jennifer 's frustration with his drug use would cost him the relationship , and , with her help , quit drugs and drinking on September 18 , 2005 . They were married one year later and have a daughter , <unk> . Fleury also has a son and daughter , Beaux and <unk> , from his relationship with his first wife , Veronica , and a son , Josh , born in 1987 to his high school girlfriend , Shannon . 
 In 1994 , Fleury joined a group that involved his former junior coach , Graham James , fellow NHL player Joe Sakic , and professional wrestler Bret Hart as a minority owner of the expansion Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League . He sold his share of the team to the Flames in 1997 in the aftermath of James ' conviction for sexually abusing Sheldon Kennedy and another player . After returning from Northern Ireland , he operated Fleury 's Concrete Coatings , a concrete sealing business he started with his wife Jennifer and brother Travis , until it closed in 2009 . He filmed a pilot episode in 2007 for a reality TV series based on his concrete business called Theoren Fleury : Rock Solid : " We want to show people that if you have a dream , anything is possible with a little ambition , " Fleury said of the show . It was not picked up by any network . 
 The 2008 launch of clothing line " <unk> " ( Fleury 's Artistic Kustom Enterprises ) led him to approach the Calgary Vipers of the Golden Baseball League in the hope of convincing them to use his brand of practice jerseys . The conversation led to talk of Fleury playing a game for the Vipers as a publicity stunt . He made his professional baseball debut on August 9 , 2008 , at the age of 40 , hitting a single in a pinch @-@ hit appearance against the Yuma Scorpions . He started the second game at left field and struck out twice before he was replaced . " I 've had so many things happen in my life already that I sometimes surprise myself with the things I 've done , the things I 've accomplished . This was just another one of those days , " Fleury said of his appearance with the Vipers . 
 Fleury has organized or participated in numerous charitable causes . He launched a hockey school in the mid @-@ 1990s that ran for seven years in Calgary and another eight in Russell , and donated the proceeds to minor hockey associations . Following his diagnosis with Crohn 's disease in 1995 , Fleury joined with the Crohn 's and Colitis Foundation of Canada to host an annual golf tournament in Calgary . The event has raised over $ 1 million , and is one of the organization 's largest fundraising events in the Calgary area . He participates in Flames Alumni events and volunteers with the Calgary Dream Centre , which helps people overcome addiction . 
 Fleury was a participant on the second season of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation figure skating reality show Battle of the Blades , aired in the fall of 2010 , and was donating his winnings to The Men 's Project , a charity that provides support for men abused in childhood . His partner was Jamie Salé and the pair finished 5th . 
 = = = Autobiography = = = 
 With the help of Kirstie McLellan Day , Fleury wrote his autobiography , Playing with Fire , which was released on October 16 , 2009 . In it , he alleged that he was sexually abused by Graham James over a period of two years . While he stated he " doesn 't want to become the poster boy for abuse by James " , Fleury hoped that speaking out might make it easier for other childhood sexual abuse victims to come forward . He blamed the abuse for turning him into a " raging , alcoholic lunatic " , and claimed to have placed a loaded gun in his mouth and contemplated suicide in 2004 . He revealed that he had spent most of his income on alcohol , drugs , gambling and women . Fleury also claimed that he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers , but that the league did not want to suspend him because he was a leading scorer . The league disputed this , and stated that its substance abuse program functioned appropriately . 
 Playing with Fire became the top seller on <unk> within a week of its release , and Fleury stated that he had been contacted by several sexual abuse victims who were motivated by his book to seek help . He also revealed that he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James , and had begun volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims . Fleury was surprised that his story became the top @-@ selling non @-@ fiction book in Canada ; without help , he and his wife were unable to keep up with the mail they were receiving . It is the second book about Fleury 's life , following Fury , released in 1997 , which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time . 
 Sheldon Kennedy , who was also a victim of James , encouraged Fleury to press charges . Fleury met with Winnipeg police in January 2010 , who began an investigation when he formally filed a complaint . James ultimately pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his abuse of Fleury and his cousin Todd Holt . James was sentenced to two years in prison , a decision which sparked outrage across Canada for its perceived leniency . Fleury praised the response by Canadians and stated his desire to use it to press for changes to the legal system . Fleury is now a motivational speaker , hoping that sharing his story will encourage others to seek help for their problems . 
 McLellan Day adapted the autobiography into a one @-@ man play , entitled Playing with Fire : The Theo Fleury Story , which was produced by Alberta Theatre Projects in Calgary . The play made its world premiere May 1 , 2012 . Fleury and his autobiography were also the subject of a 2012 documentary by HBO Canada .

 In September 2015 it was announced through Fleury 's Twitter account he had been working on a Country music record to be released in the fall of 2015 . He released his first single titled " My Life 's Been a Country Song " and it reached over 20 @,@ 000 plays on Soundcloud within the first 24 hours of being released . His debut record I Am Who I Am was released on October 16 , 2015 through eOne Music Canada and has been well received by country music fanatics . The hockey star turned Country star transformation did not happen overnight as Fleury claims this project has been ongoing for the past six years with him receiving vocal and performance training from industry professionals . He collaborated with long @-@ time friends Phil Deschambault and Paddy <unk> and together they created over 30 songs worth of material that would be later cut to ten songs for the album .

 = Carnotaurus = 
 Carnotaurus / <unk> / is a genus of large theropod dinosaur that lived in South America during the Late Cretaceous period , between about 72 and 69 @.@ 9 million years ago . The only species is Carnotaurus sastrei . Known from a single well @-@ preserved skeleton , it is one of the best @-@ understood theropods from the Southern Hemisphere . The skeleton , found in 1984 , was uncovered in the Chubut Province of Argentina from rocks of the La Colonia Formation . Derived from the Latin <unk> [ <unk> ] ( " flesh " ) and taurus ( " bull " ) , the name Carnotaurus means " meat @-@ eating bull " , alluding to its bull @-@ like horns . Carnotaurus is a derived member of the Abelisauridae , a group of large theropods that occupied the large predatorial niche in the southern <unk> of Gondwana during the late Cretaceous . The phylogenetic relations of Carnotaurus are uncertain ; it may have been closer to either Majungasaurus or Aucasaurus . 
 Carnotaurus was a lightly built , bipedal predator , measuring 8 to 9 m ( 26 to 30 ft ) in length and weighing at least 1 @.@ 35 metric tons ( 1 @.@ 33 long tons ; 1 @.@ 49 short tons ) . As a theropod , Carnotaurus was highly specialized and distinctive . It had thick horns above the eyes , a feature unseen in all other carnivorous dinosaurs , and a very deep skull sitting on a muscular neck . Carnotaurus was further characterized by small , vestigial forelimbs and long and slender hindlimbs . The skeleton is preserved with extensive skin impressions , showing a mosaic of small , non @-@ overlapping scales measuring approximately 5 mm in diameter . The mosaic was interrupted by large bumps that lined the sides of the animal , and there are no hints of feathers . 
 The distinctive horns and the muscular neck may have been used in fighting conspecifics . According to separate studies , rivaling individuals may have combated each other with quick head blows , by slow pushes with the upper sides of their skulls , or by ramming each other head @-@ on , using their horns as shock absorbers . The feeding habits of Carnotaurus remain unclear : some studies suggest the animal was able to hunt down very large prey such as sauropods , while other studies find it preyed mainly on relatively small animals . Carnotaurus was well adapted for running and was possibly one of the fastest large theropods . 
 = = Description = = 
 Carnotaurus was a large but lightly built predator . The only known individual was about 8 – 9 metres ( 26 – 30 ft ) in length , making Carnotaurus one of the largest abelisaurids . Only Ekrixinatosaurus and possibly Abelisaurus may have been similar or larger in size , though the incomplete remains of these genera make size estimations imprecise . Its mass is estimated to have been 1 @,@ 350 kg ( 1 @.@ 33 long tons ; 1 @.@ 49 short tons ) 1 @,@ 500 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 long tons ; 1 @.@ 7 short tons ) and 2 @,@ 100 kg ( 2 @.@ 1 long tons ; 2 @.@ 3 short tons ) in separate studies that used different estimation methods . Carnotaurus was a highly specialized theropod , as seen especially in characteristics of the skull , the vertebrae and the forelimbs . The pelvis and hindlimbs , on the other hand , remained relatively conservative , resembling those of the more basal Ceratosaurus . Both the pelvis and hindlimb bones were long and slender . The left thigh bone of the individual measures 103 cm in length , but shows an average diameter of only 11 cm . 
 = = = Skull = = = 
 The skull , measuring 59 @.@ 6 cm ( 23 @.@ 5 in ) in length , was proportionally shorter and deeper than in any other large carnivorous dinosaur . The snout was moderately broad , not as tapering as seen in more basal theropods like Ceratosaurus , and the jaws were curved upwards . As in other abelisaurids , the facial bones , especially the nasal bones , were sculptured with numerous small holes and spikes . In life , a wrinkled and possibly keratinous skin would have covered these bones . A prominent pair of horns protruded obliquely above the eyes . These horns , formed by the frontal bones , were thick , cone @-@ shaped but in cross @-@ section somewhat vertically flattened , and measured 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in length . In life , they would probably have formed the bony cores of much longer keratinous horns . The proportionally small eyes were situated in the upper part of the keyhole shaped <unk> ( eye sockets ) . The upper part was slightly rotated forward , probably permitting some degree of binocular vision . 
 The teeth were long and slender , as opposed to the usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids . On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth , while the lower jaws were equipped with fifteen dentary teeth per side . In contrast to the robust @-@ looking skull , the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed , with the dentary ( the foremost jaw bone ) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points . The lower jaw was found with hyoid bones , in the position they would be in if the animal was alive . These slender bones , supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles , are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily . 
 = = = Vertebrae = = = 
 The vertebral column consisted of ten cervical ( neck ) , twelve dorsal , six fused sacral and an unknown number of caudal ( tail ) vertebrae . The neck was nearly straight , rather than having the S @-@ curve seen in other theropods , and also unusually wide , especially towards its base . The top of the neck 's spinal column featured a double row of enlarged , upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses , creating a smooth trough on the top of the neck vertebrae . These processes were the highest points of the spine , towering above the unusually low spinous processes . The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature . A similar double row was also present in the tail , formed there by highly modified caudal ribs , in front view protruding upwards in a V @-@ shape , their inner sides creating a smooth , flat , top surface of the front tail vertebrae . The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook @-@ shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The forelimbs were proportionally shorter than in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs , including Tyrannosaurus . The forearm was only a quarter the size of the upper arm . There were no <unk> in the hand , so that the metacarpals articulated directly with the forearm . The hand showed four basic digits , though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones , while the fourth consisted of a single splint @-@ like metacarpal that may have represented an external ' spur ' . The fingers themselves were fused and immobile , and may have lacked claws . Carnotaurus differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs , and in having the fourth , splint @-@ like metacarpal as the longest bone in the hand . A 2009 study suggests that the arms were vestigial in abelisaurids , because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today 's emus and kiwis , which also have vestigial forelimbs . 
 = = = Skin = = = 
 Carnotaurus was the first theropod dinosaur discovered with comprehensive fossil skin impressions . These impressions , found beneath the skeleton 's right side , come from different body parts , including the lower jaw , the front of the neck , the shoulder girdle , and the rib cage . The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail . Originally , the right side of the skull also was covered with large patches of skin — this was not recognized when the skull was prepared , and these patches were accidentally destroyed . Still , the surface texture of much of the right side of the skull is very different from that of the left side , and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head . 
 The skin was built up of a mosaic of polygonal , non @-@ overlapping scales measuring approximately 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) in diameter . This mosaic was divided by thin , parallel grooves . Scalation was similar across different body parts with the exception of the head , which apparently showed a different , irregular pattern of scales . There is no evidence of feathers . Uniquely for theropods , there were large knob @-@ like bumps running along the sides of the neck , back and tail in irregular rows . Each bump showed a low ridge and measured 4 to 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter . They were set 8 to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 to 3 @.@ 9 in ) apart from each other and became larger towards the animal 's top . The bumps probably represent clusters of condensed scutes , similar to those seen on the soft frill running along the body midline in hadrosaurid ( " duck @-@ billed " ) dinosaurs . Stephen Czerkas ( 1997 ) suggested that these structures may have protected the animal 's sides while fighting members of the same species ( conspecifics ) and other theropods , arguing that similar structures can be found on the neck of the modern iguana where they provide limited protection in combat . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Carnotaurus is one of the best @-@ understood genera of the Abelisauridae , a family of large theropods restricted to the ancient southern supercontinent Gondwana . Abelisaurids were the dominant predators in the Late Cretaceous of Gondwana , replacing the carcharodontosaurids and occupying the ecological niche filled by the tyrannosaurids in the northern continents . Several notable traits that evolved within this family , including shortening of the skull and arms as well as peculiarities in the cervical and caudal vertebrae , were more pronounced in Carnotaurus than in any other abelisaurid . 
 Though relationships within the Abelisauridae are debated , Carnotaurus is consistently shown to be one of the most derived members of the family by cladistical analyses . Its nearest relative may have been either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus ; this ambiguity is largely due to the incompleteness of the Aucasaurus skull material . A recent review suggests that Carnotaurus was not closely related with either Aucasaurus or Majungasaurus , and instead proposed Ilokelesia as its sister taxon . 
 Carnotaurus is eponymous for two subgroups of the Abelisauridae : the Carnotaurinae and the Carnotaurini . Paleontologists do not universally accept these groups . The Carnotaurinae was defined to include all derived abelisaurids with the exclusion of Abelisaurus , which is considered a basal member in most studies . However , a 2008 review suggested that Abelisaurus was a derived abelisaurid instead . Carnotaurini was proposed to name the clade formed by Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus ; only those paleontologists who consider Aucasaurus as the nearest relative of Carnotaurus use this group . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The only skeleton ( holotype MACN @-@ CH 894 ) was unearthed in 1984 by an expedition led by Argentinian paleontologist José Bonaparte . This expedition also recovered the peculiar spiny sauropod Amargasaurus . It was the eighth expedition within the project named " Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America " , which started in 1976 and which was sponsored by the National Geographic Society . The skeleton is well @-@ preserved and articulated ( still connected together ) , with only the posterior two thirds of the tail , much of the lower leg , and the hind feet being destroyed by weathering . During fossilization , the skull and especially the muzzle were crushed laterally , while the premaxilla were pushed upwards onto the nasal bones . As a result , the upward curvature of the upper jaw is artificially exaggerated in the holotype . The skeleton belonged to an adult individual , as indicated by the fused sutures in the braincase . It was found lying on its right side , showing a typical death pose with the neck bent back over the torso . Unusually , it is preserved with extensive skin impressions . In view of the significance of these impressions , a second expedition was started to reinvestigate the original excavation site , leading to the recovery of several additional skin patches . 
 The skeleton was collected on a farm named " <unk> Sastre " near <unk> Moreno in the <unk> Department of Chubut Province , Argentina . Because it was embedded in a large hematite concretion , a very hard kind of rock , preparation was complicated and progressed slowly . In 1985 , Bonaparte published a note presenting Carnotaurus sastrei as a new genus and species and briefly describing the skull and lower jaw . The generic name ( Latin <unk> [ <unk> ] – " flesh " and taurus – " bull " ) refers to the bull @-@ like horns , while the specific name sastrei honors Angel Sastre , the owner of the ranch where the skeleton was found . A comprehensive description of the whole skeleton followed in 1990 . After Abelisaurus , Carnotaurus was the second member of the family Abelisauridae that was discovered . For years , it was by far the best @-@ understood member of its family , and also the best @-@ understood theropod from the Southern Hemisphere . It was not until the 21st century that similar well @-@ preserved abelisaurids were described , including Aucasaurus , Majungasaurus and <unk> , allowing scientists to re @-@ evaluate certain aspects of the anatomy of Carnotaurus . The holotype skeleton is displayed in the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences , Bernardino Rivadavia ; replicas can be seen in this and other museums around the world . Sculptors Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas manufactured a life @-@ sized sculpture of Carnotaurus that is now on display in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County . This sculpture , ordered by the museum during the mid @-@ 1980s , is probably the first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin . 
 = = Age and paleoecology = = 
 Originally , the rocks in which Carnotaurus was found were assigned to the upper part of the <unk> <unk> Formation , which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old ( Albian or Cenomanian stage ) . Later they were realized to pertain to the much younger La Colonia Formation , dating 72 to 69 @.@ 9 million years ago ( Late Cretaceous , Lower Maastrichtian stage ) . Thus , Carnotaurus was the latest South American abelisaurid known . By the Late Cretaceous , South America was already isolated from both Africa and North America . 
 The La Colonia Formation is exposed over the southern slope of the North Patagonian Massif . Most vertebrate fossils , including Carnotaurus , come from the formation 's middle section ( called the middle facies association ) . This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of estuaries , tidal flats or coastal plains . The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods . The most common vertebrates collected include <unk> lungfish , turtles , crocodiles , plesiosaurs , dinosaurs , lizards , snakes and mammals . Some of the snakes that have been found belong to the families <unk> and <unk> , such as <unk> <unk> . Turtles are represented by at least five taxa , four from <unk> ( <unk> ) and one from <unk> ( <unk> ) . Among the marine reptiles is the plesiosaur <unk> <unk> of the family <unk> . Mammals are represented with <unk> <unk> , which was considered the first record of a South American <unk> , and Argentodites coloniensis , possibly of Multituberculata . In 2011 , the discovery of a new enantiornithine bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced .

 = = = Function of the horns = = = 
 Carnotaurus is the only known carnivorous bipedal animal with a pair of horns on the frontal bone . The use of these horns is not entirely clear ; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics , in display , or in killing prey . 
 Greg Paul ( 1988 ) proposed that the horns were butting weapons and that the small <unk> would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting . Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues ( 1998 ) suggested that Carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams . They calculated that the neck musculature was strong enough to absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5 @.@ 7 m / s each . Fernando Novas ( 2009 ) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head . He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia , while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows . He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck . 
 Other studies suggest that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows , but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls . Thus , the horns may have been a device for the distribution of compression forces without damage to the brain . This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns , the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull , and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows . 
 Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues ( 1998 ) propose that the horns might also have been used to injure or kill small prey . Though horn cores are blunt , they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering . However , this would be the only reported example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals . 
 = = = Jaw function and diet = = = 
 Analysis of the jaw design of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues ( 1998 , 2004 , 2009 ) suggests that the animal was capable of quick bites , but not strong ones . Quick bites are more important than strong bites when capturing small prey , as shown by studies of modern @-@ day crocodiles . Furthermore , these researchers noted a high degree of flexibility ( <unk> ) within the skull and especially the lower jaw , somewhat similar to modern snakes . Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole . In addition , the front part of the lower jaw was hinged , and thus able to move up and down . When pressed downwards , the teeth would have projected forward , allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items ; when the teeth were curved upwards , the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping . Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items . Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey , but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs . 
 This interpretation was questioned by François Therrien and colleagues ( 2005 ) , who found that the biting force of Carnotaurus was twice as high as that of the American alligator , which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod . These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons : the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly , indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey . As a consequence , according to this study , Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals , possibly by ambush . 
 Robert Bakker ( 1998 ) found that Carnotaurus mainly fed upon very large prey , especially sauropods . As he noted , several adaptations of the skull — the short snout , the relatively small teeth and the strong back of the skull ( occiput ) — had independently evolved in Allosaurus . These features suggest that the upper jaw was used like a serrated club to inflict wounds ; big sauropods would have been weakened by repeated attacks . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 Mazzetta and colleagues ( 1998 , 1999 ) presumed that Carnotaurus was a swift runner , arguing that the thigh bone was adapted to withstand high bending moments while running . The ability of an animal 's leg to withstand those forces limits its top speed . The running adaptations of Carnotaurus would have been better than those of a human , although not nearly as good as those of an ostrich . Scientists calculate that Carnotaurus had a top speed of up to 48 – 56 km ( 30 – 35 mi ) per hour . 
 In dinosaurs , the most important locomotor muscle was located in the tail . This muscle , called caudofemoralis , attaches to the fourth trochanter , a prominent ridge on the thigh bone , and pulls the thigh bone backwards when contracted . Scott Persons and Phil Currie ( 2011 ) note that in the tail vertebrae of Carnotaurus the caudal ribs did not protrude horizontally ( " T @-@ shaped " ) , but were angled against the vertical axis of the vertebrae , forming a " V " . This would have provided additional space for a caudofemoralis muscle larger than in any other theropod — the muscle mass was calculated at 111 to 137 kilograms ( 245 to 302 lb ) per leg . Therefore , Carnotaurus could have been one of the fastest large theropods . While the caudofemoralis muscle was enlarged , the <unk> muscles situated above the caudal ribs would have been proportionally smaller . These muscles , called the longissimus and <unk> muscle , were responsible for tail movement and stability . To maintain tail stability in spite of reduction of these muscles , the caudal ribs bear forward projecting processes interlocking the vertebrae with each other and with the pelvis , stiffening the tail . As a consequence , the ability to make tight turns would have been diminished , because the hip and tail had to be turned simultaneously , unlike in other theropods .

I don 't need additional footage , you know ? " 
 The president of entertainment for MTV , Brian Graden , commented that the series benefits from the media coverage it receives in between seasons , which he described as a " six @-@ month commercial for the show that doesn 't five away the narrative in full . " He elaborated that MTV wants " viewers to watch Lauren and the girls as the characters we know instead of in a show about being the stars of The Hills " ; the sex tape rumors were consequently presented like a personal conflict between the women , and was intentionally not addressed as a highly publicized controversy . 
 The ensuing feud between Conrad and Montag received extensive media attention since its beginning ; Conrad was doubtful of the possibility of a reconciliation , noting that " I can see us getting to not hating each other but I don 't think we would ever go back to being best friends . " When addressing speculation that the conflict was fabricated for television , Conrad stated that " I wouldn 't fight for the camera . If anything I would try not to . " In a separate interview , she revealed that she almost quit the program before the season began , stating " it wasn 't so much about the filming , but I didn 't want to do a show with the other people on it " , which was assumed to be alluding to Montag and Pratt .

" A writer for The Hollywood Gossip stated that the episode " didn 't disappoint " , and felt that the storyline clearly categorized Patridge and Port as being part of " Team Lauren " and Pratt as being part of " Team Heidi " in the " epic war " . 
 Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times felt that the deterioration of Conrad and Montag 's friendship was " more convincing than Friends and just about any other comedy about female relationships because — as anyone who has ever been a young woman knows — undying friendships die . " Writing for Los Angeles Times , Denise Martin was complimentary of the fact that the conflict was " unsullied " despite the extensive media coverage it received before the season began , and added that it was " better than anything you 'd get on All My Children .

 = Blue Dragon = 
 Blue Dragon ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Burū Doragon ) is a role @-@ playing video game developed by Mistwalker and Artoon and published by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for the Xbox 360 . Blue Dragon is based on a design by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi , who also supervised development and wrote the plot . It is both Mistwalker 's debut title and the first title to be helmed by Sakaguchi outside of Square Enix . The game was released in Japan on December 7 , 2006 , where it was sold both as a standalone title and as part of a bundle with the Xbox 360 ( including the game , the Xbox 360 system itself , and a Blue Dragon console skin ) . Other regions received only the game itself , with a release in Europe on August 24 , 2007 , and in North America on August 28 , 2007 . 
 Taking place in a fictional open @-@ world environment , the story of Blue Dragon focuses on five friends ( Shu , Jiro , Kluke , Zola , and <unk> ) as they travel across the world to confront Nene , the evil ruler of the Grand Kingdom . The setting inspired separate anime and manga adaptations , although these follow the story to different degrees and feature a different cast of characters . The game follows a traditional role @-@ playing design , based around exploration and turn @-@ based combat . 
 Blue Dragon is the first Xbox 360 title to make use of multiple discs , spanning three discs in total . Overall , the game has received a positive reception , with an average score of 77 @.@ 48 % on the review aggregator website Game Rankings . Blue Dragon was both applauded and criticized for its adaptation of the traditional elements of role @-@ playing games . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay of Blue Dragon uses turn @-@ based gameplay elements seen in older Japanese role @-@ playing video games . The game world contains two major types of areas : towns , in which the player can rest and purchase items , and dungeon @-@ like areas , with numerous foes to be defeated . 
 = = = Exploration = = = 
 Players are initially able to walk between locations on the overworld , and later gain the ability to teleport to previously visited locations . The player controls a party of characters , but only one is shown when exploring the overworld . The player is able to cast magic outside of combat situations based on each character 's respective abilities . When combat begins , the entire party appears for battle . Enemies are visible to the player while exploring the game world , and can be avoided . At the same time , players can choose to engage enemies by luring them close and them activating a circle which will allow players to fight multiple monsters at a time . In some cases , specific foes will block a path or desired treasure chest and must be defeated to proceed . Other foes will pursue the player 's character once the player is spotted , but players can elude them if they flee far enough . Frequently , a single enemy or monster displayed on the screen actually represents a number of different foes of potentially different types . 
 Combat begins differently depending on how the player avatar makes contact with the monster . If the avatar strikes an enemy from behind , they take the advantage in battle with a " Back Attack " . Similarly , if the avatar is struck from behind , the enemy takes the advantage in a " Surprise Attack " . Players can also choose to fight several groups of monsters at once , with each combat taking place immediately after the previous one . A player who successfully employs this tactic is rewarded with bonuses . Players may use " field skills " to aid in controlling enemy encounters , such as using bombs to paralyze enemies . In rare cases , two groups of monsters may be of rival species , in which case a " Monster Fight " will occur , with both monster groups appearing at once and focusing on each other before attacking the player . 
 = = = Shadows = = = 
 The core mechanic in Blue Dragon is the use of magical " shadows " , with each playable character having a distinct shadow modeled after either a dragon , a phoenix , a bat , a minotaur , or a saber @-@ toothed tiger . Each shadow can be assigned to a single character class ( from a number of such classes ) at a time , taking on the attributes and abilities of that class . Only the active class may earn Class levels or " ranks " , but players are free to change classes at any time except in combat , allowing the group 's shadows to be customized in order to achieve the desired combination of skills . 
 As shadows increase in rank in a given class , they learn new skills , which can then be assigned to a limited number of skill slots to be used in combat . Shadows can be assigned previously learned skills regardless of their current class . For example , if a shadow is currently set to be an " Assassin " , but has previously learned the ability to cast " Barrier Magic " while acting as a member of the Barrier Magic class , the Barrier Magic skill can be set as an active skill . This allows mixing or hybridization , with the player able to pick and choose from among the skills learned by a given shadow . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Although combat in the game follows a strictly turn @-@ based formula , the turn sequence of the characters you have are calculated based on the speed statistic of the character , and in some cases characters are allowed to strike before enemies can act if they possess sufficient speed . Different attacks can take varied periods of time to execute . 
 Another combat timing mechanic featured in the game is the " Charge Meter " , which allows players to increase the power of spells or attacks by spending additional time preparing them . This meter is always used for spell casting , as well as when using the " Charge Attack " skill used by the " Monk " class . Although players can choose to act immediately , an ability will become more powerful the longer that the player charges the attack . However , the greater the amount of time one charges attacks , the longer the charging character must wait before the next turn . As a result of this , players can choose to charge up an ability so that the ability triggers shortly before an enemy acts , or can instead aim for the " sweet spot " , a special red area on the charging bar , indicating a charge that allows for less time until the next attack , as well as a smaller mana cost . Overall , deciding on the correct amount of charge and letting go of the button at precisely that time can greatly influence the effectiveness of each character 's attacks during combat .

 Blue Dragon takes place in a fictional open @-@ world environment where every year for the past ten years , purple clouds have mysteriously appeared in the sky , signaling misfortune and disaster for people across the world . For years , a terrifying beast dubbed the " Land Shark " , and other lost technologies , such as the " sea cube " came with the purple clouds , killing thousands of people and destroying a number of villages . The world is split up into climate regions , each containing multiple kingdoms and villages , a few of which are not on the main path , but hold small stories , such as the giants , and the sheep , as well as hidden dungeons . Around the environment are multiple sources of treasure 
 = = = Story = = = 
 On an unnamed world , the legendary purple clouds arrive in Talta Village which is the home of Shu , Kluke , and Jiro . While the other villagers seek shelter , Shu and Jiro slow down the Land Shark . After encountering troubles , Kluke saves them . Together , the three trap the Land Shark in a net , but the Land Shark breaks free and rushes away , with Shu , Jiro , and Kluke dangling from its back . The Land Shark stops in an ancient ruin that the three friends explore . They discover the Land Shark is really a machine — a " Mechat " . Without warning , the <unk> comes to life , only this time sailing into the sky , again carrying the three with it . 
 The party arrives at a giant Mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene , the apparent leader . Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing the screams of the dying victims of the Land Shark . The party battles Nene , but are easily defeated . They are thrown out of the base and start to fall to their deaths , but a beam of light from the base catches them , and brings them back to the base . The party find three small floating spheres in the middle of the room ; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the spheres . The party refuses , and instead hold onto the spheres for safekeeping . As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base , they are forced to fight a large army of Nene 's robots . When the battle seems it will never end , and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat , the party members eat the spheres . As they consume the spheres , a strange transformation occurs to each , changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army . The party escapes the base and crash in a desert . 
 After becoming familiar with their new shadows , the party travels to Talta village , befriending <unk> on the way , who also possesses a magical shadow . Finding that the villagers from Talta have started to head towards the capital city of Jibral , the party takes off after them . Just outside Jibral , the party finds the villagers attacked by Steel @-@ Eating Tigers . They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces , including Zola . Once the villagers are brought to Jibral , the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene 's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola . Together , the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene 's Mechat base . After the base is destroyed , the party heads north in search of Nene . Nene captures Kluke , and places a collar around her neck which Nene alleges will explode . After reaching Nene , Zola separates from the party to buy them time to attack Nene . When the party attempts to remove Kluke 's collar , Nene absorbs the party 's shadows by placing collars on all of them . After taking their powers and placing them in himself , he removes their collars and attempts to kill them before they recover . Shu , despite being drained of magical ability , unconsciously teleports the party to the distant Devour village . 
 In Devour Village , they find themselves unable to escape the village without their magic , because the community is surrounded by evil trees . Shu has an epiphany and finds himself able to summon his dragon shadow without his sphere . Shu destroys the Eat <unk> in Devour Village , and the party is finally able to leave . Eventually all the party are able to summon their shadows again . 
 At that point , the party reunites with Zola , who supplies a Mechat for them to pursue Nene . As the party goes after Nene in the Mechat , Nene initiates an ancient machine that splits the world into two hemispheres , with thousands of isolated cubes floating between the halves . The party follows Nene to the Primitive Cube at the core of the transformation . The party journeys through the cube eventually defeating General Szabo and ultimately engaging Nene . As the party weakens Nene , it is revealed that Zola was working for Nene all along , and she was the voice that told the others to swallow the spheres . When Zola was too weak to defend herself , Nene had given her a shadow and sent her to Jibral as a spy . Zola betrays and kills Nene choosing her friends over him . 
 <unk> , the small creature that has been on Nene 's shoulder removes himself from his masters body and absorbs Nene 's remaining life force . <unk> is revealed to be Destroy , the biomechanical weapon that destroyed the legendary ancients that once tried to bring peace to the world . The party defeats Destroy , melting him in lava . The party then quickly escapes from the melting cube to rejoin their families .

 Blue Dragon was first revealed on February 24 , 2005 as one of two unnamed role @-@ playing games in development by Mistwalker Studios for the console which later came to be known as the Xbox 360 . In an IGN interview following the unveiling , Peter Moore stressed the importance to Microsoft of having Japanese games available on the system , commenting " ... It 's a main priority for me in the next 12 – 18 months to ensure Japanese developers are our partners . " Contributors to Blue Dragon include a number of well known Japanese figures in the gaming industry . The title 's original story was written by Hironobu Sakaguchi , the game director of the first five Final Fantasy video games . It also features art from Akira Toriyama , the creator of Dragon Ball and visual character and monster designer and illustrator of both the Dragon Quest series and Chrono Trigger . 
 Much of the actual software development work on the game was done at Artoon , with Takuya Matsumoto serving as director and Manabu <unk> responsible for the game 's world view . Matsumoto previously worked as a designer on <unk> 2 : Masters of Time and Space , while <unk> is known for his work at Sega , including the world of Panzer Dragoon . Near the end of November 2005 , roughly a year before the title was released in Japan , Artoon 's Naoto Ohshima indicated that the game was around 40 % complete . He also pointed out that Artoon had previously been known primarily for action titles , so that responsibility for Blue Dragon was originally somewhat frightening .

 Reviews for Blue Dragon were somewhat mixed , though generally favorable . On the review aggregator Game Rankings , the game had an average score of 77 % based on 62 reviews . While many reviewers praised the game for its traditional approach , a few reviewers criticized it for that very reason , with one reviewer remarking , " In fact , there is very little you can point to in Blue Dragon that hasn 't been done multiple times over before " . The story also came under scrutiny from some reviewers for being too generic and too similar to existing Japanese RPGs , with slow pacing during the beginning of the game . Eurogamer stated that the apparent lack of effort put into the facial animations for each character resulted in a limited ability to express emotion . They also noted that the mouth movements are well timed , but that the rest of the characters ' facial movements are " static " . 
 Game Informer commented that Blue Dragon lacked " jaw dropping " moments and was missing a nebulous " key element " to make it perfect . 1UP.com also picked up on this , adding that Blue Dragon was missing " strong characters , gripping storytelling , and excellent pacing " . X @-@ Play said that the game was very visually pleasing , but indicated that it was like any other role @-@ playing game .

GameSpy complimented the title 's music and graphics saying the game had " phenomenal music ; and magnificently rendered cutscenes " . 
 = Welsh cuisine = 
 Welsh cuisine encompasses the cooking traditions and practices of the country of Wales and the Welsh people . Whilst there are a large number of dishes that can be considered Welsh due to their ingredients and / or history , dishes such as cawl , Welsh rarebit , laverbread , Welsh cakes , bara brith and the Glamorgan sausage have all been regarded as symbols of Welsh food . There is some variation in dishes around Wales , but the most pronounced difference is in the Gower Peninsula , an isolated rural area which was heavily influenced by Somerset and Devon . There the dishes created included <unk> and often incorporated pumpkin . 
 While Wales has imported throughout the centuries some culinary practices and dishes from its British neighbors , uniquely Welsh cuisine grew largely from the lives of the Welsh working folk , such as farmers , shepherds , and peasants , as these Welsh working people tended to be more isolated from outside culinary influences . Welsh common folk were instead influenced by the food that they could produce based on what little ingredients they could produce or afford , all while having little or no contact with neighboring English cuisine and English society . Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced transhumance , moving their cattle to higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter . Once they settled to homesteads , a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily , keeping a cow for dairy products . Vegetables beyond cabbages and leeks were rare . 
 In Wales , beef and dairy cattle are raised widely . Sheep farming , however , is extensive in the country , and lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Wales . Other important produce includes seafood — especially close to the coast , where fishing culture is strong and fisheries are common . This is exemplified by the use of cockles and laverbread in Welsh cuisine . The leek , the country 's national vegetable , is also used frequently in Welsh cuisine . Since the 1970s , the rise of the gastropub and high @-@ end restaurants has given Wales five Michelin @-@ starred restaurants .
