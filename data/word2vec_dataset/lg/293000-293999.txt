 June started off as all the previous months had , with Dodd campaigning in New Hampshire and Iowa , but at the June 3 debate in Manchester he made a notable statement that led to a huge applause from the crowd . During the debate he pointed out a woman in the audience whose husband was fighting in the War on Terrorism , he thanked her for the sacrifice and stated the importance of standing up for America 's security while on the campaign trail , " No one is going to be elected president who is not going to have as their primary responsibility to keep us safe and secure . " After the debate Dodd went back to the trails , but while campaigning he found a new tool to help spread his message . The campaign encouraged voters to confront politicians with video cameras and ask them to talk about Iraq and to support the " Dodd Amendment " which would have required American troops to start redeployment in 30 days . The final step was for the voters to post the interactions on YouTube . The Dodd campaign has used the internet more frequently than other campaigns , often airing staff meetings via the web . The campaign released a new advertisement on June 16 entitled " Amazing Grace " which focused on Dodd 's time in the Peace Corps . As June came to a close Dodd made his final appearance of the month at a forum in Lake Buena Vista , Florida , the first time he visited the state which moved up its primary dates , causing a controversy with the DNC . On June 30 the campaign revealed the fundraising totals for the second quarter , Dodd raised $ 3 @,@ 250 @,@ 730 , spent $ 4 @,@ 384 @,@ 580 and had a total of $ 6 @,@ 378 @,@ 271 cash on hand .

 Early in July , the Dodd campaign 's strategy to use social networking sites was documented by the press . The campaign uses the network <unk> which allows Dodd supporters to be linked to other users from other social networking websites . The goal was to bring supporters together and attract new supporters . On July 6 singer Paul Simon joined Dodd on the campaign trail in Iowa as Dodd embarked on a five @-@ day " River to River " tour in a big blue bus with the name " Dodd " etched on the side . Dodd simultaneously continued his campaign on the web airing live staff meetings and a live chatroom on July 23 . The campaign launched a show called D @-@ TV which the Washington Post labeled as the " political Truman Show " . On July 23 , he participated in the YouTube debate broadcast on CNN . Dodd was fielded many questions during the debate including the very first . He received questions ranging from discussion about his hair to Iraq . When asked about his position on gay marriage , he stated : 
 When asked to comment about the genocide in Darfur and the moral leadership of the United States , Dodd answered that the situation in " Iraq is related to Darfur , Anderson , here . It 's because we 're bogged down there at $ 10 billion a month , we 've lost our moral leadership in the world . No one listens to us when it comes to foreign policy . That has to change in this country . That 's the difference here . " July campaigning wrapped up in Iowa with visits to seven cities in two days from July 27 – 28 . 
 = = = August 2007 = = = 
 August was by far the busiest month for the Dodd campaign . It started off with the candidate criticizing the merger of Murdoch @-@ WSJ starting a debate over Media ethics . Dodd stated on August 1 , " I am deeply troubled by the incredible amount of consolidation occurring across the American media landscape . " On August 7 during a debate before the AFL @-@ CIO in Chicago Dodd touted his experience in fighting for the rights of Labor Unions by stating , " I ’ m proud to say for 26 years on every major issue that labor ’ s been involved in I ’ ve stood with you . I ’ ve stood with labor in banning outsourcing of jobs , of offset contracts , of <unk> picketing , on plant closing legislation . " He also got into an argument with fellow Senator Barack Obama ( D @-@ IL ) on Obama 's recent comments about escalating the Afghanistan Conflict into Pakistan : 
 DODD : I think it ’ s highly responsible -- or irresponsible for people who are running for the presidency and seek that office to suggest we may be willing unilaterally to invade a nation here who we ’ re trying to get to be more cooperative with us in Afghanistan and elsewhere . 
 <unk> : Well , look , I find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism . ( Cheers , applause . ) 
 Dodd continued campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire visiting up to four different cities in one day . Political commentator Bill O 'Reilly slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O 'Reilly Factor in August , characterizing him as a <unk> @-@ aid drinker and blind follower of the far left . O 'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election . On August 20 he attended a debate that aired on ABC and was moderated by George Stephanopoulos . He commented on the need for a president that can bring people from both parties together , " ... it 's about getting this job done . We don 't elect a king or a queen or a dictator in November , we elect a president . The margins are thin . No one political party is going to write all of this . It takes leadership that knows how to bring people together . " As the month wound down for the campaign and as Dodd continued on the trail , the month of September loomed in the horizon as did an upcoming debate in Washington on the primary focus of the campaign , the Iraq War . Accompanying Dodd on the trail was the International Association of Fire Fighters , which handed him their endorsement on August 29 . 
 = = = September 2007 = = = 
 As Dodd began the September campaign in Nevada and New Hampshire the stage was being set in Florida for a debate on Hispanic issues . However this would later be overshadowed by events that would occur in Washington on September 11 . During the testimony of General David Petraeus , he lashed out against the surge policy stating : 
 At the same time the website <unk> released an ad that slammed General Petraeus , calling him a traitor . Dodd voted against a Congressional act to denounce the ad on September 21 . 
 Returning to the campaign trail , Dodd made stops in Iowa where he started what would be a later October trend by attacking the frontrunner Hillary Clinton . He attacked her record on health care stating , " It should be far more than just a parable of personal growth and maturation . This was about an issue that was critically important to the country . It was a major effort that failed . There were a lot of reasons that it failed , not the least of which it was mismanaged terribly at the time . " In addition to the campaigning in Iowa , attended fundraisers in his home state of Connecticut , visited New Hampshire and returned to Iowa all in the timespan of 10 days . At the end of September as the third quarter came to a close , the campaign revealed that it had raised only $ 1 @,@ 467 @,@ 093 , spent $ 4 @,@ 025 @,@ 458 , leaving $ 3 @,@ 874 @,@ 874 cash on hand . 
 = = = October 2007 = = = 
 In October the Dodd campaign focused its attention on Iowa , abandoning most of the campaigning in New Hampshire . On the trail , the campaign received little media attention despite a surge in appearances . As the month neared its final days an unexpected apex emerged for the campaign . During an October 30 MSNBC debate , he went after the frontrunner Hillary Clinton , slamming her for her support of Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer 's plan to give driver 's licenses to illegal immigrants : 
 SEN . CLINTON : I just want to add , I did not say that it should be done , but I certainly recognize why Governor Spitzer is trying to do it . And we have failed -- 
 SEN . DODD : Wait a minute . No , no , no . You said yes , you thought it made sense to do it . 
 SEN . CLINTON : No , I didn 't , Chris . But the point is , what are we going to do with all these illegal immigrants who are ( driving ? ) -- ( inaudible ) ? 
 SEN . DODD : Well , that 's a legitimate issue . But driver 's license goes too far , in my view . 
 SEN . CLINTON : Well , you may say that , but what is the identification if somebody runs into you today who is an undocumented worker -- 
 SEN . DODD : There 's ways of dealing with that . 
 SEN . CLINTON : Well , but -- 
 SEN . DODD : This is a privilege , not a right . 
 SEN . CLINTON : Well , what Governor Spitzer has agreed to do is to have three different licenses ; one that provides identification for actually going onto airplanes and other kinds of security issues , another which is an ordinary driver 's license , and then a special card that identifies the people who would be on the road . 
 SEN . DODD : That 's a bureaucratic nightmare . 
 Later in the debate Dodd articulated his support for the decriminalization of marijuana citing the high populations of American prisons . Many of the participants expressed their disagreement with him on this issue . The debate was the last campaign stop for Dodd in October who went into November with energy and momentum from the multiple exchanges . 
 = = = November 2007 = = = 
 In November he started off with two @-@ day events in New Hampshire and then devoted the rest of the month to Iowa . He talked about the need for the United States to redeploy troops out of Iraq , pay attention to global warming and health care , strengthen American ties with their allies including Pakistan and to not start a war with Iran further criticizing Clinton 's yes vote on a resolution designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization . During a November 15 debate in Las Vegas he spoke out in favor of free trade and attacked his fellow candidates : 
 While on the trail in Iowa on November 20 Dodd criticized fellow candidates who threatened to cut off funding to Pakistan in light of President Pervez Musharraf 's suspension of the constitution . He stated " I think it 's a very dangerous thing to suggest at this point . We could find ourselves cut off . ... We could not get into Afghanistan except through Pakistan . So in addition to the issue of nuclear weapons , and who controls them , and a state hostile to our interest , you have to be careful how much you threaten . " 
 = = = December 2007 = = = 
 Dodd spent most of December in Iowa engaged in Town Halls . He briefly made a trip to Mountain View , California to make a speech before returning to the trails in Iowa . He participated in the last Democratic Debate before the primary season on December 13 in Johnson , Iowa . In this debate sponsored by the Des Moines Register , Dodd commented that Education was the most important issue to him in the campaign . He also made a statement on why he felt he was the best choice for president and why he should receive the endorsement of the Des Moines Register , which ultimately went to Hillary Clinton . 
 Following the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , Dodd released a statement while campaigning that elaborated on his experiences with the slain leader . He commented that the event was an important time in both Pakistan and the United States that will impact the future of both nation 's security . He described the significance of America 's responsibility to keep democracy in the nation and the region as a whole . Following the statement Dodd completed the year 's campaigning by attending New Year 's Eve parties in cities in the first caucus state of Iowa .

 The Dodd campaign had raised $ 13 @,@ 598 @,@ 152 overall , spent $ 9 @,@ 723 @,@ 278 leaving $ 3 @,@ 874 @,@ 874 cash on hand . Alec Baldwin donated $ 2 @,@ 100 during a New York fundraiser .

Elisabeth Shue donated $ 1 @,@ 500 and Christy Carlson Romano added $ 300 . On October 26 , the New London 's The Day reported that through September Dodd 's campaign received $ 21 @,@ 600 from employees of Connecticut 's Foxwoods Casino and an additional $ 2 @,@ 300 from the Mashantucket Pequot 's political action committee . According to the financial records , 60 % of Dodd 's donations came from individual contributors . 4 % of donations came from PACs , which overwhelming were related to groups with business agendas . The following chart shows the amount raised in the top three states by Dodd and in the states he had been campaigning in the most , Iowa and New Hampshire : 
 = = Polling = = 
 In polling , Dodd has seemed unable to break through to the top tier . In Nationwide polls he usually only polls at or around 1 % . A November 7 , 2007 Gallup poll placed him in last place , behind both Joe Biden and Dennis Kucinich at 1 % . At the state level , Dodd has also not done so well . In a November 18 , 2007 Iowa poll conducted by ABC news , he registered with 1 % the same number from a similar poll done by ABC news on July 31 , 2007 . In New Hampshire , a poll conducted by CNN placed Dodd at 1 % constant from a September poll but up from polls in June and July . However , on the straw poll level , Dodd was able to gain a victory during an event in South Carolina on March 5 , 2007 . He won the York County straw poll by receiving 28 % of the 100 votes cast . Barack Obama came in second with 24 % . Hillary Clinton got 18 % and John Edwards received 11 % . The victory came two days after Dodd visited the county which probably secured him the win . 
 A November 2007 poll of Connecticut voters conducted by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute determined that Dodd was losing in the state to Hillary Rodham Clinton . Of the 1 @,@ 029 voters surveyed , 70 % wanted Dodd to drop out of the presidential race , and 55 % said he was spending too much time on the campaign trail . In response , Dodd 's national press secretary , Colleen Flanagan , said " Connecticut voters are being asked to look at Senator Dodd in a different light than in past years " adding that once voters become more focused on the presidential race , they will look to Dodd as " a candidate who has a track record of proven results .

The album is a pre @-@ release to the later album Christ Illusion , which , like the EP , features the song " Cult " . The album was released exclusively through Hot Topic chain stores in the United States and copies were also available in Germany , Finland and Sweden on June 23 , 2006 . There are three tracks featured on the album , one of which is an audio track and the others are videos . The album was not well received by critics , with few critics actually reviewing the album . The album charted on four different charts , peaking number two in Finland and three in Denmark . 
 = = Background = = 
 The album Christ Illusion was originally set for release on June 6 , 2006 . Slayer guitarist Kerry King stated this tentative release date was scrapped as a number of other bands had the same idea and thought it was " fucking lame " , although USA Today reported the release date was thwarted because the band had failed to secure sufficient studio recording time . Eternal Pyre was released instead , a preview of their album to be released in the coming months . The EP featured the track " Cult " , a live performance of " War Ensemble " in Germany and four minutes footage of the band in the recording studio . Originally , it was thought that the extended play would feature a live version of " Dead Skin Mask " instead of the live version of " War Ensemble " . Many news reporters were told that the album would feature the " Live Intrusion " video , described as a clip of one of the band 's fans who carved Slayer 's name into his forearm . " 5 @,@ 000 copies were released exclusively through Hot Topic chain stores in the United States and copies were also available in Germany , Finland and Sweden on June 23 . Nuclear Blast Records released a further 7 " vinyl picture disc version limited to one thousand copies on June 30 . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Eternal Pyre features three tracks in total . " Cult " was characterized by Thom Jurek as " scathing rejection of religion as the cause for world conflict . " The song revolves around guitarist Kerry King 's perception of flaws in American religion and was a comment on America , which he describes as " the biggest cult in the world " . Their performance was positively commented on , with <unk> saying that " King and Jeff Hanneman riff like they 're summoning a storm of thunder , lightning and human blood , " and was also noted to be a down @-@ tuned , two @-@ string vamp " that slithers into the foreground creates a tension as Lombardo 's cymbals call the band into the riff that opens the tune . It 's slow , meaty , unrelenting in its tautness . When Araya 's voice comes in , the whole track is off the rails and stays there . " " War Ensemble " was filmed live from Germany , and contains four minutes of studio footage . Lyrics were said to " please fans still harboring a grudge from Catholic school . "

 = Leucopaxillus giganteus = 
 Leucopaxillus giganteus , commonly known as the giant <unk> ( formerly as the giant <unk> ) or the giant funnel , is a saprobic species of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family . As its common names imply , the fruit body , or mushroom , can become quite large — the cap reaches diameters of up to 40 cm ( 16 in ) . It has a white or pale cream cap , and is funnel @-@ shaped when mature , with the gills running down the length of the stem . Considered by some to be a choice edible when young , this species has a cosmopolitan distribution , and is typically found growing in groups or rings in grassy pastures , roadside hedges , or woodland clearings . Leucopaxillus giganteus contains a number of bioactive compounds , one of which has displayed antibiotic and anti @-@ tumor properties in laboratory tests . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described as Agaricus giganteus by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809 , who illustrated it in his book Coloured Figures of English Fungi . Other historical synonyms include Clitocybe gigantea ( Quélet , 1872 ) , Paxillus giganteus ( Fries , 1874 ) , and Omphalia <unk> var. gigantea ( Quélet , 1886 ) . In 1934 , Robert Kühner and <unk> Maire created the genus <unk> to contain species of Leucopaxillus with smooth spores , and they set L. giganteus as its type species . American mycologist Rolf Singer transferred it to its current genus in 1938 , but recognized the value of maintaining a distinction of the smooth @-@ spored species , and so made L. giganteus the type species of section <unk> . 
 Leucopaxillus giganteus is commonly known as the “ giant <unk> ” ( formerly as the “ giant <unk> ” ) or the “ giant funnel ” . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of L. giganteus can become rather large , up to 40 cm ( 16 in ) in diameter with a thickness of 1 to 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 0 @.@ 5 in ) at half the radius . Younger specimens have caps that are convex , with a margin that is rolled downwards , but as the mushrooms matures the cap flattens out and eventually becomes shallowly funnel @-@ shaped . The cap is smooth and creamy white in color , but may develop brown stains and circular cracks with age . 
 The cream @-@ colored gills are narrow , crowded close together , and have a decurrent attachment — running down the length of the stem ; in age the gills will darken to a buff color . The stem is off @-@ white with reddish @-@ brown fibers and has dimensions , when mature , of up to 4 @.@ 5 to 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) tall by 1 @.@ 5 to 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . There is no ring on the stem . At the base of the stem there is typically a dense , white mycelium that may form a mat . The flesh is firm , and also is white . Mature specimens are fragile , and difficult to remove from the ground without breaking . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 When viewed in deposit , such as with a spore print , the spores appear white . When viewed with a light microscope , the spores are ovoid to ellipsoid , translucent ( hyaline ) , have a smooth surface , and possess a broadly rounded apex and base ; the spore dimensions are 6 – 8 by 3 @.@ 5 – 5 µm . Like all Leucopaxillus species , the spores of L. giganteus are amyloid — meaning that they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer 's reagent — however , the extent of the stain may be variable . The spore @-@ bearing cells , the basidia , are 25 – 40 by 4 @.@ 5 – 8 µm , narrowly club @-@ shaped , and are attached to either 2 or 4 spores . The hyphae of this species invariably have clamp connections . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Leucopaxillus giganteus somewhat resembles Leucopaxillus candidus , but this latter species has a darker coloring and is found more commonly in montane regions . Leucopaxillus septentrionalis is also large and resembles L. giganteus at some points during its development , but may be distinguished by its nauseous odor , the tan color of the cap , and the adnate ( gill squarely attached to the stem ) to slightly adnexed ( narrowly attached ) gills . Leucopaxillus candidus tends to be smaller , with a cap diameter ranging from 6 to 20 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) broad . Both Leucopaxillus <unk> and Lactarius vellereus have been suggested as additional lookalike species . Young specimens of Leucopaxillus giganteus may be confused with Clitocybe <unk> , C. <unk> or C. robusta . White Lactarius and Russula species may also appear superficially similar , but they have brittle flesh that breaks cleanly , unlike the fibrous flesh of Leucopaxillus giganteus . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Leucopaxillus giganteus can form fairy rings in grassy areas like pastures , and is also found along roadsides ; it produces fruiting bodies in summer and autumn . It is a saprobic species , and so derives nutrients by decomposing organic matter . 
 The fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution , and occurs throughout the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere . It is found in North America , Britain , and Europe . David Arora reports that in North America , it is most common in the Pacific Northwest and the Rocky Mountains . 
 = = Uses = = 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Although one source claims that the species is a " choice edible when young " , another source warns of the possibility of stomach cramps and diarrhea . Burrows suggests preparing specimens by cutting them up and boiling the pieces , and disposing the water ; then they may be used in dishes such as stews and casseroles . Because of its large size , one specimen can be enough to be consumed by several individuals . The odor has been said to be farinaceous or similar to fish meal ; the taste and smell of the mushroom have also been alternately characterized as " mild and pleasant " or " truly disgusting " . The species is also a favorite food for species of the fruit fly genus Drosophila . 
 = = = Bioactive compounds = = = 
 Leucopaxillus giganteus contains a bioactive compound named <unk> that has antibiotic activity against a number of bacteria that are pathogenic to humans , such as Bacillus <unk> and Bacillus subtilis ; an earlier ( 1945 ) study showed antibiotic activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Salmonella typhi , and <unk> <unk> . <unk> has also been shown to promote apoptosis ( cell death ) in human cervical cancer cells in vitro ( HeLa ) . The mycelia of L. giganteus , when grown in liquid culture , has been shown to produce phenols and flavonoids that have antioxidant activity .

 State Route 251 ( SR 251 , now Northport – Boundary Road ) is a former 10 @.@ 86 @-@ mile ( 17 @.@ 48 km ) long state highway in Stevens County , Washington . The highway began at SR 25 in Northport and continued northeast parallel to the Columbia River to Boundary , an unincorporated community , where it crossed the Canada – United States border into British Columbia as British Columbia Highway 22A . SR 251 was originally a county road until 1913 , when it was added to the state highway system , but was later removed . The roadway was re @-@ added as an extension to an already existing state highway . In 1937 , it was reclassified as a secondary highway named Secondary State Highway 22A ( SSH 22A ) until 1964 , when it became SR 251 .

 State Route 251 ( SR 251 ) , now known as the Northport – Boundary Road or Boundary Highway , began in Northport at an at @-@ grade intersection at Center Street , known as SR 25 . The highway turned north from SR 25 and followed the Columbia River upstream as well a railroad owned by the Kettle Falls International Railway .

 = = History = = 
 SR 251 was once a county road connecting Northport with British Columbia that has existed since at least 1912 . In 1913 , it became part of the Inland Empire Highway , but was removed in 1915 . The road was transferred to county maintenance after removal from the state highway system . In 1931 , it was officially added to the state highway system as part of an extension of State Road 22 from Kettle Falls to British Columbia . In 1937 , it became Secondary State Highway 22A ( SSH 22A ) , a branch of Primary State Highway 22 ( PSH 22 ) . When Washington renumbered its highways in 1964 and switched to a new system , SSH 22A became SR 251 and PSH 22 became SR 25 . In 1983 , SR 251 was removed from the state highway system and control was relinquished to Stevens County . After it was turned over , Stevens County continues to maintain the roadway and no realignments or significant events have occurred .

 = Blue discharge = 
 A blue discharge ( also known as a " blue ticket " ) was a form of administrative military discharge formerly issued by the United States beginning in 1916 . It was neither honorable nor dishonorable . The blue ticket became the discharge of choice for commanders seeking to remove homosexual service members from the ranks . They were also issued disproportionately to African Americans . 
 Service members holding a blue discharge were subjected to discrimination in civilian life . They were denied the benefits of the G.I. Bill by the Veterans Administration and had difficulty finding work because employers were aware of the negative connotations of a blue discharge . Following intense criticism in the press — especially the black press , because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges — and in Congress , the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947 , replaced by two new classifications : general and undesirable . 
 = = History = = 
 The blue discharge was created in 1916 to replace two previous discharge classifications , the administrative discharge without honor and the " unclassified " discharge . The discharges were printed on blue paper , hence the name . They were also sometimes called " blue tickets " . One early use of the blue discharge was for service members who had enlisted to fight in World War I while underage , but this practice was abolished by law and all such discharges were upgraded to honorable . 
 = = Association with homosexuality = = 
 The United States military had a long @-@ standing policy that service members found to be homosexual or to have engaged in homosexual conduct were to be court @-@ martialed for sodomy , imprisoned and dishonorably discharged . However , with the mobilization of troops following the United States ' entry into World War II , it became impractical to convene court @-@ martial boards of commissioned officers and some commanders began issuing administrative discharges instead . Several waves of reform addressing the handling of homosexuals in the military resulted in a 1944 policy directive that called for homosexuals to be committed to military hospitals , examined by psychiatrists , and discharged under Regulation 615 @-@ 360 , section 8 as " unfit for service " . It is unknown exactly how many gay and lesbian service members were given blue discharges under this regulation , but in 1946 the Army estimated that it had issued between 49 @,@ 000 and 68 @,@ 000 blue discharges , with approximately 5 @,@ 000 of them issued to homosexuals , while the Navy 's estimates of blue @-@ discharge homosexuals was around 4 @,@ 000 . The period of time covered by these estimates is unclear . 
 The psychiatrists responsible for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges . However , when they learned of the difficulties that blue @-@ ticket holders faced in civilian life , they urged the military to discontinue the practice . William C. Menninger , who served as the Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the Surgeon General of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946 , tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service . 
 One press account said the purpose of administrative blue discharges , " discharges which are not dishonorable but are based on habits or traits of the individual that make his continuation in service undesirable " , was the need to return soldiers to civilian life as quickly as possible : " to get the non @-@ disabled soldier back into the nation 's economic life with as little delay and red tape as possible , and to help him solve his own personal problems such as unemployment , educational opportunities or finances . " 
 = = Discrimination = = 
 The Veterans Administration ( VA ) , charged with implementing the provisions of the G.I. Bill , denied benefits to blue @-@ discharge veterans , despite the Bill 's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran . In 1945 , the VA issued a directive that all blue @-@ discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits . On December 22 , 1955 , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. <unk> , who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge . The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it . Nevertheless , the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if <unk> had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable . 
 Most employers required that job applicants who had served in the military present their discharge papers as part of the application process . Blue @-@ discharge veterans experienced difficulty in securing employment because many employers were aware that the blue discharge meant that the holder was considered undesirable . Those employers who did not know had access to a list of the Separation Program Numbers or " spin " numbers that the military used to classify discharges . At least four such spin numbers indicated a gay @-@ related discharge . 
 Congress had expressed concern about possible misuse of the blue discharge when it began work on the G.I. Bill in 1944 . In discussions about the legislation 's details , the American Legion insisted on a specific provision to provide benefits to veterans discharged under any circumstance other than dishonorable . The Legion believed a large number of veterans had been given blue and other less @-@ than @-@ honorable discharges for reasons that it considered unreasonable or trivial . In testimony before the United States Senate , Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs strongly opposed this provision on the grounds that it would undermine morale and remove any incentive to maintain a good service record . Senator Bennett Champ Clark , a sponsor of the bill , dismissed his concerns , calling them " some of the most stupid , short @-@ sighted objections which could be raised " . Clark went on to say : 
 " The Army is giving blue discharges , namely discharges without honor , to those who have had no fault other than they have not shown sufficient aptitude for military service . I say that when the government drafts a man from civil life and puts him in the military service ... and , thereafter , because the man does not show sufficient aptitude gives him a blue discharge , or a discharge without honor , that fact should not be permitted to prevent the man from receiving the benefits to which soldiers are generally entitled . " 
 The G.I. Bill also provided for discharge review boards to review an appeal of any discharge other than dishonorable . From 1945 until early 1947 , these boards routinely upgraded to honorable the blue discharges of homosexual service members who had not committed any known sex acts during their military service . About one @-@ third of all blue discharges reviewed were upgraded to honorable . 
 = = Black press crusade = = 
 Another minority group disproportionately issued blue discharges were African Americans . Of the 48 @,@ 603 blue discharges issued by the Army between December 1 , 1941 , and June 30 , 1945 , 10 @,@ 806 were issued to African Americans , 22 @.@ 23 % of all blue discharges at a time when African Americans constituted 6 @.@ 5 % of the Army . In October 1945 , Black @-@ interest newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier launched a crusade against the discharge and its abuses ; calling the discharge " a vicious instrument that should not be perpetrated against the American Soldier " , the Courier rebuked the Army for " allowing prejudiced officers to use it as a means of punishing Negro soldiers who do not like specifically unbearable conditions " . The Courier specifically noted the discrimination faced by homosexual blue @-@ tickets , calling them " ' unfortunates ' of the Nation ... being preyed upon by the blue discharge " and demanded to know " why the Army chooses to penalize these ' unfortunates ' who seem most in need of Army benefits and the opportunity to become better citizens under the educational benefits of the GI Bill of Rights " . The Courier printed instructions on how to appeal a blue discharge and warned readers against accepting a blue ticket out of the service because of the negative effect it would likely have on their lives . 
 In addition to the Courier , other groups and institutions that decried the punitive use of the blue discharge included the American Legion , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , the Congress of Industrial Organizations , and the Veterans Benevolent Association . In the U.S. Senate , the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee , Sen. Edwin C. Johnson ( D @-@ Colorado ) , read the Courier 's editorial into the record . On October 29 , 1945 , noting that a blue discharge meant the veteran had not been convicted and yet had been separated from the military without being able to defend himself , he said : " There ought not to be a twilight zone between innocence and guilt . Blue discharges are certain to be a headache for Congress from now on . " 
 = = House Report on blue discharges = = 
 In response to reports about the disparate treatment of blue @-@ ticket veterans , the House Committee on Military Affairs appointed a special committee to review the Veterans Administration 's procedures . The committee , headed by Rep. Carl T. Durham ( D @-@ NC ) , issued its report officially called " Investigations of the National War Effort " , commonly known as " Blue Discharges " , on January 30 , 1946 . The committee expressed its amazement that anyone with a blue discharge would risk further stigmatization by speaking out against the discrimination : 
 It should be borne in mind that even a moderate amount of complaint in a matter of this sort is significant . For a person to make such a complaint in his own case implies that he feels a sense of injustice so great that he is willing to risk publicizing the stigma of having been discharged from the Army under circumstances which savor of disgrace . For each complainant there are many more who feel the same sense of injustice but prefer to bury their hurt in as much oblivion as possible . 
 In examining case histories of blue @-@ discharge veterans , the committee found that " the procedure lends itself to dismissals based on prejudice and antagonism " . Further , the committee found that the effects of a blue discharge " differ little from those of a dishonorable discharge ... the discharged man finds it difficult to get or keep a job . The suspicion of society is aroused against him , all the worse in some ways for carrying an atmosphere of mystery . " The report said that " nothing could more clearly prove the anomalous and illogical and disingenuous nature of the blue discharge than this policy of the Veterans Administration " . The committee called the system for dealing with blue @-@ ticket veterans " a squeeze play between the war department and the veterans ' administration " and took the agency to task for assuming " the right to separate the sheep from the goats " and " passing moral verdicts on the history of any soldier " . 
 To reform the discharge system the committee recommended : 
 Automatic review for all blue discharges 
 That the Army be required to demonstrate that it made multiple attempts to rehabilitate the service member before issuing a blue discharge 
 The right to counsel for service members being given a blue discharge , either provided by the military or private counsel 
 Copies of procedural regulations regarding the blue discharge process be provided upon request 
 That any discharge that did not specify the quality of service state plainly that it is not dishonorable 
 The committee also recommended changing the discharge system to four classifications : honorable and dishonorable , with no change in their definitions ; " under honorable conditions " to replace the blue discharge ; and general , to cover separation for misconduct . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Despite the Committee 's report , the VA continued to discriminate against homosexual blue @-@ tickets , renewing its 1945 directive in 1946 and again in 1949 . Blue discharges were discontinued as of July 1 , 1947 , and two new headings , general and undesirable , took their place . A general discharge was considered to be under honorable conditions — distinct from an " honorable discharge " — and an undesirable discharge was under conditions other than honorable — distinct from a " dishonorable discharge " . At the same time , the Army changed its regulations to ensure that gay and lesbian service members would not qualify for general discharges . Those found guilty of engaging in homosexual conduct still received dishonorable discharges , while those identified as homosexuals but not to have committed any homosexual acts now received undesirable discharges . By the 1970s , a service member who had not committed any homosexual acts would tend to receive a general discharge , while those found to have engaged in homosexual sex tended to receive undesirable discharges . Gay service members continued to receive a disproportionate percentage of the undesirable discharges issued . This was the status quo until replaced in 1993 by the policy commonly known as " don 't ask , don 't tell " . 
 It has been suggested that the large gay populations in port cities like San Francisco , Chicago and New York City are in part the result of the blue discharge . The theory asserts that many gay blue @-@ ticket veterans from smaller urban or rural areas who felt they were unable to return to their home communities because of the shame associated with their discharges relocated to larger areas with established gay subcultures or simply stayed in the city through which they were returned to the United States . 
 = Russian battleship Chesma ( 1886 ) = 
 Chesma ( Russian : Чесма , sometimes transliterated as <unk> ) was the second ship of the Ekaterina II @-@ class battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s . When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant that much of her waterline armor belt was submerged . Russian companies could not produce the most advanced armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff , so they were imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium . Chesma spent her career as part of the Black Sea Fleet . 
 When the crew of the battleship Potemkin mutinied in June 1905 , the ship 's crew was considered unreliable and she did not participate in the pursuit of the Potemkin . Chesma did , however , escort Potemkin as Sinop towed her back to Sevastopol from Constanța , Romania , where Potemkin had sought asylum . Chesma was turned over to the Sevastopol port authorities before being stricken on 14 August 1907 . Before she was fully dismantled the Naval Ministry decided to use her hull for full @-@ scale armour trials . She was re @-@ designated as Stricken Vessel Nr. 4 on 22 April 1912 before being used as a gunnery target . Afterwards the ship served as a torpedo target for the destroyers of the Black Sea Fleet . During these attacks Chesma settled to the bottom of the Bay of Tendra and was eventually scrapped during the mid @-@ 1920s . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Chesma was 331 feet 8 @.@ 5 inches ( 101 @.@ 1 m ) long at the waterline and 339 feet 3 inches ( 103 @.@ 4 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 68 feet 11 inches ( 21 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 28 feet 10 inches ( 8 @.@ 8 m ) more than 28 inches ( 710 mm ) than designed . She displaced 11 @,@ 396 long tons ( 11 @,@ 579 t ) at load , over 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 1 @,@ 200 t ) more than her designed displacement of 10 @,@ 181 long tons ( 10 @,@ 344 t ) . 
 Chesma had two 3 @-@ cylinder vertical compound steam engines imported from the Belgian Cockerill company . Fourteen cylindrical boilers , also imported from Cockerill , provided steam to the engines . The engines had a total designed output of 9 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 700 kW ) , but they produced 9 @,@ 059 ihp ( 6 @,@ 755 kW ) on trials and gave a top speed of almost 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . At full load she carried 900 long tons ( 910 t ) of coal that provided her a range of 2 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 200 km ; 3 @,@ 200 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) and 1 @,@ 367 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 532 km ; 1 @,@ 573 mi ) at 14 @.@ 5 knots ( 26 @.@ 9 km / h ; 16 @.@ 7 mph ) . 
 She differed from her sister ships mainly in her main armament . She had six 12 in ( 305 mm ) Model 1886 35 @-@ caliber guns mounted in twin barbette mounts , two forward , side by side , and one aft . Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30 ° across the bow and 35 ° abaft the beam , or a total of 155 ° . The rear mount could traverse 202 ° . They had a range of elevation from − 2 ° to + 15 ° . Chesma 's guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to list when the guns were trained to one side . Traversing all the guns as far as they could go to one side produced a list of 7 @.@ 6 ° and made it very difficult for the turntable machinery to rotate the guns back to the fore @-@ and @-@ aft position . This problem had been anticipated and water tanks had been added to counteract the list , but they proved to be virtually useless because they took up to two hours to fill . The problem was partially cured in 1892 when the equipment was rearranged on the turntable to improve their balance , but more thorough solutions to the problem were either deemed too expensive or inadequate . Their rate of fire was reportedly one round every fifteen to seventeen minutes , including training time . Sixty rounds per gun were carried . The main guns were mounted very low , ( only 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 37 m ) ) above the main deck , and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern . They fired a ' light ' shell that weighed 731 @.@ 3 lb ( 331 @.@ 7 kg ) or a ' heavy ' shell that weighed 1 @,@ 003 lb ( 455 kg ) . The ' light ' shell had a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 090 ft / s ( 640 m / s ) while the ' heavy ' shell could only be propelled at a velocity of 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ( 610 m / s ) . The ' light ' shell had a maximum range of 11 @,@ 600 yards ( 10 @,@ 600 m ) when fired at an elevation of 15 ° . 
 The seven 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Obukhov Model 1877 35 @-@ caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts in hull embrasures , except for one gun mounted in the stern in the hull . The eight 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) five @-@ barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in small embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against torpedo boats . Four 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) five @-@ barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the fighting top . She carried seven above @-@ water 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes , one tube forward on each side , able to bear on forward targets , two other tubes were mounted on each broadside forward and aft of the central citadel ; the seventh tube was in the stern .

 Chesma was named after the Russian victory at the Battle of Chesma in 1770 . She was built by the Russian Steam Navigation Company ( RoPIT ) at Sevastopol . She was laid down in late June 1883 , launched on 18 May 1886 , and completed on 29 May 1889 . She served with the Black Sea Fleet until 1907 . She was inactive in 1895 , probably for mechanical problems . Chesma conducted trials in 1902 with towing spherical observation balloons and she was re @-@ boilered the following year . Plans were made for a radical reconstruction to be done while her boilers were being replaced . The rebuilding involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin @-@ gun turrets equipped with 12 @-@ inch 40 @-@ caliber guns and ten 6 @-@ inch 45 @-@ caliber guns between the turrets in an armoured citadel that used Krupp armor . This proved to be too expensive and it was cancelled , but not before the armor and turrets had been ordered . Her turrets were used to equip the pre @-@ dreadnought Ioann Zlatoust , then under construction . 
 When the crew of the battleship Potemkin mutinied in June 1905 , Chesma 's crew was considered unreliable , and she did not participate in the pursuit of Potemkin . She escorted Potemkin as Sinop towed her back to Sevastopol from Constanța , Romania , where Potemkin had sought asylum .

Chesma was fitted with a replica of the armour system used in the Gangut @-@ class battleships to test its effectiveness . She was towed into position and given a 7 ° list to simulate the descent angle of shells fired at long range . Ironically her own guns were used against her as Ioann Zlatoust anchored 750 meters ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) away and fired 12 @-@ inch , 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and 6 @-@ inch shells with reduced charges to simulate shells fired from approximately 16 @,@ 000 – 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 – 16 @,@ 000 m ) away . These revealed significant weaknesses in the support structure for the armour plates and in the deck protection , but the Gangut @-@ class ships were too far along in construction to incorporate fixes . Afterwards she served as a torpedo target for the destroyers of the Black Sea Fleet . During these attacks she settled to the bottom of the Bay of Tendra and was eventually scrapped during the mid @-@ 1920s .

 Lester Joseph Brain , AO , AFC ( 27 February 1903 – 30 June 1980 ) was a pioneer Australian aviator and airline executive . Born in New South Wales , he trained with the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) before joining Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services ( Qantas ) as a pilot in 1924 . He was awarded the Air Force Cross in 1929 , after locating the lost aircraft Kookaburra in northern Australia . Having risen to Chief Pilot at Qantas by 1930 , he was appointed Flying Operations Manager in 1938 . As a member of the RAAF reserve , Brain coordinated his airline 's support for the Australian military during World War II . He earned a King 's Commendation for his rescue efforts during an air raid on Broome , Western Australia , in 1942 , and was promoted to wing commander in 1944 . 
 Seeing little prospect for advancement at Qantas once the war had ended , Brain left to join the fledgling government @-@ owned domestic carrier Trans Australia Airlines ( TAA ) in June 1946 . Appointed its first General Manager , he swiftly built up the organisation to the stage where it could commence scheduled operations later in the year . By the time he resigned in March 1955 , TAA was firmly established as one half of the Commonwealth government 's two @-@ airline system . After his departure from TAA , Brain became Managing Director of de Havilland Aircraft in Sydney , before joining the board of East @-@ West Airlines as a consultant in January 1961 . Appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in January 1979 , Lester Brain died in June the following year , at the age of seventy @-@ seven .

 Born in Forbes , New South Wales , on 27 February 1903 , Lester Brain was the second son of an English mining engineer and manager , Austin Brain , and his Australian wife , Katie . Originally from Gloucestershire , Austin had emigrated with his parents and siblings in 1885 , prospecting for gold in the United States before settling in Australia . By the age of thirteen , Lester owned his own motorcycle bought secondhand for £ 11 ; its poor condition and constant need for repair helped him become mechanically adept at an early age . He completed his education at Sydney Grammar School , where he excelled in maths , before being employed by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney ( CBC ) in 1919 . 
 Brain 's penchant for motorbikes and things mechanical inspired a lift driver at CBC to suggest he apply for pilot training in the recently formed Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . He was among five civilian students nominated by the Civil Aviation Branch ( CAB ) of the Defence Department for entry into the inaugural RAAF flying training course , which commenced at Point Cook , Victoria in January 1923 . The benefit of these nominations from a military perspective was that although the destiny of the CAB @-@ sponsored students was to be civil aviators , they would also be members of the RAAF reserve , known as the Citizen Air Force ( CAF ) , and could therefore be called up for active service as and when necessary . Brain 's fellow attendees included Royal Australian Navy lieutenants Joe Hewitt and Ellis Wackett , and Australian Army lieutenant Frank Bladin , all of whom were seconded — and later permanently transferred — to the RAAF . 
 = = = Qantas = = = 
 Brain graduated at the top of his class after the year @-@ long training course at Point Cook , and was duly commissioned in the CAF . Moving to Queensland in April 1924 , he took up employment as a pilot with Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services ( Qantas ) , its first aviator without a war record . On 7 February 1925 , he flew the first scheduled passenger service from Cloncurry to <unk> , extending the airline 's founding 580 @-@ mile ( 930 km ) route — from Charleville to Cloncurry — by 284 miles ( 457 km ) . The following year , he completed a refresher course at Central Flying School , Point Cook . On a rain @-@ soaked McKinlay airfield near Cloncurry on 27 February 1927 , he flipped Qantas ' first de Havilland DH.50 on to its back while attempting take @-@ off , though he managed to escape without injury . Qantas founder Hudson Fysh berated him for a " serious error of judgement " , but noted his excellent three @-@ year record as a pilot ; the aircraft was soon repaired and operational again . The next month , Brain became Chief Instructor at the Qantas Flying School in Brisbane , doubling as manager of the airline 's local office . By mid @-@ 1928 , he had overworked himself to the extent that he was ordered to take respite by Fysh ; this " respite " nevertheless involved a 13 @-@ week trip to England to study aviation developments . 
 In April 1929 , Brain was selected to take part in a search for lost aviators in northern Australia , having gained experience of the area while flying over the Tanami Desert to assist a gold prospecting expedition some years earlier . On 20 April , he took Qantas DH.50 Atalanta from Brisbane to link up with RAAF Airco DH.9s under the command of Flight Lieutenant Charles Eaton at Tennant Creek , to look for Keith Anderson and Robert Hitchcock in their Westland Widgeon the Kookaburra . The pair had disappeared while searching for Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm , who had been reported missing on a record attempt from Sydney to England in the Southern Cross . Brain located the Kookaburra the next day in the Tanami Desert , approximately 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) east @-@ south @-@ east of Wave Hill . He saw one body underneath the wing , but the terrain was too dangerous to attempt a landing . After Brain reported the Kookaburra 's position to Eaton , the latter led an overland expedition to the site and buried the bodies of Anderson and Hitchcock , who had evidently survived crash @-@ landing their plane before succumbing to heat and thirst . His discovery of the Kookaburra and , shortly thereafter , of two lost British aviators in Arnhem Land , earned Brain the Air Force Cross ; the award was gazetted on 31 May : 
 The KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Air Force Cross to Mr. Leslie Joseph Brain , in recognition of the distinguished services rendered to aviation by his recent flights in the northern territory of Australia in search of missing aviators . 
 The Gazette later corrected " Leslie " to " Lester " . With the Kookaburra saga making news across the country , Brain had become a national hero , and Fysh declared that the publicity for both pilot and airline " could probably not have been bought for any money " . 
 By 1930 , Brain had been appointed Qantas ' Chief Pilot . In June that year , he was given responsibility for sales and special flights such as demonstrations and agency tours at the airline 's new Brisbane headquarters , and also acted as a reserve pilot . He married Constance ( <unk> ) Brownhill at Holy Innocents Catholic Church in Croydon , New South Wales , on 8 July ; the couple had two sons and two daughters . Brain played a leading role in Qantas ' operations as it expanded its mail and passenger routes throughout Australia and , as Qantas Empire Airways ( QEA ) from January 1934 , other parts of the world . In October that year , he went to Britain to take delivery of QEA 's first de Havilland DH.86 , the fastest four @-@ engined airliner in the world at the time . He was now Flight Superintendent and , having accumulated 6 @,@ 694 hours in the air , began to evince a keener interest in the " administration and executive side of aviation " . Promoted to flying officer in the CAF on 1 March 1935 , over the next year he discussed with the Controller @-@ General of Civil Aviation , Edgar Johnston , taking a cut in salary to work in Johnston 's department , or possibly becoming Deputy Controller @-@ General . No more came of this at the time , and by 1938 Brain had been appointed Flying Operations Manager at QEA . In 1939 , he was considered for the position of Director @-@ General of Civil Aviation ( which had recently succeeded the post of Controller @-@ General ) but the role went to A. B. Corbett . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Following the outbreak of World War II , Brain was given the task of coordinating Qantas ' support for the Australian military , which became known as the Qantas Merchant Air Service . On 23 February 1940 , Fysh noted that since its formation in 1934 , QEA had logged six million miles in flying boats and <unk> without suffering any injuries to passengers or crew . He called it " a record which has never been equalled in any part of the world ... It reflects the highest credit on Captain Brain , who has been in charge of flying operations during this time . " In 1941 , Brain took charge of ferrying eighteen PBY Catalinas from the United States to Australia on behalf of the RAAF , which had purchased the aircraft . US neutrality made it prudent for a civilian organisation — that was also experienced in long @-@ range flying boat operations — to undertake the task . Brain and his crew departed San Diego , California , on 25 January to make the first flight , having surveyed their intended route on the journey out from Australia . Travelling via Honolulu , Canton Island and Nouméa , they arrived at their destination after one week , including sixty hours flying time ; it was only the third such direct flight to Australia across the Pacific Ocean . 
 By February 1942 , Brain was running the Qantas base at Broome in north Western Australia , which had assumed major importance as a way station for evacuees from the Dutch East Indies , possessing a harbour suitable for flying boats , as well as an airfield that could take heavy bombers . The increasing Royal Netherlands Air Force , RAAF and Qantas traffic through the base led Brain to anticipate an attack by Japanese forces , and this occurred on 3 March , when nine A6M Zero fighters strafed the harbour with cannon . Twenty @-@ four aircraft were destroyed , and an estimated seventy people were killed . Brain , though suffering from fever , rowed into the harbour with another airline representative and rescued ten people from the water . After the all @-@ clear sounded , he ordered an undamaged Qantas flying boat to Port Hedland , in case of further attacks ; he also took part in the search for survivors of a Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberator that had been shot down by the raiders . His rescue efforts were recognised with a King 's Commendation for " brave conduct at Civil Aerodromes " , promulgated in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette on 17 June 1943 . The following year , he was promoted to temporary wing commander in the CAF .

 After the war , Brain was appointed Qantas ' Assistant General Manager . Fysh was still in his early fifties and appeared unlikely to retire any time soon . Seeing little chance of further advancement where he was , Brain took the opportunity to apply for the position of Operations Manager at Trans Australia Airlines ( TAA ) , a new domestic carrier established by the Federal Labor government and run by the Australian National Airlines Commission ( ACAC ) , which was chaired by Arthur Coles . Qantas could not match the £ 2 @,@ 250 salary associated with the TAA role , and Brain advised Fysh of his resignation on 10 April 1946 . In the event , ACAC appointed him TAA 's General Manager on 3 June , with a £ 3 @,@ 000 salary and an undertaking to increase this to as much as £ 5 @,@ 000 in the future . 
 Brain moved quickly to secure executive , flying , training and maintenance staff from Qantas , Ansett and the RAAF , as well as surplus Douglas DC @-@ 3 twin @-@ engined transports from the RAAF and TAA 's chief private competitor , Australian National Airways ( ANA ) . He planned to have the first scheduled flights operating by October , around the same time as delivery of four DC @-@ 4 Skymaster four @-@ engined liners that would augment the DC @-@ 3 fleet , giving the airline a significant edge over ANA . In the event , TAA 's first flight , from Melbourne to Sydney , took place on 9 September under pressure from the government , keen to ensure favourable publicity for its new enterprise before the Federal election at the end of the month . Brain nevertheless instructed his pilots that " schedules are important , but safety is most important " ; it became one of TAA 's early advertising slogans . In October , he wrote to the Department of Civil Aviation to express his disquiet at the rapidly increasing list of government members who were to be given preferential treatment when required at the expense of members of the public , in effect arguing with his owner — the government — on behalf of everyday travellers . 
 On 1 July 1947 , Brain was discharged from the CAF with the rank of wing commander . By August 1949 , TAA had carried its millionth passenger . Though praised for contributing to increased civil traffic in Australia , the airline was losing money , generating criticism in media and political circles that it was an inefficient organisation propped up by ordinary taxpayers . Brain maintained that its negative financial performance in its early years was a necessary by @-@ product of rapid expansion to establish itself as a significant force in the market . In June 1950 , he was able to report its first profit . This , plus popular opinion in TAA 's favour , helped ensure the airline 's survival as a public enterprise in the wake of the Labor government 's loss to Robert Menzies ' conservative Liberal Party in the Federal election the previous year , though Coles was replaced as Chairman of ACAC by Norman Watt . By 1951 , the new government had enacted as policy a two @-@ airline system that enshrined competition between the Commonwealth @-@ sponsored domestic operator and one major privately owned carrier .

 Brain tendered his resignation from TAA on 3 February 1955 — effective 17 March — to become Managing Director of de Havilland Aircraft in Sydney ( later Hawker de Havilland , part of Boeing Australia ) . While his departure came as a surprise to ACAC , Brain had for some time felt shackled by having to run TAA on a commercial basis under the control of a government bureaucracy , and on a public servant 's remuneration . His anticipated salary increases had been less than he expected under the terms of his employment ; Watt 's attempts to make good on them had been resisted by Federal Cabinet . The government yet feared that , once he had resigned , Brain might attempt to sue for back pay , though he assured Watt that this was not his intention . Nevertheless , in November he received a Cabinet @-@ approved ex gratia payment totalling £ 6 @,@ 250 , in recognition of his " long and distinguished service to civil aviation in Australia " . 
 During Brain 's tenure at de Havilland , the company manufactured sixty @-@ nine Vampire T35 jet trainers at its Bankstown factory for delivery to the RAAF , as well as Sea Venoms for the RAN . Leaving de Havilland upon its merger with Hawker Siddeley in 1960 , he gave up full @-@ time work and joined the board of East @-@ West Airlines as a consultant in January 1961 . In August 1964 , he began negotiations with the Federal government on behalf of International Parcels Express Company ( now Toll <unk> ) , which was attempting to enter the air freight business in Australia with the purchase of five DC @-@ 4 Skymasters ; the government rejected the proposal later that year . Along with Arthur Coles , Brain was a guest at the opening of TAA 's new headquarters at Franklin Street , Melbourne in November 1965 . In 1978 , he met with adventurer Dick Smith , who was about to launch an expedition to recover the Kookaburra from the Tanami Desert . Smith was keen to get directions from the man who had found the missing plane in 1929 , in spite of receiving advice against taking the word of someone from the " cap and goggles " era . He rediscovered the Kookaburra in August that year " exactly where Lester Brain had said ... Lester was completely chuffed when I got back and told him I 'd found the Kookaburra thanks to his directions and how thankful I was that , despite everyone else 's suggestions , I 'd taken Lester 's advice . " 
 Brain had declined the offer of a knighthood in the late 1960s , but accepted appointment as an Officer of the Order of Australia on 26 January 1979 . When asked towards the end of his life why he had achieved so much but was not as well known as other aviation pioneers , he replied " Because I was always very careful and didn 't kill myself " . Having suffered from cancer for several years , Brain died in Sydney on 30 June 1980 . He was survived by his wife and children , and cremated . In November 2008 , Qantas announced that one of its new Airbus A380s would be named Lester Brain .

 Since 1928 , US 90 was routed through Santa Rosa , and concurrent with US 11 before crossing into Louisiana . In 1936 , a new , paved road was built from US 90 to south of Slidell , bypassing the town . Three years later , US 90 was realigned south on this new road . This caused the southern terminus to be US 90 , and the northern terminus at an unsigned highway , which would become MS 11 @-@ 90 a year later . In 1948 , the route was renumbered to MS 43 , and by 1950 , the former alignment of US 90 bypassed in 1936 became signed as MS 604 .

 = Tim McKee = 
 Alexander Timothy McKee ( born March 14 , 1953 ) is an American former competition swimmer and three @-@ time Olympic silver medalist . He was a successful medley and backstroke swimmer , and is often remembered for being a part of the closest Olympic swimming finish in history and the resulting rule changes regarding the timing of international swimming events . McKee is a Pennsylvania native who was raised in a family of swimmers , and had notable successes as a collegiate swimmer at the University of Florida . 
 = = Early years = = 
 McKee was born in Ardmore , Pennsylvania . He was the fourth of nine children in his family ; his father Alexander " Big Al " McKee was a former All @-@ American for Ohio State University 's Buckeye swimming and diving team in the late 1930s . While McKee was a child , his parents moved the family to Newtown Square , Pennsylvania , so that he and his siblings could walk through a path in their backyard to the Suburban Swim Club to practice , where his father served as coach from 1962 to 1968 . Three of his brothers and two of sisters achieved some measure of national or international recognition as competition swimmers . McKee graduated from Malvern Preparatory School in Malvern , Pennsylvania in 1971 . 
 = = College swimming career = = 
 After high school , McKee accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville , Florida , where he swam for coach Bill Harlan 's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletics Association ( NCAA ) and Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) competition from 1972 to 1974 . He followed his older brother Mark to Gainesville , where Mark McKee was an All @-@ American swimmer for the Florida Gators from 1969 to 1971 . As a freshman in 1972 , he finish fourth in the 200 @-@ yard backstroke , and fifth in the 400 @-@ yard individual medley , as the Florida Gators finished seventh overall at the NCAA men 's swimming championships . In his three years as a Gator swimmer , McKee was recognized as the SEC Swimmer of the Year in 1972 , won six SEC individual titles , and received four All @-@ American honors . 
 = = International swimming career = = 
 After graduating from high school , McKee was chosen as a member of the U.S. national swim team for the 1971 Pan American Games in Cali , Colombia . He finished second in the men 's 200 @-@ meter backstroke with a time of 2 : 07 @.@ 9 , earning his first silver medal in international competition . 
 Following his freshman college season , McKee qualified for the 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis . At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich , Germany , he represented the United States in three different events . Most memorably , McKee won a silver medal in the men 's 400 @-@ meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history , losing by a margin of two one @-@ thousandths ( 0 @.@ 002 ) of a second to Sweden 's Gunnar Larsson . Initially , the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4 : 31 @.@ 98 , but in a controversial decision , the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal @-@ winner ten minutes after the race was over — Larsson 's electronic clock time was 4 : 31 @.@ 981 , McKee 's 4 : 31 @.@ 983 . The time difference was variously calculated as one @-@ tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye , and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint , a sheet of paper , or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool . As a result of the controversy , the international swimming federation , FINA , subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming ; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of a second , and timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie @-@ breakers . It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second . Afterward , McKee attributed his second @-@ place finish to a tactical mistake : he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race . 
 At the 1972 Olympics , McKee garnered a second silver medal in the men 's 200 @-@ meter individual medley ( 2 : 08 @.@ 37 ) , again finishing behind gold medalist Larsson , who set a new world record in the event ( 2 : 07 @.@ 17 ) . He also placed fifth in the final of the men 's 200 @-@ meter backstroke ( 2 : 07 @.@ 29 ) . 
 After his junior year at the University of Florida , McKee left the Gators swim team to train full @-@ time for the 1976 Olympics . The 23 @-@ year @-@ old McKee again qualified for the U.S. team in the 400 @-@ meter individual medley at the 1976 U.S. Olympic Trials . At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal , he repeated his second @-@ place performance in the men 's 400 @-@ meter individual medley event , finishing behind gold medalist and fellow American Rod Strachan . The times of both Strachan ( 4 : 23 @.@ 68 ) and McKee ( 4 : 24 @.@ 62 ) broke the prior world record in the event final , with Strachan setting the new mark . 
 During the course of his career , McKee set six American records ( short course 200- and 400 @-@ yard individual medley , 400 @-@ yard medley relay ; long course 100- and 220 @-@ yard backstroke , 200 @-@ yard individual medley ) .

 McKee was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a " Gator Great " in 1987 , and the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an " Honor Swimmer " in 1998 . He is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America ( SAA ) , a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research , and has participated in sixteen SAA events . He has worked in Miami Beach , Florida as a life guard and public safety officer for over 20 years , has also worked in real estate , and has helped train other Olympic swimmers including Nancy Hogshead . McKee married his wife Courtney , a former competition swimmer , in 1998 . 
 = The Trouble with Trillions = 
 " The Trouble with Trillions " is the twentieth episode in the ninth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 5 , 1998 . It was written by Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham and directed by Swinton O. Scott III . The episode sees Homer being sent by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try to obtain a trillion dollar bill that Mr. Burns failed to deliver to Europe during the post @-@ war era . 
 = = Plot = = 
 All of Springfield is rushing to send out their tax returns just before midnight on April 15 . Homer realizes he did not file his tax return . He rushes and provides false information before driving to the post office . The IRS discovers Homer 's fraud and he is arrested . Held by the government , Homer says he will do anything to stay out of prison . Agent Johnson of the FBI decides that Homer can be useful . With a hidden microphone under his shirt , Homer uncovers that his coworker Charlie leads a group planning to assault all government officials , but is arrested by the FBI for conspiracy . 
 With his superiors impressed , Johnson sends Homer on a secret mission . They reveal that in 1945 , President Harry S. Truman printed a one trillion @-@ dollar bill to help reconstruct post @-@ war Europe . He handed the bill over to Montgomery Burns to transport to the Europeans . However , the money never arrived and the FBI suspects Burns still has the money with him . Homer is sent in to investigate . Arriving at the Burns estate , Homer searches for the money before Burns , who believes Homer is a reporter from Collier 's magazine , reveals that he kept the money on his person . Johnson and Agent Miller burst in and arrest Burns . Burns shouts how the government oppresses the average American . Moved by Burns 's speech , Homer knocks out the FBI agents and frees Burns . 
 The two men hurry to obtain Smithers for help , who suggests they leave the country . Burns takes Smithers and Homer in his old plane , setting off to find an island and start a new country . Over the Caribbean , Burns finds a fine island , although it already has a name and is in fact the country , Cuba . Going before Fidel Castro , Burns fails to buy the island when Fidel asks to see the trillion @-@ dollar bill , and is handed the bill . He refuses to give it back . The episode immediately cuts to a scene where Burns , Smithers , and Homer are on a makeshift raft . Burns announces he will merely bribe the jury when he , Smithers and Homer are put on trial .

 The episode was written by Ian Maxtone @-@ Graham , though the original draft of the plot was much different . Originally , Homer was to learn that he was a Native American , and would try to exploit it to not have to pay taxes . The idea had been going well for a few days , but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes . When the writers found out that they did , the whole plot had to be scrapped . Executive producer Mike Scully 's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion @-@ dollar bill , which they accepted , as they were out of ideas .

 The scene where the FBI agent sits near Homer is a reference to the film JFK . While Homer , Mr. Burns , and Smithers are in Cuba , a billboard can be seen with a picture of Che Guevara being used to advertise Duff Beer .

 In its original broadcast , " The Trouble with Trillions " finished 51st in ratings for the week of March 30 – April 5 , 1998 , with a Nielsen rating of 7 @.@ 5 , equivalent to approximately 7 @.@ 4 million viewing households . It was the third highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following World 's Wildest Police Videos and Melrose Place . 
 Since airing , the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , did not enjoy the episode , calling it , " Rather dull and unfunny " , adding , " A mediocre episode at best that makes Burns out to be altruistic ( which he 's not ) and very stupid in letting Castro have his money ( which he so wouldn 't ) . " The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of " The 10 Best Simpsons TV Episodes " . The article noted the episode contained " one of the few gags in comedy history about relying too heavily on surveillance photography in spying " . 
 Ian Jones and Steve Williams for Off the Telly criticized all of season 9 for lacking an episode that centered on Burns , as they consider Burns to be the crux of many good episodes , though they noted that " The Trouble with Trillions " came the closest , with Burns having a supporting role . In a review of The Simpsons ' ninth season , Isaac Mitchell @-@ Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as " brilliant " , and highlighted it along with episodes " Bart Carny " and " The Joy of Sect " . 
 In the United Kingdom , the episode was screened on BBC Two in January 1999 , before any other episode from season six or later were seen by viewers , as part of a night of Cuba @-@ themed programming . 
 = Lympne Airport = 
 Lympne Airport / <unk> / , was a military and later civil airfield ( IATA : <unk> , ICAO : <unk> ) , at Lympne , Kent , United Kingdom , which operated from 1916 to 1984 . During the First World War RFC Lympne was originally an acceptance point for aircraft being delivered to , and returning from , France but was later designated as a First Class Landing Ground , RAF Lympne . It became a civil airfield in 1919 and saw the operation of early air mail services after the 1918 armistice . It was one of the first four airfields in the United Kingdom with customs facilities . 
 Lympne was also involved in the evolution of air traffic control , with facilities developing and improving during the 1920s and 1930s . A number of record @-@ breaking flights originated or ended at Lympne . During the 1920s Lympne was the venue for the Lympne light aircraft trials from which a number of aircraft types entered production . Air racing was also held at Lympne . 
 Just before the Second World War , Lympne was requisitioned by the Fleet Air Arm . It was named HMS Buzzard and n renamed HMS Daedalus II three months later , before being transferred to the Royal Air Force in May 1940 . During the war Lympne was a front @-@ line fighter base , RAF Lympne . It was heavily bombed during the Battle of Britain in 1940 and put out of action for a number of weeks . It was too close to the coast to be used as a squadron base , but squadrons were detached there on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis . Lympne was also to have been the landing place for a German aircraft used in a plot to kidnap Adolf Hitler , with preparations made by the Royal Air Force for his arrival . 
 Lympne returned to civilian use on 1 January 1946 . In 1948 , the first air ferry service was inaugurated at Lympne by Silver City Airways . Problems with waterlogging of the grass runway and the refusal of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to upgrade the airfield led to Silver City transferring operations to Lydd ( Ferryfield ) in 1954 . By 1956 , the airport 's ownership had passed to Eric Rylands Ltd , the Skyways holding company . Skyways operated a coach @-@ air service between London and Paris , flying passengers from Lympne to Beauvais . This service operated until 1974 ( 1955 – 1958 : the original Skyways ; 1958 – 1971 : Skyways Coach @-@ Air ; 1971 – 1972 : Skyways International ; 1972 – 1974 : Dan @-@ Air Skyways ) . Following the cessation of commercial operations in October 1974 , Lympne continued to be used as a General Aviation airfield until about 1984 . The site is now an industrial estate .

 = = = Establishment = = = 
 Work began on creating a landing ground at Folks Wood , Lympne , in the autumn of 1915 . This site soon proved unsuitable and another site was sought . Lympne was established in March 1916 as an Emergency Landing Ground for the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) home defence fighters defending London against Zeppelins and Gothas . No. 1 Advanced School of Air Gunnery operated from Lympne during January and February 1917 . In January 1917 it was designated as No. 8 Aircraft Acceptance Park for delivery of aircraft to , and reception from , France . On 25 May 1917 Lympne was bombed by Gotha <unk> bombers of <unk> 3 who dropped 19 bombs on the airfield . 
 In 1918 , Lympne was designated a First Class Landing Ground and the Day and Night Bombing Observation School was formed here in May . The RFC and the Royal Naval Air Service ( RNAS ) were merged to form the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in April 1918 . From 17 July 1919 , No. 120 Squadron RAF flew air mail services between Lympne and Cologne , Germany , using de Havilland DH.9 aircraft fitted with Beardmore Halford Pullinger engines . This service ended on 1 September 1919 when 120 squadron moved to RAF Hawkinge . Hawkinge and Lympne lay within a few miles of each other and as the Air Ministry could not justify keeping the two bases open following the end of the war , they decided to retain Hawkinge . In August 1919 the RAF moved out of Lympne and it was turned over to civilian use , although 120 Squadron did not depart until 21 October .

 In May 1919 , Lympne was one of the first four customs and excise " Appointed Aerodromes " in the United Kingdom ; along with Hadleigh in Suffolk , Hounslow Heath in Middlesex and New Holland in Lincolnshire . Although Lympne had a customs clearance point there was no permanent customs officer there ; a telephone call to Folkestone Harbour was needed to clear customs . On 1 May the ban on civilian flying was lifted and a Sopwith <unk> was flown from Hounslow Heath to Lympne carrying a cargo of newspapers during that first day . In September , Sir Philip Sassoon purchased an Avro aircraft in which he commuted between London and his Lympne residence . In October the Air Ministry announced that searchlights would temporarily be displayed to assist aircraft to find certain airfields . Lympne was to be identified by three searchlights arranged in a triangle , their beams shining vertically . In November a Notice to Airmen was issued advising that radio telephony was in use at Hounslow Heath and Lympne , using the 900 @-@ metre wavelength . The practice of using the aircraft registration as a callsign was instigated . In December 1919 two Westland Limousine aircraft bound for the Paris Aero Show were delayed at Lympne by fog . Conditions later improved so that both aircraft were able to fly to Le Bourget , where G @-@ <unk> was dismantled and transported to the Grand Palais where it was exhibited to the public . The other aircraft remained at Le Bourget where it gave pleasure and demonstration flights . 
 The North Sea Aerial and General Transport Co. used a Blackburn Kangaroo on its short @-@ lived Leeds @-@ Lympne @-@ Amsterdam service from 6 March 1920 . The customs facilities at New Holland had been withdrawn on 28 January , necessitating the roundabout route . It was estimated that the extra costs involved in taking this route amounted to one @-@ third of the total costs . Flight called for customs facilities to be established to enable direct flights to be made from the north of England to the continent . Starting from 2 August , hourly weather forecasts were broadcast from Lympne and other airfields . A system of ground signals advising pilots of the weather conditions at Biggin Hill and Croydon was also introduced about this time . During August , Aircraft Transport and Travel took over air mail flights , using DH.9A aircraft . In November a Notice to Airmen was released announcing that searchlights would be in use at Lympne for two hours after sunset to assist pilots in landing their aircraft . Arrangements could be made in advance for this facility to be made available after the notified hours . In December , it was announced that an " aerial lighthouse " was to be installed at Lympne as the one installed at Croydon had proved to be of benefit to pilots arriving after dark . 
 In May 1921 , it was reported that a waiting room for the use of passengers at Lympne was being planned . In June a Notice to Airmen was released saying that , for cost reasons , lights would no longer be exhibited after sunset without prior arrangement . The system of ground signals was amended with effect from 14 July , and in September an " aerial lighthouse " was reported to be under construction . The system of aerial lighthouses on the " London – Paris Airway " was completed in December 1921 . 
 In January 1922 , a 78 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) high mast for an anemometer was being erected at the south west corner of Lympne Aerodrome . On 13 February , the system of ground signals at Lympne was further extended to include information about the Saint @-@ Inglevert Airfield , just across the English Channel in France . In July , a Notice to Airmen said that all aircraft were to make at least one left @-@ hand circuit before landing at Lympne . By November , the Instone Air Line were operating a service from Croydon to Cologne using de Havilland <unk> aircraft , stopping at Lympne to refuel to full capacity . These aircraft then had the necessary range to fly direct from Lympne to Cologne . This arrangement did not last long , with the refuelling stop moved to Tirlemont , Belgium , by the end of the month . On 30 December a Dornier aircraft landed at Lympne . It was the first German aircraft to land on British soil since the end of the First World War . A German airline , Aero @-@ Lloyd was in negotiation with Daimler Airway to start a service between London and Berlin . 
 A Junkers <unk> called at Lympne on 10 January 1923 to clear customs and then flew to Croydon where it was inspected by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare . In February , it was reported that Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress . Georges <unk> won a prize of <unk> from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day , 6 May . He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine . On landing a bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke , but repairs were effected within half an hour . Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly . On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held ( see below ) . In 1923 , Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath . 
 From 1 to 31 May 1924 , the Royal Air Force conducted a number of night flying experiments . Pilots were asked to keep an extra lookout whilst the experiments were taking place . On 27 and 28 September , the elimination trials for the Light Aircraft Trials were held . Only eight aircraft passed through to the trials proper . Also in October , it was notified that changes were being made expanding weather information given at Lympne . Amongst the changes were that measurements used were to be changed from imperial to metric . The addition of weather information at Haren , Brussels and Ostend , both in Belgium was notified . In 1924 , Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft were operating cross @-@ channel services for Imperial Airways . Lympne was used by aircraft of Imperial Airways as a refuelling point . The first stop in France was St Inglevert . When an aircraft departed Lympne for St Inglevert , the destination airfield was advised , and if arrival was not notified within two hours , the Coastguard was informed . Communication was by Carmichael <unk> UHF transmitters at each airfield . Short Brothers used Lympne for flight testing new aircraft during 1924 . 
 In January 1925 , notification that red edge lights had been installed along the runways and taxiways at Lympne was made . In July 1925 , a new arrangement was introduced whereby aircraft not fitted with radio , flying across the Channel , could have their departure and arrival reported by radio to the authorities . A circuit of Lympne and St Inglevert had to be flown at a height not exceeding 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) on departure for , and arrival from , the continent . Between 1 – 3 August , the Royal Aeronautical Society held a meeting at Lympne . The Grosvenor Challenge Cup , Private Owners ' Cup , Light Aeroplane Holiday Handicap and International Handicap were all competed for . Separate Speed Races were held for single and two @-@ seater aircraft . In August 1925 , the scheme for non @-@ radio aircraft was extended to cover Ostend . One hour was allowed for the crossing to St Inglevert and two hours for the crossing to Ostend , after which the aircraft would be reported as missing . On 25 September , Lympne was one of a number of airfields which began operating a radio direction finding service . As before the 900 @-@ metre wavelength was used . 
 During the General Strike of 1926 , which ran from 3 – 13 May , the Daily Mail was printed in Paris and flown from there to Lympne on Handley Page <unk> Imperial Airways aircraft . Further aircraft chartered by the Daily Mail then flew the newspapers to Birmingham for onward distribution . A fleet of de Havilland DH.60 Moth , de Havilland DH.9 with some Avro and Westland aircraft were used . The distribution of the newspapers by air was co @-@ ordinated by the Royal Aero Club and a total of 33 @,@ 174 mi ( 53 @,@ 388 km ) was flown by aircraft operating under the Royal Aero Club 's co @-@ ordination . The Royal Auxiliary Air Force ( AuxAF ) had been formed in 1925 . In late August and early September 1926 601 ( County of London ) Squadron AuxAF held its inaugural camp at Lympne . The squadron was equipped with Avro 504 and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft . The Light Aircraft Trials were held between 10 and 14 September . 
 On 1 January 1927 , new regulations came into effect which meant that aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator in addition to the pilot . In February it was reported that a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne , where repair facilities were available . In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne . In July , a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon . They were not to follow the normal Lympne – Edenbridge – Caterham – Croydon route , but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes . Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect , or whenever the weather had improved . This was aimed at preventing mid @-@ air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force . From 7 to 21 August , 600 ( City of London ) Squadron AuxAF and 601 ( County of London ) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp . The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft . In October , a Notice to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously , standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October . In December , a Notice to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground , to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity . Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer . The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question . In 1927 a Fokker <unk> of <unk> flew newspapers to Lympne . 
 A meeting was held over the Easter weekend in 1928 by the Cinque Ports Flying Club . Pleasure flights were given for a cost of 5 / - . An unverified report stated that one person was dissatisfied with two circuits of the airfield . The pilot is said to have offered to take him up again , which was accepted . On this second flight various aerobatics were flown and the hapless passenger was said to have been left incapable of expressing himself coherently . Among the pilots attending were Geoffrey de Havilland and his son . Other activities included some air racing and a guess the altitude competition . In May a Notice to Airmen said that the scheme for aircraft reporting that they were crossing the Channel was being extended . Lympne was to remain the reporting place on the English side but , in Belgium and France , the Ostend and St Inglevert airfields were joined by semaphore stations at Village de <unk> , Calais and Cap d ’ <unk> , Boulogne . On 17 May , Lady Heath landed at Lympne after crossing the Channel during her 10 @,@ 000 mi ( 16 @,@ 000 km ) flight to Croydon from Cape Town , South Africa . She was flying an Avro Avian III which had been taken out to South Africa by ship . In August , the AuxAF held their annual Air Defence Exercises . Both 600 ( City of London ) and 601 ( County of London ) Squadrons AuxAF were based a Lympne for the duration of the exercise . They were operating Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft . Towards the end of the camp Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill and Under Secretary of State for Air Sir Philip Sassoon inspected both squadrons and were entertained at a dinner . On 18 September , Juan de la Cierva departed from Lympne in an <unk> , making the first flight between London and Paris in this type of aircraft and the first flight across the Channel by autogyro in the process . In November , a Handley Page <unk> of Imperial Airways diverted to Lympne in a gale with three passengers suffering from airsickness . Once landed the aircraft was briefly lifted from the ground in a gust whilst ground handling staff were taking it to a hangar . Winds of 82 mph ( 132 km / h ) were recorded . 
 In January 1929 , a Notice to Airmen said that when visibility was bad any aircraft not fitted with radios were warned against using the Croydon – Edenbridge – Ashford – Lympne route or any of the alternative routes notified in 1927 . Later that month it was notified that the aerial lighthouse had been replaced by a 6 @,@ 000 candlepower neon light which would be visible at a range of 45 mi ( 72 km ) . In July 1929 a plan was proposed where an amphibious aircraft would be based at Lympne for use in search and rescue when aircraft were reported missing over the Channel . On 14 August , the 601 ( County of London ) Squadron AuxAF arrived for their annual camp . In September 1929 arrangements were notified for the abandonment of a Channel crossing by aircraft flying from England to France . In such cases , the aircraft was to perform a second circuit over Lympne which would be acknowledged . It was also notified that a flying boat operated by Compagnie <unk> Française was to be based at Calais for use in search and rescue work . 
 = = = = 1930 – 39 = = = = 
 In February 1930 , a Towle TA @-@ 2 amphibian was a visitor to Lympne . In July 1930 , it was notified that aircraft fitted with radio may report their position by radio when crossing the Channel . For non @-@ radio aircraft the earlier arrangements remained in effect , although some changes were made to the methods of acknowledgement of arrival . Search and rescue arrangements now included motorboats permanently available at Boulogne , Calais , Dover and <unk> . Lifeboats were also on standby at the French ports and air patrols were in operation during working hours , operated by Air Union . In August 1930 , the arrangements for non @-@ radio aircraft flying between Croydon and Lympne in bad weather were amended . Pilots had to notify which route they intended to take and the destination airfield was to be notified of this by telephone once the aircraft had departed . That month 601 ( County of London ) Squadron held its annual camp a Lympne . 
 On 1 August 1931 , the 601 ( County of London ) Squadron AuxAF began its annual camp at Lympne . Croydon Airport took over the responsibility for weather forecasting on air routes from the Air Ministry in October . As part of the changes Biggin Hill , Croydon and Lympne now provided weather information on a 24 @-@ hour basis . 
 In March 1932 , the arrangements for flying between Lympne and Croydon in poor visibility were altered . If the <unk> was less than 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) above sea level , or the visibility was less than 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) , aircraft were prohibited from using the Croydon – Caterham – Penshurst – Lympne route , but were to use either the Croydon – <unk> – Edenbridge or Croydon – <unk> – Shoreham – Otford – Wrotham route . Alternatively a rhumb line course could be flown on the Croydon – <unk> – Lympne route . Aircraft not fitted with radios had to notify the officer in charge at their departure airport as to which route they intended to take before departure . Royal Air Force aircraft would avoid these routes as far as practicable in conditions of poor visibility . On 25 August the Folkestone Trophy Race was held at Lympne and was won by a Comper Swift . In November , it was reported that new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15 @-@ cm waveband at 2 @,@ 000 <unk> . The new radios were to be used for the announcement of the departure of non @-@ radio aircraft across the Channel . Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter , providing a record of the communication . The new equipment was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933 . 
 In 1933 , Imperial Airway 's Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft were replaced by Handley Page <unk> On 7 March 1933 , the system for non @-@ radio aircraft proved effective when a de Havilland DH.60 Moth of British Air Transport failed to arrive at Lympne . The aircraft had ditched in the channel and both occupants were rescued by a steamship bound for Amsterdam , Netherlands . In August , the No. 601 ( County of London ) Squadron again held its annual camp at Lympne . They were visited by the Marquess of Londonderry who was the Secretary of State for Air . The squadron was equipped with Hawker Harts . Later that month the Folkestone Aero Trophy Race was held and was won by Ken Waller in a de Havilland DH.60 Moth . In September , a new system was introduced for broadcasting weather forecasts in various areas and on various air routes , including that between Croydon and Lympne . Navigational warnings would also be broadcast . In October , it was notified that the floodlight at Lympne had been put back into operation and the use of flares was therefore discontinued . In November , a squadron of the Egyptian Army Air Force was based at Lympne for a few weeks whilst they trained on their new Avro 626 aircraft . They departed on 18 November for Egypt . By 1933 , Lympne was well prepared for handling diversions . Passengers who cleared customs were taken by car to Folkestone Central railway station where they boarded trains to London using 1st class tickets . On 2 December , a Fokker <unk> , PH @-@ <unk> <unk> of KLM , diverted to Lympne following an engine failure . This was the only diversion KLM had during the whole of 1933 . 
 In January 1934 , a new radio , telegraph and telephone link was installed at Lympne and St Inglevert which came into operation on 26 January . Sir Philip Sassoon officially declared the installation open . The equipment at Lympne was manufactured by Standard Telephones and Cables and operated on the 17 @-@ cm wave band . From 13 to 27 July , 606 ( City of Glasgow ) Squadron AuxAF held its annual camp at Lympne , followed by 601 ( County of London ) Squadron AuxAF from 29 July to 12 August . On the weekend of 1 – 2 September competitions for the Folkestone Aero Trophy and the Wakefield Cup were held . Both competitions were won by pilots flying the de Havilland DH.60 Moth G @-@ <unk> . Later that month a second batch of ten Avro <unk> of the Egyptian Army Air Force departed from Lympne for Egypt . 
 In April 1935 , Air Traffic Control in the United Kingdom was improved by the introduction of a new control zone system . Heston was added as a control zone , relieving Croydon of some traffic . As a result of these changes the wavelength used by Lympne for radiotelegraphy changed from 862 metres to 825 metres . Six new direction finding stations were installed as part of these improvements , including one at Lympne . The improvement meant that Croydon would now be able to communicate by radio with two aircraft at the same time . In August Henri Mignet flew his Mignet <unk> " Flying Flea " across the Channel to Lympne , where the aircraft was demonstrated in front of large crowds . Also that month 601 ( County of London ) Squadron AuxAF held its annual camp at Lympne after having converted from a bomber squadron to a fighter squadron earlier in the year . 
 From 2 to 16 August 1936 , No. 601 Squadron held their annual camp at Lympne . One aircraft exhibited at the 1936 International Air Rally was a 1912 Caudron <unk> In November , it was reported that 21 Squadron and 34 Squadron of the RAF were temporarily relocated to Lympne as hangars at RAF Abbotsinch had been damaged in gales . In October 1936 , Lympne was again taken over by the RAF , becoming a base within No. 1 ( Bomber ) Group . Although some improvements were carried out Lympne was initially seen as a temporary station . On 3 November 21 Squadron and 34 Squadron moved in , equipped with Hawker Hind aircraft . 
 On 4 June 1937 , a British Klemm Swallow made a pilot @-@ less take @-@ off from Lympne and flew for some 35 minutes before crashing into a tree . Its resting place was 200 yd ( 180 m ) from RAF Hawkinge . On 31 July the Folkestone Trophy was competition was held and was won by Alex Henshaw in a Percival Mew Gull . 
 On 12 March 1938 , Captain Davis , managing director of the Cinque Ports Flying Club , was killed in an accident shortly after take @-@ off from Lympne . On 30 July , the Folkestone Trophy race was held and was won by H Buckingham flying a de Havilland Hornet Moth . 34 Squadron departed Lympne on 12 July , and 21 Squadron departed on 15 August . Lympne was placed under " Care and Maintenance " in October , becoming a Training Command Administration School . 
 In May 1939 , Lympne was transferred to Fighter Command . It was used by the Fleet Air Arm as an outstation for the Air Mechanics School based at HMS Daedalus . On 1 July 1939 , Lympne was taken over by the Fleet Air Arm , becoming HMS Buzzard . Aircraft at Buzzard included Blackburn Sharks and Gloster Gladiators . On 5 August , the Folkestone Trophy Race was held and was won by Andrew Dalrymple flying a Chilton <unk> 
 = = = The Second World War = = = 
 In September 1939 , the base was renamed HMS Daedalus II , but was transferred back to the RAF in May 1940 . Early in the war Lympne was home to Army Co @-@ operation and bomber squadrons . During Operation Dynamo in May 1940 a French Air Force squadron was based at Lympne . It was equipped with Marcel Bloch and Potez fighters . On 15 August 1940 , during the Battle of Britain , Lympne was bombed by Stuka dive @-@ bombers of II Gruppe , <unk> . All the hangars were hit and those aircraft belonging to Cinque Ports Flying Club that had not been evacuated to Sywell were destroyed in the fire . Lympne was evacuated and only available as an Emergency Landing Ground until mid @-@ September . 
 In 1941 , Lympne was to be the destination for the landing of an aircraft carrying Adolf Hitler in a daring kidnap plot . A man by the name of <unk> had given information to the British Military Attaché in Sofia , Bulgaria , that he was the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Hans Baur , the personal pilot of Hitler . He stated that Baur was planning to defect using Hitler 's Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 with him on board . The RAF made plans to receive the aircraft at Lympne and 25 March was the date that the defection was expected to occur . Baur did not defect and spent the war as Hitler 's personal pilot . A few weeks later Rudolph Hess defected to Scotland . 
 Also in March 1941 , 91 Squadron moved in , equipped with Spitfires . Additional dispersals and fighter pens as well as three new blister hangars were built during 1941 . Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 to counter the threat posed by the Luftwaffe 's newly introduced Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across <unk> Lane to accommodate the Typhoons . In November 1944 , Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status . Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne , with the longest being 6 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) , but it was noted that serious demolition work would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed .

 On 1 January 1946 , RAF Lympne was handed over to the Ministry of Civil Aviation and became a civil airport once more . The Cinque Ports Flying Club re @-@ established itself in facilities left by the RAF and re @-@ opened on 12 July . The club possessed two Tiger Moths and an Auster . The first post @-@ war air races were the Folkestone Trophy and the Lympne High Speed Handicap held over the weekend of 31 August and 1 September . The Folkestone Trophy was won by John Grierson flying a Supermarine Walrus ( G @-@ <unk> ) . The Lympne High Speed Handicap was won by W Humble flying a Hawker Fury I. Charter airline Air Kruise ( Kent ) Ltd was established at Lympne by Wing Commander Hugh Kennard and in September it was reported that the company had received the first civilian Miles Messenger aircraft . Air Kruise also operated Dragon Rapides . 
 On 1 December 1946 , Group Captain A. Bandit departed Lympne in a Miles Gemini bound for <unk> , Australia . This was the first solo flight to Australia since the end of the war . Bandit reached Truscott Airfield , Western Australia , on 6 January 1947 to complete the first post @-@ war England – Australia flight . Air races were held at Lympne on 30 and 31 August and four national records were set ( see below ) . 
 In July 1948 , Silver City Airways started an aerial car ferry service from Lympne to Le Touquet using Bristol Freighter aircraft . At the Lympne Aero Races Lettice Curtis set a new women 's world speed record whilst competing in the High Speed Handicap race flying a Spitfire XI . The Cinque Ports Flying Club folded on 1 October , its successor being the Kent Coast Flying Club which was set up by Hugh Kennard and had a Miles Magister ( G @-@ <unk> ) . Kent Gliding Club took up residence , and Skyfotos also made Lympne its base for aerial photography . Aircraft operated by Skyfotos included an Auster <unk> ( G @-@ <unk> ) and a Piper PA @-@ 22 Caribbean ( G @-@ <unk> ) . 
 In May 1949 , it was reported that Lympne had made a loss of £ 17 @,@ 000 and that the Air Ministry was looking to dispose of it , although it was thought that should a sale not materialise it would continue in operation . In August 1950 , Air Kruise started a scheduled service between Lympne and Le Touquet using Dragon Rapides . This service was operated under an associate airline agreement with British European Airways . 
 = = = = 1951 – 60 = = = = 
 In December 1951 , Lympne was closed to all aircraft exceeding 8 @,@ 000 lb ( 3 @,@ 600 kg ) due to the runway being waterlogged and Silver City Airways transferred their service to Southend Airport until Lympne reopened in February 1952 . <unk> Airport was also used whilst Lympne was closed . On 1 May 1952 , a passenger tax was introduced in the United Kingdom . The rate was 5s for passengers arriving from Europe and 7s 6d for those arriving from outside Europe . At the same time landing fees at Government @-@ owned airports were halved where the aircraft was operating an international flight of less than 115 mi ( 185 km ) . Silver City Airways would benefit from this concession . Also in May it was reported that Air Kruise were extending the Lympne – Le Touquet service to Ramsgate , as Ramsgate Airport was to be re @-@ opened . In July , the members of Folkestone Town Council visited the Ministry of Civil Aviation in London to discuss the purchase of Lympne Airport . 
 In February 1953 , Lympne was again waterlogged and Silver City Airways operated out of Southend and <unk> . The company stated that they were willing to purchase Lympne , but the decision of Folkestone Town Council was still awaited for . By May , Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport at a reasonable price . In November , it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and / or Ramsgate to Birmingham . The service was to be seasonal between April and September , with permission to run the service lasting until 1960 . Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953 . 
 In March 1954 , Air Kruise applied for permission to operate Dakotas on routes between Lympne and Le Touquet , Calais and Ostend . On 29 April , the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation offered Lympne for sale by auction in London . Bidding reached £ 88 @,@ 000 but the reserve was £ 100 @,@ 000 and the airport was not sold . On 28 August , Silver City Airways trialled a Westland @-@ Sikorsky WS @-@ 51 helicopter on cross @-@ Channel flights . Permission had been granted for the use of these aircraft for freight operations and it was intended to introduce them on 1 April 1955 . On 3 October , Silver City Airways operated their last flight out of Lympne as operations were being transferred to the new Lydd ( Ferryfield ) Airport which had opened on 6 July 1954 . A total of 33 @,@ 487 car ferry flights had been made from Lympne since the service had started in 1948 . As of 1 November , Lympne closed as a public airport , although private flying was allowed as long as no passengers were carried for hire or reward . 
 In 1955 , Air Kruise moved to Lydd ( Ferryfield ) and Lympne was re @-@ licensed in 1955 . On 30 September 1955 , Eric Rylands , a former co @-@ owner and managing director of the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation ( LAC ) who had bought Skyways from the previous owners in March 1952 ( together with LAC 's other owner , David Brown ) , started a coach @-@ air service between London and Paris . Passengers were taken by coach from Victoria Coach Station to Lympne , flown to Beauvais and then taken by coach to Paris . Check @-@ in and coach departures in Paris were at the Hôtel Moderne Palace on Place de la Republique in Paris 12 . Aircraft and coaches each held 36 passengers . Passengers returning to the UK could order duty @-@ free goods at Paris and the orders were telephoned to Beauvais for distribution on the flight . The off @-@ peak fare was £ 7 14s 0d and 47 @,@ 000 passengers were carried in the first year . Three Dakotas were used initially and later increasing to four . A trial run took place on 21 September and Skyways holding company , Eric Rylands Ltd , bought Lympne from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation in 1956 . 
 In January 1957 , Skyways ordered a new Decca type 424 radar for installation at Lympne . In summer 1957 , a service was started between Lympne and Vichy , the first service between the UK and Vichy since Hillman 's Airways before the war . This was part of Skyways London – Lympne – Lyons – Nice route . Valence was also served by air . 
 In May 1958 , a route to Nice via Lyon was introduced . A temporary service to Brussels via Antwerp operated that year to serve the Brussels International Exhibition . In December , it was announced that an experimental scheme to allow British and Irish subjects to make day @-@ trips abroad without needing a passport was to be introduced on a limited number of routes , including Lympne – Beauvais . An identity card would be issued in lieu of a passport and the experiment was to run from Easter to the end of September 1959 . 
 On 15 March 1959 , RAF Detling closed and the land was sold back to its pre @-@ war tenants , who did not wish for any flying to take place . As a consequence the Kent Gliding Club relocated temporarily to Lympne . In June , Skyways signed a letter of intent to purchase a number of Avro 748 aircraft . Flight magazine stated that the number involved was " about four " . Skyways were the first airline to make a public announcement of support for the then yet @-@ to @-@ fly airliner . In autumn 1960 , Lympne was closed for a few days due to waterlogging of the runway . 
 = = = = 1961 – 70 = = = = 
 On 3 May 1961 , Skyways signed a contract for the purchase of three Avro 748s at a cost of £ 750 @,@ 000 . On 6 November , the process of final certification of the Avro 748 began . A programme of 160 hours of flying , simulating airline service , took place over the following 19 days and included a break for maintenance on 16 November . The programme also allowed Skyways pilots to gain further experience towards the 50 hours in command they needed before they could fly the aircraft in service . The aircraft was returned to Avro at the end of the trials as it was not scheduled to be delivered to Skyways until 1 March 1962 . 
 On 15 March 1962 , a bomb disposal officer was killed at Lympne when the pipe mine he was attempting to make safe exploded . The Army temporarily suspended their bomb disposal operations as a result . Skyways supplemented their Dakotas with an Avro 748 ( G @-@ <unk> ) which operated its first revenue @-@ earning flight on 17 April 1962 . In July , it was reported that Skyways had extended the passenger terminal at Lympne . In November , Skyways was taken over by <unk> , excluding Skyways Coach @-@ Air which remained a separate company . 
 In 1963 , three Avro 748s were in service and two of Skyways Coach @-@ Air 's Dakotas were converted to freighters . During the winter of 1962 – 63 , the 748s continued to operate a normal service out of Lympne . In October 1964 , Skyways Coach @-@ Air moved out of its London offices and all operations were now at Lympne , although a sales office was retained in London . The Cinque Ports Flying Club was restarted in 1964 by Barry Damon and had 120 members by 1968 . The club aircraft were a Beechcraft Bonanza , Beechcraft Musketeers and a <unk> <unk> . 
 In March 1965 , a NOTAM was issued of changes had been made into the arrangements for light aircraft crossing the Channel . These changes were partly to avoid conflict with traffic flying into Lydd ( Ferryfield ) . Non @-@ radio aircraft could use the route between Hythe and Ambleteuse . Non @-@ radio aircraft were advised to call at Lympne before crossing . On 11 July , one of Skyways Coach Air 's Avro 748s crashed on landing at Lympne . 
 Following the 1965 accident , which had been caused by the nose @-@ wheel of the aircraft digging into soft ground , a 4 @,@ 500 ft ( 1 @,@ 372 m ) concrete runway was constructed . It was reported in January 1968 that planning permission had been granted and the new runway came into use on 11 April 1968 . Skyways Coach @-@ Air leased an Avro 748 from Leeward Islands Air Transport in 1968 for a two @-@ year period to replace the aircraft lost in the 1965 accident . 
 A new terminal building opened in June 1969 . Sheila Scott performed the ceremony , arriving in her record @-@ breaking Piper Comanche G @-@ <unk> Myth Too . On 10 June , the airport was renamed Ashford Airport , identifying the airport with the nearby town of Ashford which was scheduled for rapid growth . To mark the occasion a plaque was unveiled by Leader of the Opposition Edward Heath .

 A financial crisis at Skyways Coach @-@ Air in 1970 resulted in a management buy @-@ out in 1971 . Under the name Skyways International , services were operated from Lympne to Beauvais , Clermont @-@ Ferrand and Montpellier . In 1971 , to celebrate the management buyout of Skyways Coach @-@ Air and subsequent renaming as Skyways International , an air rally was held at Lympne . Ray Hanna attended in a Spitfire . Skyways International was bought by Dan @-@ Air in February 1972 , with operations continuing under the [ interim ] Dan @-@ Air Skyways name . 
 In October 1974 , commercial activities ceased at Lympne and Business Air Travel , Dan @-@ Air and Skyfotos left . In 1982 , the airfield was in use by the Ashford Parachute Centre with a Super Cub in residence in July 1983 . The Eagle Parachute School also used Lympne before leaving for Headcorn . In 1983 , Luscombe Aircraft was based at Lympne producing their Luscombe Rattler , a military version of the Luscombe Vitality . The Cinque Ports Flying Club moved to Lydd in 1984 . 
 = = Light Aircraft Trials = = 
 Light Aviation Trials were held at Lympne in 1923 , 1924 and 1926 sponsored by the Daily Mail . The 1923 competition was for aircraft with maximum engine capacity of 750 cc ( 46 cu in ) . This increased to 1 @,@ 100 cc ( 67 cu in ) in 1924 and was replaced by an engine weight limit of 170 lb ( 77 kg ) in 1926 . The rules for 1924 and 1926 required two @-@ seat , dual @-@ control aircraft . Aircraft that entered production after competing at the Light Aviation Trials include the Avro Avian , Blackburn Bluebird and Westland Widgeon , although these had larger engines . The 1924 competition was won by the Beardmore WB XXIV Wee Bee powered by a Bristol Cherub engine . The 1926 competition was won by a Hawker Cygnet .

On 11 April 1933 , William Newton Lancaster departed Lympne in an Avro Avian V ( G @-@ <unk> ) Southern Cross Minor to beat Amy Johnson 's UK @-@ South Africa record . The aircraft crashed in the Sahara next day and although Lancaster survived he died eight days later when his water ran out . On 2 November 1934 , Owen Cathcart Jones and Ken Waller landed at Lympne in a de Havilland Comet ( G @-@ ACSR ) after a record breaking flight from Australia to the United Kingdom . Harry Frank Broadbent landed at Lympne in a <unk> Leopard Moth ( VH @-@ <unk> ) on arrival from Australia on 27 April 1937 , filmed by Gaumont News , and an Australia @-@ UK record was set . On 24 October 1937 Jean Batten flew to Lympne in a Percival Gull Six ( G @-@ <unk> ) , having set a solo Australia @-@ UK record and female Australia @-@ UK record . 
 In 1947 , four national records were set at the Lympne Air Races . 
 On 8 May 1960 , a world record was set for the distance flown by a model aircraft at 45 @.@ 75 mi ( 73 @.@ 63 km ) . The 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 59 m ) wingspan aircraft had taken off from Lympne and was flown by radio control from cars to Sidcup .

 Club flying started in November 1927 with the East Kent Flying Club and although membership reached 220 by 1931 the club was struggling financially . On 1 January 1932 it became part of Brooklands Aviation and was renamed as the Cinque Ports Flying Club . Lympne was visited by many aviation personalities . Ken Waller learnt to fly at Lympne and became a long @-@ distance and race pilot . W. E. Davis was the secretary / manager of Cinque Ports Flying Club from 1932 until his death in 1938 . His wife Ann took over the position in the 18 months leading up to the Second World War . On 22 May 1937 the Duke and Duchess of Kent visited Lympne in an Airspeed Envoy ( G @-@ <unk> ) of the King 's Flight while visiting Shorncliffe Barracks . From 1938 the club participated in the Civil Air Guard training programme , giving subsidised flying lessons . The Currie Wot was designed and built at Lympne . The Cinque Ports Flying Club restarted after the war but folded on 1 October 1948 . 
 = = Silver City Airways = = 
 Silver City Airways moved to Lympne in 1948 , operating Bristol Freighter Mk.21 aircraft and an aerial car ferry to Le Touquet started on 13 July 1948 . The air ferry was the idea of Griffith J Powell , who wanted to holiday in France but did not like the ferry . Bristol lent an aircraft for an experiment on 7 July 1948 . The first car was Powell 's Armstrong Siddeley 16 which was carried by G @-@ <unk> Bristol Freighter Mk.21 could carry two cars . Although only 170 cars were carried in 1948 , experience was gained . 
 The service was initially operated on a charter basis . Having closed down over the winter , the service was resumed as a scheduled service on 13 April 1949 . During 1949 , two aircraft carried 2 @,@ 700 cars . By 1950 the figures had risen to 3 @,@ 850 cars and 1 @,@ 000 motorcycles and other vehicles with passengers totalling 15 @,@ 000 . In that year , a London driver offered a London @-@ Paris taxi service . Silver City Airways had estimated that they would carry nearly 7 @,@ 000 cars in 1953 , but this figure was reached in 1951 . The three aircraft had to be doubled to six to cope . Over 13 @,@ 000 vehicles were carried , with 42 return flights daily at peak times . The time between Lympne and Le Touquet was 18 minutes . 
 In February 1953 , Lympne was waterlogged and services were temporarily transferred to Southend . In September waterlogging again stopped the air ferry , which was transferred to RAF West Malling . Six Bristol Freighter <unk> were introduced in March 1953 , at a cost of £ 540 @,@ 000 , which could each carry three cars and a service to Ostend was started with the aircraft . Skyways remained at Lympne until October 1954 when it moved to Lydd ( Ferryfield ) . On 3 October 1954 , the last Silver City flight to Le Touquet was operated by Bristol Freighter G @-@ <unk> . Silver City moved to Lydd because the runway at Lympne was not suitable . Although it had campaigned for improvements to the runway and was Lympne 's biggest customer the airfields owners , the Ministry of Civil Aviation , refused . Silver City said it would build an airport suitable for its needs at Lydd .

 = Armillaria gallica = 
 Armillaria gallica ( synonymous with A. bulbosa and A. lutea ) is a species of honey mushroom in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales order . The species is a common and ecologically important wood @-@ decay fungus that can live as a saprobe , or as an opportunistic parasite in weakened tree hosts to cause root or butt rot . It is found in temperate regions of Asia , North America , and Europe . The species forms fruit bodies singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood . The fungus has been inadvertently introduced to South Africa . Armillaria gallica has had a confusing taxonomy , due in part to historical difficulties encountered in distinguishing between similar Armillaria species . The fungus received international attention in the early 1990s when an individual colony living in a Michigan forest was reported to cover an area of 15 hectares ( 37 acres ) , weigh at least 9 @,@ 500 kilograms ( 21 @,@ 000 lb ) , and be 1 @,@ 500 years old . This individual is popularly known as the " <unk> fungus " , and is a tourist attraction and inspiration for an annual mushroom @-@ themed festival in Crystal Falls . 
 Armillaria gallica is a largely subterranean fungus , and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter , yellow @-@ brown , and covered with small scales . On the underside of the caps are gills that are white to creamy or pale orange . The stem may be up to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) long , with a white cobwebby ring that divides the color of the stem into pale orange to brown above , and lighter @-@ colored below . The fungus can develop an extensive system of underground root @-@ like structures , called rhizomorphs , that help it to efficiently decompose dead wood in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests . It has been the subject of considerable scientific research due to its importance as a plant pathogen , its ability to <unk> , its unusual life cycle , and its ability to form large and long @-@ lived colonies . 
 = = Phylogeny , taxonomy and naming = = 
 Confusion has surrounded the nomenclature and taxonomy of the species now known as Armillaria gallica , paralleling that surrounding the genus Armillaria . The type species , Armillaria mellea , was until the 1970s believed to be a pleiomorphic species with a wide distribution , variable pathogenicity , and one of the broadest host ranges known for the fungi . In 1973 , Veikko Hintikka reported a technique to distinguish between Armillaria species by growing them together as single spore isolates on petri dishes and observing changes in the morphology of the cultures . Using a similar technique , Kari Korhonen showed in 1978 that the European Armillaria mellea species complex could be separated into five reproductively isolated species , which he named " European Biological Species " ( EBS ) A through E. About the same time , the North American A. mellea was shown to be ten different species ( North American Biological Species , or NABS I through X ) ; NABS VII was demonstrated shortly after to be the same species as EBS E. Because several research groups had worked with this widely distributed species , it was assigned several different names . 
 The species that Korhonen called EBS B was named A. bulbosa by Helga <unk> in 1982 , as it was thought to be equivalent to Armillaria mellea var. bulbosa , first described by Joseph Barla in 1887 , and later raised to species status by Josef Velenovský in 1927 . In 1973 , the French mycologist Henri Romagnesi , unaware of Velenovský 's publication , published a description of the species he called <unk> bulbosa , based on specimens he had found near Compiègne and Saint @-@ Sauveur @-@ le @-@ Vicomte in France . These specimens were later demonstrated to be the same species as the EBS E of Korhonen ; EBS B was later determined to be A. cepistipes . Therefore , the name A. bulbosa was a misapplied name for EBS E. In 1987 Romagnesi and <unk> renamed EBS E to Armillaria gallica . Another synonym , A. lutea , had originally been described by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1874 , and proposed as a name for EBS E. Although the name had priority due to its early publication date , it was rejected as a nomen ambiguum because of a lack of supporting evidence to identify the fungus , including a specimen , type locality , and incomplete collection notes . A. inflata ( Velenovský , 1920 ) may represent another synonym , but the type specimens were not preserved , so it is considered a dubious name ( nomen dubium ) . As of 2010 , both the Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider Armillaria gallica <unk> . & <unk> to be the current name , with A. bulbosa and A. lutea as synonyms . 
 Phylogenetic analysis of North American Armillaria species based on analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphism data suggests that A. gallica is most closely related to A. <unk> , A. cepistipes , and A. calvescens . These results are similar to those reported in 1992 that compared sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA . 
 The specific epithet gallica is botanical Latin for " French " ( from Gallia , " Gaul " ) , and refers to the type locality . The prior name bulbosa is Latin for " bulb @-@ bearing , bulbous " ( from bulbus and the suffix <unk> ) . Armillaria is derived from the Latin <unk> , or " bracelet " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of Armillaria gallica have caps that are 2 @.@ 5 – 9 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 7 in ) broad , and depending on their age , may range in shape from conical to convex to flattened . The caps are brownish @-@ yellow to brown when moist , often with a darker @-@ colored center ; the color tends to fade upon drying . The cap surface is covered with slender fibers ( same color as the cap ) that are erect , or sloping upwards . 
 When the fruit bodies are young , the underside of the caps have a cottony layer of tissue stretching from the edge of the cap to the stem — a partial veil — which serves to protect the developing gills . As the cap grows in size the membrane is eventually pulled away from the cap to expose the gills . The gills have an adnate ( squarely attached ) to somewhat decurrent ( extending down the length of the stem ) attachment to the stem . They are initially white , but age to a creamy or pale orange covered with rust @-@ colored spots . The stem is 4 – 10 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) long and 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 71 in ) thick , and almost club @-@ shaped with the base up to 1 @.@ 3 – 2 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 1 in ) thick . Above the level of the ring , the stem is pale orange to brown , while below it is whitish or pale pink , becoming grayish @-@ brown at the base . The ring is positioned about 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 9 cm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 35 in ) below the level of the cap , and may be covered with yellowish to pale @-@ brownish woolly cottony mycelia . The base of the stem is attached to rhizomorphs , black root @-@ like structures 1 – 3 mm in diameter . While the primary function of the below @-@ ground mycelia is to absorb nutrients from the soil , the rhizomorphs serve a more exploratory function , to locate new food bases . 
 = = = Microscopic features = = = 
 When the spores are seen in deposit , such as with a spore print , they appear whitish . They have an ellipsoid or oblong shape , usually contain an oil droplet , and have dimensions of 7 – 8 @.@ 5 by 5 – 6 µm . The spore @-@ bearing cells , the basidia , are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored ( rarely two @-@ spored ) , and measure 32 – 43 by 7 – 8 @.@ 7 µm . Other cells present in the fertile hymenium include the cheilocystidia ( cystidia present on the edge of a gill ) , which are club @-@ shaped , roughly cylindrical and 15 – 25 by 5 @.@ 0 – 12 µm . Cystidia are also present on the stem ( called caulocystidia ) , and are broadly club @-@ shaped , measuring 20 – 55 by 11 – 23 µm . The cap cuticle is made of hyphae that are irregularly interwoven and project upward to form the scales seen on the surface . The hyphae that make up the surface scales typically measure 26 – 88 µm long by 11 – 27 µm thick and can be covered with a crust of pigment . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of most tissues . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Like all Armillaria species , A. gallica is considered edible . Thorough cooking is usually recommended , as the raw mushroom tastes acrid when fresh or undercooked . One author advises to consume only a small portion initially , as some people may experience an upset stomach . The taste is described as " mild to bitter " , and the odor " sweet " , or reminiscent of <unk> cheese . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Armillaria calvescens is rather similar in appearance , and can only be reliably distinguished from A. gallica by observing microscopic characteristics . A. calvescens has a more northern distribution , and in North America , is rarely found south of the Great Lakes . A. mellea has a thinner stem than A. gallica , but can be more definitively distinguished by the absence of clamps at the base of the basidia . Similarly , A. cepistipes and A. gallica are virtually identical in appearance ( especially older fruit bodies ) , and are identified by differences in geographical distribution , host range , and microscopic characteristics . Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1 @-@ alpha . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Armillaria gallica can produce <unk> @-@ containing metabolites such as <unk> , a natural product that is classified as a sesquiterpenoid aryl ester . Although the specific function of <unk> is not definitively known , similar chemicals present in other Armillaria species are thought to play a role in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi , or in killing cells of the host plant prior to infection . 
 = = = Bioluminescence = = = 
 The mycelia ( but not the fruit bodies ) of Armillaria gallica are known to be bioluminescent . Experiments have shown that the intensity of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light . Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases , enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin ( a pigment ) . The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known , although several hypotheses have been suggested : it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal , it may be a by @-@ product of other biochemical functions , or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus . 
 = = Humongous fungus = = 
 Researchers reported finding Armillaria gallica in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early 1990s , during an unrelated research project to study the possible biological effects of extremely low frequency radio stations , which were being investigated as a means to communicate with submerged submarines . In one particular forest stand , Armillaria @-@ infected oak trees had been harvested , and their stumps were left to rot in the field . Later , when red pines were planted in the same location , the seedlings were killed by the fungus , identified as A. gallica ( then known as A. bulbosa ) . Using molecular genetics , they determined that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered 15 ha ( 37 acres ) , weighing over 9 @,@ 500 kilograms ( 21 @,@ 000 lb ) , with an estimated age of 1 @,@ 500 years . The analysis used restriction fragment length polymorphism ( <unk> ) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA ( <unk> ) to examine isolates collected from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs ( underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots ) along 1 @-@ kilometer ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) transects in the forest . The 15 @-@ hectare area yielded isolates that had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment patterns ; this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual , or clone , that had reached its size through vegetative growth . In their conclusion the authors noted : " This is the first report estimating the minimum size , mass , and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual . Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater , members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth . " After the Nature paper was published , major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found ; as a result of this publicity , the individual acquired the common name " humongous fungus " . There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood . 
 The fungus has since become a popular tourist attraction in Michigan , and has inspired a " Humongous Fungus Fest " held annually in August in Crystal Falls . The organism was the subject of a Late Show Top Ten List on Late Night with David Letterman , and an advertising campaign by the rental company U @-@ Haul . 
 = = Life cycle and growth = = 
 The life cycle of A. gallica includes two <unk> – haploidization events . The first of these is the usual process of cell fusion ( forming a diploid ) followed by meiosis during the formation of haploid basidiospores . The second event is more cryptic , and occurs before fruit body formation . In most <unk> fungi , the hyphae of compatible mating types will fuse to form a two @-@ nucleate , or dikaryotic stage ; this stage is not observed in Armillaria species , which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid . Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a genetic mosaic . These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased genetic diversity , which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions , like drought . 
 The growth rate of A. gallica rhizomorphs is between 0 @.@ 3 and 0 @.@ 6 m ( 1 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 0 ft ) per year . Population genetic studies of the fungus conducted in the 1990s demonstrated that genetic individuals grow <unk> from a single point of origin to eventually occupy territories that may include many adjacent root systems over large areas ( several hectares ) of forest floor . Based on the low mutation rates observed in large , long @-@ lived individuals , A. gallica appears to have an especially stable genome . It has also been hypothesized that genetic stability may result from self @-@ renewing mycelial repositories of nuclei with stem cell @-@ like properties . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Armillaria gallica can normally be found on the ground , but sometimes on stumps and logs . Mushrooms that appear to be terrestrial are attached to plant roots underneath the surface . It is widely distributed and has been collected in North America , Europe , and Asia ( China , Iran , and Japan ) . The species has also been found in the Western Cape Province of South Africa , where it is thought to have been introduced from potted plants imported from Europe during the early colonization of Cape Town . In Scandinavia , it is absent in areas with very cold climates , like Finland or Norway , but it is found in southern Sweden . It is thought to be the most prevalent low altitude species of Armillaria in Great Britain and France . The upper limits of its altitude vary by region . In the French Massif Central , it is found up to 1 @,@ 100 m ( 3 @,@ 600 ft ) , while in Bavaria , which has a more continental climate , the upper limit of distribution reaches 600 m ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) . In Serbian forests , it is the most common Armillaria between elevations of 70 to 1 @,@ 450 m ( 230 to 4 @,@ 760 ft ) . Field studies suggest that A. gallica prefers sites that are low in organic matter and have high soil pHs . 
 In North America , it is common east of the Rocky Mountains , but rare in the Pacific Northwest . In California , where it is widely distributed , the fungus is found in a variety of plant communities , including aspen , coastal oak woodland , Douglas Fir , Klamath mixed conifer , montane hardwood , montane hardwood @-@ conifer , montane riparian , Redwood , Sierran mixed conifer , valley oak woodland , valley @-@ foothill riparian , and White Fir . It was found to be the most common Armillaria species in hardwood and mixed oak forests in western Massachusetts . 
 A Chinese study published in 2001 used the molecular biological technique restriction fragment length polymorphism to analyze the differences in DNA sequence between 23 A. gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere . The results suggest that based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns observed , there are four global A. gallica subpopulations : the Chinese , European , North American – Chinese , and North American – European geographical lineages . A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria , using fruit body and pure culture morphology , concluded that there are several unnamed species ( Chinese biological species C , F , H , J and L ) that are similar to the common A. gallica . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Armillaria gallica is a weaker pathogen than the related A. <unk> or A. <unk> , and is considered a secondary parasite — typically initiating infection only after the host 's defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation , drought , or infection by another fungus . Fungal infection can lead to root rot or butt rot . As the diseased trees die , the wood dries , increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning . The resulting forest fire may in turn kill the species that killed the trees . Plants that are under water stress caused by dry soils or waterlogging are more susceptible to infection by A. gallica . It has been shown to be one of several Armillaria species responsible for widespread mortality of oak trees in the Arkansas Ozarks . The fungus has also been shown to infect <unk> in South Carolina , Northern highbush blueberry ( Vaccinium <unk> ) in Italy and vineyards ( Vitis species ) of <unk> <unk> in northwestern Spain . The latter infestation " may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites " . When A. solidipes and A. gallica co @-@ occur in the same forest , infection of root systems by A. gallica may reduce damage or prevent infection from A. solidipes . 
 Armillaria gallica can develop an extensive subterranean system of rhizomorphs , which helps it to compete with other fungi for resources or to attack trees weakened by other fungi . A field study in an ancient broadleaved woodland in England showed that of five Armillaria species present in the woods , A. gallica was consistently the first to colonize tree stumps that had been coppiced the previous year . Fractal geometry has been used to model the branching patterns of the hyphae of various Armillaria species . Compared to a strongly pathogenic species like A. solidipes , A. gallica has a relatively sparse branching pattern that is thought to be " consistent with a foraging strategy in which acceptable food bases may be encountered at any distance , and which favours broad and divisive distribution of potential inoculum . " Because the rhizomorphs form regular networks , mathematical concepts of graph theory have been employed to describe fungal growth and interpret ecological strategies , suggesting that the specific patterns of network attachments allow the fungus " to respond opportunistically to spatially and temporally changing environments " . 
 Armillaria gallica may itself be parasitized by other soil flora . Several species of the fungus Trichoderma , including Trichoderma <unk> , T. <unk> and T. viride , are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A. gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae . The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about one week after the initial infection . Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A. gallica . The whitish @-@ gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the E. abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development .

 Rififi ( French : Du rififi chez les <unk> ) is a 1955 French crime film adaptation of Auguste Le Breton 's novel of the same name . Directed by American blacklisted filmmaker Jules Dassin , the film stars Jean Servais as the aging gangster Tony " le Stéphanois " , Carl Möhner as Jo " le Suédois " , Robert Manuel as Mario <unk> , and Jules Dassin as César " le Milanais " . The foursome band together to commit an almost impossible theft , the burglary of an exclusive jewelry shop on the Rue de Rivoli . The centerpiece of the film is an intricate half @-@ hour heist scene depicting the crime in detail , shot in near silence , without dialogue or music . The fictional burglary has been mimicked by criminals in actual crimes around the world . 
 After he was blacklisted from Hollywood , Dassin found work in France where he was asked to direct Rififi . Despite his distaste for parts of the original novel , Dassin agreed to direct the film . He shot Rififi while working with a low budget , without a star cast , and with the production staff working for low wages . 
 Upon the initial release of the film , it received positive reactions from audiences and critics in France , the United States , and the United Kingdom . The film earned Dassin the award for Best Director at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival . Rififi was nominated by the National Board of Review for Best Foreign Film . Rififi was re @-@ released theatrically in both 2000 and 2015 and is still highly acclaimed by modern film critics as one of the greatest works in French film noir .

 The film Rififi was originally to be directed by Jean @-@ Pierre Melville , a later luminary of the heist film genre . Melville gave his blessing to American director Jules Dassin when the latter asked for his permission to take the helm . It was Dassin 's first film in five years ; he had been blacklisted by the House Committee on Un @-@ American Activities after fellow director Edward Dmytryk named him a communist in April 1951 . Subsequently , Dassin attempted to rebuild his career in Europe . Several such film projects were stopped through long @-@ distance efforts by the US government . Dassin attempted a film L <unk> public numero un , which was halted after stars <unk> and Zsa Zsa Gabor withdrew under American pressure . An attempt to film an adaptation of Giovanni <unk> 's Mastro don Gesualdo in Rome was halted by the US Embassy . Dassin received an offer from an agent in Paris , France where he met producer Henri Bérard who had acquired the rights to Auguste Le Breton 's popular crime novel Du Rififi chez les hommes . Bérard chose Dassin due to the major success in France of Dassin 's previous film The Naked City . 
 Using his native English , Dassin wrote the screenplay to Rififi in six days with the help of screenwriter René Wheeler , who subsequently took the material and translated it to French . Dassin hated the novel ; he was repelled by the story 's racist theme in which the rival gangsters were dark Arabs and North Africans pitted against light @-@ skinned Europeans . As well , the book portrayed disquieting events such as necrophilia — scenes that Dassin did not know how to bring to the big screen . For the rival gang , the producer suggested making them Americans , assuming Dassin would approve . Dassin was against this idea as he didn 't want to be accused of taking oblique revenge on screen . Dassin downplayed the rival gangsters ' ethnicity in his screenplay , simply electing the Germanic " Grutter " as surname . The greatest change from the book was the heist scene , which spanned but ten pages of the 250 @-@ page novel . Dassin focused his screenplay on it to get past other events he did not know what to do with . As produced , the scene takes a quarter of the film 's running time and is shot with only natural sound , sans spoken words or music . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Working with a budget of $ 200 @,@ 000 , Dassin could not afford top stars for the film . To carry the lead role , Dassin selected Jean Servais , an actor whose career had slumped due to alcoholism . For Italian gangster Mario Ferrati , Dassin cast Robert Manuel after seeing him perform a comic role as a member of Comédie @-@ Française . After a suggestion made by the wife of the film 's producer , Dassin cast Carl Möhner as Jo the Swede . Dassin would use Möhner again in his next film He Who Must Die . Dassin himself played the role of the Italian safecracker César the Milanese . Dassin explained in an interview that he " had cast a very good actor in Italy , whose name escapes me , but he never got the contract ! ... So I had to put on the mustache and do the part myself " . 
 Rififi was filmed during the wintertime in Paris and used real locations rather than studio sets . Due to the low budget , the locations were scouted by Dassin himself . Dassin 's fee for writing , directing , and acting was US $ 8 @,@ 000 . Dassin 's production designer , to whom he referred as " one of the greatest men in the history of cinema " was Alexandre <unk> . Out of friendship for Dassin , <unk> did the film for very little money . Dassin argued with his producer Henri Bérard on two points : Dassin refused to shoot the film when there was sunlight claiming that he " just wanted grey " ; and that there were to be no fist fights in the film . Such fight scenes had been important to the popular success in France of the Lemmy Caution film series . 
 Rififi 's heist scene was based on an actual burglary that took place in 1899 along Marseille 's cours St @-@ Louis . A gang broke into the first floor offices of a travel agency , cutting a hole in the floor and using an umbrella to catch the debris in order to make off with the contents of the jeweler 's shop below . The scene where Tony regretfully chooses to kill César for his betrayal of the thieves ' code of silence was filmed as an allusion to how Dassin and others felt after finding their contemporaries willing to name names in front of the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee . This act was not in the original novel . 
 = = = Music and title = = = 
 Georges Auric was hired as the composer for the film . Dassin and Auric originally could not agree about scoring the half @-@ hour caper scene . After Dassin told Auric he did not want music , Auric claimed he would " protect [ him ] . I 'm going to write the music for the scene anyways , because you need to be protected " . After filming was finished , Dassin showed the film to Auric once with music and once without . Afterward , Auric agreed the scene should be unscored . 
 In 2001 , Dassin admitted that he somewhat regretted the Rififi theme song , utilized only to explain the film 's title which is never mentioned by any other film characters . The title ( Word War I French military slang ) is almost un @-@ translatable into English ; the closest attempts have been " rough and tumble " and " pitched battle . " Dassin mistakenly thought the author had created the word himself to refer to Moroccan Berbers because of the Rif War . The song was written in two days by lyricist Jacques <unk> and composer Philippe @-@ Gérard after Dassin turned down a proposal by <unk> . Magali Noël was cast as Viviane , who sings the film 's theme song . Noël would later act for Italian director Federico Fellini , appearing in three of his films . 
 = = Release = = 
 Rififi debuted in France on 13 April 1955 . The film was banned in some countries due to its heist scene , referred to by the Los Angeles Times reviewer as a " master class in breaking and entering as well as filmmaking " . The Mexican interior ministry banned the film because of a series of burglaries mimicking its heist scene . Rififi was banned in Finland in the late 1950s . In answer to critics who saw the film as an educational process that taught people how to commit burglary , Dassin claimed the film showed how difficult it was to actually carry out a crime . 
 Rififi was a popular success in France which led to several other Rififi films based on le Breton 's stories . These films include Du rififi chez les femmes ( 1959 ) , Du rififi à Tokyo ( 1961 ) , and Du rififi à <unk> ( 1965 ) . On its United Kingdom release , Rififi was paired with the British science fiction film The Quatermass Xperiment as a double bill ; this went on to be the most successful double @-@ bill release in UK cinemas in all of 1955 . The film was offered distribution in the United States on the condition that Dassin renounce his past , declaring that he was duped into subversive associations . Otherwise , his name would be removed from the film as the writer and director . Dassin refused and the film was released by United Artists who set up a dummy corporation as the distributing company . The film was distributed successfully in America with Dassin listed in the credits ; in this way he was the first to break the Hollywood blacklist . Rififi was released in the United States first with subtitles and then later with an English dub under the title Rififi ... Means Trouble ! . The film caused controversy on its release from The Roman Catholic Legion of Decency . The film endured three brief cuts in it and opened with a title card quoting the Book of Proverbs stating " When the wicked are multiplied , crime shall be multiplied : but the just shall see their downfall " . After this change , the film passed with a B rating . In 2005 , Variety announced that Stone Village Pictures had acquired the remake rights to Rififi , the producers intending to place the film in a modern setting with Al Pacino taking the lead role . 
 = = = Home media = = = 
 In North America , Rififi has been released on both VHS and DVD . The VHS print has been reviewed negatively by critics . Roger Ebert referred to it as " shabby " while Bill Hunt and Todd <unk> , the authors of The Digital Bits Insider 's Guide to DVD , referred to the VHS version as " horrible " and with " crappy subtitles " . The Criterion Collection released a DVD version of the film on 24 April 2001 . In the United Kingdom , Rififi was released on DVD by Arrow Films on 21 April 2003 , and on Region B Blu @-@ ray by the same publisher on 9 May 2011 . The film was released to Blu @-@ Ray in Region 1 by Criterion on 14 January 2014 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Upon its original release , film critic and future director François Truffaut praised the film , stating that " Out of the worst crime novels I ever read , Jules Dassin has made the best crime film I 've ever seen " and " Everything in Le Rififi is intelligent : screenplay , dialogue , sets , music , choice of actors . Jean Servais , Robert Manuel , and Jules Dassin are perfect . " French critic André Bazin said that Rififi brought the genre a " sincerity and humanity that break with the conventions of a crime film , and manage to touch our hearts " . In the February 1956 issue of the French film magazine Cahiers du cinéma , the film was listed as number thirteen in the top twenty films of 1955 . The film was well received by British critics who noted the film 's violence on its initial release . The Daily Mirror referred to the film as " brilliant and brutal " while the Daily Herald made note that Rififi would " make American attempts at screen brutality look like a tea party in cathedral city " . The American release of the film also received acclaim . Bosley Crowther of The New York Times referred to the film as " perhaps the keenest crime film that ever came from France , including " Pepe le Moko " and some of the best of Louis Jouvet and Jean <unk> . " The National Board of Review nominated the film as the Best Foreign Film in 1956 . 
 Rififi was re @-@ released for a limited run within America on 21 July 2000 in a new 35 mm print containing new , more explicit subtitles that were enhanced in collaboration with Dassin . The film was received very well by American critics on its re @-@ release . The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 93 % of critics had given the film positive reviews , based upon a sample of 41 . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film has received an average score of 97 , based on 13 reviews . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote the film was the " benchmark all succeeding heist films have been measured against ... It 's a film whose influence is hard to overstate , one that proves for not the last time that it 's easier to break into a safe than fathom the mysteries of the human heart . " Lucia Bozzola of the online database Allmovie gave the film the highest possible rating of five stars , calling it " The pinnacle of heist movies " and " not only one of the best French noirs , but one of the top movies in the genre . " In 2002 , critic Roger Ebert added the film to his list of " Great Movies " stating " echoes of [ Rififi ] can be found from Kubrick 's " The Killing " to Tarantino 's " Reservoir Dogs . " They both owe something to John Huston 's " The Asphalt Jungle " ( 1950 ) , which has the general idea but not the attention to detail . " Among negative reviews of the film , Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader felt that " the film turns moralistic and sour in the last half , when the thieves fall out . " Rififi placed at number 90 on Empire 's list of The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema . Critic and director Jean @-@ Luc Godard regarded the film negatively in comparison to other French crime films of the era , noting in 1986 that " today it can 't hold a candle to <unk> pas au <unk> which paved the way for it , let alone Bob le <unk> which it paved the way for .

 = Hepatitis B = 
 Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) which affects the liver . It can cause both acute and chronic infections . Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection . Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting , yellowish skin , tiredness , dark urine and abdominal pain . Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death . It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin . In those who get infected around the time of birth 90 % develop chronic hepatitis B while less than 10 % of those infected after the age of five do . Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms ; however , cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop . These complications result in the death of 15 to 25 % of those with chronic disease . 
 The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids . Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people 's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common . In areas where the disease is rare , intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection . Other risk factors include working in healthcare , blood transfusions , dialysis , living with an infected person , travel in countries where the infection rate is high , and living in an institution . <unk> and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s ; however , this has become less common with improved sterility . The hepatitis B viruses cannot be spread by holding hands , sharing eating utensils , kissing , hugging , coughing , sneezing , or breastfeeding . The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure . Diagnosis is typically by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus . It is one of five known hepatitis viruses : A , B , C , D , and E. 
 The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982 . Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if possible . Two or three more doses are required at a later time for full effect . This vaccine works about 95 % of the time . About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006 . It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection . During an initial infection , care is based on the symptoms that a person has . In those who develop chronic disease antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful ; however , these drugs are expensive . Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis . 
 About a third of the world population has been infected at one point in their lives , including 240 million to 350 million who have chronic infections . Another 129 million new infections occurred in 2013 . Over 750 @,@ 000 people die of hepatitis B each year . About 300 @,@ 000 of these are due to liver cancer . The disease is now only common in East Asia and sub @-@ Saharan Africa where between 5 and 10 % of adults are chronically infected . Rates in Europe and North America are less than 1 % . It was originally known as serum hepatitis . Research is looking to create foods that contain HBV vaccine . The disease may affect other great apes as well . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Acute infection with hepatitis B virus is associated with acute viral hepatitis – an illness that begins with general ill @-@ health , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting , body aches , mild fever , and dark urine , and then progresses to development of jaundice . It has been noted that itchy skin has been an indication as a possible symptom of all hepatitis virus types . The illness lasts for a few weeks and then gradually improves in most affected people . A few people may have more severe liver disease ( fulminant hepatic failure ) , and may die as a result . The infection may be entirely asymptomatic and may go unrecognized . 
 Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus either may be asymptomatic or may be associated with a chronic inflammation of the liver ( chronic hepatitis ) , leading to cirrhosis over a period of several years . This type of infection dramatically increases the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) . Across Europe hepatitis B and C cause approximately 50 % of hepatocellular carcinomas . Chronic carriers are encouraged to avoid consuming alcohol as it increases their risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer . Hepatitis B virus has been linked to the development of membranous glomerulonephritis ( <unk> ) . 
 Symptoms outside of the liver are present in 1 – 10 % of HBV @-@ infected people and include serum @-@ sickness – like syndrome , acute necrotizing vasculitis ( polyarteritis nodosa ) , membranous glomerulonephritis , and <unk> acrodermatitis of childhood ( <unk> – <unk> syndrome ) . The serum @-@ sickness – like syndrome occurs in the setting of acute hepatitis B , often preceding the onset of jaundice . The clinical features are fever , skin rash , and polyarteritis . The symptoms often subside shortly after the onset of jaundice , but can persist throughout the duration of acute hepatitis B. About 30 – 50 % of people with acute necrotizing vasculitis ( polyarteritis nodosa ) are HBV carriers . HBV @-@ associated nephropathy has been described in adults but is more common in children . <unk> glomerulonephritis is the most common form . Other immune @-@ mediated hematological disorders , such as essential mixed cryoglobulinemia and aplastic anemia . 
 = = Cause = = 
 = = = Transmission = = = 
 Transmission of hepatitis B virus results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids containing blood . It is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV . Possible forms of transmission include sexual contact , blood transfusions and transfusion with other human blood products , re @-@ use of contaminated needles and syringes , and vertical transmission from mother to child ( <unk> ) during childbirth . Without intervention , a mother who is positive for HBsAg has a 20 % risk of passing the infection to her offspring at the time of birth . This risk is as high as 90 % if the mother is also positive for HBeAg . HBV can be transmitted between family members within households , possibly by contact of <unk> skin or mucous membrane with secretions or saliva containing HBV . However , at least 30 % of reported hepatitis B among adults cannot be associated with an identifiable risk factor . Breastfeeding after proper <unk> does not appear to contribute to mother @-@ to @-@ child @-@ transmission ( <unk> ) of HBV . The virus may be detected within 30 to 60 days after infection and can persist and develop into chronic hepatitis <unk> incubation period of the hepatitis B virus is 75 days on average , but can vary from 30 to 180 days . 
 = = = Virology = = = 
 = = = = Structure = = = = 
 Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is a member of the <unk> family . The virus particle ( virion ) consists of an outer lipid envelope and an icosahedral nucleocapsid core composed of protein . These virions are 30 @-@ 42 nm in diameter . The nucleocapsid encloses the viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has reverse transcriptase activity . The outer envelope contains embedded proteins that are involved in viral binding of , and entry into , susceptible cells . The virus is one of the smallest enveloped animal viruses , and the 42 nm virions , which are capable of infecting liver cells known as hepatocytes , are referred to as " Dane particles " . In addition to the Dane particles , filamentous and spherical bodies lacking a core can be found in the serum of infected individuals . These particles are not infectious and are composed of the lipid and protein that forms part of the surface of the virion , which is called the surface antigens ( HBsAg ) , and is produced in excess during the life cycle of the virus . 
 = = = = Genome = = = = 
 The genome of HBV is made of circular DNA , but it is unusual because the DNA is not fully double @-@ stranded . One end of the full length strand is linked to the viral DNA polymerase . The genome is 3020 – <unk> nucleotides long ( for the full @-@ length strand ) and 1700 – 2800 nucleotides long ( for the short length @-@ strand ) . The negative @-@ sense ( non @-@ coding ) is complementary to the viral mRNA . The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell . The partially double @-@ stranded DNA is rendered fully double @-@ stranded by completion of the ( + ) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the ( − ) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the ( + ) sense strand . Non @-@ coding bases are removed from the ends of the ( − ) sense strand and the ends are rejoined . There are four known genes encoded by the genome , called C , X , P , and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C ( <unk> ) , and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in @-@ frame AUG start codon from which the pre @-@ core protein is produced . HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre @-@ core protein . In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus <unk> mutants , no HBeAg is present . The DNA polymerase is encoded by gene P. Gene S is the gene that codes for the surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame " start " ( ATG ) codons that divide the gene into three sections , pre @-@ S1 , pre @-@ S2 , and S. Because of the multiple start codons , polypeptides of three different sizes called large ( the order from surface to the inside : pre @-@ S1 , pre @-@ S2 , and S ) , middle ( pre @-@ S2 , S ) , and small ( S ) are produced . The function of the protein coded for by gene X is not fully understood but it is associated with the development of liver cancer . It stimulates genes that promote cell growth and inactivates growth regulating molecules . 
 = = = = Pathogenesis = = = = 
 The life cycle of hepatitis B virus is complex . Hepatitis B is one of a few known pararetroviruses : non @-@ retroviruses that still use reverse transcription in their replication process . The virus gains entry into the cell by binding to NTCP on the surface and being <unk> . Because the virus multiplies via RNA made by a host enzyme , the viral genomic DNA has to be transferred to the cell nucleus by host proteins called chaperones . The partially double stranded viral DNA is then made fully double stranded by viral polymerase and transformed into covalently closed circular DNA ( <unk> ) . This <unk> serves as a template for transcription of four viral mRNAs by host RNA polymerase . The largest mRNA , ( which is longer than the viral genome ) , is used to make the new copies of the genome and to make the capsid core protein and the viral DNA polymerase . These four viral transcripts undergo additional processing and go on to form progeny virions that are released from the cell or returned to the nucleus and re @-@ cycled to produce even more copies . The long mRNA is then transported back to the cytoplasm where the virion P protein ( the DNA polymerase ) synthesizes DNA via its reverse transcriptase activity . 
 = = = = Serotypes and genotypes = = = = 
 The virus is divided into four major serotypes ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) based on antigenic epitopes presented on its envelope proteins , and into eight genotypes ( A – H ) according to overall nucleotide sequence variation of the genome . The genotypes have a distinct geographical distribution and are used in tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus . Differences between genotypes affect the disease severity , course and likelihood of complications , and response to treatment and possibly vaccination . 
 <unk> differ by at least 8 % of their sequence and were first reported in 1988 when six were initially described ( A – F ) . Two further types have since been described ( G and H ) . Most genotypes are now divided into <unk> with distinct properties . 
 = = Mechanisms = = 
 Hepatitis B virus primarily interferes with the functions of the liver by replicating in hepatocytes . A functional receptor is NTCP . There is evidence that the receptor in the closely related duck hepatitis B virus is carboxypeptidase D. The virions bind to the host cell via the <unk> domain of the viral surface antigen and are subsequently internalized by endocytosis . HBV @-@ <unk> @-@ specific receptors are expressed primarily on hepatocytes ; however , viral DNA and proteins have also been detected in extrahepatic sites , suggesting that cellular receptors for HBV may also exist on extrahepatic cells . 
 During HBV infection , the host immune response causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance . Although the innate immune response does not play a significant role in these processes , the adaptive immune response , in particular virus @-@ specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection . CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines , which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes . Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs , antigen @-@ nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL @-@ induced <unk> , and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 The tests , called assays , for detection of hepatitis B virus infection involve serum or blood tests that detect either viral antigens ( proteins produced by the virus ) or antibodies produced by the host . Interpretation of these assays is complex . 
 The hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection . It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection . However , early in an infection , this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host . The infectious virion contains an inner " core particle " enclosing viral genome . The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein , alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen , or <unk> . During this ' window ' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus , IgM antibodies specific to the hepatitis B core antigen ( anti @-@ HBc IgM ) may be the only serological evidence of disease . Therefore , most hepatitis B diagnostic panels contain HBsAg and total anti @-@ HBc ( both IgM and IgG ) . 
 Shortly after the appearance of the HBsAg , another antigen called hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) will appear . Traditionally , the presence of HBeAg in a host 's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity ; however , variants of the hepatitis B virus do not produce the ' e ' antigen , so this rule does not always hold true . During the natural course of an infection , the HBeAg may be cleared , and antibodies to the ' e ' antigen ( anti @-@ <unk> ) will arise immediately afterwards . This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication . 
 If the host is able to clear the infection , eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen ( anti @-@ HBs and anti HBc IgG ) . The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti @-@ HBs is called the window period . A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti @-@ HBs either has cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously . 
 Individuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers . Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B , which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) levels and inflammation of the liver , if they are in the immune clearance phase of chronic infection . Carriers who have <unk> to HBeAg negative status , in particular those who acquired the infection as adults , have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long @-@ term complications or of transmitting infection to others . 
 PCR tests have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA , called the viral load , in clinical specimens . These tests are used to assess a person 's infection status and to monitor treatment . Individuals with high viral loads , characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Vaccines for the prevention of hepatitis B have been routinely recommended for infants since 1991 in the United States . Most vaccines are given in three doses over a course of months . A protective response to the vaccine is defined as an anti @-@ HBs antibody concentration of at least 10 mIU / ml in the recipient 's serum . The vaccine is more effective in children and 95 percent of those vaccinated have protective levels of antibody . This drops to around 90 % at 40 years of age and to around 75 percent in those over 60 years . The protection afforded by vaccination is long lasting even after antibody levels fall below 10 mIU / ml . Vaccination at birth is recommended for all infants of HBV infected mothers . A combination of hepatitis B immune globulin and an accelerated course of HBV vaccine prevents HBV transmission around the time of birth in 86 % to 99 % of cases . 
 All those with a risk of exposure to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated , if not already . Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given to those who are not sufficiently immunized . 
 In assisted reproductive technology , sperm washing is not necessary for males with hepatitis B to prevent transmission , unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated . In females with hepatitis B , the risk of transmission from mother to child with IVF is no different from the risk in spontaneous conception . 
 Those at high risk of infection should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease . Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following : people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2 % , those with HIV , intravenous drug users , men who have sex with men , and those who live with someone with hepatitis B. 
 = = = Duration of vaccination = = = 
 In 10- to 22 @-@ year follow @-@ up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among those with a normal immune system who were vaccinated . Only rare chronic infections have been documented . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Acute hepatitis B infection does not usually require treatment and most adults clear the infection spontaneously . Early antiviral treatment may be required in fewer than 1 % of people , whose infection takes a very aggressive course ( fulminant hepatitis ) or who are immunocompromised . On the other hand , treatment of chronic infection may be necessary to reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer . Chronically infected individuals with persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase , a marker of liver damage , and HBV DNA levels are candidates for therapy . Treatment lasts from six months to a year , depending on medication and genotype . 
 Although none of the available drugs can clear the infection , they can stop the virus from replicating , thus minimizing liver damage . As of 2008 , there are seven medications licensed for treatment of hepatitis B infection in the United States . These include antiviral drugs lamivudine ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , tenofovir ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) , and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha @-@ 2a and PEGylated interferon alpha @-@ 2a ( <unk> ) . The World Health Organization recommended a combination of tenofovir and <unk> as first line agents . Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment . 
 The use of interferon , which requires injections daily or thrice weekly , has been supplanted by long @-@ acting PEGylated interferon , which is injected only once weekly . However , some individuals are much more likely to respond than others , and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person 's heredity . The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver , thereby reducing the viral load ( the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood ) . Response to treatment differs between the genotypes . Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37 % in genotype A but only a 6 % seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C <unk> only in 15 % of cases . Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~ 45 % in types A and B but only 25 – 30 % in types C and D. 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Hepatitis B virus infection may be either acute ( self @-@ limiting ) or chronic ( long @-@ standing ) . Persons with self @-@ limiting infection clear the infection spontaneously within weeks to months . 
 Children are less likely than adults to clear the infection . More than 95 % of people who become infected as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus . However , this drops to 30 % for younger children , and only 5 % of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection . This population has a 40 % lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma . Of those infected between the age of one to six , 70 % will clear the infection . 
 Hepatitis D ( <unk> ) can occur only with a concomitant hepatitis B infection , because <unk> uses the HBV surface antigen to form a capsid . Co @-@ infection with hepatitis D increases the risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer . <unk> nodosa is more common in people with hepatitis B infection .

 A number of different tests are available to determine the degree of cirrhosis present . Transient <unk> ( <unk> ) is the test of choice , but it is expensive . Aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index may be used when cost is an issue . 
 = = = Reactivation = = = 
 Hepatitis B virus DNA persists in the body after infection , and in some people the disease recurs . Although rare , reactivation is seen most often following alcohol or drug use , or in people with impaired immunity . HBV goes through cycles of replication and non @-@ replication . Approximately 50 % of overt carriers experience acute reactivation . Males with baseline ALT of 200 UL / L are three times more likely to develop a reactivation than people with lower levels . Although reactivation can occur spontaneously , people who undergo chemotherapy have a higher risk . Immunosuppressive drugs favor increased HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function in the liver . The risk of reactivation varies depending on the serological profile ; those with detectable HBsAg in their blood are at the greatest risk , but those with only antibodies to the core antigen are also at risk . The presence of antibodies to the surface antigen , which are considered to be a marker of immunity , does not preclude reactivation . Treatment with prophylactic antiviral drugs can prevent the serious morbidity associated with HBV disease reactivation . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 In 2004 , an estimated 350 million individuals were infected worldwide . National and regional prevalence ranges from over 10 % in Asia to under 0 @.@ 5 % in the United States and northern Europe . 
 Routes of infection include vertical transmission ( such as through childbirth ) , early life horizontal transmission ( bites , lesions , and sanitary habits ) , and adult horizontal transmission ( sexual contact , intravenous drug use ) . 
 The primary method of transmission reflects the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in a given area . In low prevalence areas such as the continental United States and Western Europe , injection drug abuse and unprotected sex are the primary methods , although other factors may also be important . In moderate prevalence areas , which include Eastern Europe , Russia , and Japan , where 2 – 7 % of the population is chronically infected , the disease is predominantly spread among children . In high @-@ prevalence areas such as China and South East Asia , transmission during childbirth is most common , although in other areas of high endemicity such as Africa , transmission during childhood is a significant factor . The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in areas of high endemicity is at least 8 % with 10 – 15 % prevalence in Africa / Far East . As of 2010 , China has 120 million infected people , followed by India and Indonesia with 40 million and 12 million , respectively . According to World Health Organization ( WHO ) , an estimated 600 @,@ 000 people die every year related to the infection . 
 In the United States about 19 @,@ 000 new cases occurred in 2011 down nearly 90 % from 1990 .

After several weeks , and up to eight months later , 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with jaundice and were diagnosed as suffering from serum hepatitis . Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy . <unk> 's paper , now regarded as a classical example of an epidemiological study , proved that contaminated lymph was the source of the outbreak . Later , numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction , in 1909 , of hypodermic needles that were used , and , more importantly , reused , for administering Salvarsan for the treatment of syphilis . The virus was not discovered until 1966 when Baruch Blumberg , then working at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , discovered the Australia antigen ( later known to be hepatitis B surface antigen , or HBsAg ) in the blood of Australian aboriginal people . Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by MacCallum in 1947 , D.S. Dane and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by electron microscopy . By the early 1980s the genome of the virus had been sequenced , and the first vaccines were being tested .

 = Battle of Chaeronea ( 338 BC ) = 
 The Battle of Chaeronea was fought in 338 BC , near the city of Chaeronea in Boeotia , between the Macedonians led by Philip II of Macedon and an alliance of some of the Greek city @-@ states including Athens and Thebes . The battle was the culmination of Philip 's campaign in Greece ( 339 – 338 BC ) and resulted in a decisive victory for the Macedonians . 
 Philip had brought peace to a war @-@ torn Greece in 346 BC , by ending the Third Sacred War , and concluding his ten @-@ year conflict with Athens for supremacy in the north Aegean , by making a separate peace . Philip 's much expanded kingdom , powerful army and plentiful resources now made him the de facto leader of Greece . To many of the fiercely independent Greek city @-@ states , Philip 's power after 346 BC was perceived as a threat to their liberty , especially in Athens , where the politician Demosthenes led efforts to break away from Philip 's influence . In 340 BC Demosthenes convinced the Athenian assembly to sanction action against Philip 's territories and to ally with Byzantium , which Philip was besieging . These actions were against the terms of their treaty oaths and amounted to a declaration of war . In summer 339 BC , Philip therefore led his army into Greece , prompting the formation of an alliance of Greek states opposed to him , led by Athens and Thebes . 
 After several months of stalemate , Philip finally advanced into Boeotia in an attempt to march on Thebes and Athens . Opposing him , and blocking the road near Chaeronea , was the allied Greek army , similar in size and occupying a strong position . Details of the ensuing battle are scarce , but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line , which then dissolved into a rout . 
 The battle has been described as one of the most decisive of the ancient world . The forces of Athens and Thebes were destroyed , and continued resistance was impossible ; the war therefore came to an abrupt end . Philip was able to impose a settlement upon Greece , which all states accepted , with the exception of Sparta . The League of Corinth , formed as a result , made all participants allies of Macedon and each other , with Philip as the guarantor of the peace . In turn , Philip was voted as strategos ( general ) for a pan @-@ Hellenic war against the Persian Empire , which he had long planned . However , before he was able to take charge of the campaign , Philip was assassinated , and the kingdom of Macedon and responsibility for the war with Persia passed instead to his son Alexander . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the decade following his accession in 359 BC , the Macedonian king , Philip II , had rapidly strengthened and expanded his kingdom into Thrace and <unk> on the northern coast of the Aegean Sea . He was aided in this process by the distraction of Athens and Thebes , the two most powerful city @-@ states in Greece at that point , by events elsewhere . In particular , these events included the Social War between Athens and her erstwhile allies ( 357 – 355 BC ) , and the Third Sacred War which erupted in central Greece in 356 BC between the Phocians and the other members of the Delphic Amphictyonic League . Much of Philip 's expansion during this period was at the nominal expense of the Athenians , who considered the north Aegean coast as their sphere of influence , and Philip was at war with Athens from 356 – 346 BC . 
 Philip was not originally a belligerent in the Sacred War , but became involved at the request of the Thessalians . Seeing an opportunity to expand his influence into Greece proper , Philip obliged , and in 353 or 352 BC won a decisive victory over the Phocians at the Battle of Crocus Field in Thessaly . In the aftermath , Philip was made archon of Thessaly , which gave him control of the levies and revenues of the Thessalian Confederation , thereby greatly increasing his power . However , Philip did not intervene further in the Sacred War until 346 BC . Early in that year , the Thebans , who had borne the brunt of the Sacred War , together with the Thessalians , asked Philip to assume the " leadership of Greece " and join them in fighting the Phocians . Philip 's power was by now so great that ultimately the Phocians did not even attempt to resist , and instead surrendered to him ; Philip was thus able to end a particularly bloody war without any further fighting . Philip allowed the Amphictyonic council the formal responsibility of punishing the Phocians , but ensured that the terms were not overly harsh ; nevertheless , the Phocians were expelled from the Amphictyonic League , all their cities were destroyed , and they were resettled in villages of no more than fifty houses . 
 By 346 BC , the Athenians were war @-@ weary , unable to match Philip 's strength , and had begun to contemplate the necessity of making peace . Nevertheless , when it became apparent that Philip would march south that year , the Athenians originally planned to help the Phocians ( whom they were allied to ) keep Philip out of central Greece , by occupying the pass of Thermopylae , where Philip 's superior numbers would be of little benefit . The Athenians had successfully used this tactic to prevent Philip attacking Phocis itself after his victory at Crocus Field . The occupation of Thermopylae was not only for the benefit of Phocis ; excluding Philip from central Greece also prevented him from marching on Athens itself . However , by the end of February , the general <unk> was restored to power in Phocis , and he refused to allow the Athenians access to Thermopylae . Suddenly unable to guarantee their own security , the Athenians were forced instead into making peace with Philip ; the treaty that was agreed ( the Peace of Philocrates ) also made Athens reluctant allies of Macedon . 
 For the Athenians , the treaty had been expedient , but it was never popular . Philip 's actions in 346 BC had expanded his influence over all Greece , and although he had brought peace , he had come to be seen as the enemy of the traditional liberty of the city @-@ states . The orator and politician Demosthenes had been a principal architect of the Peace of Philocrates , but almost as soon as it was agreed , he wished to be rid of it . Over the next few years , Demosthenes became leader of the " war @-@ party " in Athens , and at every opportunity he sought to undermine the peace . From 343 BC onwards , in order to try to disrupt the peace , Demosthenes and his followers used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace . Conversely , there was at first a substantial body of feeling in Athens , led by Aeschines , that the peace , unpopular though it was , should be maintained and developed . Towards the end of the decade however , the " war party " gained the ascendancy , and began to openly goad Philip ; in 341 BC for instance , the Athenian general <unk> ravaged the territory of Philip 's ally Cardia , even though Philip demanded that they desist . Philip 's patience finally ran out when the Athenians formed an alliance with Byzantium , which Philip was at that time besieging , and he wrote the Athenians declaring war . Shortly afterward Philip broke off the siege of Byzantium ; Cawkwell suggests that Philip had decided to deal with Athens once and for all . Philip went on campaign against the Scythians , and then began to prepare for war in Greece . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Philip 's forthcoming campaign in Greece became linked with a new , fourth , Sacred War . The citizens of Amphissa in <unk> Locris had begun cultivating land sacred to Apollo on the <unk> Plain south of Delphi ; after some internal bickering the Amphictyonic council decided to declare a sacred war against Amphissa . A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip should be made leader of the Amphictyonic effort , which therefore gave Philip a pretext to campaign in Greece ; it is , however , probable that Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway . 
 At the start of 339 BC , the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae , which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC . Philip does not appear to have treated this as a declaration of war , but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem , blocking the main route into Greece . However , a second route into central Greece was available , leading over the shoulder of Mount <unk> and descending into Phocis . However , the Athenians and Thebans had either forgotten the existence of this road , or believed that Philip would not use it ; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered . Philip 's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians at the end of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC now bore fruit . Reaching Elatea , he ordered the city to be re @-@ populated , and during the next few months the whole Phocian Confederation was restored to its former state . This provided Philip with a base in Greece , and new , grateful allies in the Phocians . Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC , but the Battle of Chaeronea did not occur until August 338 BC . During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the <unk> council by settling the situation in Amphissa . He tricked a force of 10 @,@ 000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts , then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens , turning it over to Delphi . He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to avoid further conflict in Greece , although if so , he was unsuccessful . 
 When news first arrived that Philip was in Elatea , just three days march away , there was panic in Athens . In what Cawkwell describes as his proudest moment , Demosthenes alone counseled against despair , and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans ; his decree was passed , and he was sent as ambassador . Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes , requesting that the Thebans join him , or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered . Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip , they could have avoided the conflict altogether . However , in spite of Philip 's proximity , and their traditional enmity with Athens , they chose to ally with the Athenians , in the cause of liberty for Greece . The Athenian army had already pre @-@ emptively been sent in the direction of Boeotia , and was therefore able to join the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed . 
 The details of the campaign leading up to Chaeronea are almost completely unknown . Philip was presumably prevented from entering Boeotia by way of Mount Helicon , as the Spartans had done in the run @-@ up to the Battle of Leuctra ; or by any of the other mountain passes that led into Boeotia from Phocis . There were certainly some preliminary skirmishes ; Demosthenes alludes to a " winter battle " and " battle on the river " in his speeches , but no other details are preserved . Finally , in August 338 BC , Philip 's army marched straight down the main road from Phocis to Boeotia , to assault the main allied army defending the road at Chaeronea . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 According to Diodorus , the Macedonian army numbered roughly 30 @,@ 000 infantry and 2 @,@ 000 cavalry , a figure generally accepted by modern historians . Philip took command of the right wing of the Macedonian army and placed his 18 @-@ year @-@ old son Alexander ( the future conqueror of the Persian Empire ) in command of the left wing , accompanied by a group of Philip 's experienced generals . 
 The allied Greek army included contingents from Achaea , Corinth , Chalcis , Epidaurus , Megara and Troezen , with the majority of troops being supplied by Athens and Thebes . The Athenian contingent was led by the generals <unk> and Lysicles , and the Thebans by <unk> . No source provides exact numbers for the Greek army , although Justin suggests that the Greeks were " far superior in number of soldiers " ; the modern view is that the numbers of the city states that fought were approximately equal to those of the Macedonians . The Athenians took up positions on the left wing , the Thebans on the right , and the other allies in the centre . 
 = = Strategic and tactical considerations = = 
 The Greek army had taken up a position near Chaeronea , astride the main road . On the left flank , the Greek line lay across the foothills of Mount <unk> , blocking the side @-@ road that led to <unk> , while on the right , the line rested against the <unk> River , near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion . The Greek line , which was about 2 @.@ 5 miles in length , was thus secure on both flanks . Moreover , the Greek line seems to have slanted north @-@ eastwards across the plain in between , so that it did not face the direction of Macedonian advance full @-@ square . This prevented Philip from attempting to concentrate his force on the Greek right wing , since the advanced position of the Greek left wing would then threaten Philip 's right . Although Philip could attempt to concentrate his force against the Greek left , the troops there occupied high ground , and any attack would be difficult . Since the Greeks could remain on the defensive , having only to prevent Philip 's advance , their position was therefore strategically and tactically very strong . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Details of the battle itself are scarce , with Diodorus providing the only formal account . He says that " once joined , the battle was hotly contested for a long time and many fell on both sides , so that for a while the struggle permitted hopes of victory to both . " He then recounts that the young Alexander , " his heart set on showing his father his prowess " succeeded in rupturing the Greek line aided by his companions , and eventually put the Greek right wing to flight ; meanwhile , Philip advanced in person against the Greek left and also put it to flight . 
 This brief account can be filled out , if Polyaenus 's account of the battle is to be believed . Polyaenus collected many snippets of information on warfare in his <unk> ; some are known from other sources to be reliable , while others are demonstrably false . In the absence of other evidence , it is unclear whether his passage regarding Chaeronea is to be accepted or rejected . Polyaenus suggests that Philip engaged the Greek left , but then withdrew his troops ; the Athenians on the Greek left followed and , when Philip held the high ground , he stopped retreating and attacked the Athenians , eventually routing them . In another ' stratagem ' , Polyaenus suggests that Philip deliberately prolonged the battle , to take advantage of the rawness of the Athenian troops ( his own veterans being more used to fatigue ) and delayed his main attack until the Athenians were exhausted . This latter anecdote also appears in the earlier Stratagems of Frontinus . 
 Polyaenus 's accounts have led some modern historians to tentatively propose the following synthesis of the battle . After the general engagement had been in progress for some time , Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver , with the right wing withdrawing , and the whole line pivoting around its centre . At the same time , wheeling forward , the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the Greek right and punched a hole in the Greek line . On the Greek left , the Athenians followed Philip , their line becoming stretched and disordered ; the Macedonians then turned , attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians . The Greek right wing , under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander 's command , then also routed , ending the battle . 
 Many historians , including Hammond and Cawkwell , place Alexander in charge of the Companion Cavalry during the battle , perhaps because of Diodorus 's use of the word " companions " . However , there is no mention of cavalry in any ancient account of the battle , nor does there seem to have been space for it to operate against the flank of the Greek army . Plutarch says that Alexander was the " first to break the ranks of the Sacred Band of the Thebans " , the elite of the Theban infantry , who were stationed on the extreme right of the Greek battle line . However , he also says that the Sacred Band had " met the spears of [ the Macedonian ] phalanx face to face " . This , together with the improbability that a head @-@ on cavalry charge against the spear @-@ armed Thebans could have succeeded ( because horses will generally shy from such a barrier ) , has led <unk> and others to suggest that Alexander must have been commanding a portion of the Macedonian phalanx at Chaeronea . 
 Diodorus says that more than 1 @,@ 000 Athenians died in the battle , with another 2 @,@ 000 taken prisoner , and that the Thebans fared similarly . Plutarch suggests that all 300 of the Sacred Band were killed at the battle , having previously been seen as invincible . In the Roman period , the ' Lion of Chaeronea ' , an enigmatic monument on the site of the battle , was believed to mark the resting place of the Sacred Band . Modern excavations found the remains of 254 soldiers underneath the monument ; it is therefore generally accepted that this was indeed the grave of the Sacred Band , since it is unlikely that every member was killed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Cawkwell suggests that this was one of the most decisive battles in ancient history . Since there was now no army which could prevent Philip 's advance , the war effectively ended . In Athens and Corinth , records show desperate attempts to re @-@ build the city walls , as they prepared for siege . However , Philip had no intention of besieging any city , nor indeed of conquering Greece . He wanted the Greeks as his allies for his planned campaign against the Persians , and he wanted to leave a stable Greece in his rear when he went on campaign ; further fighting was therefore contrary to his aims . Philip marched first to Thebes , which surrendered to him ; he expelled the Theban leaders who had opposed him , recalled those pro @-@ Macedonian Thebans who had previously been exiled , and installed a Macedonian garrison . He also ordered that the Boeotian cities of Plataea and Thespiae , which Thebes had destroyed in previous conflicts , be re @-@ founded . Generally , Philip treated the Thebans severely , making them pay for the return of their prisoners , and even to bury their dead ; he did not , however , dissolve the Boeotian Confederacy . 
 By contrast , Philip treated Athens very leniently ; although the Second Athenian Confederacy was dissolved , the Athenians were allowed to keep their colony on Samos , and their prisoners were freed without ransom . Philip 's motives are not entirely clear , but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia , since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet ; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians . Philip also made peace with the other combatants ; Corinth and Chalcis , which controlled important strategic locations both received Macedonian garrisons . He then turned to deal with Sparta , which had not taken part in the conflict , but was likely to take advantage of the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese . The Spartans refused Philip 's invitation to engage in discussions , so Philip ravaged Lacedaemonia , but did not attack Sparta itself . 
 Philip seems to have moved around Greece in the months after the battle , making peace with the states that opposed him , dealing with the Spartans , and installing garrisons ; his movements also probably served as a demonstration of force to the other cities , that they should not try to oppose him . In mid 337 BC , he seems to have camped near Corinth , and began the work to establish a league of the Greek city @-@ states , which would guarantee peace in Greece , and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia . The result , the League of Corinth , was formed in the latter half of 337 BC at a congress organised by Philip . All states signed up to the league , with the exception of Sparta . The principal terms of the concord were that all members became allied to each other , and to Macedon , and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack , freedom of navigation , and freedom from interference in internal affairs . Philip , and the Macedonian garrisons installed in Greece , would act as the ' keepers of the peace ' . At Philip 's behest , the synod of the league then declared war on Persia , and voted Philip as Strategos for the forthcoming campaign . 
 An advance Macedonian force was sent to Persia in early 336 BC , with Philip due to follow later in the year . However , before he could depart , Philip was assassinated by one of his bodyguards . Alexander therefore became King of Macedon , and in a series of campaigns lasting from 334 to 323 BC , he conquered the whole Persian Empire . 
 = = Thematic appraisal = = 
 Philip 's feint withdrawal was the main tactic which stemmed all the subsequent planned manoeuvres . 
 It lured on the Athenian left wing to the front and left , which thereby extended and weakened the whole line . 
 This meant that a gap created somewhere along the line , probably between the center and the Theban Sacred Band on the right . 
 It was through this gap Alexander and the cavalry charged . He thus made the first break in the line . 
 Alexander had surrounded the Sacred Band , who refused to move and were thus annihilated . 
 Philip on the other hand counter @-@ attacked the Athenian left wing and routed it . 
 The rest of the Athenian line was next rolled up from both ends . 
 = Volubilis = 
 Volubilis ( Berber : <unk> , Arabic : <unk> ) is a partly excavated Berber and Roman city in Morocco situated near Meknes , between Fes and Rabat , and commonly considered as the ancient capital of the kingdom of Mauretania . Built in a fertile agricultural area , it developed from the 3rd century BC onward as an Amazigh , then proto @-@ Carthaginian , settlement before being the capital of the kingdom of Mauretania . It grew rapidly under Roman rule from the 1st century AD onward and expanded to cover about 42 hectares ( 100 acres ) with a 2 @.@ 6 km ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) circuit of walls . The city gained a number of major public buildings in the 2nd century , including a basilica , temple and triumphal arch . Its prosperity , which was derived principally from olive growing , prompted the construction of many fine town @-@ houses with large mosaic floors . 
 The city fell to local tribes around 285 and was never retaken by Rome because of its remoteness and <unk> on the south @-@ western border of the Roman Empire . It continued to be inhabited for at least another 700 years , first as a Latinised Christian community , then as an early Islamic settlement . In the late 8th century it became the seat of Idris ibn Abdallah , the founder of the <unk> dynasty and the state of Morocco . By the 11th century Volubilis had been abandoned after the seat of power was relocated to Fes . Much of the local population was transferred to the new town of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun , about 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from Volubilis . 
 The ruins remained substantially intact until they were devastated by an earthquake in the mid @-@ 18th century and subsequently looted by Moroccan rulers seeking stone for building Meknes . It was not until the latter part of the 19th century that the site was definitively identified as that of the ancient city of Volubilis . During and after the period of French rule over Morocco , about half of the site was excavated , revealing many fine mosaics , and some of the more prominent public buildings and high @-@ status houses were restored or reconstructed . Today it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site , listed for being " an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire " . 
 = = Foundation and Roman occupation = = 
 Built on a shallow slope below the Zerhoun mountain , Volubilis stands on a ridge above the Wadi Khoumane . It overlooks a rolling fertile plain north of the modern city of Meknes . The area around Volubilis has been inhabited at least since the Late Atlantic Neolithic , some 5 @,@ 000 years ago ; archaeological excavations at the site have found Neolithic pottery of design comparable to pieces found in Iberia . By the third century BC , the Phoenicians had a presence there , as evidenced by the remains of a temple to the Punic god Baal and finds of pottery and stones inscribed in the Phoenician language . The origins of its name are unknown but may be a Latinisation of the Berber word <unk> , meaning oleander , which grows along the sides of the wadi . 
 The city lay within the kingdom of Mauretania , which became a Roman client state following the fall of Carthage in 146 BC . The Punic influence lasted for a considerable time afterwards , as the city 's magistrates retained the Carthaginian title of <unk> long after the end of Punic rule . Juba II of Numidia was placed on the Mauretanian throne by Augustus in 25 BC and turned his attention to building a royal capital at Volubilis . Educated in Rome and married to Cleopatra Selene II , the daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra , Juba and his son Ptolemy were thoroughly Romanised kings , although of Berber ancestry ; their preference for Roman art and architecture was clearly reflected in the city 's design . 
 After Claudius annexed Mauretania in 44 AD , the city grew substantially due to its wealth and prosperity , derived from the fertile lands of the province which produced valuable export commodities such as grain , olive oil and wild animals for gladiatorial spectacles . At its peak in the late 2nd century , Volubilis had around 20 @,@ 000 inhabitants – a very substantial population for a Roman provincial town – and the surrounding region was also well inhabited , to judge from over 50 villas discovered in the area . It was mentioned by the 1st century AD geographer Pomponius Mela , who described it in his work De situ orbis libri III as one of " the wealthiest cities , albeit the wealthiest among small ones " in Mauretania . It is also mentioned by Pliny the Elder , and the 2nd century Antonine Itinerary refers to its location and names it as Volubilis Colonia . Its population was dominated by Romanised Berbers . 
 The city became the administrative centre of the Roman province of Mauretania Tingitana . It remained loyal to Rome despite a revolt in 40 – 44 AD led by one of Ptolemy 's freedmen , <unk> , and its inhabitants were rewarded with grants of citizenship and a ten @-@ year exemption from taxes . The city was raised to the status of a municipium and its system of governance was overhauled , with the Punic @-@ style <unk> replaced by annually elected <unk> , or pairs of magistrates . However , the city 's position was always tenuous ; it was located on the south @-@ eastern edge of the province , facing hostile and increasingly powerful Berber tribes . A ring of five forts located at the modern hamlets of Aïn <unk> , Bled el <unk> , Sidi Moussa , Sidi Said and Bled <unk> ( ancient <unk> ) were constructed to bolster the city 's defence . Sidi Said was the base for the Cohors IV Gallorum equitata , an auxiliary cavalry unit from Gaul , while Aïn <unk> housed Spanish and Belgic cohorts . Sidi Moussa was the location of a cohort of Parthians , and Gallic and Syrian cavalry were based at <unk> . Rising tensions in the region near the end of the 2nd century led the emperor Marcus Aurelius to order the construction of a 2 @.@ 5 km ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) circuit of walls with eight gates and 40 towers . Volubilis was connected by road to <unk> and Tingis ( modern Tangier ) but had no eastwards connections with the neighbouring province of Mauretania Caesariensis , as the territory of the Berber <unk> tribe lay in between . 
 Rome 's control over the city ended following the chaos of the Crisis of the Third Century , when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars , palace coups and assassinations . Around 280 , Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re @-@ <unk> 285 , the emperor Diocletian reorganised what was left of the province to retain only the coastal strip between <unk> , Tingis and Septa ( modern Ceuta ) . Although a Roman army was based in Tingis , it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region . Occupation of the city continued , however , as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century . The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century , which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses .

It was certainly reoccupied in the sixth and seventh century , when three Christian inscriptions are dated by the provincial year . By the time the Arabs had arrived in 708 , the city – its name was changed to <unk> or <unk> – and it was inhabited by the Awraba , a Berber tribe that originated in Libya . Much of the city centre had been abandoned and was turned into a cemetery , while the centre of habitation had moved to the southwest of the city , where a new wall was built to contain the abridged Roman town . 
 Volubilis remained the capital of the region well into the Islamic period . Islamic coins dating to the 8th century have been found on the site , attesting to the arrival of Islam in this part of Morocco . . They are concentrated outside the city walls , which suggests that Arab settlement remained distinct from the Berber settlement inside them . It was here that Moulay Idriss established the <unk> dynasty of Morocco in 787 @-@ 8 . A direct descendant of the Islamic prophet , Muhammad , he escaped to Morocco from Syria following the Battle of <unk> in 787 . He was proclaimed " imam " in Volubilis , occupied by the Awraba , under Ishaq ibn Mohammad . He married Kanza , from the Awraba , and fathered a son , Idris II , who was proclaimed imam in Volubilis . He , too , lived outside the walls of the city , along the banks of the Wadi Khoumane , where a complex has recently been excavated that may be identified with his headquarters . Idriss I conquered most of Northern Morocco during the three years of his reign , founding the city of Fes . He was assassinated in Volubilis in 791 on the orders of the caliph of Baghdad , Harun al @-@ Rashid . On his majority Idriss II removed to Fes which served as his new capital , depriving Volubilis of its last vestiges of political significance . 
 A Muslim group known as the <unk> , who had revolted in Córdoba in Al @-@ Andalus ( Andalusia in modern Spain ) , resettled at Volubilis in 818 . Although people continued to live in Volubilis for several more centuries , it was probably almost deserted by the 14th century . Leo Africanus describes its walls and gates , as well as the tomb of Idris , guarded only by two or three castles . His body was subsequently removed to Moulay Idriss Zerhoun , 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) , where a great mausoleum was built for it . The name of the city was forgotten and it was termed <unk> <unk> , or the " Pharaoh 's Castle " , by the local people , alluding to a legend that the ancient Egyptians had built it . Nonetheless some of its buildings remained standing , albeit ruined , until as late as the 17th century when Moulay Ismail ransacked the site to provide building material for his new imperial capital at Meknes . The 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused further severe destruction . However , fortunately for posterity , English antiquarian John Windus sketched the site in 1722 . In his 1725 book A Journey to <unk> , Windus described the scene : 
 One building seems to be part of a triumphal arch , there being several broken stones that bear inscriptions , lying in the rubbish underneath , which were fixed higher than any part now standing . It is 56 feet long and 15 thick , both sides exactly alike , built with very hard stones , about a yard in length and half a yard thick . The arch is 20 feet wide and about 26 high . The inscriptions are upon large flat stones , which , when entire , were about five feet long , and three broad , and the letters on them above 6 inches long . A bust lay a little way off , very much defaced , and was the only thing to be found that represented life , except the shape of a foot seen under the lower part of a garment , in the niche on the other side of the arch . About 100 yards from the arch stands a good part of the front of a large square building , which is 140 feet long and about 60 high ; part of the four corners are yet standing , but very little remains , except these of the front . Round the hill may be seen the foundation of a wall about two miles in circumference , which inclosed these buildings ; on the inside of which lie scattered , all over , a great many stones of the same size the arch is built with , but hardly one stone left upon another . The arch , which stood about half a mile from the other buildings , seemed to have been a gateway , and was just high enough to admit a man to pass through on horseback . 
 Visiting 95 years later in 1820 , after the Lisbon earthquake had flattened the few buildings left standing , James Gray Jackson wrote : 
 Half an hour 's journey after leaving the sanctuary of Muley <unk> <unk> , and at the foot of Atlas , I perceived to the left of the road , magnificent and massive ruins . The country , for miles round , is covered with broken columns of white marble . There were still standing two porticoes about 30 feet high and 12 wide , the top composed of one entire stone . I attempted to take a view of these immense ruins , which have furnished marble for the imperial palaces at <unk> and <unk> ; but I was obliged to desist , seeing some persons of the sanctuary following the cavalcade . Pots and kettles of gold and silver coins are continually dug up from these ruins . The country , however , abounds with serpents , and we saw many scorpions under the stones that my conductor turned up . These ruins are said by the Africans to have been built by one of the Pharaohs : they are called <unk> <unk> . 
 Walter Burton Harris , a writer for The Times , visited Volubilis during his travels in Morocco between 1887 – 89 , after the site had been identified by French archaeologists but before any serious excavations or restorations had begun . He wrote : 
 There is not very much remains standing of the ruins ; two archways , each of great size , and in moderately good preservation , alone tell of the grandeur of the old city , while acres and acres of land are strewn with monuments and broken sculpture . A few isolated pillars also remain , and an immense drain or aqueduct , not unlike the <unk> Maxima at Rome , opens on to the little river below . 
 = = Excavation , restoration and UNESCO listing = = 
 Much of Volubilis was excavated by the French during their rule over French Morocco between 1912 and 1956 , but the excavations at the site began decades earlier . From 1830 , when the French conquest of Algeria began the process of extending French rule over much of northern , western and central Africa , archaeology was closely associated with French colonialism . The French army undertook scientific explorations as early as the 1830s and by the 1850s it was fashionable for French army officers to investigate Roman remains during their leave and spare time . By the late 19th century French archaeologists were undertaking an intensive effort to uncover north @-@ west Africa 's pre @-@ Islamic past through excavations and restorations of archaeological sites . The French had a very different conception of historic preservation to that of the Moroccan Muslims . As the historian Gwendolyn Wright puts it , " the Islamic sense of history and architecture found the concept of setting off monuments entirely foreign " , which " gave the French proof of the conviction that only they could fully appreciate the Moroccan past and its beauty . " Emile <unk> of the Institut des Hautes Etudes <unk> criticised the Muslims for taking the view that " the passage of time is nothing " and charged them with " let [ ting ] their monuments fall into ruin with as much indifference as they once showed ardour in building them . " 
 The French programme of excavation at Volubilis and other sites in French @-@ controlled North Africa ( in Algeria and Tunisia ) had a strong ideological component . Archaeology at Roman sites was used as an instrument of colonialist policy , to make a connection between the ancient Roman past and the new " Latin " societies that the French were building in North Africa . The programme involved clearing modern structures built on ancient sites , excavating Roman towns and villas and reconstructing major civic structures such as triumphal arches . Ruined cities , such as <unk> in Algeria , were excavated and cleared on a massive scale . The remains were intended to serve , as one writer has put it , as " the witness to an impulse towards Romanization " . 
 This theme resonated with other visitors to the site . The American writer Edith Wharton visited in 1920 and highlighted what she saw as the contrast between " two <unk> look [ ing ] at each other across the valley " , the ruins of Volubilis and " the conical white town of Moulay Idriss , the Sacred City of Morocco " . She saw the dead city as representing " a system , an order , a social conception that still runs through all our modern ways . " In contrast , she saw the still very much alive town of Moulay Idriss as " more dead and sucked back into an unintelligible past than any broken architrave of Greece or Rome . " As Sarah Bird Wright of the University of Richmond puts it , Wharton saw Volubilis as a symbol of civilisation and Moulay Idriss as one of barbarism ; the subtext is that " in ransacking the Roman outpost , Islam destroyed its only chance to build a civilised society " . Fortunately for Morocco , " the political stability which France is helping them to acquire will at last give their higher qualities time for fruition " — very much the theme that the French colonial authorities wanted to get across . Hilaire Belloc , too , spoke of his impression being " rather one of history and of contrast . Here you see how completely the new religion of Islam flooded and drowned the classical and Christian tradition . " 
 The first excavations at Volubilis were carried out by the French archaeologist Henri de la <unk> between 1887 and 1892 . In 1915 Hubert Lyautey , the military governor of French Morocco , commissioned the French archaeologists Marcel and Jane <unk> to carry out excavations in Volubilis . Although Jane 's ill @-@ health meant that they were unable to carry out the programme of work that they drew up for Lyautey , the work went ahead anyway under Louis Chatelain . The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during the First World War and loaned to the excavators by Lyautey . The excavations continued on and off until 1941 , when the Second World War forced a halt . 
 Following the war , excavations resumed under the French and Moroccan authorities ( following Morocco 's independence in 1956 ) and a programme of restoration and reconstruction began . The Arch of Caracalla had already been restored in 1930 – 34 . It was followed by the Capitoline Temple in 1962 , the basilica in 1965 – 67 and the Tingis Gate in 1967 . A number of mosaics and houses underwent conservation and restoration in 1952 – 55 . In recent years , one of the oil production workshops in the southern end of the city has been restored and furnished with a replica Roman oil press . These restorations have not been without controversy ; a review carried out for UNESCO in 1997 reported that " some of the reconstructions , such as those on the triumphal arch , the <unk> , and the oil @-@ pressing workshop , are radical and at the limit of currently accepted practice . " 
 From 2000 excavations carried out by University College London and the Moroccan Institut National des Sciences de l <unk> et du Patrimoine under the direction of Elizabeth Fentress , Gaetano Palumbo and Hassan <unk> revealed what should probably be interpreted as the headquarters of Idris I just below the walls of the Roman town to the west of the ancient city centre . Excavations within the walls also revealed a section of the early medieval town . Today , many artefacts found at Volubilis can be seen on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum . 
 UNESCO listed Volubilis as a World Heritage Site in 1997 . In the 1980s , the International Council on Monuments and Sites ( ICOMOS ) organised three conferences to assess possible nominations to the World Heritage List for sites in North Africa . It was unanimously agreed that Volubilis was a good candidate for the list and in 1997 ICOMOS recommended that it be inscribed as " an exceptionally well preserved example of a large Roman colonial town on the fringes of the Empire " , which UNESCO accepted . 
 = = City layout and infrastructure = = 
 Prior to the Roman occupation , Volubilis covered an area of about 12 hectares ( 30 acres ) , built on a V @-@ shaped ridge between the <unk> and Khoumane wadis on a roughly north @-@ south axis . It was developed on a fairly regular pattern typical of Phoenician / Carthaginian settlements and was enclosed by a set of walls . Under the Romans , the city was expanded considerably on a northeast @-@ southwest axis , increasing in size to about 42 hectares ( 100 acres ) . Most of the city 's public buildings were constructed in the older part of the city . The grand houses for which Volubilis is famous are in the newer part , behind the Decumanus Maximus ( main street ) , which bisected the Roman @-@ era part of the city . The <unk> was paved , with <unk> on either side , and was lined with arcaded porticoes on either sides , behind which were dozens of shops . The Arch of Caracalla marks the point at which the old and new cities merge . After the aqueduct fell into disrepair with the end of the Roman occupation , a new residential area was constructed to the west near the Wadi Khoumane . 
 The city was supplied with water by an aqueduct that ran from a spring in the hills behind the city . The aqueduct may have been constructed around 60 – 80 AD and was subsequently reconstructed on several occasions . An elaborate network of channels fed houses and the public baths from the municipal supply and a series of drains carried sewage and waste away to the river to be flushed . The aqueduct ran under the Decumanus Secundus , a street that ran parallel with the Decumanus Maximus , and terminated at a large fountain in the city centre near the Arch of Caracalla . 
 Most of the original pre @-@ Roman city wall was built over or destroyed , but a 77 @-@ metre ( 250 ft ) stretch of the original wall , which was made of mud bricks on a stone foundation , can still be seen near the tumulus . The Roman city walls stretch for 2 @.@ 6 km ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) and average 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) thick . Built of rubble masonry and ashlar , they are mostly still extant . The full circuit of walls had 34 towers , spaced at intervals of about one every 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , and six main gates that were flanked by towers . A part of the eastern wall has been reconstructed to a height of 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) . The Tingis Gate , also reconstructed , marks the northern @-@ eastern entrance to Volubilis . It was constructed in 168 / 169 AD – the date is known due to the discovery of a coin of that year that was deliberately embedded in the gate 's stonework by its builders . 
 An early medieval wall stands to the west of the Arch of Caracalla ; it was built after the end of the Roman occupation , apparently some time in the 5th or 6th centuries , to protect the eastern side of the city 's new residential area . It was oriented in a north @-@ south direction and was constructed using stone looted from ruined buildings elsewhere in the abandoned areas of the city . 
 = = = Commerce = = = 
 During Roman times , Volubilis was a major producer of olive oil . The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible , as are the remains of the original presses and olive mills . One such building has been reconstructed with a full @-@ size replica of a Roman olive press . Olive oil was central to the life of the city , as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used for lamps , bathing and medicines , while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses . For this reason , even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses . Fifty @-@ eight oil @-@ pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis . They housed a standard set of elements : a mill , used to crush the olives , a <unk> basin to catch the oil from pressed olives , and a press that comprised a counterweight , a <unk> or cross @-@ bar and the wooden supports within which the <unk> was fixed . The olives were first crushed into a paste , then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing . The olive oil ran out into the <unk> basin , to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface . This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae . There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre . No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far , many of them bakeries , and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks . 
 = = Notable buildings = = 
 Although only about half of Volubilis has been excavated , a number of prominent public buildings are still visible and some , notably a basilica and a triumphal arch , have been reconstructed . Many private buildings , including the mansions of the city 's elite , have also been uncovered . They are especially notable for the fine mosaics that have been discovered in a number of buildings and which are still in situ in the houses where they were laid . The buildings were mostly made from locally quarried grey @-@ blue limestone . Very little remains of the original Punic settlement , as it lies under the later Roman buildings . 
 A large tumulus of uncertain origin and purpose stands approximately in the middle of the excavated area , between the old and new parts of the city . Various theories have been advanced to explain it , such as that it was a burial site , a religious structure of some kind , a funerary monument or a monument to a Roman victory . However , these remain unproven hypotheses . 
 = = = Public buildings = = = 
 Two major public buildings are readily visible at the centre of the city – the basilica and the Capitoline Temple . The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city . Completed during the reign of Macrinus in the early 3rd century , it is one of the finest Roman basilicas in Africa and is probably modelled on the one at Leptis Magna in Libya . The building is 42 @.@ 2 m ( 138 ft ) long by 22 @.@ 3 m ( 73 ft ) wide and originally had two storeys . Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat . The outer wall of the basilica , which is faced with columns , overlooks the forum where markets were held . Small temples and public offices also lined the 1 @,@ 300 m2 ( 14 @,@ 000 sq ft ) forum , which would have been full of statues of emperors and local dignitaries , of which only the pedestals now remain . Not much is known about the public buildings which existed in Volubilis prior to the start of the 3rd century , as the buildings currently visible were built on the foundations of earlier structures . 
 The Capitoline Temple stands behind the basilica within what would originally have been an arcaded courtyard . An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps leading up to the Corinthian @-@ columned temple , which had a single cella . The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state , Jupiter , Juno and Minerva . Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars . The layout of the temple , facing the back wall of the basilica , is somewhat unusual and it has been suggested that it may have been built on top of an existing shrine . An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218 . It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962 , reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps , the walls of the cella and the columns . There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct , one of which was dedicated to Venus . 
 There were five other temples in the city , of which the most notable is the so @-@ called " Temple of Saturn " that stood on the eastern side of Volubilis . It appears to have been built on top of , or converted from , an earlier Punic temple , which may have been dedicated to Baal . It is a sanctuary with a surrounding wall and a three @-@ sided portico . In its interior was a small temple with a cella built on a shallow podium . The temple 's traditional identification with Saturn is purely hypothetical and has not generally been accepted . 
 Volubilis also possessed at least three sets of public baths . Some mosaics can still be seen in the Baths of Gallienus , redecorated by that emperor in the 260s to become the city 's most lavish baths . The nearby north baths were the largest in the city , covering an area of about 1 @,@ 500 m2 ( 16 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . They were possibly built in the time of Hadrian . 
 = = = Triumphal arch = = = 
 The Arch of Caracalla is one of Volubilis ' most distinctive sights , situated at the end of the city 's main street , the Decumanus Maximus . Although it is not architecturally outstanding , the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate at the far end of the <unk> . It was built in 217 by the city 's governor , Marcus Aurelius <unk> , to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna . Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome 's provinces . However , by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper . 
 The arch is constructed from local stone and was originally topped by a bronze chariot pulled by six horses . Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins at the foot of the arch . Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts , though these have been defaced . The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930 – 34 . However , the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy . The inscription on the top of the arch was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722 , which had been scattered on the ground in front of the arch . 
 The inscription reads ( after the abbreviations have been expanded ) : 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> PIO <unk> <unk> <unk> MAXIMO <unk> MAXIMO <unk> MAXIMO

 or , in translation : 
 For the emperor Caesar , Marcus Aurelius Antoninus [ Caracalla ] , the pious , fortunate Augustus , greatest victor in Parthia , greatest victor in Britain , greatest victor in Germany , Pontifex Maximus , holding tribunician power for the twentieth time , Emperor for the fourth time , Consul for the fourth time , Father of the Country , <unk> , and for Julia Augusta [ Julia Domna ] , the pious , fortunate mother of the camp and the Senate and the country , because of his exceptional and new kindness towards all , which is greater than that of the principes that came before , the Republic of the <unk> took care to have this arch made from the ground up , including a chariot drawn by six horses and all the ornaments , with Marcus Aurelius <unk> , procurator , who is most deeply devoted to the divinity of Augustus , initiating and dedicating it . 
 = = = Houses and palaces = = = 
 The houses found at Volubilis range from richly decorated mansions to simple two @-@ room mud @-@ brick structures used by the city 's poorer inhabitants . The city 's considerable wealth is attested by the elaborate design of the houses of the wealthy , some of which have large mosaics still in situ . They have been named by archaeologists after their principal mosaics ( or other finds ) : 
 The House of Orpheus in the southern part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees , animals and birds . As Paul MacKendrick puts it , the mosaic is rather <unk> executed , as the animals are all of different sizes and face in different directions with no relationship to Orpheus . It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements . The mosaic is situated in the triclinium , the dining room , where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic . Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium , which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures , and in the bathing rooms . One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin , considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal . 
 The House of the Athlete or <unk> , located near the forum , contains a humorous mosaic of an athlete or acrobat riding a donkey back to front while holding a cup in his outstretched hand . It may possibly represent Silenus . The most prestigious houses in the city were situated adjoining the Decumanus Maximus , behind rows of shops that lined the street under an arcade . They were entered from side streets between the shops . 
 The House of the <unk> was named after a bronze statue found there . It has a prominent interior courtyard leading to a number of public rooms decorated with mosaics , including a depiction of Bacchus in a chariot being drawn by leopards . 
 The House of the Knight next door also has a mosaic of Bacchus , this time showing coming across the sleeping Ariadne , who later bore him six children . The house takes its name from a bronze statue of a rider found here in 1918 that is now on display in the archaeological museum in Rabat . It was a large building , with an area of about 1 @,@ 700 m2 ( 18 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , and incorporated a substantial area dedicated to commercial activities including eight or nine shops opening onto the road and a large olive @-@ pressing complex . 
 The House of the Labours of Hercules is named for the mosaic depicting the twelve tasks that the demigod had to perform as penance for killing his wife and children . It is thought to have been created during the reign of the emperor Commodus , who identified himself with Hercules . Jupiter , his lover Ganymede and the four seasons are depicted in another mosaic in the house . The house was of palatial size , with 41 rooms covering an area of 2 @,@ 000 m2 ( 22 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 A building dubbed the Gordian Palace is located further up the Decumanus Maximus . It was the largest building in the city and was probably the residence of the governor , rather than the emperor Gordian III ; it was rebuilt during Gordian 's reign in the mid @-@ 3rd century . It combined two separate houses to create a complex of 74 rooms with courtyards and private bathhouses serving both domestic and official functions . It also incorporated a colonnaded front with a dozen shops behind the colonnade , and an oil factory consisting of three oil presses and an oil store in the north @-@ east corner of the complex . The decoration of the Gordian Palace is today quite plain with only a few scanty mosaics remaining . Despite its presumed high status , the floors seem to have been mostly rendered with opus sectile rather than decorated with mosaics . Inscriptions found in the palace testify to the city 's decline and eventual fall . They record a series of treaties reached with the local Berber chieftains , increasing in number as the city became more vulnerable and the tribesmen pressed harder . By the time of the final treaty , just a few years before the fall of the city , the chieftains were being treated as virtual equals of Rome – an indication of how much Roman power in the area had declined . The last two inscribed altars , from 277 and 280 , refer to a <unk> et <unk> pax ( a " federated and lasting peace " ) , though this proved to be a forlorn hope , as Volubilis fell soon afterwards . 
 The House of Venus , towards the eastern side of the city under a prominent cypress tree , was one of the most luxurious residences in the city . It had a set of private baths and a richly decorated interior , with fine mosaics dating from the 2nd century AD showing animal and mythological scenes . There were mosaics in seven corridors and eight rooms . The central courtyard has a fanciful mosaic depicting racing chariots in a hippodrome , drawn by teams of peacocks , geese and ducks . The mosaic of Venus for which the house is named has been removed to Tangier , but in the next @-@ door room is a still @-@ extant mosaic showing Diana and a companion nymph being surprised by Actaeon while bathing . Actaeon is depicted with horns beginning to sprout from his head as he is transformed by the angry goddess into a stag , before being chased down and killed by his own hunting dogs . The house appears to have been destroyed some time after the city 's fall around 280 ; a mosaic depicting Cupids feeding birds with grain has been charred by what appears to have been a fire burning directly on top of it , perhaps resulting from the building being taken over by squatters who used the mosaic as the site of a hearth . 
 The same building was also the site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger . One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis , it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat . It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists . The bust has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato 's lifetime or shortly thereafter . Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator . Another outstanding bust , depicting a Hellenistic prince , was discovered in a bakery across the street . It seems to have been made at the same time as the Cato bust and may well have come from the House of Venus , where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that the Cato had a companion piece . The bust , which is also on display in Rabat , is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include Hiero II of Syracuse , Cleomenes III of Sparta , Juba I or Hannibal . 
 = = = Villa of Idris I = = = 
 Just outside the walls of the city , on the floodplain of the Oued Khoumane , was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings , of which the largest contained a hammam , or bath . This is an L @-@ shaped structure , with a cold room paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides . At the end is found a plunge pool with three steps leading into it . From the cold room one moved to a vestibule at the corner of the building , decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla . From there , one moved into the warm room , still covered by a vault , and finally into the hot room . The vault of this has now been restored , but it is possible to see the channels in the floor through which the hot air passed . Beyond this a furnace heated the room , as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners . The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large , and contained numerous large silos for grain storage . To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception , with long narrow rooms to the east and west , one of which was painted red , with a low bench or divan at one end . Further south a third courtyard , only partially excavated , seems to have been devoted to domestic use . The plan , with its large courtyards and narrow rooms , is very different from the contemporary one or two @-@ roomed structures inside the walls , probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe . It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I , and has been identified as his headquarters . 
 = Lobatus gigas = 
 Lobatus gigas , commonly known as the queen conch , is a species of large edible sea snail , a marine gastropod mollusc in the family of true conches , the Strombidae . This species is one of the largest molluscs native to the tropical northwestern Atlantic , from Bermuda to Brazil , reaching up to 35 @.@ 2 centimetres ( 13 @.@ 9 in ) in shell length . L. gigas is closely related to the goliath conch , Lobatus goliath , a species endemic to Brazil , as well as the rooster conch , Lobatus gallus . 
 The queen conch is herbivorous and lives in seagrass beds , although its exact habitat varies by development stage . The adult animal has a very large , solid and heavy shell , with knob @-@ like spines on the shoulder , a flared thick , outer lip and a characteristic pink @-@ coloured aperture ( opening ) . The flared lip is absent in younger specimens . The external anatomy of the soft parts of L. gigas is similar to that of other snails in its family ; it has a long snout , two eyestalks with well @-@ developed eyes , additional sensory tentacles , a strong foot and a corneous , sickle @-@ shaped operculum . 
 The shell and soft parts of living L. gigas serve as a home to several different kinds of commensal animals , including slipper snails , porcelain crabs and cardinalfish . Its parasites include <unk> . The queen conch is hunted and eaten by several species of large predatory sea snails , and also by starfish , crustaceans and vertebrates ( fish , sea turtles and humans ) . Its shell is sold as a souvenir and used as a decorative object . Historically , Native Americans and indigenous Caribbean peoples used parts of the shell to create various tools . 
 International trade in queen conch is regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) agreement , in which it is listed as Strombus gigas . This species is not endangered in the Caribbean as a whole , but is commercially threatened in numerous areas , largely due to extreme overfishing . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 = = = History = = = 
 The queen conch was originally described from a shell in 1758 by Swedish naturalist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus , who originated the system of binomial nomenclature . Linnaeus named the species Strombus gigas , which remained the accepted name for over 200 years . Linnaeus did not mention a specific locality for this species , giving only " America " as the type locality . The specific name is the ancient Greek word gigas ( <unk> ) , which means " giant " , referring to the large size of this snail compared with almost all other gastropod molluscs . Strombus <unk> , which was considered to be a synonym much later , was also described by Linnaeus in Systema Naturae . 
 In the first half of the 20th century , the type material for the species was thought to have been lost ; in other words , the shell on which Linnaeus based his original description and which would very likely have been in his own collection , was apparently missing , which created a problem for taxonomists . To remedy this , in 1941 a neotype of this species was designated by the American <unk> William J. Clench and R. Tucker Abbott . In this case , the neotype was not an actual shell or whole specimen , but a figure from a 1684 book <unk> mentis , et <unk> , published 23 years before Linnaeus was born by the Italian scholar Filippo <unk> . This was the first book that was solely about seashells . In 1953 the Swedish malacologist Nils Hjalmar <unk> searched the Linnaean Collection at Uppsala University and discovered the missing type shell , thereby invalidating Clench and Abbott 's neotype designation . 
 Strombidae 's taxonomy was extensively revised in the 2000s and a few subgenera , including Eustrombus , were elevated to genus level by some authors . <unk> and <unk> and Roberts recombined this species as Eustrombus gigas , and Landau and collaborators ( 2008 ) recombined it as Lobatus gigas . 
 = = = Phylogeny = = = 
 The phylogenetic relationships among the Strombidae were mainly formed by Simone ( 2005 ) and Latiolais ( 2006 ) , using two distinct methods . Simone proposed a cladogram ( a tree of descent ) based on an extensive morpho @-@ anatomical analysis of representatives of <unk> , Strombidae , <unk> and <unk> , which included L. gigas ( there referred to as Eustrombus gigas ) . 
 With the exception of Lambis and <unk> , the remaining taxa were previously allocated in the genus Strombus , including L. gigas . However , according to Simone , only Strombus gracilior , Strombus <unk> and Strombus <unk> , the type species , remained within Strombus , as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies ( traits that are shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor ) . The remaining taxa were previously considered subgenera and were elevated to genus level by Simone . Genus Eustrombus ( now considered a synonym of Lobatus ) , in this case , included Eustrombus gigas ( now considered a synonym of Lobatus gigas ) and Eustrombus goliath ( = Lobatus goliath ) , which were thus considered closely related . 
 In a different approach , Latiolais and colleagues ( 2006 ) proposed another cladogram that attempts to show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae . The authors analysed 31 Strombus species , including Lobatus gigas ( there referred to as Strombus gigas ) , and three species in the allied genus Lambis . The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome @-@ c oxidase I ( COI ) protein @-@ coding gene regions . In this proposed phylogeny , Strombus gigas and Strombus gallus ( = Lobatus gallus ) are closely related and appear to share a common ancestor .

 = = Anatomy = = 
 = = = Shell = = = 
 The mature shell is typically 15 – 31 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 – 12 @.@ 2 in ) in length , while the maximum reported size is 35 @.@ 2 centimetres ( 13 @.@ 9 in ) . The shell is very solid and heavy , with 9 to 11 whorls and a widely flaring and thickened outer lip . Although this notch is not as well developed as elsewhere in the family , the shell feature is nonetheless visible in an adult dextral ( normal right @-@ handed ) specimen , as a secondary anterior indentation in the lip , to the right of the siphonal canal ( viewed ventrally ) . The animal 's left eyestalk protrudes through this notch . 
 The spire is a protruding part of the shell that includes all of the whorls except the largest and final whorl ( known as the body whorl ) . It is usually more elongated than in other strombid snails , such as the closely related and larger goliath conch , Lobatus goliath that is endemic to Brazil . In L. gigas , the glossy finish or glaze around the aperture of the adult shell is primarily in pale shades of pink . It may show a cream , peach or yellow colouration , but it can also sometimes be tinged with a deep magenta , shading almost to red . The periostracum , a layer of protein ( conchiolin ) that is the outermost part of the shell surface , is thin and a pale brown or tan colour . 
 The overall shell morphology of L. gigas is not solely determined by the animal 's genes ; environmental conditions such as location , diet , temperature and depth , and biological interactions such as predation , can greatly affect it . Juvenile conches develop heavier shells when exposed to predators . <unk> also develop wider and thicker shells with fewer but longer spines in deeper water . 
 The shells of juvenile queen conches are strikingly different in appearance from those of the adults . Noticeable is the complete absence of a flared outer lip ; juvenile shells have a simple sharp lip , which gives the shell a conical or <unk> outline . In Florida , juvenile queen conches are known as " rollers " , because wave action very easily rolls their shells , whereas it is nearly impossible to roll an adult specimen , due to its shell 's weight and asymmetric profile . Subadult shells have a thin flared lip that continues to increase in thickness until death . 
 = = = = Historic illustrations = = = = 
 Index <unk> <unk> ( published in 1742 by the Italian physician and malacologist Niccolò Gualtieri ) contains three illustrations of adult shells from different perspectives . The knobbed spire and the flaring outer lip , with its somewhat wing @-@ like contour expanding out from the last whorl , is a striking feature of these images . The shells are shown as if balancing on the edge of the lip and / or the apex ; this was presumably done for artistic reasons as these shells cannot balance like this . 
 One of the most prized shell publications of the 19th century , a series of books titled Illustrations <unk> ou description et figures de <unk> les <unk> <unk> , <unk> et <unk> ( published by the French naturalist Jean @-@ Charles <unk> from 1842 to 1853 ) , contains illustrations of both adult and juvenile L. gigas shells and one <unk> drawing depicting some of the animal 's soft parts . Almost forty years later , a colored illustration from the Manual of <unk> ( published in 1885 by the American malacologist George Washington Tryon ) shows a dorsal view of a small juvenile shell with its typical brown and white patterning . 
 = = = Soft parts = = = 
 Many details about the anatomy of Lobatus gigas were not well known until Colin Little 's 1965 general study . In 2005 , R. L. Simone gave a detailed anatomical description . L. gigas has a long extensible snout with two eyestalks ( also known as ommatophores ) that originate from its base . The tip of each eyestalk contains a large , well @-@ developed lensed eye , with a black pupil and a yellow iris and a small slightly posterior sensory tentacle . <unk> eyes completely regenerate . Inside the mouth of the animal is a radula ( a tough ribbon covered in rows of microscopic teeth ) of the <unk> type . Both the snout and the eyestalks show dark spotting in the exposed areas . The mantle is darkly coloured in the anterior region , fading to light gray at the posterior end , while the mantle collar is commonly orange . The siphon is also orange or yellow . When the soft parts of the animal are removed from the shell , several organs are distinguishable externally , including the kidney , the <unk> gland , the pericardium , the genital glands , stomach , style sac and the digestive gland . In adult males , the penis is also visible . 
 = = = Foot / locomotion = = = 
 The species has a large and powerful foot with brown spots and markings towards the edge , but is white nearer to the visceral hump that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs . The base of the anterior end of the foot has a distinct groove , which contains the opening of the pedal gland . Attached to the posterior end of the foot for about one third of its length is the dark brown , corneous , sickle @-@ shaped operculum , which is reinforced by a distinct central rib . The base of the posterior two @-@ thirds of the animal 's foot is rounded ; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion . The columella , the central pillar within the shell , serves as the attachment point for the white <unk> muscle . Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal 's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli . 
 Lobatus gigas has an unusual means of locomotion , first described in 1922 by George Howard Parker ( 1864 – 1955 ) . The animal first fixes the posterior end of the foot by thrusting the point of the sickle @-@ shaped operculum into the substrate , then it extends the foot in a forward direction , lifting and throwing the shell forward in a so @-@ called leaping motion . This way of moving is considered to resemble that of pole vaulting , making L. gigas a good climber even of vertical concrete surfaces . This leaping locomotion may help prevent predators from following the snail 's chemical traces , which would otherwise leave a continuous trail on the substrate . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Lobatus gigas is gonochoristic , which means each individual snail is either distinctly male or distinctly female . Females are usually larger than males in natural populations , with both sexes existing in similar proportion . After internal fertilization , the females lay eggs in gelatinous strings , which can be as long as 75 feet ( 23 m ) . These are layered on patches of bare sand or seagrass . The sticky surface of these long egg strings allows them to coil and agglutinate , mixing with the surrounding sand to form compact egg masses , the shape of which is defined by the anterior portion of the outer lip of the female 's shell while they are layered . Each one of the egg masses may have been fertilized by multiple males . The number of eggs per egg mass varies greatly depending on environmental conditions such as food availability and temperature . Commonly , females produce 8 – 9 egg masses per season , each containing 180 @,@ 000 – 460 @,@ 000 eggs , but numbers can be as high as 750 @,@ 000 eggs . L. gigas females may spawn multiple times during the reproductive season , which lasts from March to October , with activity peaks occurring from July to September . 
 Queen conch embryos hatch 3 – 5 days after spawning . At the moment of hatching , the protoconch ( embryonic shell ) is translucent and has a creamy , off @-@ white background color with small , <unk> markings . This coloration is different from other Caribbean Lobatus , such as Lobatus <unk> and Lobatus costatus , which have unpigmented embryonic shells . Afterwards , the emerging two @-@ lobed veliger ( a larval form common to various marine and fresh @-@ water gastropod and bivalve mollusks ) spend several days developing in the plankton , feeding primarily on phytoplankton . Metamorphosis occurs some 16 – 40 days from the hatching , when the fully grown protoconch is about 1 @.@ 2 mm high . After the metamorphosis , L. gigas individuals spend the rest of their lives in the benthic zone ( on or in the sediment surface ) , usually remaining buried during their first year of life . The queen conch reaches sexual maturity at approximately 3 to 4 years of age , reaching a shell length of nearly 180 mm and weighing up to 5 pounds . Individuals may usually live up to 7 years , though in deeper waters their lifespan may reach 20 – 30 years and maximum lifetime estimates reach 40 years . It is believed that the mortality rate tends to be lower in matured conchs due to their thickened shell , but it could be substantially higher for juveniles . Estimates have demonstrated that its mortality rate decreases as its size increases and can also vary due to habitat , season and other factors . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 Lobatus gigas is native to the tropical Western Atlantic coasts of North and Central America in the greater Caribbean tropical zone . Although the species undoubtedly occurs in other places , this species has been recorded within the scientific literature as occurring , in : Aruba , ( Netherlands Antilles ) ; Barbados ; the Bahamas ; Belize ; Bermuda ; North and northeastern regions of Brazil ( though this is contested ) ; Old Providence Island in Colombia ; Costa Rica ; the Dominican Republic ; Panama ; Swan Islands in Honduras ; Jamaica ; Martinique ; <unk> Reef , Campeche , <unk> Arcas and Quintana Roo , in Mexico ; Puerto Rico ; Saint Barthélemy ; Mustique and Grenada in the Grenadines ; Pinar del Río , North Havana Province , North Matanzas , Villa Clara , Cienfuegos , Holguín , Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo , in the Turks and Caicos Islands and Cuba ; South Carolina , Florida , with the Florida Keys and Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary , in the United States ; Carabobo , Falcon , Gulf of Venezuela , Los Roques archipelago , Los <unk> Islands and Sucre in Venezuela ; St. Croix in the Virgin Islands . 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 Lobatus gigas lives at depths from 0 @.@ 3 – 18 m to 25 – 35 m . Its depth range is limited by the distribution of seagrass and algae cover . In heavily exploited areas , the queen conch is more abundant in the deepest range . The queen conch lives in seagrass meadows and on sandy substrate , usually in association with turtle grass ( species of the genus Thalassia , specifically Thalassia testudinum and also <unk> sp . ) and manatee grass ( <unk> sp . ) . Juveniles inhabit shallow , inshore seagrass meadows , while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass meadows . The critical nursery habitats for juvenile individuals are defined by a series of characteristics , including tidal circulation and <unk> production , which together enable high rates of recruitment and survival . L. gigas is typically found in distinct aggregates that may contain several thousand individuals . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 <unk> gastropods were widely accepted as carnivores by several authors in the 19th century , a concept that persisted until the first half of the 20th century . This erroneous idea originated in the writings of Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck , who classified <unk> with other supposedly carnivorous snails . This idea was subsequently repeated by other authors , but were not supported by observation . Subsequent studies have refuted the concept , proving beyond doubt that strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals . In common with other Strombidae , Lobatus gigas is a specialized herbivore , that feeds on macroalgae ( including red algae , such as species of <unk> and <unk> ) , seagrass and unicellular algae , intermittently also feeding on algal detritus . The green macroalgae <unk> oerstedii is one of its preferred foods . 
 = = = Interactions = = = 
 A few different animals establish commensal interactions with L. gigas , which means that both organisms maintain a relationship that benefits ( the commensal ) species but not the other ( in this case , the queen conch ) . Commensals of this species include certain mollusks , mainly slipper shells ( <unk> spp . ) The porcelain crab <unk> <unk> is also known to be a commensal and a small cardinalfish , known as the conch fish ( <unk> stellatus ) , sometimes shelters in the conch 's mantle for protection . L. gigas is very often parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa , which are common mollusk parasites . Those coccidian parasites , which are spore @-@ forming , single @-@ celled microorganisms , initially establish themselves in large <unk> cells of the host 's digestive gland , where they reproduce freely . The infestation may proceed to the secretory cells of the same organ . The entire life cycle of the parasite typically occurs within a single host and tissue . 
 L. gigas is a prey species for several carnivorous gastropod mollusks , including the apple murex <unk> <unk> , the horse conch <unk> gigantea , the lamp shell <unk> angulata , the moon snails <unk> spp. and <unk> spp . , the <unk> snail Murex <unk> , the trumpet triton <unk> variegata and the tulip snail <unk> <unk> . Crustaceans are also conch predators , such as the blue crab Callinectes sapidus , the box crab <unk> gallus , the giant hermit crab <unk> <unk> , the spiny lobster Panulirus argus and others . Sea stars , vertebrates , including fish ( such as the permit <unk> <unk> and the porcupine fish <unk> hystrix ) , loggerhead sea turtles ( Caretta caretta ) and humans also dine on the queen conch . 
 = = Human uses = = 
 Conch meat has been consumed for centuries and has traditionally been an important part of the diet in many islands in the West Indies and Southern Florida . It is consumed raw , marinated , minced or chopped in a wide variety of dishes , such as salads , chowder , fritters , soups , stew , pâtés and other local recipes . In Spanish @-@ speaking regions , for example in the Dominican Republic , Lobatus gigas meat is known as <unk> . Although conch meat is used mainly for human consumption , it is also sometimes employed as fishing bait ( usually the foot ) . L. gigas is among the most important fishery resources in the Caribbean : its harvest value was US $ 30 million in 1992 , increasing to $ 60 million in 2003 . The total annual harvest of meat of L. gigas ranged from 6 @,@ 519 @,@ 711 kg to 7 @,@ 369 @,@ 314 kg between 1993 and 1998 , later production declined to 3 @,@ 131 @,@ 599 kg in 2001 . Data about US imports shows a total of 1 @,@ 832 @,@ 000 kg in 1998 , as compared to 387 @,@ 000 kg in 2009 , a nearly 80 % reduction twelve years later . 
 Queen conch shells were used by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians in a wide variety of ways . South Florida bands ( such as the Tequesta ) , the Carib , the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells to fabricate tools ( such as knives , axe heads and chisels ) , jewelry , cookware and used them as blowing horns . In Mesoamerican history , Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double @-@ headed serpent . The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations , and used them in religious ceremonies . In central Mexico , during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc , the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors ( in a manner similar to boxing gloves ) during combat . Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre @-@ Columbian <unk> Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source . 
 Brought by explorers , queen conch shells quickly became a popular asset in early modern Europe . In the late 17th century they were widely used as decoration over fireplace mantels and English gardens , among other places . In contemporary times , queen conch shells are mainly utilized in handicraft . Shells are made into cameos , bracelets and lamps , and traditionally as <unk> or decorations by families of seafaring men . The shell continues to be popular as a decorative object , though its export is now regulated and restricted by the CITES agreement . In modern culture , queen conch shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps . 
 Very rarely ( about 1 in 10 @,@ 000 conchs ) , a conch pearl may be found within the mantle . Though they occur in a range of colors corresponding to the colors of the interior of the shell , pink specimens are the most valuable . These pearls are considered semi @-@ precious , and a popular tourist curio . The best specimens have been used to create necklaces and earrings . A conch pearl is a non @-@ nacreous pearl ( formerly referred to by some sources as a ' calcareous concretion ' ) which differs from most pearls that are sold as gemstones . 
 = = Status = = 
 = = = Threats = = = 
 Within the conch fisheries , one of the threats to sustainability stems from the fact that there is almost as much meat in large juveniles as there is in adults , but only adult conchs can reproduce , and thus sustain a population . In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing , larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate . On a number of islands , subadults provide the majority of the harvest . Lobatus gigas abundance is declining throughout its range as a result of overfishing and poaching . Trade from many Caribbean countries such as Antigua and Barbuda , Honduras , Haiti and the Dominican Republic is known or thought to be unsustainable . As of 2001 , queen conch populations in at least 15 Caribbean countries and states were overfished and / or overexploited . Illegal harvest , including fishing in foreign waters and subsequent illegal international trade , is a common problem in the region . The Caribbean " International Queen Conch Initiative " is an international attempt at managing this species . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 The queen conch fishery is usually managed under the regulations of individual nations . In the United States all taking of queen conch is prohibited in Florida and in adjacent Federal waters . No international regional fishery management organization exists for the whole Caribbean area , but in places such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands , queen conch is regulated under the auspices of the Caribbean Fishery Management Council ( <unk> ) . In 2014 , the Parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region ( Cartagena Convention ) included queen conch in Annex III of its Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife ( <unk> Protocol ) . Species included in the Annex III require special measures to be taken to ensure their protection and recovery , and their use is authorised and regulated accordingly . 
 This species has been mentioned in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) since 1985 . In 1992 the United States proposed queen conch for listing in CITES Appendix II , making queen conch the first large @-@ scale fisheries product to be regulated by CITES ( as Strombus gigas ) . In 1995 CITES began reviewing the biological and trade status of the queen conch under its " Significant Trade Review " process . These reviews are undertaken to address concerns about trade levels in an Appendix II species . Based on the 2003 review , CITES recommended that all countries prohibit importation from Honduras , Haiti and the Dominican Republic , according to Standing Committee Recommendations . Queen conch meat continues to be available from other Caribbean countries , including Jamaica and Turks and Caicos , which operate well @-@ managed queen conch fisheries . For conservation reasons , the Government of Colombia currently bans the commercialisation and consumption of the conch between the months of June and October .
