 Blake 's literary debt to Milton is key to understanding his illustrations of the earlier poet 's writings . In general , Milton : a Poem is a guide to Blake 's idea of Milton : that he possessed true spiritual vision , but fell by his adherence to the moralistic and repressive tenets of puritanism and by his preference for the cruel and distant Jehovah of the Old testament over the redemptive figure of Christ . In that regard the Nativity Ode is to Blake the rebirth of Milton 's poetry into the creative imagination of Christ . Blake also sees a return to prophetic , Christian ideals of poetry , rather than the " pagan " classical aesthetic represented in The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods by the figure of Apollo , who is modeled on the Apollo Belvedere . 
 Blake 's prophetic book Europe : a Prophecy was especially influenced by On the Morning of Christ 's Nativity . In that poem , the messianic Orc , a symbol of pure creative energy , rises against the repressive institutions of Church and state . Orc is part of a doomed <unk> his rebellion is inevitably countered by the increased institutional repression of Urizen . Europe in that light is seen as a pessimistic parody of Milton 's poem . Orc is often associated with fire , and the closest parallel with him is found in The Flight of Moloch , where a child is about to be given to the god of sacrifice . The similarity of the orifice that frames the child to the shape of the stable in the other illustrations underscores the purpose of Christ 's birth , and foreshadows the harrowing of hell . 
 The illustrations emphasize the simultaneous occurrence of the events they depict by the presence of the stable in almost every image , and by framing the set with two very similar images that focus on the peaceful victory of Christ over darkness . The Descent of Peace also has neo @-@ platonic <unk> it represents the descent of the soul into the body , which is symbolized by the cramped stable .

 = L 'Hermite 's expedition = 
 L 'Hermite 's expedition was a French naval operation launched in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars . The operation was intended as both a commerce raiding operation against the British trading posts of West Africa and as a diversion to the Trafalgar campaign . Sailing from Lorient in October 1805 with one ship of the line , two frigates and a corvette , Commodore Jean @-@ Marthe @-@ Adrien L 'Hermite was under orders to intercept and destroy British traders and slave ships off the West African coast and await reinforcements under Jérôme Bonaparte which were to be used in the invasion and capture of one of the British trading forts for use as a permanent French naval base from which further raiding operations could be conducted . It was also hoped by the French naval command that L 'Hermite might draw some of the large British fleet maintained off Cadiz away from the blockade to allow the French and Spanish allied fleet trapped in the harbour to escape . 
 Although L 'Hermite achieved minor successes against individual British shipping , his force was too small to have a serious impact on British trade in the region and the promised reinforcements failed to materialise in the aftermath of the destruction of the Cadiz fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 , ten days before L 'Hermite sailed although before news of the battle had reached Lorient . In early January 1806 , L 'Hermite managed to capture a small British naval brig but was still unable to make any significant impact on British trade operations . In the spring of 1806 L 'Hermite withdrew across the Atlantic , taking on supplies and effecting repairs in neutral Brazil . During the return journey to France in August 1806 , the squadron was caught in a major hurricane and one frigate was severely damaged , limping to a port in the United States for repairs . The rest of the squadron continued on to France , L 'Hermite reaching Brest in his flagship Régulus . The other frigate was intercepted by a British blockade squadron on 27 September 1806 and captured in the Bay of Biscay . 
 = = Background = = 
 By the summer of 1806 , the Napoleonic Wars were two years old and the first major campaign at sea , the Trafalgar campaign , was nearing its climax . A French fleet had departed Toulon in March 1805 under Vice @-@ Admiral Pierre @-@ Charles Villeneuve , gathered Spanish ships from the Spanish Mediterranean ports and then crossed the Atlantic , under orders to disrupt British trade in the region and seize British colonies . Closely pursuing the Allied fleet was an equivalent British Royal Navy force under Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Nelson , which reached the Caribbean on 11 June and found that Villeneuve had already begun the return journey to Europe . On 22 July 1805 the Allied fleet had fought the Battle of Cape Finisterre against a British force under Sir Robert Calder and been forced to divert south , seeking shelter in the Spanish fleet anchorage of Cadiz . Appearing off Cadiz a few days after Villeneuve 's arrival , Nelson began a blockade of the Allied fleet , awaiting their emergence and preparing for battle . 
 Although the French Atlantic Fleet , principally based at the major seaport of Brest , had played no significant part in the campaign , it was decided that in order to relieve some of the pressure on the fleet in Cadiz , minor squadrons would be sent to prey on British trade in the Atlantic , hopefully drawing off some of Nelson 's ships in pursuit . One such squadron was a force under Contre @-@ Admiral Zacharie Allemand , consisting of five ships of the line , two frigates and two corvettes , which sailed from Brest for operations in the North Atlantic on 12 July . A second squadron was placed under Commodore Jean @-@ Marthe @-@ Adrien L 'Hermite , with the ship of the line Régulus , frigates Président and Cybèle and corvette <unk> . L 'Hermite was ordered to sail to West Africa , raiding merchant vessels and slave ships that operated among the numerous British trading posts along the coastline . At an undetermined point in the cruise , L 'Hermite would be joined by a larger squadron under Captain Jérôme Bonaparte , Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte 's brother . The reinforced squadron would include over 1 @,@ 000 French soldiers who would be used in an attack on one of the British West African trading posts . If the post could be successfully captured , it could be turned into a naval base for use by French commerce raiders and would force the British to deploy a full squadron from the Channel Fleet in response , at a time when every ship of the line was needed for the Trafalgar campaign . 
 = = Expedition = = 
 L 'Hermite 's squadron sailed from Lorient on 31 October , avoiding contact with the British blockading squadron and heading for the West African coast . Although the news had not yet reached Brittany , Villeneuve 's fleet had already been destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar ten days earlier and L 'Hermite 's role as a diversion to the main campaign was no longer required . Cruising in the Gulf of Guinea during November and December , L 'Hermite succeeded in capturing and burning a number of small merchant vessels and slave ships . The intended reinforcements never appeared however — in the aftermath of Trafalgar Napoleon diverted resources to the Atlantic campaign of 1806 , a major raiding operation to the Caribbean and South Atlantic launched in December 1805 . Among the vessels detailed for this operation was Jérôme Bonaparte 's ship Vétéran , which cruised as part of the squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez . 
 Without reinforcements , L 'Hermite could not make any significant impact on British trade off West Africa or make any attempt to capture a British trading fort . On 6 January , he achieved a minor success when he seized the 18 @-@ gun British sloop HMS Favourite under Commander John Davie . The prize was fitted out as part of the squadron and <unk> was sent back to France with despatches . In the spring of 1806 , with supplies running low , L 'Hermite left the African coast and crossed the Atlantic , seeking fresh supplies in Brazil , a colony of neutral Portugal . After several months refitting and taking on stores , L 'Hermite crossed the Caribbean Sea in July 1806 , unknowingly passing though the same area that Willaumez was operating in but meeting only a handful of small merchant ships before passing into the Atlantic in early August . Favourite was left behind in the West Indies , and on 27 January 1807 was recaptured by the British frigate HMS Jason off Surinam . On 20 August , L 'Hermite was caught in a hurricane at 22 ° 26 ′ N 55 ° 00 ′ W , the same storm that had dispersed and badly damaged Willaumez 's squadron two days earlier . The damage was severe , with Cybèle suffering the most with the loss of her topmasts , rendering her slower than the rest of the squadron . Concerned by the frigate 's weakness , L 'Hermite ordered her to separate and sail for a harbour in the neutral United States , arriving at Hampton Roads on 1 September . Cybèle was later repaired and returned to France in 1807 , joining the squadron based at Rochefort . 
 = = Capture of Président = = 
 L 'Hermite 's three other ships all survived the hurricane relatively intact and were able to continue their journey to Europe unimpeded , the British squadrons in the area also dispersed by the summer storms . In late September the squadron broke up , Régulus sailing for Brest and arriving on 5 October , the only French ship of the line to enter or leave the port all year . Président was less successful : at 03 : 30 on 27 September , while sailing in the Bay of Biscay at 47 ° 17 ′ N 06 ° 52 ′ W , Captain Labrosse sighted six ships of the line . This overwhelming force was a squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Thomas Louis , which had been sent to the Bay of Biscay to await the return of Willaumez from the Caribbean . Immediately giving chase , Louis found that his ships of the line were not fast enough to catch the French frigate , which began to outdistance the main body of the squadron . However one of the small 18 @-@ gun sloops attached to the squadron , HMS Despatch under Captain Edward Hawkins was able to keep pace with the frigate , coming within firing range at 18 : 45 . 
 Although Hawkins only had two small guns that would bear on the frigate he kept up a steady rate of fire during the next hour , avoiding fire from the frigate 's bow guns during the chase . By 19 : 45 it was obvious that Despatch 's fire was successfully delaying the frigate and Labrosse turned towards the approaching squadron , moving as if to attack the nearest British frigate HMS Blanche under Sir Thomas Lavie . Seeing the French ship change direction , Louis ordered his flagship HMS Canopus to fire a gun at extreme range . This alerted Labrosse to the rapidly approaching squadron and he decided to surrender rather than be destroyed by the combined firepower of the British ships . No man had been hurt in the exchange of fire but Despatch had suffered severe damage to her rigging and one shot through her hull . The French ship had suffered minor damage in the engagement and was subsequently taken into the Royal Navy as HMS Presidente , renamed in 1815 to HMS <unk> . The frigate was much admired in the Royal Navy and a number of later frigates were built to a similar design .

 = Biblical Hebrew = 
 Biblical Hebrew ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 'it or <unk> <unk> <unk> ha @-@ <unk> ) , also called Classical Hebrew , is an archaic form of Hebrew , a Canaanite Semitic language spoken by the Israelites in the area known as Israel , roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea . The term " Hebrew " was not used for the language in the Bible , which referred to Canaanite or Judahite , but the name was used in Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts . Biblical Hebrew is attested from about the 10th century BCE , and persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period ( which ended in the siege of Jerusalem ( AD 70 ) ) . 
 Biblical Hebrew eventually developed into Mishnaic Hebrew , which was spoken until the second century CE . 
 Biblical Hebrew is best @-@ attested in the Hebrew Bible , the collection of Judaic religious and historical texts which reflect various stages of the Hebrew language in its consonantal skeleton , as well as a vocalic system which was added in the Middle Ages by the Masoretes . There is also some evidence of regional dialectal variation , including differences between Biblical Hebrew as spoken in the northern Kingdom of Israel and in the southern Kingdom of Judah . 
 Biblical Hebrew has been written with a number of different writing systems . The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the 12th century BCE , which developed into the Paleo @-@ Hebrew alphabet . This was retained by the Samaritans , who use the descendent Samaritan alphabet to this day . However , the Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo @-@ Hebrew alphabet for the Jews , and it became the source for the modern Hebrew alphabet . All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew , though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions / translations of the time . These scripts originally only indicated consonants , but certain letters , known by the Latin term matres lectionis , became increasingly used to mark vowels . In the Middle Ages , various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts ; of these , only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use . 
 Biblical Hebrew possessed a series of " emphatic " consonants whose precise articulation is disputed , likely ejective or pharyngealized . Earlier Biblical Hebrew possessed three consonants which did not have their own letters in the writing system , but over time they merged with other consonants . The stop consonants developed fricative allophones under the influence of Aramaic , and these sounds eventually became marginally phonemic . The pharyngeal and glottal consonants underwent weakening in some regional dialects , as reflected in the modern Samaritan Hebrew reading tradition . The vowel system of Biblical Hebrew changed dramatically over time and is reflected differently in the ancient Greek and Latin transcriptions , medieval vocalization systems , and modern reading traditions . 
 Biblical Hebrew had a typical Semitic morphology with <unk> morphology , arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words . Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders ( masculine , feminine ) , three numbers ( singular , plural , and uncommonly , dual ) . Verbs were marked for voice and mood , and had two conjugations which may have indicated aspect and / or tense ( a matter of debate ) . The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation ו , in the so @-@ called waw @-@ consecutive construction . Default word order was verb – subject – object , and verbs inflected for the number , gender , and person of their subject . Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs ( to indicate object ) or nouns ( to indicate possession ) , and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions . 
 = = Nomenclature = = 
 The earliest written sources refer to Biblical Hebrew by the name of the land in which it was spoken : <unk> <unk> ' the language of Canaan ' ( see Isaiah 19 : 18 ) . The Hebrew Bible also shows that the language was called <unk> ' Judaean , Judahite ' ( see , for example , 2 Kings 18 : 26 @,@ 28 ) . In the Hellenistic period Greek writings use the names <unk> , <unk> ( Josephus , Antiquities I , 1 : 2 , etc . ) , and in Mishnaic Hebrew we find <unk> ' Hebrew ' and <unk> <unk> ' Hebrew language ' ( Mishnah Gittin 9 : 8 , etc . ) . The origin of this term is obscure ; suggested origins include the biblical Eber , the ethnonyms <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> found in sources from Egypt and the near east , and a derivation from the root <unk> " to pass " alluding to crossing over the Jordan River . Jews also began referring to Hebrew as <unk> <unk> " the Holy Tongue " in Mishnaic Hebrew . 
 The term Classical Hebrew may include all pre @-@ medieval dialects of Hebrew , including Mishnaic Hebrew , or it may be limited to Hebrew contemporaneous with the Hebrew Bible . The term Biblical Hebrew refers to pre @-@ Mishnaic dialects ( sometimes excluding Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew ) . The term ' Biblical Hebrew ' may or may not include extra @-@ biblical texts , such as inscriptions ( e.g. the Siloam inscription ) , and generally also includes later vocalization traditions for the Hebrew Bible 's consonantal text , most commonly the early medieval Tiberian vocalization . 
 = = History = = 
 The archeological record for the prehistory of Biblical Hebrew is far more complete than the record of Biblical Hebrew itself . Early Northwest Semitic ( <unk> ) materials are attested from 2350 BCE to 1200 BCE , the end of the Bronze Age . The Northwest Semitic languages , including Hebrew , differentiated noticeably during the Iron Age ( 1200 – 540 BCE ) , although in its earliest stages Biblical Hebrew was not highly differentiated from Ugaritic and the Canaanite of the Amarna letters . 
 Hebrew developed during the latter half of the second millennium BCE between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea , an area known as Canaan . The Israelite tribes established a kingdom in Canaan at the beginning of the first millennium BCE , which later split into the kingdom of Israel in the north and the kingdom of Judah in the south after a dispute of succession . The earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered was found at Khirbet <unk> and dates to the 10th century BCE . 
 The kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 722 BCE . The kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BCE , its higher classes were exiled into the Babylonian captivity and Solomon 's Temple was destroyed . Later the Persians made Judah a province and permitted Jewish exiles to return and rebuild the Temple . According to the <unk> , Hebrew of this period was similar to Imperial Aramaic ; in <unk> , Tractate <unk> , Hanina bar Hama said that God sent the exiled Jews to Babylon because " [ the Babylonian ] language is akin to the <unk> <unk> " . 
 Aramaic became the common language in the north , in Galilee and Samaria . Hebrew remained in use in Judah ; however the returning exiles brought back Aramaic influence , and Aramaic was used for communicating with other ethnic groups during the Persian period . Alexander conquered Judah in 332 BCE , beginning the period of Hellenistic ( Greek ) domination . During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmonean dynasty , but later the Romans ended their independence , making Herod the Great their governor . One Jewish revolt against the Romans led to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE , and the second Bar Kokhba revolt in 132 – 135 led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea . 
 Biblical Hebrew after the Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew , which ceased being spoken and developed into a literary language around 200 CE . Hebrew continued to be used as a literary and liturgical language in the form of Medieval Hebrew , and Hebrew began a revival process in the 19th century , culminating in Modern Hebrew becoming the official language of Israel . Currently , Classical Hebrew is generally taught in public schools in Israel , and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in Modern Hebrew literature , much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature . Since Modern Hebrew contains many biblical elements , Biblical Hebrew is fairly intelligible to Modern Hebrew speakers . 
 The primary source of Biblical Hebrew material is the Hebrew <unk> epigraphic materials from the area of Israelite territory are written a form of Hebrew called Inscriptional Hebrew , although this is <unk> attested . According to <unk> & O 'Connor , Inscriptional Hebrew " is not strikingly different from the Hebrew preserved in the Masoretic text . " The damp climate of Israel caused the rapid deterioration of papyrus and parchment documents , in contrast to the dry environment of Egypt , and the survival of the Hebrew Bible may be attributed to scribal determination in preserving the text through copying . No manuscript of the Hebrew Bible dates to before 400 BCE , although two silver rolls ( the <unk> Hinnom scrolls ) from the seventh or sixth century BCE show a version of the Priestly Blessing . Vowel and cantillation marks were added to the older consonantal layer of the Bible between 600 CE and the beginning of the 10th century . The scholars who preserved the pronunciation of the Bibles were known as the Masoretes . The most well @-@ preserved system that was developed , and the only one still in religious use , is the Tiberian vocalization , but both Babylonian and Palestinian vocalizations are also attested . The Palestinian system was preserved mainly in piyyutim , which contain biblical quotations . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Biblical Hebrew is a Northwest Semitic language from the Canaanite subgroup . 
 As Biblical Hebrew evolved from the Proto @-@ Semitic language it underwent a number of consonantal mergers parallel with those in other Canaanite languages . There is no evidence that these mergers occurred after the adaptation of the Hebrew alphabet . 
 As a Northwest Semitic language , Hebrew shows the shift of initial * / w / to / j / , a similar independent pronoun system to the other Northwest Semitic languages ( with third person pronouns never containing / ʃ / ) , some archaic forms , such as / <unk> / ' we ' , first person singular pronominal suffix -i or <unk> , and / n / commonly preceding pronominal suffixes . Case endings are found in Northwest Semitic languages in the second millennium BCE , but disappear almost totally afterwards . <unk> is absent in singular nouns , but is often retained in the plural , as in Hebrew . 
 The Northwest Semitic languages formed a dialect continuum in the Iron Age ( 1200 – 540 BCE ) , with Phoenician and Aramaic on each extreme . Hebrew is classed with Phoenician in the Canaanite subgroup , which also includes Ammonite , Edomite , and Moabite . Moabite might be considered a Hebrew dialect , though it possessed distinctive Aramaic features . Although Ugaritic shows a large degree of affinity to Hebrew in poetic structure , vocabulary , and some grammar , it lacks some Canaanite features ( like the Canaanite shift and the shift * / ð / > / z / ) , and its similarities are more likely a result of either contact or preserved archaism . 
 Hebrew underwent the Canaanite shift , where Proto @-@ Semitic / aː / tended to shift to / oː / , perhaps when stressed . Hebrew also shares with the Canaanite languages the shifts * / ð / > / z / , * / <unk> / and * / <unk> / > / sʼ / , widespread reduction of diphthongs , and full assimilation of non @-@ final / n / to the following consonant if word final , i.e. <unk> / bat / from * <unk> . There is also evidence of an rule of assimilation of / y / to the following coronal consonant in pre @-@ tonic position , shared by Hebrew , Phoenician and <unk> . 
 Typical Canaanite words in Hebrew include : <unk> " roof " <unk> " table " <unk> " window " <unk> " old ( thing ) " <unk> " old ( person ) " and <unk> " expel " . Morphological Canaanite features in Hebrew include the masculine plural marker <unk> , first person singular pronoun <unk> , interrogative pronoun <unk> , definite article <unk> ( appearing in the first millennium BCE ) , and third person plural feminine verbal marker <unk> . 
 = = Eras = = 
 Biblical Hebrew as preserved in the Hebrew Bible is composed of multiple linguistic layers . The consonantal skeleton of the text is the most ancient , while the vocalization and cantillation are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language . These additions were added after 600 CE ; Hebrew had already ceased being used as a spoken language around 200 CE . Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the consonantal text of the Bible and in extra @-@ biblical inscriptions may be subdivided by era . 
 The oldest form of Biblical Hebrew , Archaic Hebrew , is found in poetic sections of the Bible and inscriptions dating to around 1000 BCE , the early <unk> Period . This stage is also known as Old Hebrew or Paleo @-@ Hebrew , and is the oldest stratum of Biblical Hebrew . The oldest known artifacts of Archaic Biblical Hebrew are various sections of the Tanakh , including the Song of Moses ( Exodus 15 ) and the Song of Deborah ( Judges 5 ) . Biblical poetry uses a number of distinct lexical items , for example <unk> for prose <unk> ' see ' , <unk> for <unk> ' great ' . Some have cognates in other Northwest Semitic languages , for example <unk> ' do ' and <unk> ' gold ' which are common in Canaanite and Ugaritic . Grammatical differences include the use of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> as relative particles , negative <unk> , and various differences in verbal and pronominal morphology and syntax . 
 Later pre @-@ <unk> Biblical Hebrew ( such as is found in prose sections of the Pentateuch , <unk> 'im , and some Ketuvim ) is known as ' Biblical Hebrew proper ' or ' Standard Biblical Hebrew ' . This is dated to the period from the 8th to the 6th century BCE . In contrast to Archaic Hebrew , Standard Biblical Hebrew is more consistent in using the definite article <unk> , the accusative marker את , distinguishing between simple and waw @-@ consecutive verb forms , and in using particles like <unk> and <unk> rather than <unk> . 
 Biblical Hebrew from after the Babylonian exile in 587 BCE is known as ' Late Biblical Hebrew ' . Late Biblical Hebrew shows Aramaic influence in phonology , morphology , and lexicon , and this trend is also evident in the later @-@ developed Tiberian vocalization system . 
 Qumran Hebrew , attested in the Dead Sea Scrolls from ca . 200 BCE to 70 CE , is a continuation of Late Biblical Hebrew . Qumran Hebrew may be considered an intermediate stage between Biblical Hebrew and Mishnaic Hebrew , though Qumran Hebrew shows its own idiosyncratic dialectal features . 
 = = Dialects = = 
 Dialect variation in Biblical Hebrew is attested to by the well @-@ known shibboleth incident of Judges 12 : 6 , where Jephthah 's forces from Gilead caught <unk> trying to cross the Jordan river by making them say <unk> ֤ לֶת ( ' ear of corn ' ) The <unk> ' identity was given away by their pronunciation : <unk> ֤ לֶת . The apparent conclusion is that the <unk> dialect had / s / for standard / ʃ / . As an alternative explanation , it has been suggested that the proto @-@ Semitic phoneme * / θ / , which shifted to / ʃ / in most dialects of Hebrew , may have been retained in the Hebrew of the trans @-@ Jordan . However , there is evidence that the word <unk> ֤ לֶת had initial consonant * / ʃ / in proto @-@ Semitic , contradicting this theory . 
 Hebrew as spoken in the northern Kingdom of Israel , known also as <unk> Hebrew , shows phonological , lexical , and grammatical differences from southern dialects . The Northern dialect spoken around Samaria shows more frequent simplification of / aj / into / eː / as attested by the Samaria ostraca ( 8th century BCE ) , e.g. <unk> ( 
 = / <unk> / < * / <unk> / ' wine ' ) , while the Southern ( Judean ) dialect instead adds in an epenthetic vowel / i / , added halfway through the first millennium BCE ( <unk> = 
 / <unk> / ) . The word play in Amos 8 : 1 – 2 <unk> <unk> ֫ <unk> ... <unk> <unk> may reflect this : given that Amos was addressing the population of the Northern Kingdom , the vocalization * <unk> would be more forceful . Other possible Northern features include use of <unk> ' who , that ' , forms like <unk> ' to know ' rather than <unk> and infinitives of certain verbs of the form <unk> ' to do ' rather than <unk> . The Samaria ostraca also show <unk> for standard <unk> ' year ' , as in Aramaic . 
 The guttural phonemes / ħ ʕ h ʔ / merged over time in some dialects . This was found in Dead Sea Scroll Hebrew , but Jerome attested to the existence of contemporaneous Hebrew speakers who still distinguished pharyngeals . Samaritan Hebrew also shows a general attrition of these phonemes , though / ʕ ħ / are occasionally preserved as [ ʕ ] . 
 = = Orthography = = 
 The earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered , found at Khirbet <unk> , dates to the 10th century BCE . The 15 cm x 16 @.@ 5 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in x 6 @.@ 5 in ) trapezoid pottery sherd ( ostracon ) has five lines of text written in ink written in the Proto @-@ Canaanite alphabet ( the old form of the Phoenician alphabet ) . The tablet is written from left to right , indicating that Hebrew writing was still in the formative stage . 
 The Israelite tribes who settled in the land of Israel adopted the Phoenician script around the 12th century BCE , as found in the Gezer calendar ( c . 10th century BCE ) . This script developed into the Paleo @-@ Hebrew script in the 10th or 9th centuries BCE . The Paleo @-@ Hebrew alphabet 's main differences from the Phoenician script were " a curving to the left of the downstrokes in the " long @-@ legged " letter @-@ signs ... the consistent use of a <unk> with a concave top , [ and an ] x @-@ shaped Taw . " The oldest inscriptions in Paleo @-@ Hebrew script are dated to around the middle of the 9th century BCE , the most famous being the Mesha Stele in the Moabite language ( which might be considered a dialect of Hebrew ) . The ancient Hebrew script was in continuous use until the early 6th century BCE , the end of the First Temple period . In the Second Temple Period the Paleo @-@ Hebrew script gradually fell into disuse , and was completely abandoned among the Jews after the failed Bar Kochba revolt . The Samaritans retained the ancient Hebrew alphabet , which evolved into the modern Samaritan alphabet . 
 By the end of the First Temple period the Aramaic script , a separate descendant of the Phoenician script , became widespread throughout the region , gradually displacing Paleo @-@ Hebrew . The oldest documents that have been found in the Aramaic Script are fragments of the scrolls of Exodus , Samuel , and Jeremiah found among the Dead Sea scrolls , dating from the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BCE . It seems that the earlier biblical books were originally written in the Paleo @-@ Hebrew script , while the later books were written directly in the later Assyrian script . Some Qumran texts written in the Assyrian script write the <unk> and some other divine names in Paleo @-@ Hebrew , and this practice is also found in several Jewish @-@ Greek biblical translations . While spoken Hebrew continued to evolve into Mishnaic Hebrew , the scribal tradition for writing the Torah gradually developed . A number of regional " book @-@ hand " styles developed for the purpose of Torah manuscripts and occasionally other literary works , distinct from the calligraphic styles used mainly for private purposes . The Mizrahi and Ashkenazi book @-@ hand styles were later adapted to printed fonts after the invention of the printing press . The modern Hebrew alphabet , also known as the Assyrian or Square script , is a descendant of the Aramaic alphabet . 
 The Phoenician script had dropped five characters by the 12th century BCE , reflecting the language 's twenty @-@ two consonantal phonemes . As a result , the 22 letters of the Paleo @-@ Hebrew alphabet numbered less than the consonant phonemes of ancient Biblical Hebrew ; in particular , the letters 〈 ח , ע , ש 〉 could each mark two different phonemes . After a sound shift the letters ח , ע could only mark one phoneme , but ( except in Samaritan Hebrew ) ש still marked two . The old Babylonian vocalization system wrote a superscript ס above the ש to indicate it took the value / s / , while the Masoretes added the shin dot to distinguish between the two varieties of the letter . 
 The original Hebrew alphabet consisted only of consonants , but gradually the letters א , <unk> , ו , י , also became used to indicate vowels , known as matres lectionis when used in this function . It is thought that this was a product of phonetic development : for instance , * bayt ( ' house ' ) shifted to בֵּית in construct state but retained its spelling . While no examples of early Hebrew orthography have been found , older Phoenician and Moabite texts show how First Temple period Hebrew would have been written . Phoenician inscriptions from the 10th century BCE do not indicate matres <unk> in the middle or the end of a word , for example <unk> and <unk> for later <unk> and <unk> , similarly to the Hebrew Gezer Calendar , which has for instance <unk> for <unk> and possibly <unk> for <unk> . <unk> lectionis were later added word @-@ finally , for instance the Mesha inscription has <unk> , <unk> for later <unk> , <unk> ; however at this stage they were not yet used word @-@ medially , compare Siloam inscription <unk> versus <unk> ( for later <unk> ) . The relative terms defective and full / <unk> are used to refer to alternative spellings of a word with less or more matres lectionis , respectively . 
 The Hebrew Bible was presumably originally written in a more defective orthography than found in any of the texts known today . Of the extant textual witnesses of the Hebrew Bible , the Masoretic text is generally the most conservative in its use of matres lectionis , with the Samaritan Pentateuch and its forebearers being more full and the Qumran tradition showing the most liberal use of vowel letters . The Masoretic text mostly uses vowel letters for long vowels , showing the tendency to mark all long vowels except for word @-@ internal / aː / . In the Qumran tradition , back vowels are usually represented by 〈 ו 〉 whether short or long . 〈 י 〉 is generally used for both long [ iː ] and [ eː ] ( <unk> , <unk> ) , and final [ iː ] is often written as <unk> in analogy to words like <unk> , <unk> , e.g. <unk> , sometimes <unk> . 〈 <unk> 〉 is found finally in forms like <unk> ( Tiberian <unk> ) , <unk> ( Tiberian <unk> ) while 〈 א 〉 may be used for an a @-@ quality vowel in final position ( e.g. <unk> ) and in medial position ( e.g. <unk> ) . Pre @-@ Samaritan and Samaritan texts show full spellings in many categories ( e.g. <unk> vs. Masoretic <unk> in Genesis 49 : 3 ) but only rarely show full spelling of the Qumran type . 
 In general the vowels of Biblical Hebrew were not indicated in the original text , but various sources attest them at various stages of development . Greek and Latin transcriptions of words from the biblical text provide early evidence of the nature of Biblical Hebrew vowels . In particular , there is evidence from the rendering of proper nouns in the Koine Greek Septuagint ( 3rd – 2nd centuries BCE ) and the Greek alphabet transcription of the Hebrew biblical text contained in the Secunda ( 3rd century CE , likely a copy of a preexisting text from before 100 BCE ) . In the 7th and 8th centuries CE various systems of vocalic notation were developed to indicate vowels in the biblical text . The most prominent , best preserved , and the only system still in use , is the Tiberian vocalization system , created by scholars known as Masoretes around 850 CE . There are also various extant manuscripts making use of less common vocalization systems ( Babylonian and Palestinian ) , known as <unk> vocalizations because their vocalization marks are placed above the letters . In addition , the Samaritan reading tradition is independent of these systems , and was occasionally notated with a separate vocalization system . These systems often record vowels at different stages of historical development ; for example , the name of the Judge Samson is recorded in Greek as <unk> <unk> with the first vowel as / a / , while Tiberian <unk> / <unk> / with / i / shows the effect of the law of attenuation whereby / a / in closed unstressed syllables became / i / . All of these systems together are used to reconstruct the original vocalization of Biblical Hebrew . 
 At an early stage , in documents written in the paleo @-@ Hebrew script , words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots , as reflected by the Mesha Stone , the Siloam inscription , the Ophel inscription , and paleo @-@ Hebrew script documents from Qumran . Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions ; however , there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division , as suggested by Nahmanides in his introduction to the Torah . Word division using spaces was commonly used from the beginning of the 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script . In addition to marking vowels , the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks , which serve to mark word stress , semantic structure , and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text . 
 While the Tiberian , Babylonian , and Palestinian reading traditions are extinct , various other systems of pronunciation have evolved over time , notably the Yemenite , Sephardi , Ashkenazi , and Samaritan traditions . Modern Hebrew pronunciation is also used by some to read biblical texts . The modern reading traditions do not stem solely from the Tiberian system ; for instance , the Sephardic tradition 's distinction between <unk> <unk> and <unk> is pre @-@ Tiberian . However , the only orthographic system used to mark vowels is the Tiberian vocalization . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 The phonology as reconstructed for Biblical Hebrew is as follows : 
 = = = Consonants = = = 
 Consonants lost and gained during the lifetime of Biblical Hebrew are color @-@ coded respectively . 
 The phonetic nature of some Biblical Hebrew consonants is disputed . The so @-@ called " <unk> " were likely ejective , but possibly pharyngealized or velarized . Some argue that / s , z , sʼ / were <unk> ( / ts , dz , tsʼ / ) . 
 Originally , the Hebrew letters 〈 ח 〉 and 〈 ע 〉 each represented two possible phonemes , uvular and pharyngeal , with the distinction unmarked in Hebrew orthography . However the uvular phonemes / χ / ח and / ʁ / ע merged with their pharyngeal ones / ħ / ח and / ʕ / ע respectively c . 200 BCE . 
 This is observed by noting that these phonemes are distinguished consistently in the Septuagint of the Pentateuch ( e.g. Isaac <unk> 
 = <unk> versus Rachel <unk> = 
 <unk> ) , but this becomes more sporadic in later books and is generally absent in Ezra and Nehemiah . 
 The phoneme / ɬ / , is also not directly indicated by Hebrew orthography but is clearly attested by later developments : It is written with 〈 ש 〉 ( also used for / ʃ / ) but later merged with / s / ( normally indicated with 〈 ס 〉 ) . As a result , three etymologically distinct phonemes can be distinguished through a combination of spelling and pronunciation : / s / written 〈 ס 〉 , / ʃ / written 〈 ש 〉 , and / <unk> / ( pronounced / s / but written 〈 ש 〉 ) . The specific pronunciation of / <unk> / as [ ɬ ] is based on comparative evidence ( / ɬ / is the corresponding Proto @-@ Semitic phoneme and still attested in Modern South Arabian dialects ) as well as early borrowings ( e.g. balsam < Greek <unk> < Hebrew <unk> ) . / ɬ / began merging with / s / in Late Biblical Hebrew , as indicated by interchange of orthographic 〈 ש 〉 and 〈 ס 〉 , possibly under the influence of Aramaic , and this became the rule in Mishnaic Hebrew . In all Jewish reading traditions / ɬ / and / s / have merged completely ; however in Samaritan Hebrew / ɬ / has instead merged with / ʃ / . 
 <unk> spirantization of / b ɡ d k p t / to [ v ɣ ð x f θ ] ( known as <unk> spirantization ) developed sometime during the lifetime of Biblical Hebrew under the influence of Aramaic . This probably happened after the original Old Aramaic phonemes / θ , ð / disappeared in the 7th century BCE , and most likely occurred after the loss of Hebrew / χ , ʁ / c . 200 BCE . It is known to have occurred in Hebrew by the 2nd century CE . After a certain point this alternation became contrastive in word @-@ medial and final position ( though bearing low functional load ) , but in word @-@ initial position they remained allophonic . This is evidenced both by the Tiberian vocalization 's consistent use of word @-@ initial <unk> after a vowel in sandhi , as well as Rabbi Saadia Gaon 's attestation to the use of this alternation in Tiberian Aramaic at the beginning of the 10th century CE . 
 The Dead Sea scrolls show evidence of confusion of the phonemes / ħ ʕ h ʔ / , e.g. <unk> <unk> for Masoretic <unk> / <unk> / ' he said ' . However the testimony of Jerome indicates that this was a regionalism and not universal . Confusion of gutturals was also attested in later Mishnaic Hebrew and Aramaic ( see <unk> <unk> ) . In Samaritan Hebrew , / ʔ ħ h ʕ / have generally all merged , either into / ʔ / , a glide / w / or / j / , or by vanishing completely ( often creating a long vowel ) , except that original / ʕ ħ / sometimes have reflex / ʕ / before / a ɒ / . 
 Geminate consonants are phonemically contrastive in Biblical Hebrew . In the Secunda / w j z / are never geminate . In the Tiberian tradition / ħ ʕ h ʔ r / cannot be geminate ; historically first / r ʔ / <unk> , followed by / ʕ / , / h / , and finally / ħ / , as evidenced by changes in the quality of the preceding vowel . 
 = = = Vowels = = = 
 The vowel system of Biblical Hebrew has changed considerably over time . The following vowels are those reconstructed for the earliest stage of Hebrew , those attested by the Secunda , those of the various vocalization traditions ( Tiberian and varieties of Babylonian and Palestinian ) , and those of the Samaritan tradition , with vowels absent in some traditions color @-@ coded . 
 = = = = Sound changes = = = = 
 The following sections present the vowel changes that Biblical Hebrew underwent , in approximate chronological order . 
 = = = = = Proto @-@ Central @-@ Semitic = = = = = 
 Proto @-@ Semitic is the ancestral language of all the Semitic languages , and in traditional reconstructions possessed 29 consonants ; 6 monophthong vowels , consisting of three qualities and two lengths , * / a aː i iː u uː / , in which the long vowels occurred only in open syllables ; and two diphthongs * / aj aw / . The stress system of Proto @-@ Semitic is unknown but it is commonly described as being much like the system of Classical Latin or the modern pronunciation of Classical Arabic : If the penultimate ( second last ) syllable is light ( has a short vowel followed by a single consonant ) , stress goes on the antepenultimate ( third last ) ; otherwise , it goes on the penultimate . 
 Various changes , mostly in morphology , took place between Proto @-@ Semitic and Proto @-@ Central @-@ Semitic , the language at the root of the Central Semitic languages . The phonemic system was inherited essentially unchanged , but the emphatic consonants may have changed their realization in Central Semitic from ejectives to pharyngealized consonants . 
 The morphology of Proto @-@ Central @-@ Semitic shows significant changes compared with Proto @-@ Semitic , especially in its verbs , and is much like in Classical Arabic . Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases : / -u / ( nominative ) , / -a / ( accusative ) or / -i / ( genitive ) . In some circumstances ( but never in the construct state ) , nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending : nunation ( final / -n / ) occurred in some languages , mimation ( final / -m / ) in others . The original meaning of this marker is uncertain . In Classical Arabic , final / -n / on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning . In other languages , final / -n / may be present whenever a noun is not in the construct state . Very Early Biblical Hebrew ( pre @-@ 1500 BCE ) had mimation , of uncertain meaning , in an occurrence of the word <unk> ( Jerusalem ) . 
 Broken plural forms in Arabic are declined like <unk> , and often take singular agreement as well . Dual and " strong plural " forms use endings with a long vowel or diphthong , declined in only two cases : nominative and objective ( combination accusative / genitive ) , with the objective form often becoming the default one after the loss of case endings . Both Hebrew and Arabic had a special form of nunation / mimation that co @-@ occurred with the dual and masculine sound plural endings whenever the noun was not in the construct state . The endings were evidently felt as an inherent part of the ending and , as a result , are still used . Examples are Arabic strong masculine plural <unk> ( nominative ) , <unk> ( objective ) , and dual endings <unk> ( nominative ) , <unk> ( objective ) ; corresponding construct @-@ state endings are <unk> , -ī ( strong masculine plural ) , <unk> , <unk> ( dual ) . ( The strong feminine endings in Classical Arabic are <unk> nominative , <unk> objective , marked with a singular @-@ style -n nunation in the indefinite state only . ) 
 Hebrew has almost lost the broken plural ( if it ever had it ) , and any vestigial forms that may remain have been extended with the strong plural endings . The dual and strong plural endings were likely much like the Arabic forms given above at one point , with only the objective @-@ case forms ultimately surviving . Dor example , dual <unk> is probably from * <unk> with an extended mimation ending ( cf . Arabic <unk> above ) , while dual construct <unk> is from * <unk> without mimation . Similarly , <unk> < * <unk> , <unk> < * <unk> . ( Note that expected plural construct state * -ī was replaced by dual <unk> . ) 
 Feminine nouns at this point ended in a suffix / <unk> / or / <unk> / and took normal case endings . ( When the ending / <unk> / became final because of loss or non @-@ presence of the case ending , both Hebrew and Arabic show a later shift to / <unk> / and then / <unk> / . ) 
 = = = = = Canaanite shift = = = = = 
 Hebrew shows the Canaanite shift whereby * / aː / often shifted to / oː / ; the conditions of this shift are disputed . This shift had occurred by the 14th century BCE , as demonstrated by its presence in the Amarna letters ( c . 1365 BCE ) . 
 = = = = = Proto @-@ Hebrew = = = = = 
 As a result of the Canaanite shift , the Proto @-@ Hebrew vowel system is reconstructed as * / a aː oː i iː u uː / ( and possibly rare * / eː / ) . Furthermore , stress at this point appears to have shifted so that it was consistently on the penultimate ( next to last ) syllable , and was still non @-@ phonemic . The predominant final stress of Biblical Hebrew was a result of loss of final unstressed vowels and a shift away from remaining open syllables ( see below ) . 
 = = = = = Loss of final unstressed vowels = = = = = 
 Final unstressed short vowels dropped out in most words , making it possible for long vowels to occur in closed syllables . This appears to have proceeded in two steps : 
 Final short mood , etc. markers dropped in verbal forms . 
 Final short case markers dropped in nominal forms . 
 Vowel lengthening in stressed , open syllables occurred between the two steps , with the result that short vowels at the beginning of a <unk> ending lengthened in nouns but not verbs . This is most noticeable with short / a / : e.g. * <unk> ( ' he wrote ' ) > / <unk> / but * <unk> ( ' word ' acc . ' ) > / <unk> / . 
 The dropping of final short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions , but also some gender distinctions ; however , unexpected vowel lengthening occurred in many situations to preserve the distinctions . For example , in the suffix conjugation , first @-@ singular * -tu appears to have been remade into * -tī already by Proto @-@ Hebrew on the basis of possessive -ī ( likewise first singular personal pronoun * <unk> became * <unk> ) . 
 Similarly , in the second @-@ singular , inherited * <unk> <unk> competed with lengthened * -tā -tī for masculine and feminine forms . The expected result would be -t or -tā for masculine , -t or -tī for feminine , and in fact both variants of both forms are found in the Bible ( with -h marking the long <unk> and -y marking the long -ī ) . The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries , with -t and -tā / tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech ( cf. the Secunda ( Hexapla ) of Origen , which records both pronunciations , although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us ) . Ultimately , writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders , while speech choose feminine -t but masculine <unk> . This is the reason for the unexpected <unk> vowel written under the final letter of such words . 
 The exact same process affected possessive * <unk> ( ' your ' <unk> sing . ) and * <unk> ( ' your ' <unk> sing . ) , and personal pronouns * <unk> , * <unk> , with the same split into shorter and longer forms and the same ultimate resolution . 
 = = = = = Short vowel lengthening ( esp. pretonic ) , lowering = = = = = 
 The short vowels * / a i u / tended to lengthen in various positions . 
 First , short vowels lengthened in an open syllable in pretonic position ( i.e. directly before the stressed syllable ) . 
 Later , short vowels lengthened in stressed open syllables . 
 In the process of lengthening , the high vowels were lowered . In the Secunda , the lengthened reflexes of / a i u / are / aː eː oː / ; when kept short they generally have reflexes / a e o / . 
 = = = = = Reduction of short open stressed syllables = = = = = 
 Stressed open syllables with a short vowel ( i.e. syllables consisting of a short vowel followed by a consonant and another vowel ) had the vowel reduced to / <unk> / and the stressed moved one syllable later in the word ( usually to the last syllable of the word ) . Stress was originally penultimate and loss of final short vowels made many words have final stress . However , words whose final syllable had a long vowel or ended with a consonant were unaffected and still had penultimate stress at this point . This change did not happen in <unk> position , where the penultimate stress is preserved , and vowel lengthening rather than reduction occurs . 
 The previous three changes occurred in a complex , interlocking fashion : 
 Shift of stress to be universally penultimate . 
 Loss of final short vowels in verbs , pre @-@ stress lengthening in open syllables . Pre @-@ stress lengthening / lowering becomes a surface filter that remains as a rule in the language , automatically affected any new short vowels in open syllables as they appear ( but ultra @-@ short vowels are unaffected ) . 
 Stress movement from light syllable to following heavy syllable when not in <unk> , with newly unstressed light syllable reducing the schwa . 
 Tonic lengthening / lowering in open syllables . 
 Loss of final short vowels in nouns . 
 Examples : 
 Note that many , perhaps most , Hebrew words with a schwa directly before a final stress are due to this stress shift . 
 This sound change shifted many more originally penultimate @-@ stressed words to have final stress . The above changes can be seen to divide words into a number of main classes based on stress and syllable properties : 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with an open penult and short @-@ vowel ending : Become final @-@ stressed ( e.g. / <unk> / ( ' he killed ' ) < PHeb . / <unk> / ) . 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with an closed penult and short @-@ vowel ending : Become penultimate due to <unk> rule ( e.g. / <unk> / ( ' king ' ) < * / <unk> / ) . 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with an open short penult and longer ending : Become final @-@ stressed due to <unk> shift ( e.g. / <unk> / ( ' they killed ' ) < PHeb . / <unk> / ) . 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with a closed penult and longer ending : Remain penultimate ( e.g. / <unk> / ( ' I killed ' ) < PHeb . / <unk> / ) . 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with an open long penult and longer ending : ? ? ? 
 = = = = = Pre @-@ stress reduction of short vowel = = = = = 
 * / a i u / were reduced to / ə / in the second syllable before the stress , and occasionally reduced rather than lengthened in pretonic position , especially when initial ( e.g. <unk> = <unk> / <unk> / ' his name ' ) . Thus the vowel system of the Secunda was / a e eː iː o oː uː ə / . 
 = = = = = Later developments = = = = = 
 The later Jewish traditions ( Tiberian , Babylonian , Palestinian ) show similar vowel developments . By the Tiberian time , all short vowels in stressed syllables and open pretonic lengthened , making vowel length allophonic . Vowels in open or stressed syllables had allophonic length ( e.g. / a / in <unk> / <unk> / [ <unk> ] ( ' he will have mercy ' ) < previously short [ <unk> ] < [ <unk> ] by Tiberian <unk> of / ħ / < <unk> * / <unk> / ) . The Babylonian and Palestinian vocalizations systems also do not mark vowel length . In the Tiberian and Babylonian systems , * / aː / and lengthened * / a / become the back vowel / ɔ / . In unaccented closed syllables , * / i u / become / ɛ ~ i ɔ ~ u / ( Tiberian ) , / a ~ i u / ( Babylonian ) , or / e ~ i o ~ u / ( Palestinian ) – generally becoming the second vowel before <unk> ( e.g. <unk> ) and the first otherwise . In the Tiberian tradition pretonic vowels are reduced more commonly than in the Secunda . It does not occur for / * a / , but is occasional for / * i / ( e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ' nails ' < * / <unk> / ) , and is common for / * u / ( e.g. <unk> / <unk> ' open place ' < * / <unk> / ) . In Tiberian Hebrew pretonic / * u / is most commonly preserved by <unk> the following consonant , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' red ' pl . ) ( cf . / <unk> / ' red ' sg . ) ; this pretonic gemination is also found in some forms with other vowels like <unk> ~ <unk> / <unk> / ~ / <unk> / ( ' prisoner ' ) . 
 The Babylonian and Palestinian systems have only one reduced vowel phoneme / ə / like the Secunda , though in Palestinian Hebrew it developed the pronunciation [ ɛ ] . However the Tiberian tradition possesses three reduced vowels / ă ɔ ̆ ɛ ̆ / of which / ɛ ̆ / has questionable <unk> . / ă / under a non @-@ guttural letter was pronounced as an <unk> copy of the following vowel before a guttural , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ̆ <unk> ] , and as [ <unk> ] preceding / j / , e.g. <unk> ֫ <unk> [ <unk> ] , but was always pronounced as [ ă ] under gutturals , e.g. <unk> , <unk> . When reduced , etymological * / a i u / become / ă ɛ ̆ ~ ă ɔ ̆ / under gutturals ( e.g. <unk> ' you [ mp . ] said ' cf . <unk> ' he said ' ) , and generally / ă / under non @-@ gutturals , but * / u / > / ɔ ̆ / ( and rarely * / i / > / ɛ ̆ / ) may still occur , especially after stops ( or their spirantized counterparts ) and / sʼ ʃ / ( e.g. <unk> / <unk> ̆ <unk> / ) . Samaritan and Qumran Hebrew have full vowels in place of the reduced vowels of Tiberian Hebrew . 
 Samaritan Hebrew also does not reflect etymological vowel length ; however the elision of guttural consonants has created new phonemic vowel length , e.g. / <unk> / <unk> ( ' great ' ) vs. / <unk> / <unk> ( ' wide ' ) . Samaritan Hebrew vowels are allophonically lengthened ( to a lesser degree ) in open syllables , e.g. <unk> [ <unk> ] , <unk> [ <unk> ] , though this is less strong in post @-@ tonic vowels . <unk> gemination is also found in Samaritan Hebrew , but not always in the same locations as in Tiberian Hebrew , e.g. <unk> TH / <unk> / SH / <unk> / ; <unk> TH / <unk> / SH / <unk> / . While Proto @-@ Hebrew long vowels usually retain their vowel quality in the later traditions of Hebrew , in Samaritan Hebrew * / iː / may have reflex / e / in closed stressed syllables , e.g. <unk> / den / , * / aː / may become either / a / or / ɒ / , and * / oː / > / u / . The reduced vowels of the other traditions appear as full vowels , though there may be evidence that Samaritan Hebrew once had similar vowel reduction . Samaritan / ə / results from the neutralization of the distinction between / i / and / e / in closed post @-@ tonic syllables , e.g. / bit / בית ( ' house ' ) / <unk> / <unk> ( ' the house ' ) / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> . 
 Various more specific conditioned shifts of vowel quality have also occurred . Diphthongs were frequently <unk> , but the scope and results of this shift varied among dialects . In particular , the Samaria ostraca show / <unk> / < * / <unk> / < * / <unk> / for Southern / <unk> / ( ' wine ' ) , and Samaritan Hebrew shows instead the shift * / aj / > / iː / . Original * / u / tended to shift to / i / ( e.g. <unk> and <unk> ' word ' ; <unk> ' outside ' and <unk> ' outer ' ) beginning in the second half of the second millennium BC . This was carried through completely in Samaritan Hebrew but met more resistance in other traditions such as the Babylonian and Qumran traditions . Philippi 's law is the process by which original * / i / in closed stressed syllables shifts to / a / ( e , g , / * bint / > <unk> / bat / ' daughter ' ) , or sometimes in the Tiberian tradition / ɛ / ( e.g. / * <unk> / > <unk> / ɛ ̆ <unk> / ' truth ' ) . This is absent in the transcriptions of the Secunda , but there is evidence that the law 's onset predates the Secunda . In the Samaritan tradition Philippi 's law is applied consistently , e.g. * / <unk> @-@ u / > / lab / ( ' heart ' ) . In some traditions the short vowel / * a / tended to shift to / i / in unstressed closed syllables : this is known as the law of attenuation . It is common in the Tiberian tradition , e.g. * / <unk> / > Tiberian <unk> / <unk> / ( ' seven ' ) , but exceptions are frequent . It is less common in the Babylonian vocalization , e.g. / <unk> / ( ' seven ' ) , and differences in Greek and Latin transcriptions demonstrate that it began quite late . <unk> generally did not occur before / i ~ e / , e.g. Tiberian <unk> / <unk> / ( ' key ' ) versus <unk> / <unk> / ( ' opening [ construct ] ' ) , and often was blocked before a geminate , e.g. <unk> ( ' gift ' ) . <unk> is rarely present in Samaritan Hebrew , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / . In the Tiberian tradition / e i o u / take offglide / a / before / h ħ ʕ / . This is absent in the Secunda and in Samaritan Hebrew but present in the transcriptions of Jerome . In the Tiberian tradition an <unk> echo vowel is sometimes added to clusters where the first element is a guttural , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / ( ' he will listen ' ) <unk> / <unk> ̆ lo / ( ' his work ' ) but <unk> / <unk> / ( ' he will make glorious ' ) <unk> / <unk> / ' its breadth ' . 
 The following charts summarize the most common reflexes of the Proto @-@ Semitic vowels in the various stages of Hebrew : 
 = = = Stress = = = 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew generally had penultimate stress . The ultimate stress of later traditions of Hebrew usually resulted from the loss of final vowels in many words , preserving the location of proto @-@ Semitic stress . Tiberian Hebrew has phonemic stress , e.g. <unk> ֫ / <unk> / ( ' they built ' ) vs. <unk> ֫ נוּ / <unk> / ( ' in us ' ) ; stress is most commonly ultimate , less commonly penultimate , and <unk> stress exists marginally , e.g. <unk> ֫ <unk> / <unk> ̆ <unk> / ( ' into the tent ' ) . There does not seem to be evidence for stress in the Secunda varying from that of the Tiberian tradition . Despite sharing the loss of final vowels with Tiberian Hebrew , Samaritan Hebrew has generally not preserved Proto @-@ Semitic stress , and has predominantly penultimate stress , with occasional ultimate stress . There is evidence that Qumran Hebrew had a similar stress pattern to Samaritan Hebrew . 
 = = Grammar = = 
 Medieval grammarians of Arabic and Hebrew classified words as belonging to three parts of speech : Arabic ism ( ' noun ' ) , <unk> ( ' verb ' ) , and <unk> ( ' particle ' ) ; other grammarians have included more categories . In particular , adjectives and nouns show more affinity to each other than in most European languages . Biblical Hebrew has a typical Semitic morphology , characterized by the use of roots . Most words in Biblical Hebrew are formed from a root , a sequence of consonants with a general associated meaning . Roots are usually triconsonantal , with <unk> roots less common ( depending on how some words are analyzed ) and rare cases of <unk> and <unk> roots . Roots are modified by affixation to form words . Verbal patterns are more productive and consistent , while noun patterns are less predictable . 
 = = = Nouns and adjectives = = = 
 The most common nominal prefix used is / m / , used for <unk> of location ( <unk> ' assembly ' ) , instruments ( <unk> ' key ' ) , and abstractions ( <unk> ' judgement ' ) . The vowel after / m / is normally / a / , but appears sometimes as / i / , or in the case of <unk> as / o / ( contracted from * / aw / ) . The prefix / t / is used to denote the action of the verb it is derived from , more common for <unk> / w / verbs , e.g. <unk> ( ' thanksgiving ' ; < <unk> ) . Prefixed / ʔ / is used in adjectives , e.g. <unk> ( ' deceptive ' ) , and also occurs in nouns with initial sibilants , e.g. <unk> ( ' finger ' ) . In the latter case this prefix was added for phonetic reasons , and the א prefix is called either " <unk> " or " prosthetic " . Prefixed ע often occurs in <unk> animal names , perhaps as a prefix , e.g. <unk> ( ' bat ' ) , <unk> ( ' mouse ' ) , <unk> ( ' scorpion ' ) . 
 In proto @-@ Semitic nouns were marked for case : in the singular the markers were * / -u / in the nominative , * / -a / in the accusative ( used also for adverbials ) , and * / -i / in the genitive , as evidenced in Akkadian , Ugaritic , and Arabic . The Amarna letters show that this was probably still present in Hebrew c . 1350 BCE . In the development of Hebrew , final * / -u , -i / were dropped first , and later * / -a / was elided as well . <unk> , a nominal suffix * / -m / of unclear meaning , was found in early Canaanite , as shown by early Egyptian transcriptions ( c . 1800 BCE ) of Jerusalem as <unk> , but there is no indication of its presence after 1800 BCE . Final * / -a / is preserved in <unk> ֫ <unk> / <unk> / , originally meaning ' at night ' but in prose replacing <unk> ֫ <unk> / <unk> / ( ' night ' ) , and in the " connective vowels " of some prepositions ( originally adverbials ) , e.g. <unk> ֫ נוּ ( ' with us ' ) ; nouns preserve * / -i / in forms like <unk> ֫ נוּ . Construct state nouns lost case vowels at an early period ( similar to Akkadian ) , as shown by the reflexes of * / <unk> / ( <unk> in absolute but <unk> in construct ) and the reflexes of * / <unk> / ( <unk> and <unk> ) However forms like <unk> ֫ נוּ show that this was not yet a feature of Proto @-@ Hebrew . 
 Biblical Hebrew has two genders , masculine and feminine , which are reflected in nouns , adjectives , pronouns , and verbs . Hebrew distinguishes between singular and plural numbers , and plural forms may also be used for collectives and honorifics . Hebrew has a morphological dual form for nouns that naturally occur in pairs , and for units of measurement and time this contrasts with the plural ( <unk> ' day ' <unk> ' two days ' <unk> ' days ' ) . A widespread misconception is that Hebrew plural denotes three or more objects . In truth , Hebrew plural denotes two or more objects . However adjectives , pronouns , and verbs do not have dual forms , and most nominal dual forms can function as plurals ( <unk> <unk> ' six wings ' from Isaiah 6 : 2 ) . Finite verbs are marked for subject person , number , and gender . Nouns also have a construct form which is used in genitive constructions . 
 Nouns are marked as definite with the prefix / <unk> / followed by gemination of the initial consonant of the noun . In Tiberian Hebrew the vowel of the article may become / ɛ / or / ɔ / in certain phonetic environments , for example <unk> / <unk> / ( ' the wise man ' ) , <unk> / <unk> / ( ' the man ' ) . 
 The traditions differ on the form of <unk> nouns , nouns stemming from roots with two final consonants . The <unk> / ɛ / of the Tiberian tradition in <unk> appears in the Septuagint ( 3rd century BCE ) but not the Hexapla ( 2nd century CE ) , e.g. <unk> / <unk> / 
 = <unk> versus <unk> / <unk> / = 
 <unk> ( Psalms 49 : 14 ) . This may reflect dialectal variation or phonetic versus phonemic transcriptions . Both the Palestinian and Babylonian traditions have an <unk> vowel in <unk> , / e / in the Palestinian tradition ( e.g. / <unk> / ' <unk> 
 = Tiberian <unk> Deuteronomy 26 : 15 ) and / a / in Babylonian ( e.g. / <unk> / ' item ' = 
 Tiberian <unk> Jeremiah 22 : 28 ) . The Qumran tradition sometimes shows some type of back epenthetic vowel when the first vowel is back , e.g. 〈 <unk> 〉 for Tiberian 〈 <unk> 〉 / <unk> / ( ' tent ' ) . 
 Biblical Hebrew has two sets of personal pronouns : the free @-@ standing independent pronouns have a nominative function , while the pronominal suffixes are genitive or accusative . Only the first person suffix has different possessive and objective forms ( <unk> and <unk> ) . 
 = = = Verbs = = = 
 Verbal consonantal roots are placed into verbal conjugations patterns , known as <unk> binyanim in Hebrew ; the binyanim mainly serve to indicate grammatical voice . This includes various distinctions of reflexivity , passivity , and <unk> . Verbs of all binyanim have three non @-@ finite forms ( one participle , two infinitives ) , three modal forms ( <unk> , imperative , <unk> ) , and two major conjugations ( prefixing , suffixing ) . The meaning of the prefixing and suffixing conjugations are also affected by the conjugation ו , and their meaning with respect to tense and aspect is a matter of debate . 
 = = = Word order = = = 
 The default word order in Biblical Hebrew is commonly thought to be VSO , though one scholar has argued that this is due to the prevalence of clauses with a <unk> verb form compared to other less marked forms that use SVO either more often or at least to a comparable degree . Attributive adjectives normally follow the noun they modify . In Biblical Hebrew , possession is normally expressed with status <unk> , a construction in which the possessed noun occurs in a phonologically reduced , " construct " form and is followed by the possessor noun in its normal , " absolute " form . Pronominal direct objects are either suffixed to the verb or alternatively expressed on the object @-@ marking pronoun את .

Together they had two children : Ayesha Tanzler ( 1922 – 1998 ) , and Crystal Tanzler ( 1924 – 1934 ) , who died of diphtheria . 
 Tanzler grew up in Germany . The following “ Editorial Note “ accompanying the autobiographical account “ The Trial Bay Organ : A Product of Wit and Ingenuity ” by “ Carl von Cosel , “ in the Rosicrucian Digest of March and April 1939 , gives details about his stay in Australia before and during World War I and his return to Germany after the war : 
 Many years ago , Carl von Cosel travelled from India to Australia with the intention of proceeding to the South Seas Islands . He paused in Australia to collect equipment and suitable boats , and to become acquainted with prevailing weather and sea conditions . However , he became interested in engineering and electrical work there , bought property , boats , an organ , an island in the Pacific — so that he was still in Australia at the end of ten years . He had just begun to build a trans @-@ ocean flyer when the war broke out and the British military authorities placed him in a concentration camp for ' safe @-@ keeping ' along with many officers India and China who were prisoners of war . Later he was removed to Trial Bay to a castle @-@ like prison on the cliffs , and there the work in this narrative was accomplished . At the end of the war no prisoner was permitted to return to his former residence , but all were shipped to the prisoner 's exchange in Holland . When Carl von Cosel was released he set out to find his mother from whom he had not heard since the beginning of the war . Finding her safe , he remained with her for three years , witnessing the chaos that followed in the wake of the war . ... Finally , she suggested that her son return to his sister in the United States ... 
 Tanzler 's account of Trial Bay Gaol , his secret building of a sailing boat , etc . , is confirmed by <unk> Thera , who mentions that he planned to escape from the Gaol with ” Count Carl von Cosel ” in a sailing boat , and provides other information about the interment of Germans in Australia during WWI . 
 Tanzler emigrated to the United States in 1926 , sailing from Rotterdam on February 6 , 1926 to Havana , Cuba . From Cuba he settled in Zephyrhills , Florida , to where his sister had already emigrated , and was later joined by his wife and two daughters . Leaving his family behind in Zephyrhills in 1927 , he took a job as a radiologic technologist at the U.S. Marine Hospital in Key West , Florida under the name Carl von Cosel . 
 During his childhood in Germany , and later while traveling briefly in Genoa , Italy , Tanzler claimed to have been visited by visions of a dead ancestor , Countess Anna Constantia von Cosel , who revealed the face of his true love , an exotic dark @-@ haired woman , to him . 
 = = Maria Elena Milagro de Hoyos = = 
 On April 22 , 1930 , while working at the Marine Hospital in Key West , Tanzler met Maria Elena " Helen " Milagro de Hoyos ( 1909 – 1931 ) , a local Cuban @-@ American woman who had been brought to the hospital by her mother for an examination . Tanzler immediately recognized her as the beautiful dark @-@ haired woman that had been revealed to him in his earlier " visions . " By all accounts , Hoyos was viewed as a local beauty in Key West . 
 Elena was the daughter of local cigar maker Francisco " Pancho " Hoyos ( 1883 – 1934 ) and Aurora Milagro ( 1881 – 1940 ) . She had two sisters , Florinda " Nana " Milagro Hoyos ( 1906 – 1944 ) , who married Mario Medina ( <unk> – 1944 ) and also succumbed to tuberculosis ; and Celia Milagro Hoyos ( 1913 – ? ) . Medina , Nana 's husband , was electrocuted trying to rescue a coworker who hit a powerline with his crane at a construction site . 
 On February 18 , 1926 , Hoyos married Luis Mesa ( 1908 – ? ) , the son of Caridad and Isaac Mesa . Luis left Hoyos shortly after Hoyos miscarried the couple 's child , and moved to Miami . Hoyos was legally married to Mesa at the time of her death . 
 Hoyos was eventually diagnosed with tuberculosis , a typically fatal disease at the time , that eventually claimed the lives of almost all of her entire immediate family . Tanzler , with his self @-@ professed medical knowledge , attempted to treat and cure Hoyos with a variety of medicines , as well as x @-@ ray and electrical equipment , that were brought to the <unk> ' home . Tanzler showered Hoyos with gifts of jewelry and clothing , and allegedly professed his love to her , but no evidence has surfaced to show that any of his affection was reciprocated by Hoyos . 
 = = Morbid obsession = = 
 Despite Tanzler 's best efforts , Hoyos died of terminal tuberculosis at her parents ' home in Key West on October 25 , 1931 . Tanzler paid for her funeral , and with the permission of her family he then commissioned the construction of an above ground mausoleum in the Key West Cemetery , which he visited almost every night . 
 One evening in April , 1933 , Tanzler crept through the cemetery where Hoyos was buried and removed her body from the mausoleum , carting it through the cemetery after dark on a toy wagon , and transporting it to his home . He reportedly said that Elena 's spirit would come to him when he would sit by her grave and serenade her corpse with a favorite Spanish song . He also said that she would often tell him to take her from the grave . Tanzler attached the corpse 's bones together with wire and coat hangers , and fitted the face with glass eyes . As the skin of the corpse decomposed , Tanzler replaced it with silk cloth soaked in wax and plaster of paris . As the hair fell out of the decomposing scalp , Tanzler fashioned a wig from Hoyos 's hair that had been collected by her mother and given to Tanzler not long after her burial in 1931 . Tanzler filled the corpse 's abdominal and chest cavity with rags to keep the original form , dressed Hoyos 's remains in stockings , jewelry , and gloves , and kept the body in his bed . Tanzler also used copious amounts of perfume , disinfectants , and preserving agents , to mask the odor and forestall the effects of the corpse 's decomposition . 
 In October , 1940 , Elena 's sister Florinda heard rumors of Tanzler sleeping with the disinterred body of her sister , and confronted Tanzler at his home , where Hoyos 's body was eventually discovered . Florinda notified the authorities , and Tanzler was arrested and detained . Tanzler was psychiatrically examined , and found mentally competent to stand trial on the charge of " wantonly and maliciously destroying a grave and removing a body without authorization . " After a preliminary hearing on October 9 , 1940 at the Monroe County Courthouse in Key West , Tanzler was held to answer on the charge , but the case was eventually dropped and he was released , as the statute of limitations for the crime had expired . 
 Shortly after the corpse 's discovery by authorities , Hoyos 's body was examined by physicians and pathologists , and put on public display at the Dean @-@ Lopez Funeral Home , where it was viewed by as many as 6 @,@ 800 people . Hoyos 's body was eventually returned to the Key West Cemetery where the remains were buried in an unmarked grave , in a secret location , to prevent further tampering . 
 The facts underlying the case and the preliminary hearing drew much interest from the media at the time ( most notably , from the Key West Citizen and Miami Herald ) , and created a sensation among the public , both regionally and nationwide . The public mood was generally sympathetic to Tanzler , whom many viewed as an eccentric " romantic " . 
 Though not reported contemporaneously , research ( most notably by authors Harrison and <unk> ) has revealed evidence of Tanzler 's necrophilia with Hoyos 's corpse . Two physicians ( Dr. <unk> and Dr. Foraker ) who attended the 1940 autopsy of Hoyos 's remains recalled in 1972 that a paper tube had been inserted in the vaginal area of the corpse that allowed for intercourse . Others contend that since no evidence of necrophilia was presented at the 1940 preliminary hearing , and because the physicians ' " proof " surfaced in 1972 , over 30 years after the case had been dismissed , the necrophilia allegation is questionable . While no existing contemporary photographs of the autopsy or photographs taken at the public display show a tube , the necrophilia claim was repeated by the HBO Autopsy program in 2005 . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 In 1944 , Tanzler moved to Pasco County , Florida close to Zephyrhills , Florida , where he wrote an autobiography that appeared in the Pulp publication , Fantastic Adventures , in 1947 . His home was near his wife Doris , who apparently helped to support Tanzler in his later years . Tanzler received United States citizenship in 1950 in Tampa . 
 Separated from his obsession , Tanzler used a death mask to create a life @-@ sized effigy of Hoyos , and lived with it until his death on July 3 , 1952 . His body was discovered on the floor of his home three weeks after his death . He died under the name " Carl Tanzler " . 
 It has been recounted that Tanzler was found in the arms of the Hoyos effigy upon discovery of his corpse , but his obituary reported that he died on the floor behind one of his organs . The obituary recounted : " a metal cylinder on a shelf above a table in it wrapped in silken cloth and a robe was a waxen image " . 
 It has been written ( most notably by <unk> ) that Tanzler had the bodies switched ( or that Hoyos 's remains were secretly returned to him ) , and that he died with the real body of Elena .

 = Marjory Stoneman Douglas = 
 Marjory Stoneman Douglas ( April 7 , 1890 – May 14 , 1998 ) was an American journalist , writer , feminist , and environmentalist known for her staunch defense of the Everglades against efforts to drain it and reclaim land for development . Moving to Miami as a young woman to work for The Miami Herald , Douglas became a freelance writer , producing over a hundred short stories that were published in popular magazines . Her most influential work was the book The Everglades : River of Grass ( 1947 ) , which redefined the popular conception of the Everglades as a treasured river instead of a worthless swamp ; its impact has been compared to that of Rachel Carson 's influential book Silent Spring ( 1962 ) . Her books , stories , and journalism career brought her influence in Miami , which she used to advance her causes . 
 Even as a young woman Douglas was outspoken and politically conscious of many issues that included women 's suffrage and civil rights . She was called upon to take a central role in the protection of the Everglades when she was 79 years old . For the remaining 29 years of her life she was " a relentless reporter and fearless crusader " for the natural preservation and restoration of the nature of South Florida . Her tireless efforts earned her several variations of the nickname " Grande Dame of the Everglades " as well as the hostility of agricultural and business interests looking to benefit from land development in Florida . Numerous awards were given to her , including the Presidential Medal of Freedom , and she was inducted into several halls of fame . 
 Douglas lived until age 108 , working until nearly the end of her life for Everglades restoration . Upon her death , an obituary in The Independent in London stated , " In the history of the American environmental movement , there have been few more remarkable figures than Marjory Stoneman Douglas . " 
 = = Early life = = 
 Marjory Stoneman was born on April 7 , 1890 , in Minneapolis , Minnesota , the only child of Frank Bryant Stoneman ( 1857 – 1941 ) and Lillian Trefethen ( 1859 – 1912 ) , a concert violinist . One of her earliest memories was her father reading to her The Song of Hiawatha , at which she burst into sobs upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide Hiawatha the wood for a canoe . She was an early and voracious reader . Her first book was Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , which she kept well into adulthood until " some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back " . She visited Florida when she was four years old , and her most vivid memory of the trip was picking an orange from a tree at the Tampa Bay Hotel . From there she and her parents embarked on a cruise from Tampa to Havana . 
 When she was six years old , Marjory 's parents separated . Her father endured a series of failed entrepreneurial ventures and the instability caused her mother to move them abruptly to the Trefethen family house in Taunton , Massachusetts . She lived there with her mother , aunt , and grandparents who did not get along well and consistently spoke ill of her father , to her dismay . Her mother , whom Marjory characterized as " high strung " , was committed to a mental sanitarium in Providence several times . Her parents ' separation and the contentious life with her mother 's family caused her to suffer from night terrors . She credited her tenuous upbringing with making her " a skeptic and a dissenter " for the rest of her life . 
 As a youth , Marjory found solace in reading , and eventually she began to write . At sixteen years old she contributed to the most popular children 's publication of the day , St. Nicholas Magazine — also the first publisher of 20th century writers F. Scott Fitzgerald , Rachel Carson , and William Faulkner — with a puzzle titled " Double <unk> and <unk> " . In 1907 , she was awarded a prize from the Boston Herald for a story titled " An Early Morning Paddle " , about a boy who watches a sunrise from a canoe . However , as her mother 's mental health deteriorated , Marjory took on more responsibilities , eventually managing some of the family finances and gaining a maturity imposed upon her by circumstance . 
 = = = Education and marriage = = = 
 Marjory left for college in 1908 , despite having grave misgivings about her mother 's mental state . Her aunt and grandmother shared her concerns , but recognized that she needed to leave in order to begin her own life . She was a good student without having to study too much . She attended Wellesley College , graduating with a BA in English in 1912 . She found particular gifts in a class on elocution , and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates . She was elected as " Class Orator " at Wellesley , but was unable to fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities . During her senior year while visiting home , her mother showed her a lump on her breast . Marjory arranged the surgery to have it removed . After the graduation ceremony , her aunt informed her it had metastasized , and within months her mother was dead . The family left making the funeral arrangements up to Marjory . 
 After drifting with college friends through a few jobs for which she did not feel she was well @-@ suited , Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914 . She was so impressed with his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months . He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor , and was 30 years her senior , but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist . The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal , despite her honesty in all other manners . Marjory may have unwittingly married Douglas while he was already married to another woman . While he spent six months in jail for passing a bad check , she remained faithful to him . However , his scheme to scam her absent father out of money worked in Marjory 's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman 's attention . Marjory 's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and for the marriage to end . In the fall of 1915 , Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father , whom she had not seen since her parents ' separation when she was six years old . Shortly before that time , her father had remarried <unk> ( " Lilla " ) Eleanor Shine , whose great @-@ great grandfather was Thomas Jefferson . ( Her grandfather was Francis W. Eppes . ) Marjory later wrote that Lilla Shine " remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida . "

 = = = The Miami Herald = = = 
 Douglas arrived in South Florida when fewer than 5 @,@ 000 people were recorded on the census in Miami and it was " no more than a glorified railroad terminal " . Her father , Frank Stoneman , was the first publisher of the paper that later became The Miami Herald . Stoneman passionately opposed the governor of Florida , Napoleon Bonaparte Broward , and his attempts to drain the Everglades . He infuriated Broward so much that when Stoneman won an election for circuit judge , Governor Broward refused to validate the election , so Stoneman was referred to as " Judge " for the rest of his life without performing the duties of one . 
 She joined the staff of the newspaper in 1915 , originally as a society columnist writing about tea parties and society events , but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories : " Somebody would say , ' Who 's that Mrs. <unk> <unk> you 've got in your column ? ' And I would say , ' Oh , you know , I don 't think she 's been here very long ' " . When her father went on vacation less than a year after her appearance in Miami , he left her the responsibility of the editorial page . She developed a rivalry with an editor at The Miami Metropolis whose greater familiarity with the history of Miami gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing . Her father scolded her to check her facts better . 
 Douglas was given an assignment in 1916 to write a story on the first woman to join the US Naval Reserve from Miami . When the woman did not show up for the interview , Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a Yeoman ( F ) first class . It did not suit her ; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar as a typist , so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross , where she was stationed in Paris . She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signed , and she cared for war refugees ; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock , she wrote , " helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later " . 
 Following the war , Douglas took on duties as assistant editor at The Miami Herald . She gained some renown through her daily column entitled " The Galley " , and had enough influence through the newspaper that she became somewhat of a local celebrity . She amassed a devoted readership and attempted to begin each column with a poem . " The Galley " was topical and went in any direction Douglas chose . She promoted responsible urban planning when Miami saw a population boom of 100 @,@ 000 people in a decade . She wrote supporting women 's suffrage , civil rights , and better sanitation while opposing Prohibition and foreign trade tariffs . 
 Some of the stories she wrote spoke of the wealth of the region being in its " inevitable development " , and she supplemented her income with $ 100 a week from writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida , something she would reconsider later in her life . She wrote a ballad in the 1920s lamenting the death of a 22 @-@ year @-@ old vagrant who was beaten to death in a labor camp , titled " Martin <unk> of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now " . It was printed in The Miami Herald , and read aloud during a session of the Florida Legislature , which passed a law banning convict leasing , in large part due to her writing . " I think that 's the single most important thing I was ever able to accomplish as a result of something I 've written " , she wrote in her autobiography . 
 = = = Freelance writer = = = 
 After quitting the newspaper in 1923 , Douglas worked as a freelance writer . From 1920 to 1990 , Douglas published 109 fiction articles and stories . One of her first stories was sold to the pulp fiction magazine Black Mask for $ 600 ( equivalent to $ 8 @,@ 330 in 2015 ) . Forty of her stories were published in The Saturday Evening Post ; one titled " Story of a <unk> Woman " was reprinted in 1937 in the Post 's best short stories compilation . Recurring motifs in her fiction were their settings in South Florida , the Caribbean , or Europe during World War I. Her protagonists were often independent , quirky women or youthful underdogs who encountered social or natural injustices . The people and animals of the Everglades served as subjects for some of her earliest writings . " Plumes " , originally published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1930 , was based on the murder of Guy Bradley , an Audubon Society game warden , by poachers . " Wings " was a nonfiction story , also first appearing in the Post in 1931 , that addressed the slaughter of Everglades wading birds for their feathers . Her story " Peculiar Treasure of a King " was a second @-@ place finalist in the O. Henry Award competition in 1928 . 
 During the 1930s , Douglas was commissioned to write a pamphlet supporting a botanical garden called " An argument for the establishment of a tropical botanical garden in South Florida . " Its success caused her to be in demand at garden clubs where she delivered speeches throughout the area , then to serve on the board to support the Fairchild Garden . She called the garden " one of the greatest achievements for the entire area " . 
 Douglas became involved with the Miami Theater , and wrote some one @-@ act plays that were fashionable in the 1930s . One , entitled " The Gallows Gate " , was about an argument between a mother and father regarding the character of their son who is sentenced to hang . She got the idea from her father , who had witnessed hangings when he lived in the West and was unnerved by the creaking sound of the rope bearing the weight of the hanging body . The play won a state competition , and eventually $ 500 in a national competition after it was written into three acts . With William W. Muir , husband of reporter Helen Muir , she authored a play called " Storm Warnings " loosely based on the life of mobster Al Capone . Some of Capone ’ s henchmen showed up at the theater , “ add [ ing ] an extra tingle for the audience that night ” , though no actual problems arose . Douglas wrote the foreword to the Work Projects Administration 's guide to Miami and environs , published in 1941 as part of the Federal Writers ' Project 's American Guide Series . 
 Douglas served as the book review editor of The Miami Herald from 1942 to 1949 , and as editor for the University of Miami Press from 1960 to 1963 . She released her first novel , entitled Road to the Sun , in 1952 . She wrote four novels , and several non @-@ fiction books on regional topics including Florida birdwatching and David Fairchild , the entomologist turned biologist who imagined a botanical park in Miami . Her autobiography entitled Marjory Stoneman Douglas : Voice of the River was written with John Rothchild in 1987 . She had been working on a book about W. H. Hudson for years , traveling to Argentina and England several times . It was incomplete when she died in 1998 . 
 = = = The Everglades : River of Grass = = = 
 Early in the 1940s Douglas was approached by a publisher to contribute to the Rivers of America Series by writing about the Miami River . Unimpressed with it , she called the Miami River about " an inch long " , but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher instead to allow her to write about them . She spent five years researching what little scientific knowledge was recorded about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida . Douglas spent time with geologist <unk> Parker , who discovered that all of South Florida 's fresh water source was the Biscayne Aquifer , and it was filled by the Everglades . Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas , trying to capture the essence of the Everglades , asked if she could safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee a river of grass . 
 The Everglades : River of Grass was published in 1947 and sold out of its first printing a month after being released . The first line of the book , " There are no other Everglades in the world " , has been called the " most famous passage ever written about the Everglades " , and the statement welcomes visitors to the Everglades National Park website . Douglas characterized the Everglades as ecosystems surrounding a river worthy of protecting , that was inescapably connected to the people and cultures of South Florida . She outlined its imminent disappearance in the last chapter titled " The Eleventh Hour " : 
 <unk> 's grass fires roared uncontrolled . Cane @-@ field fires spread crackling and hissing in the saw grass in vast waves and pillars and billowing mountains of heavy , cream @-@ colored , purple @-@ shadowed smoke . Training planes flying over the Glades dropped bombs or cigarette butts , and the fires exploded in the hearts of the drying hammocks and raced on before every wind leaving only blackness ... There was no water in the canals with which to fight [ the fires ] ... The sweet water the rock had held was gone or had shrunk far down into its strange holes and cleavages . 
 The Everglades : River of Grass galvanized people to protect the Everglades and is compared to Rachel Carson 's 1962 exposé of the harmful effects of DDT , Silent Spring , as both books are " groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice " . Its impact is still relevant as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists , and " remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades " . It has gone through numerous editions , selling 500 @,@ 000 copies since its original publication . The Christian Science Monitor wrote of it in 1997 , " Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature , it also reads like a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world " . The downside to the book 's impact , according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades , is that her metaphor is so <unk> dominant that it is inaccurate in describing the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades : " River of Grass " describes one . David <unk> wrote that despite Douglas ' " appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system " she described , popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book overshadows her detailed explanations .

 Women 's suffrage was an early interest of Douglas , and although she tended to shy away from polemics in her early work at The Miami Herald , on her third day as a society columnist , she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions . In 1917 , she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan , William Jennings Bryan 's wife , and two other women to Tallahassee to speak in support of women 's right to vote . Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature . She wrote about her experience later : " All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats . Talking to them was like talking to graven images . They never paid attention to us at all . " Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920 . 
 Using her influence at The Miami Herald , Douglas wrote columns about poverty : 
 You can have the most beautiful city in the world as appearance goes , the streets may be clean and shining , the avenues broad and tree lined , the public buildings dignified , adequate and well kept ... but if you have a weak or inadequate health department , or a public opinion lax on the subject , all the splendors of your city will have not value . 
 In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee , with a friend of hers named Elizabeth <unk> , who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove . They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs . In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed , they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove , who borrowed the money interest @-@ free to pay for the plumbing work . Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid .

 Douglas became involved in the Everglades in the 1920s , when she joined the board of the Everglades Tropical National Park Committee , a group led by Ernest F. Coe and dedicated to the idea of making a national park in the Everglades . By the 1960s , the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever because of gross mismanagement in the name of progress and real estate and agricultural development . Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups , in 1969 — at the age of 79 — Douglas founded Friends of the Everglades to protest the construction of a jetport in the Big Cypress portion of the Everglades . She justified her involvement saying , " It is a woman 's business to be interested in the environment . It 's an extended form of housekeeping . " 
 She toured the state giving " hundreds of ringing denunciations " of the airport project , and increased membership of Friends of the Everglades to 3 @,@ 000 within three years . She ran the public information operation full @-@ time from her home and encountered hostility from the jetport 's developers and backers , who called her a " damn butterfly chaser " . President Richard Nixon , however , scrapped funding for the project due to the efforts of many Everglades watchdog groups . 
 Douglas continued her activism and focused her efforts on restoring the Everglades after declaring that " Conservation is now a dead word ... You can 't conserve what you haven 't got . " Her criticism was directed at two entities she considered were doing the most damage to the Everglades . A coalition of sugarcane growers , named Big Sugar , she accused of polluting Lake Okeechobee by pumping water tainted with chemicals , human waste , and garbage back into the lake , which served as the fresh water source for the Miami metropolitan area . She compared Florida sugarcane agriculture to sugarcane grown in the West Indies , which , she claimed , was more environmentally sound , had a longer harvest cycle less harmful to soil nutrients , and was less expensive for consumers due to the higher sugar content . 
 Besides Big Sugar , Douglas spoke about the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by diverting the natural flow of water . The Corps was responsible for constructing more than 1 @,@ 400 miles ( 2 @,@ 300 km ) of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947 . When the Central & South Florida Project ( C & SF ) , run by former members of the Corps of Engineers , was proposed to assist the Everglades , Douglas initially gave it her approval , as it promised to deliver much @-@ needed water to the shrinking Everglades . However , in application , the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades , changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers ' irrigation needs , and flat @-@ out refused to release water to Everglades National Park , until much of the land was unrecognizable . " What a liar I turned out to be ! " remarked Douglas , then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying , " Their <unk> obviously never let them play with mud pies , so now they take it out on us by playing with cement " . 
 Douglas was giving a speech addressing the harmful practices of the Army Corps of Engineers when the colonel in attendance dropped his pen on the floor . As he was stooping to pick it up , Douglas stopped her speech and said to him , " Colonel ! You can crawl under that table and hide , but you can 't get away from me ! " 
 In 1973 , Douglas attended a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City , and was observed by John Rothchild : 
 Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses , which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O 'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky . When she spoke , everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order . She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don 't remember what else . Her voice had the sobering effect of a one @-@ room <unk> 's . The tone itself seemed to tame the <unk> of the local stone <unk> , plus the developers , and the lawyers on both sides . I wonder if it didn 't also intimidate the mosquitoes ... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down . This was no surprise to those of us who 'd heard her speak . 
 Douglas was not well received by some audiences . She opposed the drainage of a suburb in Dade County named East Everglades . After the county approved building permits in the Everglades , the land flooded as it had for centuries . When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods , she was the only opposing voice . At the hearing in 1983 , she was booed , jeered , and shouted at by the audience of residents . " Can 't you boo any louder than that ? " she chided , eventually making them laugh . " Look . I 'm an old lady . I 've been here since eight o 'clock . It 's now eleven . I 've got all night , and I 'm used to the heat , " she told them . Later , she wrote , " They 're all good souls — they just shouldn 't be out there . " Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain . 
 Florida Governor Lawton Chiles explained her impact , saying , " Marjory was the first voice to really wake a lot of us up to what we were doing to our quality of life . She was not just a pioneer of the environmental movement , she was a prophet , calling out to us to save the environment for our children and our grandchildren . " 
 = = = Other causes = = = 
 Douglas also served as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter organized in the South in the 1950s . She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment , speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it . In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services , a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade , and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry . She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured . The same year , Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center , which had been housed in hot dog stands , needed a building of its own . The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $ 1 @.@ 8 million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park . Douglas co @-@ founded the Friends of the Miami @-@ Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir , and served as its first president . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 = = = Religious views = = = 
 Although Douglas grew up in an Episcopalian household , she described herself as agnostic throughout her life , and forbade any religious ceremony at her memorial . Douglas tied her agnosticism to her unanswered prayers when her mother was dying . However , she credited the motivation for her support of women 's suffrage to her Quaker paternal grandparents whose dedication to the abolition of slavery she admired , and proudly claimed Levi Coffin , an organizer of the Underground Railroad , was her great @-@ great @-@ uncle . She wrote that his wife was a friend of Harriet Beecher Stowe , and had provided Stowe with the story of Eliza in Uncle Tom 's Cabin fleeing slavery because Douglas ' great @-@ great @-@ aunt took care of Eliza and her infant after their escape . Frank Stoneman grew up in a Quaker colony , and Douglas maintained he kept touches of his upbringing throughout his life , even after converting to Episcopalianism . Writer Jack Davis and neighbor Helen Muir suggest this Quaker influence was behind Douglas ' use of " Friends " in naming the organizations Friends of the Everglades and Friends of the Miami @-@ Dade Public Libraries . 
 = = = Mental health = = = 
 As a child , Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents ' separation . She witnessed her mother 's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized , and even long after her mother returned to live with her , she exhibited bizarre , childlike behaviors . Following her mother 's death , her relocation to Miami , and her displeasure in working as the assistant editor at The Miami Herald , in the 1920s , she suffered the first of three nervous breakdowns . 
 Douglas suggested she had had " blank periods " before starting during her marriage , but they were brief . She connected these lapses to her mother 's insanity . She eventually quit the newspaper , but after her father 's death in 1941 she suffered a third and final breakdown , when her neighbors found her roaming the neighborhood one night screaming . She admitted she had a " father complex " , explaining it by saying , " Having been brought up without him and then coming back and finding him so sympathetic had a powerful effect " . 
 = = = Personal habits = = = 
 Regardless of her dedication to the preservation of the Everglades , Douglas admitted the time she spent actually there was sporadic , driving there for occasional picnics . " To be a friend of the Everglades is not necessarily to spend time wandering around out there ... It 's too buggy , too wet , too generally inhospitable " , she wrote . Instead , she understood that the health of the environment indicated the general well @-@ being of humanity . 
 Despite Douglas ' demure appearance — she stood at 5 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 57 m ) and weighed 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) , and was always immaculately dressed in pearls , a floppy straw hat and gloves — she had an uncanny ability to get her point across . She was known for speaking in perfect , precise paragraphs , and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects ; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades . Jeff <unk> , a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times who interviewed and wrote several stories about Douglas , wrote of her , " She had a tongue like a switchblade and the moral authority to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen . " Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions . 
 She enjoyed drinking Scotch and sherry ; as friend and neighbor Helen Muir remembered her , " She would come up and have a sherry , and then I would walk her home , and then she 'd walk me back , and we would have another sherry . What fun she was . " Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir , " the Stewart Avenue Gang " . The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping , but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries , and the role of women in South Florida . They were confidants , and often shared their work with one another . Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car . Her house also had no air conditioning , electric stove , or dishwasher . 
 She was attached to several men after her divorce , counting one of them as the reason she enlisted in the Red Cross , as he had already gone to France as a soldier . However , she said she did not believe in extramarital sex and would not have dishonored her father by being promiscuous . She told <unk> in 1992 , frankly , that she had not had sex since her divorce , saying " I wasn 't a wild woman " . However , she was fond of saying she used the emotion and energy instead on her work . " People don 't seem to realize that the energy that goes into sex , all the emotion that surrounds it , can be well employed in other ways " , she wrote in her autobiography . 
 = = Awards , death , and legacy = = 
 = = = Honors = = = 
 Douglas began accruing honors since her early days writing for The Miami Herald . In the 1980s , however , the awards became more prestigious , and her reactions to them mixed . The Florida Department of Natural Resources ( now the Florida Department of Environmental Protection ) named its headquarters in Tallahassee after her in 1980 , which she considered a dubious honor . She told a friend she would have rather seen the Everglades restored than her name on a building . During her polite acceptance speech , she railed against Ronald Reagan and the then @-@ Secretary of the Interior James Watt for their lackluster approach to environmental conservation . The National Parks Conservation Association established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award in 1986 , that " honor ( s ) individuals who often must go to great lengths to advocate and fight for the protection of the National Park System " . Despite blindness and diminished hearing , Douglas continued to be active into her second century , and was honored with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II , to whom Douglas gave a signed copy of The Everglades : River of Grass in 1991 . Instead of gifts and celebrations , Douglas asked that trees be planted on her birthday , resulting in over 100 @,@ 000 planted trees across the state and a bald cypress on the lawn of the governor 's mansion . The South Florida Water Management District began removing exotic plants that had taken hold in the Everglades when Douglas turned 102 . 
 In 1993 , President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest honor given to a civilian . The citation for the medal read , " Marjory Stoneman Douglas personifies passionate commitment . Her crusade to preserve and restore the Everglades has enhanced our Nation 's respect for our precious environment , reminding all of us of nature 's delicate balance . Grateful Americans honor the ' Grandmother of the Glades ' by following her splendid example in safeguarding America 's beauty and splendor for generations to come . " Douglas donated her medal to Wellesley College . Most of the others she received she stored on the floor of her home . 
 Douglas was inducted into the National Wildlife Federation Hall of Fame in 1999 , and the National Women 's Hall of Fame in 2000 . John Rothchild declared her a feminist before the word existed , but not entirely . Upon hearing that she was to be inducted , she questioned , " Why should they have a Women 's Hall of Fame , as I heard they wanted to put me in the other day ? Why not a Citizen 's Hall of Fame ? " Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a papier @-@ mâché bust of her with Georgia O 'Keeffe and Susan B. Anthony in an early episode of The Simpsons . 
 Some of Douglas ' stories were collected by University of Florida professor Kevin McCarthy in two edited collections : Nine Florida Stories in 1990 and A River In Flood in 1998 . McCarthy wrote that he collected Douglas ' short stories because most people in the 1990s were well aware of her fame as an environmentalist , but many did not know about her career as a freelance writer . " Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well @-@ being of Florida than this little lady from Coconut Grove " , McCarthy wrote in the introduction of A River in Flood . 
 = = = Remembrances = = = 
 Marjory Stoneman Douglas died at the age of 108 on May 14 , 1998 . John Rothchild , who helped write her autobiography , said that her death was the only thing that could " shut her up " but added , " The silence is terrible . " Carl Hiaasen eulogized her in The Miami Herald , writing that The Everglades : River of Grass was " monumental " , and praised her passion and her resolve ; even when politicians finally found value in the Everglades and visited her for a photo opportunity , she still provoked them to do more and do it faster . 
 The National Wildlife Federation described her as " a passionate , articulate , and tireless voice for the environment " . Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society Ed Davison remembered her , saying , " She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be , and she didn 't give a lot of credibility to excuses about why they 're not like that . She would give these wonderful , curmudgeonly speeches to which there was no response . You can 't holler back to grandmotherly scolding . All you can do is shuffle your feet and say , ' Yes , Ma 'am . ' " She was aware of it ; she was reported saying , " People can 't be rude to me , this poor little old woman . But I can be rude to them , poor darlings , and nobody can stop me . " Her ashes were scattered over the 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 5 @,@ 300 km2 ) of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park . 
 In 2000 , a Naples , Florida @-@ based composer named Steve <unk> wrote a 15 @-@ minute orchestra piece to be performed by the Naples Philharmonic entitled Voice of the Everglades ( Epitaph for Marjory Stoneman Douglas ) . <unk> explained his motivation for the piece , saying , " She was outspoken , she was direct , she had the energy and belief to make the world a better place . " Two South Florida public schools are named in her honor : Broward County Public Schools ' Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and Miami @-@ Dade County Public Schools ' Marjory Stoneman Douglas Elementary School . 
 = = = Douglas home = = = 
 Douglas ' cottage , located in Coconut Grove at <unk> – <unk> Stewart Avenue , was built in 1924 . She wrote all of her major books and stories in the cottage , and the City of Miami designated it an historic site in 1995 , not only for its famous owner but also for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture . After Douglas ' death , Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life , but neighbors protested , citing issues with parking , traffic , and an influx of visitors to the quiet neighborhood . The house , which had an exterior floodwater line from the 1926 Miami Hurricane and some damage from an infestation of bees , had fallen further into disrepair . For a while , the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables , which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts , was considered . The State of Florida owns Douglas ' house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service , a division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection . Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months . Water service was reconnected to the house and the electrical system was updated for safety purposes . All work was approved by the Department of Historic Resources . A park ranger was placed as a resident in the Douglas house to help maintain the structure and property . 
 On April 22 , 2015 , while giving an Earth Day speech in the Everglades , President Barack Obama announced that Interior Secretary Sally Jewell had designated the house a National Historic Landmark .

 = Icelanders = 
 Icelanders are a Germanic ethnic group and nation , native to Iceland . 
 On 17 June 1944 , when the Icelandic republic was founded , the Icelanders became independent from the Danish monarchy . The language spoken is Icelandic , a North Germanic language , and Lutheranism is the predominant religion . Historical and DNA records indicate that around 60 to 80 percent of the settlers were of Norse origin ( primarily from Western Norway ) and the rest were of Celtic stock from Ireland and peripheral Scotland . 
 = = Iceland = = 
 Icelanders have had a tumultuous history . Development of the island was slow due to a lack of interest from the countries controlling it for most of its history : Norway , Denmark – Norway , and ultimately Denmark . Through this time , Iceland had relatively little contact with the outside world . The island became independent in union with Denmark in 1918 . Since 1944 , Iceland has been a republic , and Icelandic society has undergone a rapid modernisation process in the post @-@ independence era . 
 = = History = = 
 Iceland is a geologically young land mass , having formed an estimated 20 million years ago due to volcanic eruptions on the Mid @-@ Atlantic ridge . One of the last larger islands to remain uninhabited , the first human settlement date is generally accepted to be 874 , although there is some evidence to suggest human activity prior to the Norse arrival . 
 = = = Initial migration and settlement = = = 
 The first Viking to sight Iceland was <unk> <unk> , who went off course due to harsh conditions when sailing from Norway to the Faroe Islands . His reports led to the first efforts to settle the island . <unk> <unk> ( b . 9th century ) was the first Norseman to sail to Iceland intentionally . His story is documented in the Landnámabók manuscript , and he is said to have named the island <unk> ( Iceland ) . The first permanent settler in Iceland is usually considered to have been a Norwegian chieftain named <unk> <unk> . He settled with his family in around 874 , at a place he named " Bay of Smokes " , or Reykjavík in Icelandic . 
 Following <unk> , and also in 874 , another group of Norwegians set sail across the North Atlantic Ocean with their families , livestock , slaves and possessions , escaping the domination of the first King of Norway , Haraldur <unk> . They traveled 1 @,@ 000 km ( 600 mi ) in their Viking longships to the island of Iceland . These people were primarily of Norwegian , Irish or Gaelic Scottish origin . The Irish and the Scottish Gaels were either slaves or servants of the Norse chiefs , according to the Icelandic sagas , or descendants of a " group of Norsemen who had settled in Scotland and Ireland and intermarried with Gaelic @-@ speaking people " . Genetic evidence suggests that approximately 62 % of the Icelandic maternal gene pool is derived from Ireland and Scotland , which is much higher than other Scandinavian countries , although comparable to the Faroese , while 37 % is of Nordic origin . About 20 @-@ 25 % of the Icelandic paternal gene pool is of Gaelic origin , with the rest being Nordic . 
 The Icelandic Age of Settlement ( Icelandic : <unk> ) is considered to have lasted from 874 to 930 , at which point most of the island had been claimed and the Alþingi ( English : Althing ) , the assembly of the Icelandic Commonwealth , was founded at Þingvellir . 
 = = = Hardship and conflict = = = 
 In 930 , on the Þingvellir ( English : <unk> ) plain near Reykjavík , the chieftains and their families met and established the Alþingi , Iceland 's first national assembly . However , the Alþingi lacked the power to enforce the laws it made . In 1262 , struggles between rival chieftains left Iceland so divided that King Haakon IV of Norway was asked to step in as a final arbitrator for all disputes , as part of the Old Covenant . This is known as the Age of the <unk> . 
 Iceland was under Norwegian leadership until 1380 , when the Royal House of Norway died out . At this point , both Iceland and Norway came under the control of the Danish Crown . With the introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark , the Icelanders relinquished their autonomy to the crown , including the right to initiate and consent to legislation . This meant a loss of independence for Iceland , which led to nearly 300 years of decline : perhaps largely because Denmark and its Crown did not consider Iceland to be a colony to be supported and assisted . In particular , the lack of help in defense led to constant raids by marauding pirates along the Icelandic coasts . 
 Unlike Norway , Denmark did not need Iceland 's fish and homespun wool . This created a dramatic deficit in Iceland 's trade , and no new ships were built as a result . In 1602 Iceland was forbidden to trade with other countries by order of the Danish Government , and in the 18th century climatic conditions had reached an all @-@ time low since Settlement . 
 In 1783 – 84 Laki , a volcanic fissure in the south of the island , erupted . The eruption produced about 15 km ³ ( 3 @.@ 6 mi ³ ) of basalt lava , and the total volume of tephra emitted was 0 @.@ 91 km ³ . The aerosols built up caused a cooling effect in the Northern Hemisphere . The consequences for Iceland were catastrophic , with approximately 25 @-@ 33 % of the population dying in the famine of 1783 and 1784 . Around 80 % of sheep , 50 % of cattle , and 50 % of horses died of fluorosis from the 8 million tons of fluorine that were released . This disaster is known as the Mist Hardship ( Icelandic : <unk> ) . 
 In 1798 – 99 the Alþingi was discontinued for several decades , eventually being restored in 1844 . It was moved to Reykjavík , the capital , after being held at Þingvellir for over nine centuries . 
 = = = Independence and prosperity = = = 
 The 19th century brought significant improvement in the Icelanders ' situation . A protest movement was led by Jón Sigurðsson , a statesman , historian , and authority on Icelandic literature . Inspired by the romantic and nationalist currents from mainland Europe , Jón protested strongly , through political journals and self @-@ publications , for ' a return to national consciousness ' and for political and social changes to be made to help speed up Iceland 's development . 
 In 1854 , the Danish government relaxed the trade ban that had been imposed in 1602 , and Iceland gradually began to rejoin Western Europe economically and socially . With this return of contact with other peoples came a reawakening of Iceland 's arts , especially its literature . Twenty years later in 1874 , Iceland was granted a constitution . Icelanders today recognize Jón 's efforts as largely responsible for their economic and social resurgence . 
 Iceland gained near @-@ full independence in 1918 after World War I , and retained only formal ties with the Danish Crown . This move to independence was completed on 17 June 1944 on what would have been Jón Sigurðsson 's 133rd birthday . After a national referendum , Iceland broke all ties with Denmark , after nearly six centuries of Danish rule , and declared itself independent . 
 = = Demographics and society = = 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Most mitochondrial DNA lineages found today in contemporary Icelanders can be traced to the native populations in Ireland and Scotland and Scandinavia . Another study shows that a tiny proportion of samples of contemporary Icelanders carry a more distant lineage , which belongs to the haplogroup C1 , which can possibly be traced to the settlement of the Americas around 14 @,@ 000 years ago . The same study used preliminary genealogical analyses which revealed that C1 lineage was present in the Icelandic mtDNA pool at least 300 years ago . Due to their small founding population and considerable history of relative isolation , Icelanders have often been considered highly genetically homogeneous as compared to other European populations . For this reason , along with the extensive genealogical records for much of the population that reach back to the settlement of Iceland , Icelanders have been the focus of considerable genomics research by both biotechnology companies and academic and medical researchers . However , one study of mitochondrial DNA , blood groups , and isozymes revealed a more variable population than expected from these genetic standpoints , comparable to the diversity of some other Europeans . Another study shows that quite a big group of Scandinavian males , in particular Norwegians and Icelanders ( up to 31 % of samples ) , carry Haplogroup <unk> ( Y @-@ DNA ) . 
 Results of the mitochondrial DNA studies have been consistent with the genealogical records that trace the ancestry of most Icelanders to Scandinavia , Ireland and Scotland , though there may have been a minor contribution from other European groups . Founder effects and the effects of genetic drift are more pronounced for the Icelandic gene pool than other nearby populations , supporting the assumed genetic isolation of the population .

 = = = = Greenland = = = = 
 Greenland was first settled by some 500 Icelanders under the leadership of Erik the Red in the late 10th century , CE . Isolated fjords in this harsh land offered sufficient grazing to support cattle and sheep , though the climate was too cold for cereal crops . Royal trade ships from Norway occasionally went to Greenland to trade for walrus tusks and falcons . The population eventually reached a high point of perhaps 3 @,@ 000 in two communities and developed independent institutions before fading away during the 15th century . A papal legation was sent there as late as 1492 , the year Columbus attempted to find a shorter spice route but instead found the Americas . 
 = = = = North America = = = = 
 According to the Saga of Eric the Red , Icelandic immigration to North America dates back to 1006 , when Icelandic Snorri was born in Vinland . This colony was short @-@ lived though and by the 1020s the Icelanders abandoned it . Icelandic immigration to North America would not resume for some 800 years . 
 One of the first new instances of Icelandic immigration to North America occurred in 1855 , when a small group settled in Spanish Fork , Utah . Another Icelandic colony is Washington Island , Wisconsin . Immigration to the United States and Canada began in earnest in the 1870s , with most migrants initially settling in the Great Lakes area . These settlers were fleeing famine and overcrowding on Iceland . Today , there are sizable communities of Icelandic descent in both the United States and Canada . Gimli , in Manitoba , Canada , is home to the largest population of Icelanders outside of the main island of Iceland . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Language and literature = = = 
 Icelandic , a North Germanic language , is the official language of Iceland ( de facto ; the laws are silent about the issue ) . Icelandic has inflectional grammar comparable to Latin , Ancient Greek , more closely to Old English and practically identical to Old Norse . 
 Old Icelandic literature can be divided into several categories , of which three are best known to foreigners : Eddic poetry , skaldic poetry , and saga literature , if saga literature is understood broadly . Eddic poetry is made up of heroic and mythological poems . Poetry that praises someone is considered skaldic poetry or court poetry . Finally Saga literature is prose , ranging from pure fiction to fairly factual history . 
 Written Icelandic has changed little since the 13th century . Because of this , modern readers can understand the Icelanders ' sagas . The sagas tell of events in Iceland in the 10th and early 11th centuries . They are considered to be the best @-@ known pieces of Icelandic literature . 
 The elder or Poetic Edda , the younger or Prose Edda , and the sagas are the major pieces of Icelandic literature . The Poetic Edda is a collection of poems and stories from the late 10th century , whereas the younger or Prose Edda is a manual of poetry that contains many stories of Norse mythology . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Iceland embraced Christianity in c . AD 1000 , in what is called the <unk> , and the country , while mostly secular in observance , is still predominantly Christian culturally . The Lutheran church claims some 84 % of the total population . While early Icelandic Christianity was more lax in its observances than traditional Catholicism , Pietism , a religious movement imported from Denmark in the 18th century , had a marked effect on the island . By discouraging all but religious leisure activities , it fostered a certain dourness , which was for a long time considered an Icelandic stereotype . At the same time , it also led to a boom in printing , and Iceland today is one of the most literate societies in the world . 
 While Catholicism was supplanted by Protestantism during the Reformation , most other world religions are now represented on the island : there are small Protestant Free Churches and Catholic communities , and even a nascent Muslim community , composed of both immigrants and local converts . Perhaps unique to Iceland is the fast @-@ growing <unk> , a legally recognized revival of the pre @-@ Christian Nordic religion of the original settlers . According to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Reykjavík , there were only approximately 30 Jews in Iceland as of 2001 . The First Lady of Iceland Dorrit <unk> is an Israeli @-@ born Bukharian Jew .

 Icelandic cuisine consists mainly of fish , lamb , and dairy . Fish was once the main part of an Icelander 's diet but has recently given way to meats such as beef , pork , and poultry . 
 Iceland has many traditional foods called <unk> . These foods include smoked and salted lamb , singed sheep heads , dried fish , smoked and pickled salmon , and cured shark . Andrew Zimmern , a chef who has traveled the world on his show Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern , responded to the question " What 's the most disgusting thing you 've ever eaten ? " with the response " That would have to be the fermented shark fin I had in Iceland . " Fermented shark fin is a form of <unk> .

 The earliest indigenous Icelandic music was the rímur , epic tales from the Viking era that were often performed a cappella . Christianity played a major role in the development of Icelandic music , with many hymns being written in the local idiom . <unk> <unk> , a poet and priest , is noted for writing many of these hymns in the 17th century . The island 's relative isolation ensured that the music maintained its regional flavor . It was only in the 19th century that the first pipe organs , prevalent in European religious music , first appeared on the island . 
 Many singers , groups , and forms of music have come from Iceland . Most Icelandic music contains vibrant folk and pop traditions . Some more recent groups and singers are Voces <unk> , The Sugarcubes , Björk , Sigur Rós , and Of Monsters and Men . 
 The national anthem is " Ó Guð <unk> lands " ( English : " Our Country 's God " ) , written by <unk> <unk> , with music by <unk> <unk> . The song was written in 1874 , when Iceland celebrated its one thousandth anniversary of settlement on the island . It was originally published with the title A Hymn in Commemoration of Iceland 's Thousand Years .

 = Canadian federal election , 1957 = 
 The Canadian federal election of 1957 was held June 10 , 1957 , to select the 265 members of the House of Commons of Canada . In one of the great upsets in Canadian political history , the Progressive Conservative Party ( also known as " PCs " or " Tories " ) , led by John Diefenbaker , brought an end to 22 years of Liberal rule , as the Tories were able to form a minority government . 
 The Liberal Party had governed Canada since 1935 , winning five consecutive elections . Under Prime Ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent , the government gradually built a welfare state . During the Liberals 's fifth term in office , the opposition parties depicted them as arrogant and unresponsive to Canadians ' needs . Controversial events , such as the 1956 " Pipeline Debate " over the construction of the Trans @-@ Canada Pipeline , had hurt the government . St. Laurent , nicknamed ' Uncle Louis ' , remained popular , but exercised little supervision over his cabinet ministers . 
 In 1956 , Tory leader George A. Drew unexpectedly resigned due to ill health . In his place , the PC party elected the fiery and charismatic Diefenbaker . The Tories ran a campaign centred on their new leader , who attracted large crowds to rallies and made a strong impression on television . The Liberals ran a lacklustre campaign , and St. Laurent made few television appearances . Uncomfortable with the medium , the Prime Minister read his speeches from a script and refused to wear makeup . 
 Abandoning their usual strategy of trying to make major inroads in Liberal @-@ dominated Quebec , the Tories focused on winning seats in the other provinces . They were successful ; though they gained few seats in Quebec , they won 112 seats overall to the Liberals ' 105 . With the remaining seats won by other parties , the PC party only had a plurality in the House of Commons , but the margin was sufficient to make John Diefenbaker Canada 's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935 .

 = = = Liberal domination = = = 
 The Tories had last governed Canada under R.B. Bennett , who had been elected in 1930 . Bennett 's government had limited success in dealing with the Depression , and was defeated in 1935 , as Liberal William Lyon Mackenzie King , who had previously served two times as Prime Minister , was restored to power . The Liberals won five consecutive majorities between 1935 and 1953 . The Liberals worked closely with the civil service ( drawing several of their ministers from those ranks ) and their years of dominance saw prosperity . 
 When Mackenzie King retired in 1948 , he was succeeded by his Minister of Justice , Louis St. Laurent , a bilingual Quebecer who took office at the age of 66 . An adept politician , St. Laurent projected a gentle persona and was affectionately known to many Canadians as Uncle Louis ( or , among francophones , <unk> Louis ) . In actuality , St. Laurent was uncomfortable away from Ottawa , was subject to fits of depression ( especially after 1953 ) , and on political trips was carefully managed by advertising men from the firm of Cockfield Brown . St. Laurent led the Liberals to an overwhelming triumph in the 1949 election , campaigning under the slogan " You never had it so good " . The Liberals won a fifth successive mandate in 1953 , with St. Laurent content to exercise a highly relaxed leadership style . 
 With over twenty years of parliamentary majorities , Liberal ministers did as they wished with little regard for the opposition parties . The Mackenzie King and St. Laurent governments laid the groundwork for the welfare state , a development initially opposed by many Tories . C.D. Howe , considered one of the leading forces of the St. Laurent government , told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them , " Who would stop us ? ... Don 't take yourselves too seriously . If we wanted to get away with it , who would stop us ? " 
 = = = Tory struggles = = = 
 At the start of 1956 , the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew , who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker . Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power . None had come close to defeating the Liberals ; the best performance was in 1945 , when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories . The Liberals , though , had won 125 seats , and maintained their majority . In the 1953 election , the PC party won 51 seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons . Subsequently the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by @-@ elections , and the Liberals ( who had won 169 seats in 1953 ) lost an additional seat to the Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF , the predecessor of the New Democratic Party ( NDP ) ) . 
 After over two decades in opposition , the Tories were closely associated with that role in the public eye . The Tories were seen as the party of the wealthy and of English @-@ speaking Canada and drew about 30 % of the vote in federal elections . The Tories had enjoyed little success in Quebec in the past forty years . By 1956 , the Social Credit Party was becoming a potential rival to the Tories as Canada 's main right @-@ wing party . Canadian journalist and author Bruce Hutchison discussed the state of the Tories in 1956 : 
 When a party calling itself Conservative can think of nothing better than to outbid the Government 's election promises ; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next ; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results ... when in short , the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty @-@ one years ... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the improbable chance of quick victory . 
 = = = Run @-@ up to the campaign = = = 
 In 1955 , the Tories , through a determined filibuster , were able to defeat amendments to the Defence Procurement Act , which would have made temporary , extraordinary powers granted to the government permanent . Drew led the Tories in a second battle with the government the following year : in the so @-@ called " Pipeline Debate " , the government invoked closure repeatedly in a weeks @-@ long debate which ended with the Speaker ignoring points of order as he had the division bells rung . Both measures were closely associated with Howe , which , in combination with his earlier comments , led to Tory claims that Howe was indifferent to the democratic process . 
 Tory preparations for an upcoming election campaign were thrown into disarray in August 1956 when Drew fell ill . Tory leaders felt that the party needed vigorous leadership with a federal election likely to be called within a year . In September , Drew resigned . Diefenbaker , who had failed in two prior bids for the leadership , announced his candidacy , as did Tory frontbenchers Davie Fulton and Donald Fleming . Diefenbaker , a criminal defence lawyer from Prince Albert , Saskatchewan , was on the populist left of the PC party . Those Tory leaders who disliked Diefenbaker and his views , and hoped to find a candidate from Drew 's conservative wing of the party , wooed University of Toronto president Sidney Smith as a candidate . However , Smith refused to run . 
 Tory leaders scheduled a leadership convention for December . In early November , the Suez crisis erupted . Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson played a major part in the settlement of that dispute , and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role . Diefenbaker , as the Tories ' foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race , gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez . The Tories attacked Pearson for , as they said , being an errand boy for the United States government ; he responded that it was better to be such a lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain 's will unquestioningly . While Suez would come to be regarded by many as one of the finest moments in Canadian foreign policy , at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec . 
 Diefenbaker was the favourite throughout the leadership campaign . At the convention in Ottawa in December , he refused to abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or <unk> of his candidacy , and instead selected an Easterner ( from New Brunswick ) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination . With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents , Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support . Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot , and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory . Other Diefenbaker opponents , such as those who had urged Smith to run , believed that the 61 @-@ year @-@ old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker , who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of a younger man , and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories . 
 When Parliament convened in January , the Liberals introduced no major proposals , and proposed nothing controversial . Diefenbaker turned over his parliamentary duties to British Columbia MP Howard Green and spent much of his time on the road making speeches across the country . Diefenbaker toured a nation in which Liberal support at the provincial level had slowly been eroding . When the Liberals gained Federal power in 1935 , they controlled eight of the nine provincial governments , all except Alberta . By early 1957 , the Liberals controlled the legislatures only in the tenth province , Newfoundland , and in Prince Edward Island and Manitoba . 
 In March , Finance Minister Walter Harris , who was believed to be St. Laurent 's heir apparent , introduced his budget . The budget anticipated a surplus of $ 258 million , of which $ 100 million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments , with an increase of $ 6 per month ( to a total of $ 46 ) for old age pensioners — effective after the election . Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation . Diefenbaker attacked the budget , calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments , more aid to the poorer provinces , and aid to farmers . 
 St. Laurent had informed Diefenbaker that Parliament would be dissolved in April , for an election on June 10 . A final parliamentary conflict was sparked by the suicide of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt E.H. Norman in the midst of allegations made by a United States Senate subcommittee that Norman had communist links . Pearson had defended Norman when the allegations became public , and defended him again after his death , suggesting to the Commons that the allegations were false . It quickly became apparent that the information released by the Americans might have come from Canadian intelligence sources , and after severe questioning of Pearson by Diefenbaker and the other parties ' foreign policy critics , Pearson made a statement announcing that Norman had had communist associations in his youth , but had passed a security review . The minister evaded further questions regarding what information had been provided , and the discussion was cut short when Parliament was dissolved on April 12 . 
 Peter <unk> , who studied the four elections between 1957 and 1963 , wrote of the situation at the start of the election campaign , " In 1957 , there was no tangible indication that the Liberals would be beaten or , even in the opposition 's darkest moment of reflection , could be . All the hindsight and post hoc gazing at entrails cannot change that objective fact . " 
 = = Issues = = 
 The Liberals and PC party differed considerably on fiscal and tax policies . In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto , Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed in the amount of $ 120 per family of four . Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus . St. Laurent also addressed tax policy in his opening speech , in Winnipeg . St. Laurent noted that since 1953 , tax rates had declined , as had the national debt , and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments . The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate . Diefenbaker also assailed tight @-@ money monetary policies which kept interest rates high , complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard . 
 The Tories promised changes in agricultural policies . Many Canadian farmers were unable to find buyers for their wheat ; the PC party promised generous cash advances on unsold wheat and promised a protectionist policy regarding foreign agricultural products . The Liberals argued that such tariffs were not worth the loss of bargaining position in efforts to seek foreign markets for Canadian agricultural products . 
 The institution of the welfare state was by 1957 accepted by both major parties . Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients . He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance , not even enough to keep up with the cost of living . Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day , using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation . All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension , with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by . 
 The Liberals were content to rest on their record in foreign affairs , and doubted that the Tories could better them . In a radio address on May 30 , Minister of Transport George <unk> commented , " You will wonder as I do who in the Conservative Party would take the place of the Honourable Lester Pearson , whose knowledge and experience of world affairs has been put to such good use in recent years . " Diefenbaker , however , refused to concede the point and in a televised address stated that Canadians were " asking Pearson to explain his bumbling of External Affairs " . Though they were reluctant to discuss the Norman affair , the Tories suggested that the government had irresponsibly allowed gossip to be transmitted to United States congressional committees . They also attacked the government over Pearson 's role in the Suez settlement , suggesting that Canada had let Britain down . 
 Some members of the Tories ' campaign committee had urged Diefenbaker not to build his campaign around the Pipeline Debate , contending that the episode was now a year in the past and forgotten by the voters , who did not particularly care what went on in Parliament anyway . Diefenbaker replied , " That 's the issue , and I 'm making it . " Diefenbaker referred to the conduct of the government in the Pipeline Debate more frequently than he did any other issue during the campaign . St. Laurent initially dealt with the question flippantly , suggesting in his opening campaign address that the debate had been " nearly as long as the pipeline itself and quite as full of another kind of natural gas " . As the issue gained resonance with the voters , the Liberals devoted more time to it , and St. Laurent devoted a major part of his final English television address to the question . The Liberals defended their conduct , and contended that a minority should not be allowed to impose its will on an elected majority . St. Laurent suggested that the Tories had performed badly as an opposition in the debate , and suggested that the public give them more practice at being an opposition . 
 Finally , the Tories contended that the Liberals had been in power too long , and that it was time for a change . The PC party stated that the Liberals were arrogant , inflexible , and not capable of looking at problems from a new point of view . Liberals responded that with the country prosperous , there was no point to a change .

 In 1953 , almost half of the Tories ' campaign funds were spent in Quebec , a province in which the party won only four of seventy @-@ five seats . After the 1953 election , Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation . He concluded that the Progressive Conservatives were ill @-@ advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province ; the Tories could win at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English @-@ speaking Canada , and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec , it could attain a majority . Churchill 's conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories — except Diefenbaker . 
 Diefenbaker 's successful leadership race had been run by Allister Grosart , an executive for McKim Advertising Ltd . Soon after taking the leadership , Diefenbaker got Grosart to help out at Tory headquarters , and soon appointed him national director of the party and national campaign manager . Grosart appointed a national campaign committee , something which had not been done previously by the Tories , but which , according to Grosart , provided the organizational key to success in 1957 . The party was ill @-@ financed , having only $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to wage the campaign — half what it had in 1953 . Grosart divided most of that money equally by constituency , to the disgruntlement of Quebec Tories , who were used to receiving a disproportionate share of the national party 's financing . 
 The Tory campaign opened at Massey Hall in Toronto on April 25 , where Diefenbaker addressed a crowd of 2 @,@ 600 , about 200 short of capacity . At the Massey Hall rally , a large banner hung behind Diefenbaker , which did not mention the name of his party , but which instead stated , " It 's Time for a Diefenbaker Government . " The slogan , coined by Grosart , sought to blur Canadian memories of the old Tory party of Bennett and Drew and instead focus attention on the party 's new leader . Posters for election rallies contained Diefenbaker 's name in large type ; only the small print contained the name of the party . When St. Laurent complained that the Tories were not campaigning under their own name , Grosart sent copies of the Prime Minister 's remarks in a plain envelope to every Liberal candidate , and was gratified when they began inserting the allegation into their own speeches . According to Professor J. Murray Beck in his history of Canadian general elections , " His political enemies were led to make the very point he was striving to drive home : Diefenbaker was , in effect , leading a new party , not an old one with a repellent image . " Grosart later stated that he structured the entire campaign around the personality of John Diefenbaker , and threw away the Tory party and its policies . 
 Diefenbaker began his campaign with a week of local campaigning in his riding , after which he went to Toronto for the Massey Hall speech . After two days in Ontario , he spoke at a rally in Quebec City , before spending the remainder of the first week in the Maritimes . The next week saw Diefenbaker spend two days in Quebec , after which he campaigned in Ontario . The next two weeks included a Western tour , with brief returns to Ontario , the most populous province . The final two weeks saw Diefenbaker spend much of the time in Ontario , though with brief journeys east to the Maritimes and Quebec and twice west to Saskatchewan . He returned to his riding for the final weekend before the Monday election . He spent 39 days on the campaign trail , eleven more than the Prime Minister . 
 According to Professor John Meisel , who wrote a book about the 1957 campaign , Diefenbaker 's speaking style was " reminiscent of the fiery orators so popular in the nineteenth century . Indeed , Mr. Diefenbaker 's oratory has been likened to that of the revivalist preacher . " As a new face on the national scene given to outspoken attacks on the government , he began to attract unexpectedly large crowds early in the campaign . When reduced to the written word , however , Diefenbaker 's rhetoric sometimes proved to be without much meaning . According to journalist and author Peter C. Newman , " On the printed page , it makes little sense . But from the platform , its effect was far different . " Both Newman and Meisel cite as an example of this the conclusion to the leader 's Massey Hall speech : 
 If we are dedicated to this — and to this we are — you , my fellow Canadians , will require all the wisdom , all the power that comes from those spiritual springs that make freedom possible — all the wisdom , all the faith and all the vision which the Conservative Party gave but yesterday under Macdonald , change to meet changing conditions , today having the responsibility of this party to lay the foundations of this nation for a great and glorious future . 
 Diefenbaker 's speeches contained words which evoked powerful emotions in his listeners . His theme was that Canada was on the edge of greatness — if it could only get rid of its incompetent and arrogant government . He stressed that the only alternative to the Liberals was a " Diefenbaker government " . According to Newman , Diefenbaker successfully drew on the discontent both of those who had prospered in the 1950s , and sought some deeper personal and national purpose , as well as those who had been left out of the prosperity . However , Diefenbaker spoke French badly and the excitement generated by his campaign had little effect in francophone Quebec , where apathy prevailed and Le Devoir spoke of " une <unk> <unk> au <unk> " . 
 The Tories had performed badly in British Columbia in 1953 , finishing a weak fourth . However , the province responded to Diefenbaker , and 3 @,@ 800 turned out for his Victoria speech on May 21 , his largest crowd yet . This was bettered two days later in Vancouver with a crowd of 6 @,@ 000 , with even the street outside the Georgia Street Auditorium packed with Tory partisans . Diefenbaker responded to this by delivering what Dick Spencer ( who wrote a book on Diefenbaker 's campaigns ) considered his greatest speech of the 1957 race , and which Newman considered the turning point of Diefenbaker 's campaign . Diefenbaker stated , " I give this assurance to Canadians — that the government shall be the servant and not the master of the people ... The road of the Liberal party , unless it is stopped — and Howe has said , " Who 's going to stop us ? " — will lead to the virtual extinction of parliamentary government . You will have the form , but the substance will be gone . " 
 The Liberal @-@ leaning Winnipeg Free Press , writing shortly after Diefenbaker 's speeches in British Columbia , commented on them : 
 Facts were overwhelmed with sound , passion substituted for arithmetic , moral indignation pumped up to the bursting point . But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election ... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister , though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour ... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest , the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity , the little guy fighting for his rights . 
 So far as the crowds mean anything , that posture is a brilliant success at one @-@ night stands . 
 On June 6 , the two major party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock , Ontario . Speaking in the afternoon , St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200 . To the shock of St. Laurent staffers , who remained for the Diefenbaker appearance , the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening , even though he was an hour late , with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or shake his hand . 
 Diefenbaker 's intensive campaign exhausted the handful of national reporters who followed him . Clark Davey of The Globe and Mail stated , " We did not know how he did it . " Reporters thought the Progressive Conservatives might , at best , gain 30 or 35 seats over the 53 they had at dissolution , and when Diefenbaker , off the record , told the reporters that the Tories would win 97 seats ( which would still allow the Liberals to form the government ) , they concluded he was guilty of wishful thinking . Diefenbaker was even more confident in public ; after he concluded his national tour and returned to his constituency , he addressed his final rally in Nipawin , Saskatchewan : " On Monday , I 'll be Prime Minister . " 
 = = = Liberal = = = 
 St. Laurent was utterly confident of an election victory , so much so that he did not even bother to fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate . He had been confident of re @-@ election when Drew led the Tories , and , according to Liberal minister Lionel Chevrier , Diefenbaker 's victory in the party leadership race increased his confidence by a factor of ten . At his press conference detailing his election tour , St. Laurent stated , " I have no doubt about the election outcome . " He indicated that his campaign would open April 29 in Winnipeg , and that the Prime Minister would spend ten days in Western Canada before moving east . However , he indicated he would first go home to Quebec City for several days around Easter ( April 21 in 1957 ) . This break kept him out of the limelight for ten days at a time when Diefenbaker was already actively campaigning and making daily headlines . At a campaign stop in Jarvis , Ontario , St. Laurent told an aide that he was afraid the right @-@ wing , anti @-@ Catholic Social Credit Party would be the next Opposition . St. Laurent denied Opposition claims that he would resign after an election victory , and the 75 @-@ year @-@ old indicated that he planned to run again in 1961 , if he was still around . 
 The Liberals made no new , radical proposals during their campaign , but instead ran a quiet campaign with occasional attacks on the opposition parties . They were convinced that the public still supported their party , and that no expensive promises need be made to voters . St. Laurent was made the image of the nation 's prosperity , and the Liberals refused to admit any reason for discontent existed . When Minister of Finance Harris proposed raising the upcoming increase in old age pension by an additional four dollars a month , St. Laurent refused to consider it , feeling that the increase had been calculated on the basis of the available facts , and those facts had not changed . 
 During the Prime Minister 's Western swing , St. Laurent made formal speeches only in major cities . In contrast to Diefenbaker 's whistle @-@ stop train touring , with a hasty speech in each town as the train passed through , the Liberals allowed ample time for " Uncle Louis " to shake hands with voters , pat their children on the head , and kiss their babies . In British Columbia , St. Laurent took the position that there were hardly any national issues worth discussing — the Liberals had brought Canada prosperity and all that was needed for more of the same was to return the party to office . After touring Western Canada , St. Laurent spent the remainder of the second week of the campaign returning to , and in , Ottawa . The third week opened with a major speech in Quebec City , followed by intensive campaigning in Ontario . The fifth week was devoted to the Maritime provinces and Eastern Quebec . The sixth week opened with a major rally in Ottawa , before St. Laurent returned to the Maritimes and Quebec , and the final week was spent in Ontario before St. Laurent returned to his hometown of Quebec City for the election . 
 St. Laurent tried to project an image as a family man , and to that end often addressed schoolchildren . As he had in previous elections , he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics . The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope , Ontario . With the children inattentive , some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face , St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss if they did not pay attention , as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his . 
 St. Laurent and the Liberals suffered other problems during the campaign . According to Newman , St. Laurent sometimes seemed unaware of what was happening around him , and at one campaign stop , shook hands with the reporters who were following him , under the apparent impression they were local voters . On the evening of Diefenbaker 's Vancouver speech , St. Laurent drew 400 voters to a rally in Sherbrooke , Quebec , where he had once lived . C.D. Howe , under heavy pressure from the campaign of CCF candidate Doug Fisher in his Ontario riding , intimated that Fisher had communist links . At a rally in Manitoba , Howe offended a voter who told him the farmers were starving to death , poking the voter in the stomach and saying " Looks like you 've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government . " At another rally , Howe dismissed a persistent Liberal questioner , saying " Look here , my good man , when the election comes , why don 't you just go away and vote for the party you support ? In fact , why don 't you just go away ? " 
 The Liberals concluded their campaign with a large rally at Toronto 's Maple Leaf Gardens on June 7 . Entertainment at the event was provided by the Leslie Bell singers , and according to Grosart , many in the audience were Tory supporters who had turned out to hear them . St. Laurent 's speech at the rally was interrupted when William Hatton , a 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy from Malton , Ontario , climbed onto the platform . Hatton carried a banner reading , " This Can 't Be Canada " with a Liberal placard bearing St. Laurent 's photograph , and moved to face the Prime Minister . Meisel describes Hatton as an " otherwise politically apathetic boy who ... slowly and deliberately tore up a photograph of the Prime Minister as the latter was speaking " and states that Hatton engaged in " intensely provocative behavior " . Liberal partisans interceded , and in the ensuing fracas , Hatton fell from the platform , audibly hitting his head on the concrete floor . St. Laurent watched in apparent shock , according to his biographer Dale Tompson , as officials aided the boy and took him from the hall . According to Tompson , the crowd " turned its indignation on the men on the platform " and spent the remainder of the evening wondering about the boy 's possible injuries rather than listening to the Prime Minister 's speech . Hatton was not seriously injured , but , according to Newman , " the accident added to the image of the Liberal Party as an unrepentant arrogant group of old men , willing to ride roughshod over voters " . Grosart later described the incident as " the turning point " of the campaign . Professor Meisel speculated that the Hatton incident might have been part of an organized campaign to annoy St. Laurent out of his pleasant " Uncle Louis " persona , and Grosart later related that Liberal frontbencher Jack Pickersgill always accused him of being behind the boy 's actions , but that the incident was " a sheer accident " . Hatton 's mother described his actions as " [ j ] ust a schoolboy prank , " and a reaction to reading an article about how the art of heckling was dying . According to public relations executive J.G. Johnston in a letter to Diefenbaker on June 10 , Hatton had come to the rally with several other boys , including Johnston 's son , but had gone off on his own while the other boys paraded with Diefenbaker posters which had been smuggled inside . According to Johnston , Hatton was caught on CBC tape saying to St. Laurent , " I can no longer stand your hypocrisy , Sir " before tearing the St. Laurent poster . Attempts by Johnston to have the Liberal activist who pushed Hatton off the platform arrested failed , according to Johnston , on the ground that the police could find no witnesses . 
 = = = CCF = = = 
 The CCF was a socialist party , which had much of its strength in Saskatchewan , though it ran candidates in several other provinces . At Parliament 's dissolution in April 1957 , it had 23 MPs , from five different provinces . Aside from the Liberals and the Tories , it was the only party to nominate a candidate in a majority of the ridings . In 1957 , the party was led by Saskatchewan MP M.J. Coldwell . 
 In 1956 , the party adopted the Winnipeg Declaration , a far more moderate proposal than its previous governing document , the 1933 Regina Manifesto . For example , the Regina Manifesto pledged the CCF to the eradication of capitalism ; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business , and stated that the government should own business only when it was in the public interest . In its election campaign , the CCF did not promise to nationalize any industries . It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the redistribution of wealth in Canada . It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax , to allow medical expenses to be considered deductions from income for tax purposes , and to eliminate sales tax on food , clothing , and other necessities of life . It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate dividends . 
 The CCF represented many agricultural areas in the Commons , and it proposed several measures to assure financial security for farmers . It proposed national growers ' cooperatives for agricultural products which were exported . It proposed cash advances for farm @-@ stored wheat , short and long term loans for farmers at low interest rates , and government support of prices , to assure the farmer a full income even in bad years . For the Atlantic fisherman , the CCF proposed cash advances at the start of the fishing season and government @-@ owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices . 
 Coldwell suffered from a heart condition , and undertook a much less ambitious schedule than the major party leaders . The party leader left Ottawa for his riding , Rosetown — Biggar in Saskatchewan , on April 26 , and remained there until May 10 . He spent three days campaigning in Ontario , then moved west to the major cities of the prairie provinces and British Columbia , before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election . Other CCF leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the Maritimes . 
 = = = Social Credit = = = 
 By 1957 , the Social Credit Party of Canada had moved far afield from the theories of social credit economics , which its candidates rarely mentioned . Canada 's far @-@ right party , the Socreds were led by Solon Low , though its Alberta leader , Premier Ernest Manning , was highly influential in the party . The Socreds ' election programme was based on the demand " that Government get out of business and make way for private enterprise " and on their hatred of " all government @-@ inspired schemes to degrade man and make him subservient to the state or any monopoly " . 
 The Socreds proposed an increase in the old age pension to $ 100 per month . They called for the reversal of the government 's tight money policies , and for low income loans for small business and farmers . It asked for income tax exemptions to be increased to meet the cost of living , and a national housing programme to make home ownership possible for every Canadian family . The party called for a national security policy based on the need for defence , rather than " aggression " , and for a foreign policy which would include food aid to the less @-@ developed nations . 
 The Socreds also objected to the CBC and other spending in the arts and broadcasting . The party felt that the government should solve economic problems before spending money on the arts . 
 Low challenged the Prime Minister over the Suez issue , accusing him of sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets the opportunity for a military buildup in Egypt . St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth . Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge , and selected the only living former Prime Minister , Tory Arthur Meighen , but the matter was not resolved before the election , and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election 's aftermath . 
 The Social Credit Party was weakened by considerable conflict between its organizations in the two provinces it controlled , Alberta and British Columbia . It failed to establish a strong national office to run the campaign due to infighting between the two groups . However , it was better financed than the CCF , due to its popularity among business groups in the West . 
 The Socreds hoped to establish themselves in Ontario , and scheduled their opening rally for Massey Hall in Toronto . The rally was a failure , and even though it ran 40 candidates in Ontario ( up from 9 in 1953 ) , the party won no seats in the province . 
 = = = Use of television = = = 
 In 1957 , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation gave the four recognized parties free air time for political statements . The television broadcasts 's audio tracks served also for use on radio . The three opposition parties gave their party leader all of the broadcast time , though Diefenbaker , who did not speak French well , played only a limited role in the Tories ' French @-@ language broadcasts . In one , he introduced party president Léon Balcer , a Quebecer , who gave the speech . Diefenbaker had no objection to makeup and , according to Meisel , was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective . A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders . 
 According to Liberal minister Paul Martin Sr. ( the father of the future Prime Minister ) , St. Laurent had the potential to be quite good on television , but disliked the medium . He was prejudiced against television appearances , considering such speeches the equivalent of carefully planned performances , such as stage shows . He refused to be made up for the telecasts , and insisted on reading his speech from a script . His advisers switched him to a teleprompter , but this failed to make his performances more relaxed . When reading , he would rarely look at the camera . However , St. Laurent made only occasional television appearances ( three in each language ) , letting his ministers make the remainder . Only one cabinet member , Minister of National Defence Ralph <unk> took advantage of the course in television techniques offered by the Liberal Party in a dummy studio in its Ottawa headquarters . This lack of preparation , according to Meisel , led to " a fiasco " during a television address by Minister of Justice Stuart Garson in early June when the teleprompter stopped working during the speech and Garson " was unable to cope effectively with the failure " . 
 = = Election = = 
 Most predictions had the Tories picking up seats , but the Liberals maintaining a majority . The New York Times reported that Liberals expected to lose a majority of Ontario 's seats , but retain a narrow majority in the House of Commons . Time magazine predicted a Tory gain of 20 to 40 seats and stated that any result which denied the Liberals 133 seats and a majority " would rank as a major upset " . Beck indicates that many journalists , including those sympathetic to the Tories , saw signs of the coming upset , but disregarded them , convinced that the government was invulnerable . Maclean 's , which printed its <unk> issue before the election to go on sale the morning after , ran an editorial noting that Canadians had freely chosen to reelect the Liberal Party . 
 On Election Night , the first returns came in from Sable Island , Nova Scotia . Usually a Liberal stronghold , the handful of residents there favoured the Tories by two votes . St. Laurent listened to the election returns on a radio in the living room of his home on Grande Allée in Quebec City , and when the radio broke , moved to an upstairs television set . Diefenbaker began the evening at his house in Prince Albert , and once his re @-@ election to the Commons was certain , moved to his local campaign headquarters . 
 The Conservatives did well in Atlantic Canada , gaining two seats in Newfoundland and nine in Nova Scotia , and sweeping Prince Edward Island 's four seats . However , in Quebec , they gained only five seats as the province returned 62 Liberals . The Tories gained 29 seats in Ontario . Howe was defeated by Fisher , and told the media that some strange disease was sweeping the country , but as for him , he was going to bed . The Liberals still led by a narrow margin as the returns began to come in from Manitoba , and St. Laurent told Liberal minister Pickersgill that he hoped that the Tories would get at least one more seat than the Liberals so they could get out of an appalling situation . As the Tories forged ahead in Western Canada , Diefenbaker flew from Prince Albert to Regina to deliver a television address and shouted to Grosart as yet another cabinet minister was defeated , " Allister , how does the architect feel ? " Late that evening , St. Laurent went to the Château Frontenac hotel for a televised speech , delivered before fifty supporters . 
 The Tories finished with 112 seats to the Liberals ' 105 , while both the CCF and Social Credit gained seats in Western Canada and finished with 25 and 19 seats respectively . Nine cabinet ministers , including Howe , <unk> , Garson , <unk> and Harris were defeated . Though the Liberals outpolled the Tories by over 100 @,@ 000 votes , most of those votes were wasted running up huge margins in Quebec . St. Laurent could have constitutionally hung onto power until defeated in the House , but he chose not to , and John Diefenbaker took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21 , 1957 . 
 = = = Irregularities = = = 
 After the election , the Chief Electoral Officer reported to the Speaker of the House of Commons that " the general election appears to have been satisfactorily conducted in accordance with the procedure in the Canada Elections Act " . 
 There were , however , a number of irregularities . In the Toronto riding of St. Paul 's , four Liberal workers were convicted of various offences for adding almost five hundred names to the electoral register . One of the four was also convicted for two counts of perjury . While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate , former MP James Rooney , was not charged , Ontario Chief Justice James Chalmers <unk> , who investigated the matter , doubted that this could have been done without the candidate 's knowledge . 
 Various violations of law , including illicitly opening ballot boxes , illegal possession of ballots , and adding names to the electoral register , took place in twelve Quebec ridings . The RCMP felt it had enough evidence to prosecute in five ridings , and a total of twelve people were convicted . The offences did not affect the outcome of any races . 
 The election of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate . After a trial before the Yukon Territorial Court , that court voided the election , holding that enough ineligible people had been permitted to vote to affect the outcome , though the court noted that it was not the fault of the Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred . The Tory , Erik Nielsen , won the new election in December 1957 . 
 The election in one Ontario riding , Wellington South was postponed pursuant to statute after the death of the Liberal candidate and MP , Henry Alfred Hosking during the campaign . The Tory candidate , Alfred Hales , defeated Liberal David <unk> and CCF candidate Thomas Withers on July 15 , 1957 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The unexpected defeat of the Liberals was ascribed to various causes . The Ottawa Citizen stated that the defeat could be attributed to " the uneasy talk ... that the Liberals have been in too long . " Tom Kent of the Winnipeg Free Press , a future Liberal deputy minister , wrote that though the Liberal record had been the best in the democratic world , the party had failed miserably to explain it . Author and political scientist H.S. Ferns disagreed with Kent , stating that Kent 's view reflected the Liberal " assumption that ' Nobody 's going to shoot Santa Claus ' " and that Canadians in the 1957 election were motivated by things other than material interests . Peter <unk> cited the Progressive Conservative strategy in the 1957 and 1958 elections " as classics of ingenuity unequalled in Canadian political history . Much of the credit belongs to Diefenbaker himself ; at least some must go to Allister Grosart " . A survey taken of those who abandoned the Liberals in 1957 showed that 5 @.@ 1 % did so because of Suez , 38 @.@ 2 % because of the Pipeline Debate , 26 @.@ 7 % because of what they considered an inadequate increase in the old age pension , and 30 % because it was time for a change . 
 The results of the election surprised the civil service as much as it did the rest of the public . Civil servant and future Liberal minister Mitchell Sharp asked C.D. Howe 's replacement as Minister of Trade and Commerce , Gordon Churchill , not to come to the Ministry 's offices for several days as they were redecorating . Churchill later learned that the staff were moving files out . When Churchill finally came to the Ministry 's offices , he was met with what he termed " the coldest reception that I have ever received in my life " . The new Minister of Labour , Michael Starr , was ticketed three days in a row for parking in the minister 's spot . 
 St. Laurent resigned as leader of the Liberal Party on September 5 , 1957 , but agreed to stay on until a successor was elected . With a lame @-@ duck leader , the Liberals were ineffective in opposition . Paul Martin stated that " I 'm sure I never thought the day would come when [ Diefenbaker ] would ever be a member of a government , let alone head of it . When that happened , the world had come to an end as far as I was concerned . " In January 1958 , St. Laurent was succeeded by Lester Pearson . 
 Even in reporting the election result , newspapers suggested that Diefenbaker would soon call another election and seek a majority . Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton ( who would soon become Postmaster General under Diefenbaker ) predicted on the evening of June 10 that there would soon be another election , in which the Tories would do much better in Quebec . The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people , and Diefenbaker called a snap election . On March 31 , 1958 , the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats , taking 208 seats ( including fifty in Quebec ) to the Liberals ' 48 , with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit . 
 Michael Bliss , who wrote a survey of the Canadian Prime Ministers , alluded to Howe 's dismissive comments regarding the Tories as he summed up the 1957 election : 
 The pipeline debate of 1956 sparked a dramatic opposition stand on the importance of free parliamentary debate . Their arrogance did the Grits [ Liberals ] enormous damage , contributing heavily to the government 's problems in the 1957 general election . Under the glare of television cameras in that campaign , St. Laurent , Howe , and company now appeared to be a lot of wooden , tired old men who had lost touch with Canada . The voters decided to stop them .

 The X @-@ Files : The Album is a 1998 soundtrack album released to accompany the film The X @-@ Files . Released on June 2 , 1998 , the album features songs by various artists , including several who had contributed to the earlier album Songs in the Key of X : Music from and Inspired by the X @-@ Files , and consists mostly of cover versions or reworkings of earlier material . 
 The X @-@ Files : The Album received mostly positive criticism upon its release , and charted in several countries worldwide , recording a peak position of number 5 in New Zealand . 
 = = Production = = 
 Although The X @-@ Files : The Album is the soundtrack to the 1998 film The X @-@ Files , only one of the album 's songs — " Crystal Ship " by X — is actually heard during the film , briefly playing on a jukebox during a brief scene . The album 's producer , David Was , intended to match the film 's tone rather than using the songs as content , leading to several of the artists involved contributing material which would seem " uncharacteristically eerie " compared to their usual work . 
 Many of the songs on The X @-@ Files : The Album are cover versions or reworkings of earlier material — singer Sting collaborated with the group Aswad to perform a reggae cover of " Invisible Sun " , which he had earlier recorded with The Police ; Filter 's " One " is a rearrangement of a song made famous by Three Dog Night ; while Foo Fighters contributed a new version of their song " Walking After You " . All but one of the album 's tracks are exclusive to the soundtrack , with Björk 's " Hunter " having been previously released on the 1997 album Homogenic . Several of the artists on the album 's roster — Foo Fighters , Filter and Soul Coughing — had previously contributed material to Songs in the Key of X : Music from and Inspired by the X @-@ Files , the soundtrack album which accompanied the television series ; however , Chris Carter , creator of The X @-@ Files , stated before the album 's release that although " there are some similarities " between the records , " there are different artists and a different flavor " . 
 The inclusion of a track by the group Ween was spurred by fact that The X @-@ Files star David Duchovny had first met then @-@ wife Téa Leoni through their mutual appreciation for the group ; while The Cranberries were approached about contributing material after Carter saw them performing on a tour of the United States . The Filter cover of " One " was deliberately constructed by Was once he realized that Duchovny had ad @-@ libbed the song 's opening line during one of the film 's scenes . The album 's final track — a cover by Dust Brothers of Mark Snow 's opening theme for the television series — features a hidden track which plays after a period of silence . The track features a spoken word segment by Carter which explains the series ' overarching mythology up to the film 's release . 
 The European and Japanese releases include an extra track , " Tubular X " by Mike Oldfield . This is a variation of Mark Snow 's " The X @-@ Files Theme " incorporating elements of Oldfield 's Tubular Bells .

 The X @-@ Files : The Album has received generally positive reviews .

Erlewine felt that the album was more polished and well @-@ produced than Songs in the Key of X ; however , he noted that this came at the expense of the earlier record 's " quirky " and " off @-@ kilter " aesthetic . Erlewine singled out " Beacon Light " and " Hunter " as particular highlights of the album . Jim <unk> of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times rated the album one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four , finding the album to be predictable and " phone [ d ] in " ; he highlighted the songs by Filter , Foo Fighters , Björk and Ween to be particular low points for him . 
 Writing for Entertainment Weekly , David Brown rated the album a B − , finding that it " isn ’ t eccentric enough " compared to the film or series . Browne found that the contributions by Noel Gallagher and Ween matched the tone of The X @-@ Files , but felt that Tonic , Filter , Sting and Aswad had been included out of commercial rather than artistic interest . Keith Phipps of the The A.V. Club considered the soundtrack to be less interesting than the accompanying film score , finding the album 's roster to be formulaic and several of its tracks to not be particularly " revelatory " or " radical " . 
 = Planets beyond Neptune = 
 Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846 , there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit . The search began in the mid @-@ 19th century and culminated at the start of the 20th with Percival Lowell 's quest for Planet X. Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets , particularly Uranus and Neptune , speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities . 
 Clyde Tombaugh 's discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell 's hypothesis , and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet . In 1978 , Pluto was conclusively determined to be too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets , resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet . The search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s , when a study of measurements made by the Voyager 2 spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in Uranus 's orbit were due to a slight overestimation of Neptune 's mass . After 1992 , the discovery of numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet , or whether it and its neighbours should , like the asteroids , be given their own separate classification . Although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets , in 2006 the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets , leaving Neptune the farthest known planet in the Solar System . 
 While today the astronomical community widely agrees that Planet X , as originally envisioned , does not exist , the concept of an as @-@ yet @-@ unobserved planet has been revived by a number of astronomers to explain other anomalies observed in the outer Solar System . As of March 2014 , observations with the WISE telescope have ruled out the possibility of a Saturn @-@ sized object ( 95 Earth mass ) out to 10 @,@ 000 AU , and a Jupiter @-@ sized or larger object out to 26 @,@ 000 AU . 
 In 2014 , based on similarities of the orbits of a group of recently discovered extreme trans @-@ Neptunian objects , astronomers hypothesized the existence of a super @-@ Earth planet , 2 to 15 times the mass of the Earth and beyond 200 AU with possibly a high inclined orbit at some 1500 AU . In 2016 further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely on an inclined , eccentric orbit that goes no closer than about 200 AU and no further than about 1600 AU from the Sun . The orbit is predicted to be anti @-@ aligned to the clustered extreme trans @-@ Neptunian objects . Because Pluto is no longer considered a planet by the International Astronomical Union , this new hypothetical object has become known as Planet Nine . 
 = = Early speculation = = 
 In the 1840s , the French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to analyse perturbations in the orbit of Uranus , and hypothesised that they were caused by the gravitational pull of a yet @-@ undiscovered planet . Le Verrier predicted the position of this new planet and sent his calculations to German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle . On 23 September 1846 , the night following his receipt of the letter , Galle and his student Heinrich d <unk> discovered Neptune , exactly where Le Verrier had predicted . There remained some slight discrepancies in the giant planets ' orbits . These were taken to indicate the existence of yet another planet orbiting beyond Neptune . 
 Even before Neptune 's discovery , some speculated that one planet alone was not enough to explain the discrepancy . On 17 November 1834 , the British amateur astronomer the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy , the British Astronomer Royal . Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet , Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him , and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen , director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha , about the subject . Hansen 's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus , and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus . 
 In 1848 , Jacques <unk> raised an objection to Le Verrier 's calculations , claiming that Neptune 's observed mass was smaller and its orbit larger than Le Verrier had initially predicted . He postulated , based largely on simple subtraction from Le Verrier 's calculations , that another planet of roughly 12 Earth masses , which he named " Hyperion " , must exist beyond Neptune . Le Verrier denounced <unk> 's hypothesis , saying , " [ There is ] absolutely nothing by which one could determine the position of another planet , barring hypotheses in which imagination played too large a part . " 
 In 1850 James Ferguson , Assistant Astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory , noted that he had " lost " a star he had observed , <unk> , which Lt. Matthew Maury , the superintendent of the Observatory , claimed was evidence that it must be a new planet . Subsequent searches failed to recover the " planet " in a different position , and in 1878 , CHF Peters , director of the Hamilton College Observatory in New York , showed that the star had not in fact vanished , and that the previous results had been due to human error . 
 In 1879 , Camille Flammarion noted that the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49 AU , respectively , suggesting that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit . Astronomer Georges Forbes concluded on the basis of this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune . He calculated , based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100 AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300 AU , the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans @-@ Neptunian planets . These elements <unk> suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd , suggesting to many that they might be valid . However , sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results . 
 In 1900 and 1901 , Harvard College Observatory director William Henry Pickering led two searches for trans @-@ Neptunian planets . The first was begun by Danish astronomer Hans Emil Lau who , after studying the data on the orbit of Uranus from 1690 to 1895 , concluded that one trans @-@ Neptunian planet alone could not account for the discrepancies in its orbit , and postulated the position of two planets he believed were responsible . The second was launched when Gabriel Dallet suggested that a single trans @-@ Neptunian planet lying at 47 AU could account for the motion of Uranus . Pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets . In neither case were any found . 
 In 1909 , Thomas Jefferson Jackson See , an astronomer with a reputation as an egocentric contrarian , opined " that there is certainly one , most likely two and possibly three planets beyond Neptune " . Tentatively naming the first planet " Oceanus " , he placed their respective distances at 42 , 56 and 72 AU from the Sun . He gave no indication as to how he determined their existence , and no known searches were mounted to locate them . 
 In 1911 , Indian astronomer Venkatesh P. Ketakar suggested the existence of two trans @-@ Neptunian planets , which he named Brahma and Vishnu , by reworking the patterns observed by Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace in the planetary satellites of Jupiter and applying them to the outer planets . The three inner Galilean moons of Jupiter , Io , Europa and Ganymede , are locked in a complicated 1 : 2 : 4 resonance called a Laplace resonance . Ketakar suggested that Uranus , Neptune and his hypothetical trans @-@ Neptunian planets were locked in Laplace @-@ like resonances . His calculations predicted a mean distance for Brahma of 38 @.@ 95 AU and an orbital period of 242 @.@ 28 Earth years ( 3 : 4 resonance with Neptune ) . When Pluto was discovered 19 years later , its mean distance of 39 @.@ 48 AU and orbital period of 248 Earth years were close to Ketakar 's prediction ( Pluto in fact has a 2 : 3 resonance with Neptune ) . Ketakar made no predictions for the orbital elements other than mean distance and period . It is not clear how Ketakar arrived at these figures , and his second planet , Vishnu , was never located . 
 = = Planet X = = 
 In 1894 , with the help of William Pickering , Percival Lowell , a wealthy Bostonian , founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona . In 1906 , convinced he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus 's orbit , he began an extensive project to search for a trans @-@ Neptunian planet , which he named Planet X. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter , as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 ( at the time , Planet X would have been the ninth planet ) . Lowell 's hope in tracking down Planet X was to establish his scientific credibility , which had eluded him thanks to his widely derided belief that channel @-@ like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization . 
 Lowell 's first search focused on the ecliptic , the plane encompassed by the zodiac where the other planets in the Solar System lie . Using a 5 @-@ inch photographic camera , he manually examined over 200 three @-@ hour exposures with a magnifying glass , and found no planets . At that time Pluto was too far above the ecliptic to be imaged by the survey . After revising his predicted possible locations , Lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916 . In 1915 , he published his Memoir of a Trans @-@ Neptunian Planet , in which he concluded that Planet X had a mass roughly seven times that of Earth — about half that of Neptune — and a mean distance from the Sun of 43 AU . He assumed Planet X would be a large , low @-@ density object with a high albedo , like the giant planets . As a result , it would show a disc with diameter of about one arcsecond and an apparent magnitude of between 12 and 13 — bright enough to be spotted . 
 Separately , in 1908 , Pickering announced that , by analysing irregularities in Uranus 's orbit , he had found evidence for a ninth planet . His hypothetical planet , which he termed " Planet O " ( because it came after " N " , i.e. Neptune ) , possessed a mean orbital radius of 51 @.@ 9 AU and an orbital period of 373 @.@ 5 years . Plates taken at his observatory in Arequipa , Peru , showed no evidence for the predicted planet , and British astronomer P. H. Cowell showed that the irregularities observed in Uranus 's orbit virtually disappeared once the planet 's displacement of longitude was taken into account . Lowell himself , despite his close association with Pickering , dismissed Planet O out of hand , saying , " This planet is very properly designated " O " , [ for it ] is nothing at all . " Unbeknownst to Pickering , four of the photographic plates taken in the search for " Planet O " by astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1919 captured images of Pluto , though this was only recognised years later . Pickering went on to suggest many other possible trans @-@ Neptunian planets up to the year 1932 , which he named P , Q , R , S , T and U ; none were ever detected . 
 = = = Discovery of Pluto = = = 
 Lowell 's sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. Failing to find the planet , according to one friend , " virtually killed him " . Lowell 's widow , Constance , engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over Lowell 's legacy which halted the search for Planet X for several years . In 1925 , the observatory obtained glass discs for a new 13 in ( 33 cm ) wide @-@ field telescope to continue the search , constructed with funds from Abbott Lawrence Lowell , Percival 's brother . In 1929 the observatory 's director , Vesto Melvin Slipher , summarily handed the job of locating the planet to Clyde Tombaugh , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings . 
 Tombaugh 's task was to systematically capture sections of the night sky in pairs of images . Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart . He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator , which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body . To reduce the chances that a faster @-@ moving ( and thus closer ) object be mistaken for the new planet , Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point , 180 degrees from the Sun , where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth 's orbit is at its strongest . He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate . Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac , rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell . 
 By the beginning of 1930 , Tombaugh 's search had reached the constellation of Gemini . On 18 February 1930 , after searching for nearly a year and examining nearly 2 million stars , Tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year . A lesser @-@ quality photograph taken on January 21 confirmed the movement . Upon confirmation , Tombaugh walked into Slipher 's office and declared , " Doctor Slipher , I have found your Planet X. " The object lay just six degrees from one of two locations for Planet X Lowell had suggested ; thus it seemed he had at last been vindicated . After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs , news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13 , 1930 . The new object was later <unk> on photographs dating back to 19 March 1915 . The decision to name the object Pluto was intended in part to honour Percival Lowell , as his initials made up the word 's first two letters . After discovering Pluto , Tombaugh continued to search the ecliptic for other distant objects . He found hundreds of variable stars and asteroids , as well as two comets , but no further planets . 
 = = = Pluto loses Planet X title = = = 
 To the observatory 's disappointment and surprise , Pluto showed no visible disc ; it appeared as a point , no different from a star , and , at only 15th magnitude , was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted , which meant it was either very small , or very dark . Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets , they assumed that it should have an albedo of 0 @.@ 07 ( meaning that it reflected only 7 % of the light that hit it ) ; about as dark as asphalt and similar to that of Mercury , the least reflective planet known . This would give Pluto an assumed diameter of about 8 @,@ 000 km , or about 60 % that of Earth . Observations also revealed that Pluto 's orbit was very elliptical , far more than that of any other planet . 
 Almost immediately , some astronomers questioned Pluto 's status as a planet . Barely a month after its discovery was announced , on 14 April 1930 , in an article in the New York Times , Armin O. Leuschner suggested that Pluto 's dimness and high orbital eccentricity made it more similar to an asteroid or comet : " The Lowell result confirms the possible high eccentricity announced by us on April 5 . Among the possibilities are a large asteroid greatly disturbed in its orbit by close approach to a major planet such as Jupiter , or it may be one of many long @-@ period planetary objects yet to be discovered , or a bright cometary object . " In that same article , Harvard Observatory director Harlow Shapley wrote that Pluto was a " member of the Solar System not comparable with known asteroids and comets , and perhaps of greater importance to cosmogony than would be another major planet beyond Neptune . " In 1931 , using a mathematical formula , Ernest W. Brown asserted ( in agreement with E. C. Bower ) , that the presumed irregularities in the orbit of Uranus could not be due to the gravitational effect of a more distant planet , and thus that Lowell 's supposed prediction was " purely accidental " . 
 Throughout the mid @-@ 20th century , estimates of Pluto 's mass were revised downward . In 1931 , Nicholson and Mayall calculated its mass , based on its supposed effect on the giant planets , as roughly that of Earth ; a value somewhat in accord with the 0 @.@ 91 Earth mass calculated in 1942 by Lloyd R. Wylie at the US Naval Observatory , using the same assumptions . In 1949 , Gerard Kuiper 's measurements of Pluto 's diameter with the 200 inch telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory led him to the conclusion that it was midway in size between Mercury and Mars and that its mass was most probably about 0 @.@ 1 Earth mass . 
 In 1973 , Dennis Rawlins conjectured , based on the similarities in the periodicity and amplitude of brightness variation between Pluto and Neptune 's moon Triton , that Pluto 's mass must be similar to Triton 's . This is , in fact , true , and had been argued by astronomers Walter Baade and E. C. Bower as early as 1934 . However , because Triton 's mass was then believed to be roughly 2 @.@ 5 % that of the Earth – Moon system ( more than ten times its actual value ) , Rawlins 's determination for Pluto 's mass was similarly incorrect . It was nonetheless a meagre enough value for him to conclude that Pluto was not Planet X. In 1976 , Dale Cruikshank , Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the University of Hawaii analysed spectra from Pluto 's surface and determined that it must contain methane ice , which is highly reflective . This meant that Pluto , far from being dark , was in fact exceptionally bright , and thus was probably no more than 0 @.@ 01 Earth mass . 
 Pluto 's size was finally determined conclusively in 1978 , when American astronomer James W. Christy discovered its moon Charon . This enabled him , together with Robert Sutton Harrington of the U.S. Naval Observatory , to measure the mass of the Pluto – Charon system directly by observing the moon 's orbital motion around Pluto . They determined Pluto 's mass to be 1 @.@ 31 × 1022 kg ; roughly one five @-@ hundredth that of Earth or one @-@ sixth that of the Moon , and far too small to account for the observed discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets . Lowell 's " prediction " had been a coincidence : If there was a Planet X , it was not Pluto . 
 = = = Further searches for Planet X = = = 
 After 1978 , a number of astronomers kept up the search for Lowell 's Planet X , convinced that , because Pluto was no longer a viable candidate , an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing the outer planets . 
 In the 1980s and 1990s , Robert Harrington led a search to determine the real cause of the apparent irregularities . He calculated that any Planet X would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun ; its orbit would be highly eccentric , and strongly inclined to the ecliptic — the planet 's orbit would be at roughly a 32 @-@ degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets . This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception . Noted Planet X sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier , and could easily be due to observational error . 
 In 1972 , Joseph Brady of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied irregularities in the motion of Halley 's Comet . Brady claimed that they could have been caused by a Jupiter @-@ sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a retrograde orbit around the Sun . However , both Marsden and Planet X proponent P. Kenneth <unk> attacked the hypothesis , showing that Halley 's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material , causing changes to its own orbital trajectory , and that such a massive object as Brady 's Planet X would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets . 
 Although its mission did not involve a search for Planet X , the IRAS space observatory made headlines briefly in 1983 due to an " unknown object " that was at first described as " possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this Solar System " . Further analysis revealed that of several unidentified objects , nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was " interstellar cirrus " ; none were found to be Solar System bodies . 
 In 1988 , A. A. Jackson and R. M. Killen studied the stability of Pluto 's resonance with Neptune by placing test " Planet X @-@ es " with various masses and at various distances from Pluto . Pluto and Neptune 's orbits are in a 3 : 2 resonance , which prevents their collision or even any close approaches , regardless of their separation in the z axis . It was found that the hypothetical object 's mass had to exceed 5 Earth masses to break the resonance , and the parameter space is quite large and a large variety of objects could have existed beyond Pluto without disturbing the resonance . Four test orbits of a trans @-@ Plutonian planet have been integrated forward for four million years in order to determine the effects of such a body on the stability of the Neptune – Pluto 3 : 2 resonance . Planets beyond Pluto with masses of 0 @.@ 1 and 1 @.@ 0 Earth masses in orbits at 48 @.@ 3 and 75 @.@ 5 AU , respectively , do not disturb the 3 : 2 resonance . Test planets of 5 Earth masses with semi @-@ major axes of 52 @.@ 5 and 62 @.@ 5 AU disrupt the four @-@ million @-@ year libration of Pluto 's argument of perihelion . 
 = = = Planet X disproved = = = 
 Harrington died in January 1993 , without having found Planet X. Six months before , E. Myles Standish had used data from Voyager 2 's 1989 flyby of Neptune , which had revised the planet 's total mass downward by 0 @.@ 5 % — an amount comparable to the mass of Mars — to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus . When Neptune 's newly determined mass was used in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental <unk> ( JPL DE ) , the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit , and with them the need for a Planet X , vanished . There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10 , Pioneer 11 , Voyager 1 , and Voyager 2 that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System . Today , most astronomers agree that Planet X , as Lowell defined it , does not exist . 
 = = Discovery of further trans @-@ Neptunian objects = = 
 After the discovery of Pluto and Charon , no more trans @-@ Neptunian objects ( TNOs ) were found until ( 15760 ) 1992 QB1 in 1992 . Since then , thousands of such objects have been discovered . Most are now recognized as part of the Kuiper belt , a swarm of icy bodies left over from the Solar System 's formation that orbit near the ecliptic plane just beyond Neptune . Though none were as large as Pluto , some of these distant trans @-@ Neptunian objects , such as Sedna , were initially described in the media as " new planets " . 
 In 2005 , astronomer Mike Brown and his team announced the discovery of 2003 UB313 ( later named Eris after the Greek goddess of discord and strife ) , a trans @-@ Neptunian object then thought to be just barely larger than Pluto . Soon afterwards , a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory press release described the object as the " tenth planet " . 
 Eris was never officially classified as a planet , and the 2006 definition of planet defined both Eris and Pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets because they have not cleared their neighbourhoods . They do not orbit the Sun alone , but as part of a population of similarly sized objects . Pluto itself is now recognized as being a member of the Kuiper belt and the largest dwarf planet , larger than the more @-@ massive Eris . 
 A number of astronomers , most notably Alan Stern , the head of NASA 's New Horizons mission to Pluto , contend that the IAU 's definition is flawed , and that Pluto and Eris , and all large trans @-@ Neptunian objects , such as Makemake , Sedna , Quaoar , Varuna and Haumea , should be considered planets in their own right . However , the discovery of Eris did not rehabilitate the Planet X theory because it is far too small to have significant effects on the outer planets ' orbits . 
 = = Subsequently proposed trans @-@ Neptunian planets = = 
 Although most astronomers accept that Lowell 's Planet X does not exist , a number have revived the idea that a large unseen planet could create observable gravitational effects in the outer Solar System . These hypothetical objects are often referred to as " Planet X " , although the conception of these objects may differ considerably from that proposed by Lowell . 
 = = = Orbits of distant objects = = = 
 Sedna 's orbit 
 When Sedna was discovered , its extreme orbit raised questions about its origin . Its perihelion is so distant ( approximately 75 AU ) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna 's eccentric distant orbit . It is too far from the planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected by outside forces such as the galactic tides . Hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star , that it was captured from another planetary system , or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans @-@ Neptunian planet . The most obvious solution to determining Sedna 's peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region , whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their past history . If Sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans @-@ Neptunian planet , any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to Sedna ( around 80 AU ) . 
 Elongated orbits of group of Kuiper belt objects 
 In 2012 , Rodney Gomes modelled the orbits of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted . He concluded that the simplest explanation was the gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion , such as a Neptune @-@ sized object at 1500 AU or a Mars @-@ sized object at around 53 AU . 
 Discovery of 2012 VP113 and the orbital clustering of Kuiper belt objects 
 In 2014 , astronomers announced the discovery of 2012 VP113 , a large object with a Sedna @-@ like 4200 @-@ year orbit and a perihelion of roughly 80 AU , which led them to suggest that it offered evidence of a potential trans @-@ Neptunian planet . Trujillo and Sheppard argued that the orbital clustering of arguments of perihelia for VP113 and other extremely distant TNOs suggests the existence of a " super @-@ Earth " of between 2 and 15 Earth masses beyond 200 AU and possibly on an inclined orbit at 1500 AU . 
 In 2014 astronomers at the Universidad Complutense in Madrid suggested that the available data actually indicate more than one trans @-@ Neptunian planet . 
 Further analysis & Planet Nine hypothesis 
 On January 20 , 2016 , Brown and Konstantin Batygin published an article corroborating Trujillo and Sheppard 's initial findings ; proposing a super @-@ Earth ( dubbed Planet Nine ) based on a statistical clustering of the arguments of perihelia ( noted before ) near zero and also ascending nodes near 113 ° of six distant trans @-@ Neptunian objects . They estimated it to be ten times the mass of Earth ( about 60 % the mass of Neptune ) with a semimajor axis of approximately 400 – 1500 AU . 
 = = = Probability = = = 
 Even without gravitational evidence , Mike Brown , the discoverer of Sedna , has argued that Sedna 's 12 @,@ 000 @-@ year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an Earth @-@ sized object exists beyond Neptune . Sedna 's orbit is so eccentric that it spends only a small fraction of its orbital period near the Sun , where it can be easily observed . This means that unless its discovery was a freak accident , there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly Sedna 's diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region . Mike Brown noted that " Sedna is about three @-@ quarters the size of Pluto . If there are sixty objects three @-@ quarters the size of Pluto [ out there ] then there are probably forty objects the size of Pluto ... If there are forty objects the size of Pluto , then there are probably ten that are twice the size of Pluto . There are probably three or four that are three times the size of Pluto , and the biggest of these objects ... is probably the size of Mars or the size of the Earth . " However , he notes that , should such an object be found , even though it might approach Earth in size , it would still be a dwarf planet by the current definition , because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently . 
 = = = Kuiper cliff = = = 
 Additionally , speculation of a possible trans @-@ Neptunian planet has revolved around the so @-@ called " Kuiper cliff " . The Kuiper belt terminates suddenly at a distance of 48 AU from the Sun . <unk> and Melita have speculated that this sudden drop @-@ off may be attributed to the presence of an object with a mass between that of Mars and Earth located beyond 48 AU . The presence of an object with a mass similar to that of Mars in a circular orbit at 60 AU leads to a trans @-@ Neptunian object population incompatible with observations . For instance , it would severely deplete the <unk> population . Astronomers have not excluded the possibility of an object with a mass similar to that of Earth located further than 100 AU with an eccentric and inclined orbit . Computer simulations by Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University have suggested that an object with a mass between 0 @.@ 3 and 0 @.@ 7 Earth masses , ejected outward by Neptune early in the Solar System 's formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 101 and 200 AU from the Sun , could explain the Kuiper cliff and the peculiar detached objects such as Sedna and 2012 VP113 . Although some astronomers , such as Renu Malhotra and David Jewitt , have cautiously supported these claims , others , such as Alessandro Morbidelli , have dismissed them as " contrived " .

 Tyche was a proposed gas giant to be located in the Solar System 's Oort cloud . It was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists John Matese , Patrick Whitman and Daniel Whitmire of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette . They argued that evidence of Tyche 's existence could be seen in a supposed bias in the points of origin for long @-@ period comets . In 2013 , Matese and Whitmire re @-@ evaluated the comet data and noted that Tyche , if it existed , would be detectable in the archive of data that was collected by NASA 's Wide @-@ field Infrared Survey Explorer ( WISE ) telescope . In 2014 , NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object with Tyche 's characteristics , indicating that Tyche as hypothesized by Matese , Whitman , and Whitmire does not exist . 
 The oligarch theory of planet formation states that there were hundreds of planet @-@ sized objects , known as oligarchs , in the early stages of the Solar System 's evolution . In 2005 , astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today , most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions . Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free @-@ floating planets , whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System , with orbital periods of millions of years . This halo would lie at between 1 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 AU from the Sun , or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud . 
 In December 2015 , astronomers at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array ( ALMA ) detected a brief series of 350 GHz pulses that they concluded must either be a series of independent sources , or a single , fast moving source . Deciding that the latter was the most likely , they calculated based on its speed that , were it bound to the Sun , the object , which they named " <unk> " after a fast @-@ moving messenger goddess in Norse mythology , would be about 12 – 25 AU distant and have a dwarf planet @-@ sized diameter of 220 to 880 km . However , if it were a rogue planet not gravitationally bound to the Sun , and as far away as 4000 AU , it could be much larger . The paper was never formally accepted , and has been withdrawn until the detection is confirmed . Scientists ' reactions to the notice were largely sceptical ; Mike Brown commented that , " If it is true that ALMA accidentally discovered a massive outer solar system object in its tiny , tiny , tiny , field of view , that would suggest that there are something like 200 @,@ 000 Earth @-@ sized planets in the outer solar system . Which , um , no ... Even better , I just realized that this many Earth @-@ sized planets existing would destabilize the entire solar system and we would all die . " 
 = = Constraints on additional planets = = 
 As of 2016 the following observations severely constrain the mass and distance of any possible additional Solar System planet : 
 An analysis of mid @-@ infrared observations with the WISE telescope have ruled out the possibility of a Saturn @-@ sized object ( 95 Earth masses ) out to 10 @,@ 000 AU , and a Jupiter @-@ sized or larger object out to 26 @,@ 000 AU . 
 Using modern data on the anomalous precession of the perihelia of Saturn , Earth , and Mars , Lorenzo Iorio concluded that any unknown planet with a mass of 0 @.@ 7 times that of Earth must be further than 350 – 400 AU ; one with a mass of 2 times that of Earth , further than 496 – 570 AU ; and finally one with a mass of 15 times that of Earth , further than 970 – 1111 AU . Moreover , Iorio stated that the modern ephemerides of the Solar System outer planets has provided even tighter constraints : no celestial body with a mass of 15 times that of Earth can exist closer than 1100 – 1300 AU . However , work by another group of astronomers using a more comprehensive model of the Solar System found that Iorio 's conclusion was only partially correct . Their analysis of Cassini data on Saturn 's orbital residuals found that observations were inconsistent with a planetary body with the orbit and mass similar to those of Batygin and Brown 's Planet Nine having a true anomaly of − 130 ° to − 110 ° or − 65 ° to 85 ° . Furthermore , the analysis found that Saturn 's orbit is slightly better explained if such a body is located at a true anomaly of 117 @.@ 8 ° + 11 ° 
 − 10 ° . At this location , it would be approximately 630 AU from the Sun .

 = Redshift = 
 In physics , redshift happens when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object is increased in wavelength , or shifted to the red end of the spectrum . In general , whether or not the radiation is within the visible spectrum , " redder " means an increase in wavelength – equivalent to a lower frequency and a lower photon energy , in accordance with , respectively , the wave and quantum theories of light . 
 Some redshifts are an example of the Doppler effect , familiar in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles . A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer . Another kind of redshift is cosmological redshift , which is due to the expansion of the universe , and sufficiently distant light sources ( generally more than a few million light years away ) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth . Finally , gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields . Conversely , a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light @-@ emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field . However , redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift . 
 Knowledge of redshifts and blueshifts has been applied to develop several terrestrial technologies such as Doppler radar and radar guns . Redshifts are also seen in the spectroscopic observations of astronomical objects . Its value is represented by the letter z . 
 A special relativistic redshift formula ( and its classical approximation ) can be used to calculate the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat . However , in many contexts , such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology , redshifts must be calculated using general relativity . Special relativistic , gravitational , and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws . There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation , including scattering and optical effects ; however , the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such ( see section on physical optics and radiative transfer ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of the subject began with the development in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect . The effect is named after Christian Doppler , who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842 . The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist <unk> Buys Ballot in 1845 . Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves , and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth . Before this was verified , however , it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star 's temperature , not motion . Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations . 
 The first Doppler redshift was described by French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau in 1848 , who pointed to the shift in spectral lines seen in stars as being due to the Doppler effect . The effect is sometimes called the " Doppler – Fizeau effect " . In 1868 , British astronomer William Huggins was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth by this method . In 1871 , optical redshift was confirmed when the phenomenon was observed in Fraunhofer lines using solar rotation , about 0 @.@ 1 Å in the red . In 1887 , Vogel and Scheiner discovered the annual Doppler effect , the yearly change in the Doppler shift of stars located near the ecliptic due to the orbital velocity of the Earth . In 1901 , <unk> <unk> verified optical redshift in the laboratory using a system of rotating mirrors . 
 The earliest occurrence of the term " red @-@ shift " in print ( in this hyphenated form ) appears to be by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1908 , in which he mentions " Two methods of investigating that nature of the nebular red @-@ shift " . The word does not appear <unk> until about 1934 by Willem de Sitter , perhaps indicating that up to that point its German equivalent , <unk> , was more commonly used . 
 Beginning with observations in 1912 , Vesto Slipher discovered that most spiral galaxies , then mostly thought to be spiral nebulae , had considerable redshifts . Slipher first reports on his measurement in the inaugural volume of the Lowell Observatory Bulletin . Three years later , he wrote a review in the journal Popular Astronomy . In it he states , " [ ... ] the early discovery that the great Andromeda spiral had the quite exceptional velocity of – 300 km ( / s ) showed the means then available , capable of investigating not only the spectra of the spirals but their velocities as well . " Slipher reported the velocities for 15 spiral nebulae spread across the entire celestial sphere , all but three having observable " positive " ( that is recessional ) velocities . Subsequently , Edwin Hubble discovered an approximate relationship between the redshifts of such " nebulae " and the distances to them with the formulation of his eponymous Hubble 's law . These observations corroborated Alexander Friedmann 's 1922 work , in which he derived the famous Friedmann @-@ Lemaître equations . They are today considered strong evidence for an expanding universe and the Big Bang theory . 
 = = Measurement , characterization , and interpretation = = 
 The spectrum of light that comes from a single source ( see idealized spectrum illustration top @-@ right ) can be measured . To determine the redshift , one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines , emission lines , or other variations in light intensity . If found , these features can be compared with known features in the spectrum of various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth . A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen . The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals . If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration ( top right ) . If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths , it can be identified as hydrogen too . If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra — but at different wavelengths — then the redshift can be calculated using the table below . Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a <unk> or wavelength @-@ range . In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source , in other words , the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source . Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly , because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest , the method using spectral lines described here is used instead . Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest @-@ frame frequency is unknown , or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise ( random fluctuations in a spectrum ) . 
 Redshift ( and blueshift ) may be characterized by the relative difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths ( or frequency ) of an object . In astronomy , it is customary to refer to this change using a dimensionless quantity called z . If λ represents wavelength and f represents frequency ( note , <unk> = c where c is the speed of light ) , then z is defined by the equations : 
 After z is measured , the distinction between redshift and blueshift is simply a matter of whether z is positive or negative . See the formula section below for some basic interpretations that follow when either a redshift or blueshift is observed . For example , Doppler effect blueshifts ( z < 0 ) are associated with objects approaching ( moving closer to ) the observer with the light shifting to greater energies . Conversely , Doppler effect redshifts ( z > 0 ) are associated with objects receding ( moving away ) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies . Likewise , gravitational blueshifts are associated with light emitted from a source residing within a weaker gravitational field as observed from within a stronger gravitational field , while gravitational redshifting implies the opposite conditions . 
 = = Redshift formulae = = 
 In general relativity one can derive several important special @-@ case formulae for redshift in certain special spacetime geometries , as summarized in the following table . In all cases the magnitude of the shift ( the value of z ) is independent of the wavelength . 
 = = = Doppler effect = = = 
 If a source of the light is moving away from an observer , then redshift ( z > 0 ) occurs ; if the source moves towards the observer , then blueshift ( z < 0 ) occurs . This is true for all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the Doppler effect . Consequently , this type of redshift is called the Doppler redshift . If the source moves away from the observer with velocity v , which is much less than the speed of light ( v ≪ c ) , the redshift is given by 
 <formula> ( since <formula> ) 
 where c is the speed of light . In the classical Doppler effect , the frequency of the source is not modified , but the recessional motion causes the illusion of a lower frequency . 
 A more complete treatment of the Doppler redshift requires considering relativistic effects associated with motion of sources close to the speed of light . A complete derivation of the effect can be found in the article on the relativistic Doppler effect . In brief , objects moving close to the speed of light will experience deviations from the above formula due to the time dilation of special relativity which can be corrected for by introducing the Lorentz factor γ into the classical Doppler formula as follows ( for motion solely in the line of sight ) : 
 <formula> 
 This phenomenon was first observed in a 1938 experiment performed by Herbert E. Ives and G.R. Stilwell , called the Ives – Stilwell experiment . 
 Since the Lorentz factor is dependent only on the magnitude of the velocity , this causes the redshift associated with the relativistic correction to be independent of the orientation of the source movement . In contrast , the classical part of the formula is dependent on the projection of the movement of the source into the line @-@ of @-@ sight which yields different results for different orientations . If θ is the angle between the direction of relative motion and the direction of emission in the observer 's frame ( zero angle is directly away from the observer ) , the full form for the relativistic Doppler effect becomes : 
 <formula> 
 and for motion solely in the line of sight ( θ 
 = 0 ° ) , this equation reduces to : 
 <formula> 
 For the special case that the light is approaching at right angles ( θ = 
 90 ° ) to the direction of relative motion in the observer 's frame , the relativistic redshift is known as the transverse redshift , and a redshift : 
 <formula> 
 is measured , even though the object is not moving away from the observer . Even when the source is moving towards the observer , if there is a transverse component to the motion then there is some speed at which the dilation just cancels the expected blueshift and at higher speed the approaching source will be redshifted . 
 = = = Expansion of space = = = 
 In the early part of the twentieth century , Slipher , Hubble and others made the first measurements of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the Milky Way . They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due solely to the Doppler effect , but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between the increasing redshifts and the increasing distance of galaxies . Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a different mechanism for producing redshifts . Hubble 's law of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by models of cosmology derived from general relativity that have a metric expansion of space . As a result , photons propagating through the expanding space are stretched , creating the cosmological redshift . 
 There is a distinction between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler @-@ effect redshift . Rather than cosmological redshifts being a consequence of relative velocities , the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a feature of the spacetime through which they are traveling that causes space to expand . Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase , the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 × 108 m / s , but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location ( which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance ) . 
 = = = = Mathematical derivation = = = = 
 The observational consequences of this effect can be derived using the equations from general relativity that describe a homogeneous and isotropic universe . 
 To derive the redshift effect , use the geodesic equation for a light wave , which is 
 <formula> 
 where 
 ds is the spacetime interval 
 dt is the time interval 
 dr is the spatial interval 
 c is the speed of light 
 a is the time @-@ dependent cosmic scale factor 
 k is the curvature per unit area . 
 For an observer observing the crest of a light wave at a position r

 <unk> , the crest of the light wave was emitted at a time t 
 = <unk> in the past and a distant position r = 
 R. Integrating over the path in both space and time that the light wave travels yields : 
 <formula> 
 In general , the wavelength of light is not the same for the two positions and times considered due to the changing properties of the metric . When the wave was emitted , it had a wavelength <unk> . The next crest of the light wave was emitted at a time 
 <formula> 
 The observer sees the next crest of the observed light wave with a wavelength <unk> to arrive at a time 
 <formula> 
 Since the subsequent crest is again emitted from r

 <formula> 
 The right @-@ hand side of the two integral equations above are identical which means 
 <formula> 
 Using the following manipulation :

 we find that :

 For very small variations in time ( over the period of one cycle of a light wave ) the scale factor is essentially a constant ( a 
 = <unk> today and a = 
 <unk> previously ) . This yields 
 <formula> 
 which can be rewritten as 
 <formula> 
 Using the definition of redshift provided above , the equation 
 <formula> 
 is obtained . In an expanding universe such as the one we inhabit , the scale factor is monotonically increasing as time passes , thus , z is positive and distant galaxies appear redshifted . 
 Using a model of the expansion of the Universe , redshift can be related to the age of an observed object , the so @-@ called cosmic time – redshift relation . <unk> a density ratio as <unk> :

 = = = = Distinguishing between cosmological and local effects = = = = 
 For cosmological redshifts of z < 0 @.@ 01 additional Doppler redshifts and blueshifts due to the peculiar motions of the galaxies relative to one another cause a wide scatter from the standard Hubble Law . The resulting situation can be illustrated by the Expanding Rubber Sheet Universe , a common cosmological analogy used to describe the expansion of space . If two objects are represented by ball bearings and spacetime by a stretching rubber sheet , the Doppler effect is caused by rolling the balls across the sheet to create peculiar motion . The cosmological redshift occurs when the ball bearings are stuck to the sheet and the sheet is stretched . 
 The redshifts of galaxies include both a component related to recessional velocity from expansion of the Universe , and a component related to peculiar motion ( Doppler shift ) . The redshift due to expansion of the Universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the Universe , which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity . Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift , cosmologist Edward Robert Harrison said , " Light leaves a galaxy , which is stationary in its local region of space , and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space . Between the galaxy and the observer , light travels through vast regions of expanding space . As a result , all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space . It is as simple as that ... " Steven Weinberg clarified , " The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of a ( t ) [ here a ( t ) is the Robertson @-@ Walker scale factor ] at the times of emission or absorption , but on the increase of a ( t ) in the whole period from emission to absorption . " 
 Popular literature often uses the expression " Doppler redshift " instead of " cosmological redshift " to describe the redshift of galaxies dominated by the expansion of spacetime , but the cosmological redshift is not found using the relativistic Doppler equation which is instead characterized by special relativity ; thus v > c is impossible while , in contrast , v > c is possible for cosmological redshifts because the space which separates the objects ( for example , a quasar from the Earth ) can expand faster than the speed of light . More mathematically , the viewpoint that " distant galaxies are receding " and the viewpoint that " the space between galaxies is expanding " are related by changing coordinate systems . Expressing this precisely requires working with the mathematics of the Friedmann @-@ Robertson @-@ Walker metric . 
 If the Universe were contracting instead of expanding , we would see distant galaxies blueshifted by an amount proportional to their distance instead of redshifted . 
 = = = Gravitational redshift = = = 
 In the theory of general relativity , there is time dilation within a gravitational well . This is known as the gravitational redshift or Einstein Shift . The theoretical derivation of this effect follows from the Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein equations which yields the following formula for redshift associated with a photon traveling in the gravitational field of an uncharged , nonrotating , spherically symmetric mass : 
 <formula> 
 where 
 G is the gravitational constant , 
 M is the mass of the object creating the gravitational field , 
 r is the radial coordinate of the source ( which is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object , but is actually a Schwarzschild coordinate ) , and 
 c is the speed of light . 
 This gravitational redshift result can be derived from the assumptions of special relativity and the equivalence principle ; the full theory of general relativity is not required . 
 The effect is very small but measurable on Earth using the Mössbauer effect and was first observed in the Pound – Rebka experiment . However , it is significant near a black hole , and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite . It is also the dominant cause of large angular @-@ scale temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( see Sachs @-@ Wolfe effect ) . 
 = = Observations in astronomy = = 
 The redshift observed in astronomy can be measured because the emission and absorption spectra for atoms are distinctive and well known , calibrated from spectroscopic experiments in laboratories on Earth . When the redshift of various absorption and emission lines from a single astronomical object is measured , z is found to be remarkably constant . Although distant objects may be slightly blurred and lines broadened , it is by no more than can be explained by thermal or mechanical motion of the source . For these reasons and others , the consensus among astronomers is that the redshifts they observe are due to some combination of the three established forms of Doppler @-@ like redshifts . Alternative hypotheses and explanations for redshift such as tired light are not generally considered plausible . 
 Spectroscopy , as a measurement , is considerably more difficult than simple photometry , which measures the brightness of astronomical objects through certain filters . When photometric data is all that is available ( for example , the Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field ) , astronomers rely on a technique for measuring photometric redshifts . Due to the broad wavelength ranges in photometric filters and the necessary assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light @-@ source , errors for these sorts of measurements can range up to δz 
 = 0 @.@ 5 , and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations . However , photometry does at least allow a qualitative characterization of a redshift . For example , if a Sun @-@ like spectrum had a redshift of z = 
 1 , it would be brightest in the infrared rather than at the yellow @-@ green color associated with the peak of its blackbody spectrum , and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of four , ( 1 + z ) 2 . Both the photon count rate and the photon energy are redshifted . ( See K correction for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift . ) 
 = = = Local observations = = = 
 In nearby objects ( within our Milky Way galaxy ) observed redshifts are almost always related to the line @-@ of @-@ sight velocities associated with the objects being observed . Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and <unk> the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries , a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins . Similarly , small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers have been able to diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters . Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in <unk> to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun . Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the rotation rates of planets , velocities of interstellar clouds , the rotation of galaxies , and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts . Additionally , the temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening – effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line . By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21 @-@ centimeter hydrogen line in different directions , astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas , which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way . Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies , such as Andromeda . As a diagnostic tool , redshift measurements are one of the most important spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy . 
 = = = Extragalactic observations = = = 
 The most distant objects exhibit larger redshifts corresponding to the Hubble flow of the Universe . The largest observed redshift , corresponding to the greatest distance and furthest back in time , is that of the cosmic microwave background radiation ; the numerical value of its redshift is about z 
 = 1089 ( z = 
 0 corresponds to present time ) , and it shows the state of the Universe about 13 @.@ 8 billion years ago , and 379 @,@ 000 years after the initial moments of the Big Bang . 
 The luminous point @-@ like cores of quasars were the first " high @-@ redshift " ( z > 0 @.@ 1 ) objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high @-@ redshift galaxies . 
 For galaxies more distant than the Local Group and the nearby Virgo Cluster , but within a thousand megaparsecs or so , the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy 's distance . This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and has come to be known as Hubble 's law . Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts , in about the year 1912 , while Hubble correlated Slipher 's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law . In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity , redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space : this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us , the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy , so the more the light has been stretched , the more redshifted the light is , and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us . Hubble 's law follows in part from the Copernican principle . Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are , measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements , so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble 's law . 
 Gravitational interactions of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram . The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of <unk> objects in the Universe . This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies ( such as the Andromeda Galaxy ) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter , and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution . This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio ( the ratio of a galaxy 's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities ) , an important tool for measuring dark matter . 
 The Hubble law 's linear relationship between distance and redshift assumes that the rate of expansion of the Universe is constant . However , when the Universe was much younger , the expansion rate , and thus the Hubble " constant " , was larger than it is today . For more distant galaxies , then , whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times , the approximation of constant expansion rate fails , and the Hubble law becomes a non @-@ linear integral relationship and dependent on the history of the expansion rate since the emission of the light from the galaxy in question . Observations of the redshift @-@ distance relationship can be used , then , to determine the expansion history of the Universe and thus the matter and energy content . 
 While it was long believed that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang , recent observations of the redshift @-@ distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the Universe has begun to accelerate . 
 = = = Highest redshifts = = = 
 Currently , the objects with the highest known redshifts are galaxies and the objects producing gamma ray bursts . The most reliable redshifts are from spectroscopic data , and the highest confirmed spectroscopic redshift of a galaxy is that of GN @-@ z11 , with a redshift of z 
 = 11 @.@ 1 , corresponding to 400 million years after the Big Bang . The previous record was held by <unk> @-@ <unk> at a redshift of z = 
 8 @.@ 6 , corresponding to 600 million years after the Big Bang . Slightly less reliable are Lyman @-@ break redshifts , the highest of which is the lensed galaxy <unk> @-@ <unk> at a redshift z 
 = 7 @.@ 5 and the next highest being z = 
 7 @.@ 0 . The most distant observed gamma ray burst with a spectroscopic redshift measurement was GRB <unk> , which had a redshift of z 
 = 8 @.@ 2 . The most distant known quasar , <unk> <unk> + <unk> , is at z = 
 7 @.@ 1 . The highest known redshift radio galaxy ( TN <unk> @-@ 2201 ) is at a redshift z 
 = 5 @.@ 2 and the highest known redshift molecular material is the detection of emission from the CO molecule from the quasar SDSS <unk> + <unk> at z =

 Extremely red objects ( <unk> ) are astronomical sources of radiation that radiate energy in the red and near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum . These may be starburst galaxies that have a high redshift accompanied by reddening from intervening dust , or they could be highly redshifted elliptical galaxies with an older ( and therefore redder ) stellar population . Objects that are even redder than <unk> are termed hyper extremely red objects ( <unk> ) . 
 The cosmic microwave background has a redshift of z 
 = 1089 , corresponding to an age of approximately 379 @,@ 000 years after the Big Bang and a comoving distance of more than 46 billion light years . The yet @-@ to @-@ be @-@ observed first light from the oldest Population III stars , not long after atoms first formed and the CMB ceased to be absorbed almost completely , may have redshifts in the range of 20 < z < 100 . Other high @-@ redshift events predicted by physics but not presently observable are the cosmic neutrino background from about two seconds after the Big Bang ( and a redshift in excess of z > 1010 ) and the cosmic gravitational wave background emitted directly from inflation at a redshift in excess of z > 1025 . 
 In June 2015 , astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 
 6 @.@ 60 . Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe ( i.e. , at high redshift ) , and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it . 
 = = = Redshift surveys = = = 
 With advent of automated telescopes and improvements in spectroscopes , a number of collaborations have been made to map the Universe in redshift space . By combining redshift with angular position data , a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky . These observations are used to measure properties of the large @-@ scale structure of the Universe . The Great Wall , a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light @-@ years wide , provides a dramatic example of a large @-@ scale structure that redshift surveys can detect . 
 The first redshift survey was the CfA Redshift Survey , started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982 . More recently , the <unk> Galaxy Redshift Survey determined the large @-@ scale structure of one section of the Universe , measuring redshifts for over 220 @,@ 000 galaxies ; data collection was completed in 2002 , and the final data set was released 30 June 2003 . The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) , is ongoing as of 2013 and aims to measure the redshifts of around 3 million objects . SDSS has recorded redshifts for galaxies as high as 0 @.@ 8 , and has been involved in the detection of quasars beyond z = 6 . The <unk> Redshift Survey uses the Keck telescopes with the new " <unk> " spectrograph ; a follow @-@ up to the pilot program <unk> , <unk> is designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0 @.@ 7 and above , and it is therefore planned to provide a high redshift complement to SDSS and <unk> . 
 = = Effects due to physical optics or radiative transfer = = 
 The interactions and phenomena summarized in the subjects of radiative transfer and physical optics can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation . In such cases the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being due to a transformation between reference frames . These shifts can be due to such physical phenomena as coherence effects or the scattering of electromagnetic radiation whether from charged elementary particles , from particulates , or from fluctuations of the index of refraction in a dielectric medium as occurs in the radio phenomenon of radio <unk> . While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as " redshifts " and " blueshifts " , in astrophysics light @-@ matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as " reddening " rather than " redshifting " which , as a term , is normally reserved for the effects discussed above . 
 In many circumstances scattering causes radiation to redden because entropy results in the predominance of many low @-@ energy photons over few high @-@ energy ones ( while conserving total energy ) . Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions , scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum ; that is , any calculated z is generally a function of wavelength . Furthermore , scattering from random media generally occurs at many angles , and z is a function of the scattering angle . If multiple scattering occurs , or the scattering particles have relative motion , then there is generally distortion of spectral lines as well . 
 In interstellar astronomy , visible spectra can appear redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes the rest of the sky to have a blue color . This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the line @-@ of @-@ sight .

 = Trans @-@ Europe Express ( album ) = 
 Trans @-@ Europe Express ( German : Trans Europa Express ) is the sixth studio album by German electronic music band Kraftwerk . Recorded in mid @-@ 1976 in Düsseldorf , Germany , the album was released in March 1977 on Kling Klang Records . The album 's themes were influenced by friends who suggested writing songs about the Trans Europ Express to reflect Kraftwerk 's electronic music style . Critics have described the album as having two specific themes : celebration of Europe and the disparities between reality and image . Musically , the songs on this album differ from the group 's earlier Krautrock style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms , minimalism , and occasional manipulated vocals . 
 Trans @-@ Europe Express charted at 119 on the American charts and was placed number 30 on the Village Voice 's 1977 Pazz & Jop critics poll . Two singles were released from Trans @-@ Europe Express : " Trans @-@ Europe Express " and " Showroom Dummies " . The album has been re @-@ released in several formats and continued to receive acclaim from modern critics . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the release and tour for the album Radio @-@ Activity , Kraftwerk continued to move further away from their earlier Krautrock style of improvised instrumental music , refining their work more into the format of melodic electronic songs . During the tour for Radio @-@ Activity the band began to make performance rules such as not to be drunk on stage or at parties . Karl Bartos wrote that about these rules , stating that " it 's not easy to turn knobs on a synthesizer if you are drunk or full of drugs . ... We always tried to keep very aware of what we were doing while acting in public . " During this tour , early melodies that would later evolve into the song " Showroom Dummies " were being performed . 
 In mid @-@ 1976 , Kraftwerk began to work on the album which was then called Europe Endless . Paul Alessandrini suggested that Kraftwerk write a song about the Trans @-@ Europ Express to reflect their electronic music style . Hütter and Schneider met with musicians David Bowie and Iggy Pop prior to recording which influenced song lyrics . Maxime Schmitt encouraged the group to record a French language version of the song " Showroom Dummies " which led the group to later record several songs in French . The album was recorded at Kling Klang Studio in Düsseldorf . Artistic control over the songs was strictly in the hands of members Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider with Bartos and Wolfgang Flür contributing sequenced electronic percussion . Kraftwerk went to railway bridges to listen to the sounds the train would actually produce . The group found the sound the train made was not danceable and changed it slightly . 
 = = Recording = = 
 An important piece of new equipment used on the album was the <unk> <unk> , a customized 32 @-@ step 16 @-@ channel analogue sequencer made for the band by <unk> & <unk> . This allowed the construction of more elaborate sequenced synthesizer lines , which are featured prominently in the tracks " Europe Endless " , " Franz Schubert " and " Endless Endless " , and liberated the player from the chore of playing repetitive keyboard patterns . 
 Whereas Radio @-@ Activity had featured a mixture of German and English lyrics throughout the album , Trans @-@ Europe Express went further and was mixed as two entirely separate versions , one sung in English , the other in German . At the recommendation of Maxime Schmitt , a French version of the song " Showroom Dummies " , titled " Les Mannequins " , was also recorded . " Les Mannequins " was the group 's first song in French and would influence decisions to record songs in French on later albums . After recording the album in Düsseldorf , Hütter and Schneider visited Los Angeles to mix the tracks at the Record Plant Studio . Elements of the mixing sessions that were done in Los Angeles were dropped from the album , including the use of more upfront vocals in order to do more mixing in Düsseldorf and Hamburg later . 
 The artwork for the album cover of Trans @-@ Europe Express was originally going to be a monochrome picture of the group reflected in a series of mirrors . This idea was dropped for a photo by New York @-@ based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour , with the group dressed in suits to resemble mannequins . J. Stara 's image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly retouched photo @-@ montage of Kraftwerk from their shoulders up again posed as mannequins which is shown on the cover of the English version of the album . On the inside sleeve , a color collage of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil Schult was used . The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour , taken on the group 's American tour . Other photos were taken by Schult that show the group laughing and smiling . These were not used for the album 's release . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Wolfgang Flür has stated Kraftwerk were influenced by music of the Weimar Germany era : " we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war , and before the war we had only the German folk music . In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from " . Karl Bartos also spoke of post @-@ war influence as the group thought that they " had this development in the 1920s which was very , very strong and was audio visual . We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical . This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there . " Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album 's concept . Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that " with the kind of music you do , which is kind of like an electronic blues , railway stations and trains are very important in your universe , you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express " . Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and United States associated them with Nazi Germany , with tracks such as " Autobahn " inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high @-@ speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s . At the same time the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this . Allmusic referred to Trans @-@ Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes . The first being the disparities between reality and image , represented by the songs " Hall of Mirrors " and " Showroom Dummies " , and the others about the glorification of Europe . Slant Magazine described the album as " a sonic poem to Europe " . 
 The musical style of Trans @-@ Europe Express was described by AllMusic as melodic themes which are " repeated often and occasionally interwoven over deliberate , chugging beats , sometimes with manipulated vocals " and " minimalism , mechanized rhythms , and crafted , catchy melodies " . Hütter has commented on the minimalist nature of the album , stating that " If we can convey an idea with one or two notes , it is better than to play a hundred or so notes " . The first side of Trans @-@ Europe Express has three songs . The song " Hall of Mirrors " has been described as containing deadpan vocals with lyrics that speculate how stars look at themselves in a looking glass . Hütter and Schneider have described the song as auto @-@ biographical . The third track " Showroom Dummies " was described by Allmusic as " <unk> melodic in a way that most of Trans @-@ Europe Express isn 't " and with lyrics which are " slightly paranoid " . The idea for the song came from Flür and Bartos being compared to showroom dummies in a British concert review . Some versions of the song contain a spoken introduction starting with a count @-@ in of " eins zwei drei vier " as a parody of the band Ramones who started some songs with a quick count @-@ in of " one two three four " . The second side of Trans @-@ Europe Express is a suite with " Trans @-@ Europe Express " continuing through to " Metal on Metal " and " Franz Schubert " before closing with a brief reiteration of the main theme from " Europe Endless " . Allmusic described the musical elements of the suite as having a haunting theme with " deadpan chanting of the title phrase " which is " slowly layered over that rhythmic base in much the same way that the earlier " Autobahn " was constructed " . The song 's lyrics reference the album Station to Station and meeting with musicians Iggy Pop and David Bowie . Hütter and Schneider had previously met up with Bowie in Germany and were flattered with the attention they received from him . Ralf Hütter was interested in Bowie 's work as he had been working with Iggy Pop , who was the former lead singer of The Stooges ; one of Hütter 's favorite groups .

 Trans @-@ Europe Express was originally released in March 1977 . With the help of Günther <unk> , Kraftwerk made a promotional music video for the song " Trans @-@ Europe Express " . The video features the group wearing long coats on a train trip from Düsseldorf to nearby Duisburg . Photo stills from this video were later used on the single sleeve for " Showroom Dummies " . <unk> would work with Kraftwerk again on their album The Man @-@ Machine doing the photography for the album cover . To promote the album to the press in France , EMI Records hired a train with old fashioned carriages from the 1930s to travel from Paris to Rheims while the songs from the album were played over the train 's announcement system for the critics . 
 In October 2009 , a remastered edition of the album was released by EMI Records in Germany , Mute Records in the European Union and Astralwerks Records in the United States . This re @-@ release was available on compact disc , digital download and vinyl and features a different album cover from previous versions of the album . This new version features a black background with white Trans Europ Express train in the center . The track listing on the 2009 re @-@ release amends the titles of the songs to match the original German release . This change has " Metal on Metal " being credited for two minutes of the music with the remainder being a track titled " Abzug " ( English : " Departure " ) .
