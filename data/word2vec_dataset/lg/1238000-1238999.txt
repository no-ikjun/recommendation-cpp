 = U.S. Route 64 in Oklahoma = 
 U.S. Route 64 ( US @-@ 64 ) is a U.S. highway running from the Four Corners area to the Outer Banks of North Carolina . Between these two points , the highway passes through the entire width of Oklahoma ; a total of 591 @.@ 17 miles ( 951 @.@ 40 km ) of US @-@ 64 lies in the state of Oklahoma . US @-@ 64 enters the state from New Mexico , crossing the line between the two states between Clayton , New Mexico , and Boise City in Cimarron County . The route runs the full length of the Oklahoma Panhandle , then serves the northernmost tier of counties in the main body of the state before dipping southeastward to Tulsa , the state 's second @-@ largest city . From Tulsa , the highway continues southeast , leaving Oklahoma just west of Fort Smith , Arkansas . In addition to Tulsa , US @-@ 64 serves fifteen Oklahoma counties and the cities of Guymon , Woodward , Enid , and Muskogee . 
 US @-@ 64 has been a part of the United States Numbered Highways system from the program 's inception in 1926 . US @-@ 64 's route has remained roughly the same since then , although it has undergone alterations several times , many changing its course through towns and moving the highway designation to higher @-@ capacity expressways and freeways .

 U.S. Route 64 crosses the New Mexico – Oklahoma state line northeast of Clayton , New Mexico , concurrent with US @-@ 56 and US @-@ 412 . The three highways enter the state just north of the extreme southwest corner of Cimarron County , the westernmost tip of the Oklahoma Panhandle . The highways head northeast , passing through disconnected parcels of the Rita Blanca National Grassland . The first town US @-@ 56 , US @-@ 64 , and US @-@ 412 encounter in Oklahoma is unincorporated Felt , of which they skirt the northern edge . The highways then cross the Beaver River before intersecting US @-@ 385 , which joins the other three highways in a concurrency as they approach Boise City , the county seat . In Boise City , the highways reach a traffic circle which surrounds the Cimarron County Courthouse . At this traffic circle , US @-@ 56 , US @-@ 64 , and US @-@ 412 all turn east , while US @-@ 385 splits away to the north . State Highway 3 ( SH @-@ 3 ) enters the circle from the north and leaves from the east , following US @-@ 64 , while SH @-@ 325 begins at the circle and heads west toward Kenton . East of town , US @-@ 56 / US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 have an interchange with US @-@ 287 , which bypasses Boise City to the east . Six miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of here , US @-@ 56 splits away from the other highways ; it continues northeast , while US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 turn onto a due east course . The routes intersect SH @-@ 171 eight miles ( 13 km ) east of the split . 
 Approximately twelve miles ( 19 km ) east of the SH @-@ 171 junction , US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 cross into Texas County . Seven miles ( 11 km ) east of the county line , at unincorporated Four Corners , SH @-@ 95 joins the concurrency ; it splits away after following the other three routes for five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) . The next major highway junction lies eighteen miles ( 29 km ) miles to the east , where SH @-@ 136 joins with US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 / SH @-@ 3 as the highways turn south toward Guymon . The four highways cross the Beaver River once again before entering that city , Texas County 's seat and the largest city in the Panhandle , on Main Street . In Guymon , US @-@ 64 splits away to the east along NE 12th Street , while US @-@ 412 and state highways 3 and 136 continue south . US @-@ 64 is accompanied on 12th Street by truck routes for the latter three highways . At the intersection with US @-@ 54 , the truck routes turn southwest , while US @-@ 64 turns northeast , following US @-@ 54 out of town US @-@ 54 / US @-@ 64 continue northeast through eastern Texas County , running parallel to a Union Pacific rail line . After crossing the Beaver River ( the only crossing for US @-@ 54 , but the third for US @-@ 64 ) , the highways cut through the northwest corner of the town of Optima . Continuing northeast , US @-@ 54 and US @-@ 64 run just southeast of <unk> before coming to Hooker . There , US @-@ 54 / US @-@ 64 serve as the northern terminus of SH @-@ 94 . After the SH @-@ 94 junction , US @-@ 54 continues northeast toward Tyrone and Liberal , Kansas , while US @-@ 64 splits off onto a due east course . The road passes south of Baker before leaving Texas County . 
 Next , US @-@ 64 passes through Beaver County , the easternmost of the three counties forming the Oklahoma Panhandle . About four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east of the county line , US @-@ 64 reaches the town of Turpin ; here , the highway begins a concurrency with US @-@ 83 . Approximately three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of Turpin , the two highways come to a junction with US @-@ 270 . US @-@ 83 and westbound US @-@ 270 continue north from this junction toward Liberal , while US @-@ 64 and US @-@ 270 eastbound form a concurrency heading due east . Passing north of Floris , the highways proceed east for about 18 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 29 @.@ 8 km ) without any curves or junctions with other highways before reaching Forgan . East of Forgan lies a highway junction with SH @-@ 23 — here , US @-@ 270 splits away from US @-@ 64 , turning south along SH @-@ 23 en route to the county seat , Beaver . SH @-@ 23 joins US @-@ 64 to form a one @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) concurrency before also splitting away toward its northern terminus at the Kansas line . US @-@ 64 does not intersect any other highways in the 29 @-@ mile ( 47 km ) segment of highway in Beaver County east of the SH @-@ 23 junction . As it zig @-@ zags southeastward , the highway passes through the towns of Knowles and Gate . Three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Gate , the highway crosses the Beaver – Harper county line , the eastern boundary of the Oklahoma <unk> , and enters the main body of the state . 
 = = = Northern Oklahoma = = = 
 Just two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of its entry into Harper County , US @-@ 412 begins a concurrency with US @-@ 283 . The two highways pass through <unk> , then US @-@ 283 splits away to the south toward Laverne . US @-@ 64 continues alone on a due east course for eight miles ( 13 km ) before reaching the northern terminus of SH @-@ 46 . The highway continues east , then veers northeast , and turns back to the east before meeting up with US @-@ 183 on the south side of Buffalo , the county seat . US @-@ 64 turns north at this intersection , overlapping US @-@ 183 through town . The two routes part ways northeast of town , with US @-@ 183 continuing on a northerly course toward Kansas and US @-@ 64 turning east once again . On the east end of the county , US @-@ 64 begins another concurrency , this time with SH @-@ 34 . About 2 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) east of the junction , the two highways cross the Cimarron River , which forms the northeastern boundary of Harper County . 
 As US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 34 cross the Cimarron River , the two highways enter Woods County . SH @-@ 34 splits off to the north shortly thereafter . US @-@ 64 continues on east , passing through unincorporated Plainview and turning southeast to intersect SH @-@ 50 at its northern terminus at Camp Houston , north of Freedom . The next highway junction is just over thirteen miles ( 21 km ) east of Camp Houston , and is the northern terminus of SH @-@ 14 as signed ; however , ODOT documents show SH @-@ 14 continuing east along US @-@ 64 from this point for slightly less than thirteen miles ( 21 km ) . The two highways proceed into the Woods County seat , Alva , where they join US @-@ 281 . This concurrency lasts about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) before US @-@ 281 splits off to the north on the east side of town ; at this point , SH @-@ 14 ends . US @-@ 64 continues east by itself for six miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) before reaching the eastern limit of Woods County . 
 The next county that US @-@ 64 serves on its path across Oklahoma is Alfalfa County . After passing eight miles ( 13 km ) through rural Alfalfa county , it approaches the unincorporated Ingersoll , whereupon it continues another two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) until the route intersects state highways 8 , 11 , and 58 . All three of these highways extend north from the intersection , while SH @-@ 11 continues east . US @-@ 64 turns south at this intersection , overlapping SH @-@ 8 and SH @-@ 58 . They then pass through Cherokee , seat of Alfalfa County . About five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) south of town , SH @-@ 8 splits away to the southwest , while US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 58 turn due east . Approximately six miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) east of that intersection , SH @-@ 58 also splits away , headed south toward Helena . US @-@ 64 proceeds east to Jet , where it forms the southern terminus of SH @-@ 38 . Four miles west of Jet , the highway exits Alfalfa County . 
 Upon leaving Alfalfa County , US @-@ 64 passes into Grant County . The first town the highway passes through in Grant County is Nash , where it begins a concurrency with SH @-@ 132 . This concurrency lasts for two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) before SH @-@ 132 splits away . Eight miles ( 13 km ) east of this junction , US @-@ 64 intersects US @-@ 60 and US @-@ 81 in a T junction . US @-@ 81 northbound and US @-@ 60 eastbound continue straight , while US @-@ 64 eastbound turns south along with southbound US @-@ 81 and westbound US @-@ 60 ( creating a wrong @-@ way concurrency with US @-@ 60 ) . The three highways continue south into Garfield County . Fourteen miles ( 23 km ) south of the T junction , US @-@ 60 / US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 81 serve as the eastern terminus of SH @-@ 45 . This junction marks the highways ' entry into the Enid area . The highways serve as the city limit boundary between Enid ( to the west ) and North Enid ( to the east ) . About 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) south of the SH @-@ 45 junction , US @-@ 64 splits away from the other two highways at an interchange where US @-@ 64 continues south and US @-@ 60 / US @-@ 81 take a southwesterly tack . US @-@ 64 heads south from the interchange on North 4th Street . At Willow Road , US @-@ 64 turns due east ; it follows Willow Road for about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) before turning south on North 30th Street . This street has an parclo interchange with Owen K. Garriott Road , which carries US @-@ 412 ; here , US @-@ 64 joins US @-@ 412 , and the two highways head due east out of Enid as a four @-@ lane expressway . East of Enid , the two routes pass between Breckenridge and Fairmont . South of Garber lies an interchange between US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 and SH @-@ 74 . SH @-@ 15 also begins here , extending north along SH @-@ 74 . US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 continue east out of Garfield County . 
 US @-@ 64 and US @-@ 412 next enter Noble County . The two highways ' first junction with another highway in the county is a cloverleaf interchange at I @-@ 35 ( exit 194 on the interstate ) . US @-@ 412 continues straight through the interchange , forming the Cimarron Turnpike , while US @-@ 64 follows I @-@ 35 southbound . US @-@ 64 splits away from the interstate in Perry at exit 186 , heading due east , deeper into Perry . In downtown Perry , about 2 1 ⁄ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 8 km ) east of I @-@ 35 , US @-@ 64 has a brief concurrency with US @-@ 77 . US @-@ 64 continues east out of Perry . West of Morrison , the highway crosses US @-@ 177 . US @-@ 64 then passes through Morrison . East of town , US @-@ 64 has an interchange with the Cimarron Turnpike , still carrying US @-@ 412 , at turnpike exit 22 . US @-@ 64 continues northeast to Lela , where it serves as the northern terminus of SH @-@ 108 , which runs along the Noble – Pawnee county line . US @-@ 64 continues east into Pawnee County . 
 About seven miles ( 11 km ) into Pawnee County , US @-@ 64 enters the county seat , Pawnee . Here , the route begins a concurrency with SH @-@ 18 . The two highways head southeast out of town together for just over two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) before SH @-@ 18 splits off to the south toward Lone Chimney . US @-@ 64 continues alone to the east for about 12 3 ⁄ 4 miles ( 20 @.@ 5 km ) before beginning another concurrency , this time with SH @-@ 99 , on the outskirts of Cleveland . The two highways leave Cleveland , proceeding east through unincorporated territory , before re @-@ entering the city . Here , the two highways head in separate directions , with SH @-@ 99 heading north and US @-@ 64 heading southeast . This portion of the highway runs parallel to Keystone Lake , a reservoir formed by the impounded Arkansas River . US @-@ 64 intersects with SH @-@ 48 at the latter 's northern terminus before merging with US @-@ 412 in a partial interchange ( the missing movements are provided via SH @-@ 48 ) . This interchange is also the Cimarron Turnpike 's eastern endpoint . 
 = = = Tulsa area = = = 
 US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 continue east from the eastern terminus of the Cimarron Turnpike in southeastern Pawnee as a freeway known as the Keystone Expressway . This highway continues eastward along a peninsula into Lake Keystone . Here , the highway serves as the southern limit of Westport and Mule Barn , which remains an incorporated town despite having a population of zero . The freeway turns southeast , briefly entering Westport before crossing Lake Keystone into Osage County . US @-@ 64 and US @-@ 412 run through Osage County for just under 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) , cutting across a corner of the county before entering Tulsa County . 
 Upon entering Tulsa County , US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 412 serve as the northern terminus of SH @-@ 151 . The freeway passes through an outlying parcel of Sand Springs , running parallel to the Arkansas River , before emerging into unincorporated territory . Proceeding east , the freeways re @-@ enter Sand Springs , passing through an interchange with SH @-@ 97 just south of downtown . SH @-@ 51 joins the Keystone Expressway at this interchange . The freeway then enters Tulsa ( estimated population 394 @,@ 098 as of 2012 ) , the second @-@ largest city in Oklahoma . The Keystone Expressway continues to an interchange at the northwest corner of the Inner Dispersal Loop ( IDL ) , a ring of freeways encircling downtown Tulsa . At this interchange , US @-@ 64 meets I @-@ 244 and the L.L. Tisdale Parkway . US @-@ 412 follows I @-@ 244 east , while US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 51 turn south along I @-@ 244 westbound . The three highways then run along the western side of the IDL . At the southwest corner of the loop lies an interchange serving as the western terminus of unsigned I @-@ 444 . US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 51 split away from I @-@ 244 at this interchange to join I @-@ 444 and US @-@ 75 . I @-@ 444 , US @-@ 64 , US @-@ 75 , and SH @-@ 51 head east along the south leg of the IDL . At the southeast corner of the IDL , the highways part ways ; I @-@ 444 and US @-@ 75 turn north along the east side of the IDL , while US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 51 split off to the east . 
 US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 51 proceed southeast from downtown along another freeway , the Broken Arrow Expressway . Between Lewis Avenue and Sheridan Road , a rail line runs down the median of the highway . After the freeway splits away from the railroad alignment , it comes to an interchange with I @-@ 44 / SH @-@ 66 . From here , the Broken Arrow Expressway heads southeast to an interchange with the Mingo Valley Expressway , which carries US @-@ 169 . Here , US @-@ 64 splits away to follow the southbound Mingo Valley Expressway , while SH @-@ 51 continues southeast on the Broken Arrow Expressway . US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 169 follow a due south course to an interchange with the Creek Turnpike . The freeway merges with a free section of the turnpike , heading west . At an interchange with Memorial Drive , US @-@ 64 turns south , splitting away from the freeway . US @-@ 169 ends at this point , and tolls resume on the Creek Turnpike to the west of the interchange . 
 From here , US @-@ 64 proceeds south on Memorial Drive into Bixby . In Bixby , the highway crosses the Arkansas River for the second time . Further south , it serves as the eastern terminus of SH @-@ 67 . On the southern outskirts of Bixby , it turns east , passing through unincorporated Leonard before exiting Tulsa County . 
 = = = Eastern Oklahoma = = = 
 Southeast of Leonard , US @-@ 64 cuts across extreme southwestern Wagoner County , passing through Stone Bluff , before entering Muskogee County . Approximately 2 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) south of the county line , the highway serves the town of Haskell , where it begins a concurrency with SH @-@ 72 and junctions with SH @-@ 104 at its western terminus . US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 72 head south from Haskell , passing through unincorporated Jamesville and coming to a junction south of the settlement . Here , SH @-@ 72 splits away from US @-@ 64 , continuing a southbound course straight through the junction to join westbound US @-@ 62 . The western leg of this junction leads to westbound SH @-@ 16 . US @-@ 64 turns to the east , joined by eastbound US @-@ 62 and SH @-@ 16 . The three routes serve as the southern terminus of SH @-@ 162 , a spur route to Taft . The road forms a gentle S @-@ curve as it comes into the city of Muskogee , the county seat . Here , the routes split ways at an intersection with US @-@ 69 ; US @-@ 62 ad SH @-@ 16 turn north along US @-@ 69 , while US @-@ 64 follows southbound US @-@ 69 . US @-@ 62 BUS / US @-@ 64 BUS continue east from the intersection . US @-@ 64 / US @-@ 69 continue south to an intersection with Peak Boulevard , where US @-@ 64 heads east on its own . US @-@ 62 follows Peak Boulevard for about 1 1 ⁄ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 0 km ) , exiting at an interchange with US @-@ 64 Business ; mainline US @-@ 64 continues south past the terminus of US @-@ 64 Business , while SH @-@ 165 continues east on Peak Boulevard . US @-@ 64 proceeds south for just under sixteen miles ( 26 km ) to Warner , where it forms the eastern terminus of US @-@ 266 and the northern terminus of SH @-@ 2 . US @-@ 64 turns back to the east here , running parallel to I @-@ 40 between Warner and Webbers Falls , where it has an interchange with the Muskogee Turnpike . East of the turnpike interchange , US @-@ 64 begins a concurrency with SH @-@ 100 . The two highways pass northwest of downtown Webbers Falls before crossing the Arkansas River , which forms the boundary of Muskogee County , a third time . 
 The final county US @-@ 64 passes through on its trek through Oklahoma is Sequoyah County , where much of its path loosely follows that of I @-@ 40 . SH @-@ 100 splits away from US @-@ 64 at an intersection about 3 ⁄ 4 mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) east of the Muskogee – Sequoyah county line , in Gore . At this same intersection , US @-@ 64 is joined by SH @-@ 10 , which follows it out of Gore before splitting off southeast of town . US @-@ 64 continues alone to the town of Vian , where it intersects SH @-@ 82 . East of Vian , US @-@ 64 serves the county seat , Sallisaw , where it overlaps US @-@ 59 . On the southeast side of the city , it comes to an interchange with I @-@ 40 ( exit 311 from the Interstate ) . US @-@ 64 <unk> southeast from Sallisaw , turning back to the east at the eastern terminus of SH @-@ 141 . It crosses under I @-@ 40 just east of here , although there are no ramps between the two roads . US @-@ 64 then enters Muldrow . Here , the highway intersects SH @-@ 64B . US @-@ 64 then continues into Roland , where another interchange with I @-@ 40 ( exit 325 ) is located . The highway then turns southeast , passing north of Moffett , with two interchanges serving SH @-@ 64D , which heads north to Dora , Arkansas , and Grand Boulevard , which heads south into Moffett . US @-@ 64 then crosses the Arkansas River a fourth time , the final crossing in Oklahoma ; the river 's east bank is the Oklahoma – Arkansas state line . 
 = = History = = 
 US @-@ 64 was one of the original United States Numbered Highways designated at the highway system 's creation on November 11 , 1926 . It stretched from the New Mexico state line in the Oklahoma panhandle east to the Arkansas state line near Fort Smith . The original route included two sharp , right @-@ angle turns near the city of Freedom . On February 19 , 1934 , the Oklahoma Highway Commission approved the re @-@ routing of US @-@ 64 onto a roadway a bit further west to eliminate these turns . On November 9 , 1937 , the highway was re @-@ routed through the city of Tulsa , as well . Later , in 1943 just south of the city of Muskogee , US @-@ 64 and SH @-@ 2 , which was then concurrent with US @-@ 64 , were relocated slightly to the west to allow for the new Davis Field air base to be constructed at the place the highways had run before relocation . 
 On July 7 , 1947 , another modification to the route was made , moving its western terminus from the northern portion of the panhandle to a new roadway in the southern section . The next significant change to the highway took place on April 4 , 1960 , when it was realigned to the north between the cities of Gore and Vian . Two years later , on April 4 , 1962 , US @-@ 64 was relocated to the north west of Tulsa , near Sand Springs . On November 4 , 1963 , a bypass was added through the city of Enid . It was designated as US @-@ 64 Bypass and ran on Willow Avenue and 30th Street . A couple of months later , on February 3 , 1964 , US @-@ 64 was moved onto a freeway through the southeastern portion of Tulsa . Later , on December 1 of the same year , similar reroutings through Tulsa and Broken Arrow were approved by the Oklahoma Department of Highways . 
 The routing of US @-@ 64 was modified further on July 6 , 1965 , through the city of Enid . The routing of US @-@ 64 Bypass , which was designated two years earlier , was replaced by that of US @-@ 64 itself , and what used to be US @-@ 64 became part of a new business loop ( US @-@ 64 Bus . ) through the city . The Oklahoma Department of Highways approved a rerouting of the designation onto a freeway south of Muskogee on October 3 , 1966 , and a relocation slightly to the north between Jamesville and Muskogee on July 10 , 1967 . However , neither of these modifications was completed until around 1969 . Then , on June 1 , 1970 , US @-@ 64 was relocated across the Arkansas River between Webber Falls and Gore . Between then and 1972 , US @-@ 64 was realigned between Enid and Perry , with the old highway becoming SH @-@ 164 . 
 By 1974 , the majority of the freeway that US @-@ 64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete , and it was relocated onto the completed portion of the freeway . Only the portion in the downtown section of the city was yet to be completed . The remainder of the freeway , the concurrency with Interstate 444 , was not completed until about 1983 . The next and final major modification to the designation of US @-@ 64 took place when it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike over the first half of 1992 . The route has undergone only minor changes since then . 
 The section of US @-@ 64 between Webbers Falls and Gore was pressed into service as a detour for I @-@ 40 traffic after the collapse of its bridge over the Arkansas River on May 26 , 2002 . The detour significantly impacted the town of Gore . Local firefighters directed traffic there 24 hours a day , with daytime temperatures approaching 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) . Businesses in Gore reported loss of revenue due to the traffic ; one gas station reported a 30 % decline in revenue while traffic was detoured through town . Delays of thirty to fifty minutes on the 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) detour were typical , although trains passing through Gore could lengthen wait times by 15 minutes .

 Near the east end of its route through Oklahoma , US @-@ 64 currently connects to two short highways , bearing the number " 64 " with a letter suffix , branching off from the interstate to connect the highway to other roads . Both of these highways lie entirely within Sequoyah County and connect US @-@ 64 to I @-@ 40 .

From Roland , it continued south , crossing I @-@ 40 and coming to its eastern terminus at US @-@ 64 . Its length was nine miles ( 14 km ) . 
 SH @-@ 64C first appeared on the 1974 state highway map . By the following year , the portion of highway between downtown Roland and US @-@ 64 had been removed from the state highway system , bringing its length down to eight miles ( 13 km ) .

 = Jackalope = 
 The jackalope is a mythical animal of North American folklore ( a fearsome critter ) described as a jackrabbit with antelope horns . The word " jackalope " is a portmanteau of " jackrabbit " and " antelope " , although the jackrabbit is not a rabbit , and the American antelope is not an antelope . Also , many jackalope taxidermy mounts , including the original , are actually made with deer antlers . 
 In the 1930s , Douglas Herrick and his brother , hunters with taxidermy skills , popularized the American jackalope by grafting deer antlers onto a jackrabbit carcass and selling the combination to a local hotel in Douglas , Wyoming . Thereafter , they made and sold many similar jackalopes to a retail outlet in South Dakota , and another taxidermist continues to manufacture the horned rabbits in the 21st century . Stuffed and mounted , jackalopes are found in many bars and other places in the United States ; stores catering to tourists sell jackalope postcards and other paraphernalia , and commercial entities in America and elsewhere have used the word " jackalope " or a jackalope logo as part of their marketing strategies . The jackalope has appeared in published stories , poems , television shows , video games , and a low @-@ budget mockumentary film . The Wyoming Legislature has considered bills to make the jackalope the state 's official mythological creature . 
 The underlying legend of the jackalope , upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building , may be related to similar stories in other cultures and other historical times . Researchers suggest that at least some of the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus . It causes <unk> and antler @-@ like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit 's head and body . 
 Folklorists see the jackalope as one of a group of fabled creatures common to American culture since Colonial days . These appear in tall tales about <unk> , giant turtles , Bigfoot , and many other mysterious beasts and in novels like Moby Dick . The tales lend themselves to comic <unk> by entrepreneurs who seek attention for their products , their persons , or their towns .

 Jackalope is a portmanteau word that combines two words , jackrabbit and antelope . 
 Jackrabbits are actually hares rather than rabbits though both are mammals in the order Lagomorpha . Wyoming is home to three species of hares , all in the genus Lepus . These are the black @-@ tailed jackrabbit , the white @-@ tailed jackrabbit , and the snowshoe hare . 
 The antelope is actually a pronghorn ( <unk> americana ) rather than an antelope , although one of its colloquial names in North America is " antelope " . Some of the largest herds of wild pronghorns , which are found only in western North America , are in Wyoming . The adults grow to about 3 feet ( 1 m ) tall , weigh up to 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) , and can run at sustained speeds approaching 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) .

 Stories or descriptions of animal hybrids have appeared in many cultures worldwide . A 13th @-@ century Persian work depicts a rabbit with a single horn , like a unicorn . In Europe , the horned rabbit appeared in Medieval and Renaissance folklore in Bavaria ( the <unk> ) and elsewhere . Natural history texts such as Historiae Naturalis de <unk> Libri ( The History Book of Natural Quadrangles ) by Joannes <unk> ( John <unk> ) in the 17th century and illustrations such as Animalia <unk> et <unk> ( Terra ) : Plate XLVII by Joris Hoefnagel ( 1522 – 1600 ) in the 16th century included the horned hare . These early scientific texts described and illustrated the hybrids as though they were real creatures , but by the end of the 18th century scientists generally rejected the idea of horned hares as a biological species . 
 References to horned rabbits may originate in sightings of rabbits affected by the Shope papilloma virus , named for Richard E. Shope , M.D. , who described it in a scientific journal in 1933 . Shope initially examined wild cottontail rabbits that had been shot by hunters in Iowa and later examined wild rabbits from Kansas . They had " numerous horn @-@ like protuberances on the skin over various parts of their bodies . The animals were referred to popularly as ' horned ' or ' warty ' rabbits . " Legends about horned rabbits also occur in Asia and Africa as well as Europe , and researchers suspect the changes induced by the virus might underlie at least some of those tales . 
 In Central America , mythological references to a horned rabbit creature can be found in Huichol legends . The Huichol oral tradition has passed down tales of a horned rabbit and of the deer getting horns from the rabbit . The rabbit and deer were paired , though not combined as a hybrid , as day signs in the calendar of the Mesoamerican period of the Aztecs , as twins , brothers , even the sun and moon .

 The New York Times attributes the American jackalope 's origin to a 1932 hunting outing involving Douglas Herrick ( 1920 – 2003 ) of Douglas , Wyoming . Herrick and his brother had studied taxidermy by mail order as teenagers , and when the brothers returned from a hunting trip for jackrabbits , Herrick tossed a carcass into the taxidermy store , where it came to rest beside a pair of deer antlers . The accidental combination of animal forms sparked Herrick 's idea for a jackalope . The first jackalope the brothers put together was sold for $ 10 to Roy Ball , who displayed it in Douglas ' La Bonte Hotel . The mounted head was stolen in 1977 . The jackalope became a popular local attraction in Douglas , where the Chamber of Commerce issues Jackalope Hunting Licenses to tourists . The tags are good for hunting during official jackalope season , which occurs for only one day : June 31 ( a nonexistent date as June has 30 days ) , from midnight to 2 a.m. The hunter must have an IQ greater than 50 but not over 72 . Thousands of " licenses " have been issued . In Herrick 's home town of Douglas , there is an 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) statue of a jackalope , and the town hosts an annual Jackalope Days Celebration in early June . 
 Building on the Herrick 's success , Frank English of Rapid City , South Dakota has made and sold many thousands of jackalopes since retiring from the Air Force in 1981 . He is the only supplier of the altered animal heads to Cabela 's , a major outdoor @-@ theme retail company . His standard jackalopes and " world @-@ record " jackalopes sell for about $ 150 . 
 In Man and Beast in American Comic Legend , folklorist Richard Dorson recounts the Douglas variant but also an alternative that will " surely infuriate the residents of Douglas ... " . According to Dorson , in Mythical Creatures of the North Country ( 1969 ) , historian Walker D. Wyman acknowledged the existence of what he called the Alkali Area Jackalope of the western United States . However , he expressed doubt that it predated the Jack @-@ pine Jackalope of Minnesota and Wisconsin , " a mythological throwback that defies even the most competent biologists of the region . " Wyman claimed there were three known specimens of this primary jackalope — in Augusta in west @-@ central Wisconsin ; Cornucopia , along the south shore of Lake Superior ; and in a north shore museum and lumber camp — all " presumably shot by careless hunters during the deer season . " 
 In a 1978 revision and expansion of his book , which includes material on the <unk> porcupine , the <unk> , the three @-@ tailed <unk> , the <unk> , and many other creatures , Wyman devotes four pages to the jackalope . In a turnabout from his earlier claims of a North Country origin for the antlered hare , he says , " The center of its vast range seems to be Wyoming . " Evidence of wide dispersal of Lepus <unk> wyomingensis from its original range , he claims , are labels such as " Tioga , Pennsylvania , " and " Hongkong " stamped on mounted jackalope heads in <unk> across the United States . 
 = = Tall tales = = 
 The jackalope is subject to many outlandish and largely tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek claims embedded in tall tales about its habits . Jackalopes are said to be so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored . Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk , but The New York Times questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk . One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey , the jackalope 's beverage of choice . 
 The jackalope can imitate the human voice , according to legend . During the days of the Old West , when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night , jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices or singing along , usually as a tenor . It is said that jackalopes , the rare Lepus <unk> , only breed during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare 's reputation for fertility .

 In 2005 , the legislature of Wyoming considered a bill to make the jackalope the state 's official mythological creature . It passed the House by a 45 – 12 margin , but the session ended before the Senate could take up the bill , which died . In 2013 , following the death of the bill 's sponsor , Dave Edwards , the state legislature reintroduced the bill . It again passed the House but died in the rules committee of the Senate . In 2015 , three state representatives put forth the jackalope proposal again , this time as House Bill 66 , and again it passed the House but died in a Senate committee . One of the co @-@ sponsors , Dan <unk> , said , " I ’ ll keep bringing it back until it passes . " 
 In 2014 , the Wyoming Lottery adopted a jackalope logo for its lottery tickets and marketing materials . Lottery officials chose the fictitious animal , which they named <unk> , over the bucking horse and other state symbols .

 Since Herrick and his brother began selling manipulated taxidermy heads in the 1930s , such trophies — as well as jackalope postcards and related gift @-@ shop items — can be found in many places beyond Douglas . The student magazine of the Santa Fe University of Art and Design in New Mexico is called The Jackalope . On the other side of the world , The Hop Factory craft beer cafe in Newcastle , Australia , uses a leaping jackalope as its logo . In 1986 , James Abdnor , a senator from South Dakota , gave U.S. President Ronald Reagan a stuffed jackalope ( rabbit head with antlers ) during a presidential campaign stop in Rapid City . 
 Many books , including a large number written for children , feature the jackalope . A search for " jackalope " in the WorldCat listings of early 2015 produced 225 hits , including 57 for books . Among them is Juan and the Jackalope : A Children 's Book in Verse by Rudolfo Anaya . The WorldCat summary of Anaya 's book says : " Competing for the hand of the lovely Rosita and her rhubarb pie , Juan rides a Jackalope in a race against Pecos Bill . " A short story , " Jackalope Wives " by Ursula Vernon , has been nominated for a 2014 Nebula Award . 
 Musicians have used the jackalope in various ways . R. Carlos Nakai , a Native American flute player , formerly belonged to a group called Jackalope . In the late 1980s , it performed what Nakai called " <unk> " , which combined " improvisation , visual art , storytelling , dance and dramatic theatrical effects . " Nakai said he wanted people to dream as they listened to the music . Jakalope is a Canadian alternative pop / rock group formed in 2003 by Dave " Rave " Ogilvie . The band Miike Snow uses the jackalope as its logo . Band member Andrew Wyatt said during an interview in 2012 that the logo was meant to signify experiment and adventure . Of the 225 <unk> hits resulting from a search for " jackalope " , 95 were related to music . 
 Jackalopes have appeared in movies and on television . A jackalope named " Jack Ching Bada Bing " was a recurring character in a series of sketches on the television show America 's Funniest People . The show 's host , Dave Coulier , voiced the rascally hybrid . In 2003 , Pixar featured a jackalope in the short animation Boundin ' . The jackalope gave helpful advice to a lamb who was feeling sad after being shorn . 
 Jackalopes have appeared in video games . In Red Dead Redemption , the player is able to hunt and skin jackalopes . In Redneck Rampage , jackalopes , including one the size of a bus , are enemies . Jackalopes are part of the action in Guild Wars 2 . 
 A low @-@ budget jackalope mockumentary , <unk> , aired in Casper and Douglas in 2006 . The movie included interviews with the owner of a Douglas sporting goods store who claimed to harbor a live jackalope on his premises and with a paleontologist who explained the natural history of the jackalope and its place in the fossil record . 
 Beginning in 1997 , the Central Hockey League included a team called the Odessa Jackalopes . The team joined the South Division of the North American Hockey League before the 2011 – 12 season . An Odessa sports writer expressed concern about the team 's name , which he found insufficiently intimidating and which sounded like " something you might eat for breakfast . " 
 Jackalope Brewing Company , the first commercial brewery in Tennessee run by women , opened in Nashville in 2011 . Its four craft beers are Thunder Ann , <unk> , <unk> , and Leghorn . 
 = = Scholarly interpretations = = 
 Folklorist John A. Gutowski sees in the Douglas jackalope an example of an American tall tale publicized by a local community that seeks wider recognition . Through a combination of hoax and media activity , the town or other community draws attention to itself for social or economic reasons . A common adjunct to this activity involves the creation of an annual festival to perpetuate the town 's association with the local legend . 
 Gutowski finds evidence of what he calls the " <unk> " pattern throughout the United States . In addition to the jackalope , his examples include the sea serpent of Nantucket , which in 1937 led to " stories of <unk> hunting the monster , and footprint discoveries by local businessmen " , accompanied by wide publicity . In similar fashion , Newport , Arkansas , publicized its White River Monster , and Algiers , Louisiana , claimed to be home to a flying Devil Man . Ware , Massachusetts , drew media attention to its local reputation for alligator sightings . Perry , New York , held Silver Lake Sea Serpent Festivals based on a local hoax . The <unk> Festival in Rhinelander , Wisconsin , celebrates " discovery " of a prehistoric creature in a nearby pit . Willow Creek , California , hosts an annual Bigfoot Festival . Since 1950 , Churubusco , Indiana , has celebrated Turtle Days , based on a story , part real and part invented , about the hunt for the Beast of <unk> , a 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) snapping turtle said to be living in a nearby lake . 
 Common to these tales , Gutowski says , is the recurring motif of the quest for the mythical animal , often a monster . The same motif , he notes , appears in American novels such as Moby Dick and Old Man and the Sea and in monster movies such as King Kong and Jaws and in world literature such as Beowulf . The monster motif also appears in tales of contemporary places outside the United States , such as Scotland , with its Loch Ness Monster . What is not global , Gutowski says , is the embrace of local monster tales by American communities that put them to use through " public relations hoaxes , boisterous boosterism , and [ a ] carnival atmosphere ... " . 
 Folklorist Richard M. Dorson also cites the " booster impulse , mingled with entrepreneurial <unk> " as the way that Douglas with its jackalope , Churubusco with its giant turtle , and other towns with their own local legends rise above anonymity . He traces the impulse and the methods to the promotional literature of colonial times that depicted North America as an earthly paradise . Much later , in the 19th century , settlers transferred that optimistic vision to the American West , where it culminated in " boosterism " . Although other capitalist countries advertise their products , Dorson says , " ... the intensity of the American ethos in advertising , <unk> , attention @-@ getting , media @-@ manipulating to sell a product , a personality , a town is beyond compare .

 = Rocket Science ( film ) = 
 Rocket Science is a 2007 American comedy @-@ drama film written and directed by Jeffrey Blitz , and starring Reece Thompson , Anna Kendrick , Nicholas D 'Agosto , Vincent Piazza , and Aaron Yoo . It tells the story of Hal Hefner , a fifteen @-@ year @-@ old stutterer who decides to join his school 's debate team when he develops a crush on its star member , and addresses the themes of coming of age , sexuality , and finding one 's voice . 
 Blitz conceived a rough storyline for the film while making Spellbound , a documentary about 1999 's Scripps National Spelling Bee , but an HBO Films executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence when he told her about his experiences as a stutterer . The film 's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada ; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow @-@ up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out . The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore , Maryland and Trenton , New Jersey . 
 Rocket Science premiered on January 19 , 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and was theatrically released on August 10 . It was not a financial success , earning only US $ 756 @,@ 000 from its $ 4 @.@ 5 million budget , though it was well @-@ received by critics . Reviewers praised Thompson and Kendrick 's performances and the film 's parallels to real life ; others believed that the film was deliberately quirky and forgettable . It was nominated for Sundance 's Dramatic Grand Jury Prize and three Independent Spirit Awards . Though it failed to win any of the Grand Jury Prizes at Sundance , Blitz won its Dramatic Directing Award . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Hal Hefner is a fifteen @-@ year @-@ old student of Plainsboro , New Jersey with a pronounced stutter . His older brother Earl is an obsessive @-@ compulsive kleptomaniac , his father Doyle has recently walked out on the family after a heated argument , and his mother Juliet has begun to date the father of his school friend , Heston . 
 Hal is riding the school bus home one day when he is approached by Ginny Ryerson , the articulate , competitive star of the debate team . She urges him to join her and replace her former partner , Ben <unk> , who has dropped out of high school after falling silent mid @-@ speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship . Though Hal initially declines , he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner . Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools . When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate , he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet , where Ginny joins him . Hal kisses her hopefully , and they make out , but she subsequently falls out of contact with him . Ginny 's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate . 
 On the day of the tournament , Coach Lumbly tells the debate team that Ginny has transferred to Townsend Prep for the remainder of her senior year and that Hal will be paired with Heston for the day . Struggling with his speech and his stutter , Hal calls his therapist , who suggests that he sing his speech or talk with a foreign accent . Hal and Heston finish the day without much success , while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker , which inexplicably goes missing . Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team , telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school 's chances of winning . He breaks into Earl 's bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen tequila , then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis 's house , who lives across the street from Ginny . A drunken Hal drags Lewis 's mother 's cello across the street and throws it through Ginny 's window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate , Ram . 
 Later in the year , Hal 's mother breaks up with Heston 's father , and Hal decides to seek out Ginny and return her trophy , which he stole . She rejects his apology , and he travels to Trenton — the " Big City " — to find Ben , Ginny 's former debate partner . Hal convinces Ben to debate with him , and they register as a home @-@ schooled team in the upcoming Policy Debate Championships . In order to overcome his stutter , Ben helps Hal to write his entire speech to the tune of " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " . During the tournament , Hal is interrupted in the middle of his song @-@ speech by Coach Lumbly and a Debate Official who disqualify Hal and Ben on the grounds that neither of them is home @-@ schooled . Ben is satisfied with their efforts , but Hal finds Ginny before leaving . He insists that one day will be his day , while she tells him that it was not easy for her to betray him as he walks off as he insults her with " the finger " . He spends the evening at a nearby beach , and when his father picks him up , Hal tries to tell him that life and love " shouldn 't be rocket science " , although he is unable to say the phrase " rocket science " due to his stutter . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner , a shy fifteen @-@ year @-@ old student at Plainsboro High School , New Jersey with a pronounced stutter . Beginning in late 2004 , Rocket Science 's producers traveled to several American and Canadian cities looking for an actor to play the lead role of Hal . At one point , Carter Jenkins was set to play Hal , but NBC blocked this as he was contracted for further episodes of Surface . HBO Films told the producers after six months of searching for a Hal that it would abandon the project if a lead actor was not found in two weeks , at which point a desperate Jeffrey Blitz watched all of the unsolicited audition tapes that he had been sent and " knew immediately we had a promising candidate " when he saw Thompson 's tape . Although a casting call was originally posted for a teenage boy aged 13 – 18 who had a stutter and could also act , Thompson had previously been taught how to stutter . However Blitz wanted Hal to stutter in a different style , knowing he was going to block up on a particular word and looking for ways to work round it . Before filming , Thompson was taught this specific style by a speech pathologist . 
 Anna Kendrick plays Ginny Ryerson , the ambitious and competitive star of the Plainsboro High School debate team . Anna Kendrick was one of the first cast members to sign on to the film . Blitz recalls writing " Anna Kendrick is Ginny Ryerson " after her audition and , after auditioning many other girls , she was cast . To prepare for her role , Kendrick learned the typical debating strategy of " spreading " , a rapid @-@ fire delivery used in order to present as much evidence and information as possible within a time limit . Kendrick and Nicholas D 'Agosto studied with a college debate coach and also viewed a live high school debate . Ginny 's comment " I upped your game , little man " was inserted into the script by Blitz from a journal which he asked Kendrick to write in character . 
 Nicholas D 'Agosto plays Ben <unk> , Ginny 's former debate partner who dropped out of high school to work at a dry cleaners after falling silent <unk> and losing the championship trophy . " Nick takes his work very seriously — it 's an approach that 's very much like Ben , in my mind , " said Blitz of D 'Agosto , calling his performance " just right " . D 'Agosto joked about his being cast as a high school student , having been cast as a student previously in Election , which was released eight years before Rocket Science , in 1999 . Like Kendrick , D 'Agosto had to learn a number of debating techniques to prepare for his role . 
 Vincent Piazza plays Earl Hefner , Hal 's obsessive @-@ compulsive , <unk> older brother . Vincent Piazza was studying at the New York acting school where Rocket Science casting sessions were being held ; he decided to audition and was one of the first actors to be cast . When he first auditioned , he spoke with a lisp , said Blitz : " I eventually decided to do away with the lisp — one major speech impediment per family is plenty — but kept many of the rest of the choices Vince brought to Earl . " Blitz cited Piazza 's portrayal of Earl as an example of " the strong choices that actors make in interpreting their character " . 
 Aaron Yoo plays Heston , Hal and Earl 's bi @-@ curious school friend who ends up joining Hal in the debate team . " Aaron made Heston almost an alien among the kids of New Jersey . He 's never quite connected to the scene but he 's always aware of it , " said Blitz about Yoo 's performance as Heston . He says Yoo was cast because of the " dramatic decisions " he brought to Heston 's portrayal " from the start " . 
 Josh Kay plays Lewis <unk> , an eleven @-@ year @-@ old boy whom Hal befriends while loitering in the street outside Ginny 's house . Blitz was pleased with Kay 's original audition : " When Josh Kay came in to audition in New York , it was instantly obvious that he was perfect : smart , deadpan and with a natural ability to either nail the timing of the lines himself or mimic my reading to him . " 
 Denis O 'Hare plays Doyle Hefner , Hal 's father who walks out on the family abruptly , following an argument with his wife about suitcases . Denis O 'Hare originally auditioned in 2005 for an alternate role , and , describing O 'Hare as a " must @-@ have " , Blitz had him re @-@ audition at a different session in the role of Doyle . Because of scheduling conflicts , O 'Hare was only available for filming on two days of production : the first day and the last , filming one of the first scenes of the film and also the final scene . 
 Maury Ginsberg plays Mr. Lewinsky , Hal 's vain speech therapist who offers no successful advice . The character was based on Blitz 's own experiences as a youth with many well @-@ meaning but mostly ineffective therapists when he sought treatments to his stutter . 
 Jonah Hill plays the Junior Philosopher , a teenager Hal meets in the library while studying for the policy debate with Ginny . Hill had initially auditioned for another role in the film , but was unavailable as he was shooting another film at the same time . Blitz was keen to have him appear , though , and so wrote him a small role as the Junior Philosopher , appearing in only two scenes . 
 Dan Cashman voices the narrator . Blitz chose to use an third @-@ person narrative narrator to juxtapose Hal , a character with no voice , with a character who is " nothing but a disembodied voice , a purely articulate voice " , showing " the gulf between who Hal is and who he wishes to be " . 
 Blitz and the film 's producers considered having celebrity cameos in Hal 's parents ' roles , though he decided that cameos would draw away from the film as the celebrities would not be " onscreen long enough for them to become someone other than the celebrity " . In between shooting the film and its release , Hill became a well @-@ known celebrity with the films Knocked Up and Superbad ; Blitz describes being " bummed about that " because of his reluctance to feature celebrities . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Film critic Justin Chang , writing for Variety , summarized the film as " eloquent about love , self @-@ realization and adolescent angst " . The main theme addressed in Rocket Science is Hal 's coming of age , which is portrayed both by his understanding of love and finding his voice . The film takes its title from Hal 's closing quote that understanding life and love " shouldn 't be rocket science " . 
 Blitz described Hal as " lost in the mystery of love " and he " loved the idea that a kid who is lost when he 's confronted by love and sex would be saddled with the name Hal Hefner " , an homage to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner . Throughout the film , Hal is seen to be surrounded by sex and relationships — <unk> for the seasons of the year are placed over images of kissing students ; Hal listens to his mother having intercourse with her new boyfriend ; his friend Lewis shows Hal images from the Kama Sutra ; while Lewis 's parents attempt to mend their relationship through music therapy — but the adults in the film were written to be similarly confused and frustrated with love . " In a world where all the children are trying so hard to be like adults " , according to Stylus ' Yannick LeJacq , " the adults are all sullenly try [ ing ] to reenact their childhood , taking every chance to ignore their children and savor the meaningless void of leisure time . " 
 Blitz believed that Hal 's stuttering was a metaphor for his lack of mastery of life and love : " He can 't control this thing that ought to be so simple ... And so much of his life is like that . " Journalist Mark Baumer highlighted the juxtaposition of Hal with the fast @-@ talking debaters , who are at opposite ends of the spectrum with their speech but are both struggling with communication and expression . Blitz said that " Even when [ the children ] can speak incredibly fast and are packing their sentences with tons of SAT words , they still don 't know exactly what they 're talking about . There is still a question about whether their content of what they 're talking about matches up with what they 're feeling or trying to express . Whether it 's the kid who 's talking a million miles an hour , but saying nothing or the kid who isn 't able to get out any word at all they 're both at the mercy of not knowing how to express what 's inside them . "

 After the success of his 2002 documentary Spellbound , Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films . Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound : " I kept thinking , what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words ? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because he was in love with a girl ? " He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound , several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters . Despite claiming to be " allergic " to autobiographical films , he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that , as a teenager , he joined his school 's debate team to try and overcome his stutter . He says that he is uninterested in teen films , so " the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like . " He was aware of the clichés in teen films , so " tried to undo them without wrecking them " . Blitz wrote the script " off and on " over a year in between stints of commercial directing . He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies , though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson , Alexander Payne , Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson — the latter despite Blitz specifically saying , " I did not want a Wes Andersen [ sic ] <unk> artificial world . " 
 While many parts of Rocket Science are completely fictitious , a number of the story 's details are lifted directly from Blitz 's own experiences . In several scenes of the film , Hal is trying to ask for a slice of pizza but cannot say the word " pizza " ; this is drawn from Blitz 's experience of trying to order a hamburger from hotel room service without being able to say the word " hamburger " . Hal 's first debate scene is based on Blitz 's first debate , where , for a full eight minutes , he could only make the sound " <unk> " , and the scene in which Hal throws a cello through a window was inspired by Blitz 's own destruction of a flute . While Blitz grew up in Ridgewood , New Jersey , he chose to set the narrative in Plainsboro , New Jersey — a place he has never visited — because it was closer to Trenton , rather than New York City . He found it humorous that the characters referred to Trenton as the " Big City " and that Plainsboro seemed to orbit around a dead city , Trenton , in comparison to New York . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Blitz hired Belgian Jo Willems as the cinematographer , having collaborated previously on commercials . Blitz admired Willems ' " European sensibility about shooting " and wanted to use his aesthetic to " tell a story that was equal parts deadpan and suggestive of the ' real ' world " . In creating a " look " for the film , he said that he relied upon " almost opposite impulses " — to tell the story intimately but also carry the comedy . Through the film , he used lighting and art direction that felt real , while framing the shots to come across as deadpan . Production designer Rick Butler chose bland , simple furniture and commonplace houses and cars to give the film a sense of timelessness and familiarity . The color palette in both production and costume design was drab and ordinary to give a deadpan undertone . Blitz was most inspired by the cinematography and production design of Hal Ashby 's films : " I watched his films again and again ... He has a masterful blending of absurd comedy and naturalism . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The night before filming began , Blitz took Thompson , Piazza and Yoo to dinner , insisting that they stay in character . Thompson , as Hal , was unable to tell the waitress what he wanted to order ; Piazza , as Earl , obsessive @-@ compulsively asked the waitress for a fresh straw each time she passed ; and Yoo , as Heston , could not decide what to order and had the waitress explain the menu repeatedly . The purpose of the evening , according to Blitz , was for the actors to " be comfortable around each other inhabiting their roles without self @-@ consciousness " , as each of their roles required them to act in potentially embarrassing ways . 
 Principal photography began in Baltimore , Maryland on the week beginning July 18 , 2005 , the project receiving a tax rebate as part of Baltimore 's Employer Wage Rebate Program for filmmakers . The film was shot on a 30 @-@ day schedule with an overall budget of $ 4 @.@ 5 million . Blitz chose to film in Maryland , as its child labour laws are much less restrictive than those of New Jersey , where the film is set . This was important because Reece Thompson , who was sixteen years old at the time , appears in almost every scene . While Baltimore stood in for Plainsboro , New Jersey , scenes set in Trenton , New Jersey were filmed on location , including shots of the Lower Trenton Bridge over the Delaware River . The final scenes of the film took place on a boardwalk at the Jersey Shore with the shoot concluding at 5 am . While filming , Blitz sometimes used hand gestures from the director 's chair instead of yelling " cut " because of his stutter . 
 = = Score and soundtrack = = 
 Jeffrey Blitz wanted the film 's music to be " sweet and a touch melancholy and just a step out of rhythm " , demonstrating Hal 's sense of himself in the world , and to express his teenage angst while " maintain [ ing ] an underlying sweetness " . While writing the Rocket Science script , Blitz had been listening to indie rock band Clem Snide 's music and suggested the use of their music on the soundtrack to the HBO executive producers . He contacted Clem Snide 's lead singer <unk> Barzelay to use some of the band 's songs , but Barzelay says " it just made more sense for me to write original instrumental music " , and composed the incidental score himself . When choosing instruments , he tried to create sounds that would match Hal 's awkwardness . " I had this little ukulele that I never played ... And Jeffrey [ Blitz ] had gotten a little bee in his bonnet about the accordion ... and then at one point I started using a kazoo . " One of his original songs , " I Love the Unknown " , was chosen from the 1999 album Your Favorite Music . 
 Blitz also chose to use the Violent Femmes ' songs " Blister in the Sun " , " Kiss Off " , and a cover version of " Add It Up " . The Violent Femmes ' songs were chosen for the film by Blitz before filming had begun as he believed that they expressed " the rage of love gone wrong better than any band out there " , and they allowed their songs to be used in the film after reading the script . Blitz thought that the Violent Femmes suggested " both [ Hal 's ] anger and the humor all around it " .

 When reviewed by the Motion Picture Association of America , Rocket Science was rated R for strong sexual language , brief sex , brief nudity , some violence and a scene depicting teen drinking . Jeffrey Blitz described the decision as " mind @-@ boggling " and " ludicrous " ; he claimed that the images of Kama Sutra seen briefly in the film were " antique Indian paintings " and that the teenagers ' discussion of blow jobs was harmless as they had clearly never engaged in fellatio themselves . He criticized the MPAA for its PG @-@ 13 rating of Live Free or Die Hard ( also released in 2007 ) , which involves " a girl getting groped at the beginning , all sorts of cursing , gigantic body count , just completely fucking crazy . " Other questionable elements were altered during production , including a more graphical male beefcake calendar shown to Hal by Heston .

" The Chicago Tribune 's Michael Phillips , who gave the film 2 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars , felt that it " doesn 't quite work " and " the spark goes out of the writing " when Hal seeks out Ben in Trenton .

 = U.S. Route 13 in Delaware = 
 U.S. Route 13 ( US 13 ) is a U.S. highway running from Fayetteville , North Carolina north to Morrisville , Pennsylvania . In the U.S. state of Delaware , the route runs for 103 @.@ 33 mi ( 166 @.@ 29 km ) . It traverses the entire length of the state from the Maryland state line in Delmar , Sussex County to the Pennsylvania state line in Claymont , New Castle County . US 13 connects many important cities and towns in Delaware , including Seaford , Dover , and Wilmington . The entire length of US 13 in Delaware is a multilane divided highway with the exceptions of the segment through Wilmington and parts of Philadelphia Pike in Claymont . Between the Maryland border and Dover , US 13 serves as one of the main north @-@ south routes across the Delmarva Peninsula . From Dover north to the Wilmington area , the route is followed by the limited @-@ access Delaware Route 1 ( DE 1 ) toll road , which crosses the route several times and has multiple interchanges with it . US 13 bypasses downtown Wilmington to the east before it heads northeast of the city parallel to Interstate 495 ( I @-@ 495 ) and the Delaware River to Claymont . 
 The portion of US 13 between Delmar and Dover was constructed as a state highway during the 1920s . Between Dover and Wilmington , the route was built as part of the cross @-@ state DuPont Highway , which was completed in 1923 and improved transportation between northern and southern Delaware . North of Wilmington , what would become US 13 was originally built as the Philadelphia Pike in the 1820s and improved to a state highway by 1920 . US 13 was designated through Delaware when the U.S. Highway System was created in 1926 . The route was widened into a divided highway between Dover and Wilmington in the 1930s and between Delmar and Dover in the 1950s . US 13 was routed to bypass Dover in the 1950s . In 1970 , US 13 was moved to its current alignment between Wilmington and Claymont on a bypass built in the 1930s . The portion of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington saw heavy traffic heading to the Delaware Beaches in the summer , which led to the construction of a freeway " Relief Route " . This freeway was built as DE 1 , which was completed in 2003 . The construction of DE 1 necessitated the realignment of US 13 in two places .

 Before the numbering of the U.S. Highway System , there were many roads that ran north @-@ south across Delaware along the rough alignment of the present route . In the 18th century , the King 's Highway ran between Dover and Wilmington ; south of Dover it continued southeast toward Lewes . By the later part of that century , a post road ran from Horn Town , Virginia north across the Delmarva Peninsula . The road ran between Dover and Wilmington , where it continued northeast to the Pennsylvania border and headed toward Philadelphia . In 1813 , the Wilmington and Philadelphia Turnpike Company was chartered to build a turnpike running from the Brandywine Bridge in Wilmington northeast to the Pennsylvania border , where the roadway would continue to Philadelphia . A 3 @.@ 75 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 04 km ) long portion of the road near Wilmington was finished in 1816 with the remainder completed in 1823 . With the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 , the Philadelphia Pike was to be improved by the state . The Philadelphia Pike was upgraded to a state highway by 1920 . 
 = = = Construction of state highways = = = 
 The portion of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington was built as part of the DuPont Highway . The DuPont Highway was proposed in 1908 by Thomas Coleman DuPont as a modern road that was to run from Selbyville north to Wilmington as part of a philanthropic measure . This roadway was planned to improve travel and bring economic development to Kent and Sussex counties . The DuPont Highway was to be modeled after the great boulevards of Europe and was to have a 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) wide right @-@ of @-@ way consisting of a 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) wide roadway for automobiles flanked by dual trolley lines , 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) wide roadways for heavy vehicles , 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) wide unpaved roadways for horses , and sidewalks . Utilities were to be buried underground below the horse roadways . The highway was also to include agricultural experimental stations and monuments for future surveying . Trolley revenues would help pay for the construction of the roadway . After portions of the DuPont Highway were built , these portions were planned to be turned over to the state at no charge . 
 In 1911 , the Coleman DuPont Road , Inc. was established and construction on the highway began . By 1912 , construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right @-@ of @-@ way . DuPont would narrow the proposed right @-@ of @-@ way to 100 feet ( 30 m ) in order to compromise with opponents of the highway in addition to offering <unk> whose properties were affected by the highway five times the assessed value of the land five years after the highway was completed . The DuPont Highway would end up being built on a 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) alignment with a 32 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) wide roadway . The length of the DuPont Highway between Selbyville and Wilmington was completed in 1923 , with one of the final portions to be completed at the Drawyers Creek north of Odessa . A ceremony marking the completion of the highway was held in Dover on July 2 , 1924 . The completion of the DuPont Highway improved transportation between northern and southern Delaware and would lead to the expansion of state highways in Delaware . 
 Work also took place on constructing a state highway running from the Maryland border in Delmar north to Dover . By 1920 , most of the highway in Sussex County had been completed with the exceptions of a portion north of Laurel and a portion north of Bridgeville . In Kent County , the state highway was completed between the Sussex County border and Farmington . The portion between Farmington and Woodside was under contract by 1920 while the portion between Woodside and Dover was under proposal . By 1924 , the entire length of the state highway between Delmar and Dover was completed . A bascule bridge over the Nanticoke River in Seaford was completed in March 1925 . In 1925 , recommendations were made to improve the South Market Street Causeway over the Christina River in Wilmington , which included a new bridge over the river . Construction on the drawbridge began in May 1926 . In 1927 , the new drawbridge , the four @-@ lane South Market Street Bridge , opened over the Christina River on South Market Street in Wilmington , replacing a previous drawbridge that was only two lanes wide . 
 With the proposal of the U.S. Highway System in 1925 , US 13 was planned as one of three routes to pass through Delaware , running from the Maryland border in Delmar via Dover and Wilmington to the Pennsylvania border in Claymont . US 13 was designated on November 11 , 1926 . US 13 followed the state highway between the Maryland border in Delmar and Dover , the DuPont Highway between Dover and Wilmington , Market Street through Wilmington , and the Philadelphia Pike between Wilmington and the Pennsylvania border in Claymont . Between the Maryland border and US 40 ( now DE 273 ) in Hares Corner , US 13 was part of the Ocean Highway , an Atlantic coastal highway stretching from Jacksonville , Florida to New Brunswick , New Jersey that served as the quickest route between the New York City area and Florida before the introduction of the Interstate Highway System . US 13 is one of only four U.S. Routes that form the highway and Delaware was one of the states that participated in the highway 's formation . 
 = = = Widening and improvements = = = 
 The portion of the DuPont Highway between Dover and Wilmington saw increased traffic from connecting interstate roads and summer travelers , prompting the Delaware State Highway Department to consider widening the highway in 1925 . A year later , the department suggested the Philadelphia Pike be widened along with the DuPont Highway between State Road and Wilmington . This proposal included widening the bridge over a Pennsylvania Railroad line ( now abandoned ) in Farnhurst that was built in 1902 . US 13 was widened to four lanes between State Road and Wilmington and between Shellpot Park and Bellevue Quarry along the Philadelphia Pike in 1927 . The same year , the department recommended expanding the road between St. Georges and State Road into a divided highway . In 1928 , the widening of Philadelphia Pike was completed . In 1929 , the portion of the highway between St. Georges and State Road was widened into a divided highway . The department recommended widening the part of US 13 between Delmar and Dover in 1930 as it was one of the main routes across the Delmarva Peninsula . In addition , plans began to widen the route into a divided highway between Drawyers Creek north of Odessa and St. Georges . The divided highway portion of US 13 between Drawyers Creek and St. Georges was completed in September 1931 . Also , work on widening the route to a divided highway between <unk> and Drawyers Creek and from State Road to Wilmington began . The same year , recommendations began to extend the divided highway portion of US 13 south to Dover . 
 In 1932 , the portion of US 13 between Felton and Dover was widened . In addition , the divided highway between Reynolds ' Corner and Drawyers Creek was completed in September and work began on widening US 13 into a divided highway between Smyrna and Reynolds ' Corner . The completion of the divided highway between State Road and Wilmington was slated for summer 1933 . This widening project included widening the bridge over the Pennsylvania Railroad in Farnhurst . In 1933 , the divided highway portion of US 13 was extended south to Smyrna while the portion between Dover and Smyrna was under contract . The same year , the remainder of US 13 south of Dover was widened . The divided highway portion between Dover and Smyrna was finished on September 22 , 1934 , marking the completion of widening US 13 between Dover and Wilmington into a divided highway . At the time , US 13 between Dover and Wilmington was the best superhighway and the longest stretch of divided highway in the world . 
 In 1937 , the narrow crossing of Silver Lake along State Street in Dover was replaced with a new , wider bridge . On July 18 , 1938 , the grade crossing with the Reading Railroad ( now abandoned ) and the Pennsylvania Railroad ( now Norfolk Southern 's Shellpot Branch ) on South Market Street in Wilmington was eliminated with the opening of a bridge over the railroad tracks . On January 10 , 1939 , the S.S. Waukegan struck and destroyed the bridge carrying US 13 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal in St. Georges , killing the bridge tender . The destruction of the bridge led to detours for US 13 along smaller roads . Plans were made to construct a high @-@ level crossing of the canal . Work on acquiring the right @-@ of @-@ way for the new bridge took place in 1940 . Construction of the bridge took place in 1941 . The replacement steel truss St. Georges Bridge over the canal opened on January 31 , 1942 . This bridge was the first four @-@ lane crossing of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal . 
 In 1950 , recommendations were made by the chief engineer of the DSHD to widen US 13 into a divided highway between Delmar and Dover . The divided highway was completed from Hearne 's Mill north to just south of Greenwood in 1952 . The highway bypassed Bridgeville to the east , rerouting US 13 off Main Street in that town . In 1953 , the divided highway portion of US 13 was built around Seaford . The divided highway was completed between the Maryland border in Delmar and Hearne 's Mill and from Harrington to Dover in 1954 . The new alignment of US 13 between Delmar and Hearne 's Mill was built further to the east , with the former two @-@ lane alignment running through Delmar , Laurel , Blades , and Seaford becoming US 13 Alt . The bypassed two @-@ lane alignment between Canterbury and Camden was also designated as US 13 Alt . In 1956 , work was underway in widening US 13 into a divided highway between south of Greenwood and Harrington . The widening of this portion of US 13 was finished in 1957 , completing widening US 13 to a divided highway between Delmar and Wilmington . By 1957 , the former alignment of US 13 in Bridgeville along Main Street was designated US 13 Alt . ( now US 13 Bus . ) while US 13 Alt. between Delmar and Hearne 's Mill was decommissioned . 
 The alignment of US 13 in Wilmington has been shifted multiple times to improve traffic flow . By 1932 , US 13 was split into the one @-@ way pair of French Street northbound and Market Street southbound in the downtown area . Both directions of the route was shifted to use French Street by 1936 . In 1952 , a new bridge over the Christina River , the Walnut Street Bridge , was proposed to link Walnut Street in the downtown area with the Dupont Parkway section of US 13 south of the city . Under this plan , the Walnut Street Bridge would be used for northbound traffic while the South Market Street Bridge would be used for southbound traffic . By this time , US 13 was routed on a one @-@ way pair in the downtown area , using Walnut Street northbound and French Street southbound . A year later , the Walnut Street Bridge project was under contract . Construction on the project began in 1955 . Construction of the Walnut Street Extension , which included the drawbridge , approach roads , and a new bridge under the Pennsylvania Railroad ( now Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor ) , was completed in 1957 . As a result , US 13 was split into the one @-@ way pair of South Walnut Street northbound and South Market Street southbound between the south end of the city and downtown . 
 Construction on an interchange with the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach at Farnhurst began on July 12 , 1950 . On August 16 , 1951 , the Delaware Memorial Bridge opened to traffic . US 40 was rerouted to use the new Delaware Memorial Bridge to cross the Delaware River , being realigned to follow US 13 north from Hares Corner and Farnhurst . Upgrades to the Farnhurst interchange were finished in July 1961 that provided a connection to the Delaware Turnpike that opened on November 14 , 1963 . In 1954 , there were plans to replace the intersection with DE 41 / DE 141 in Basin Corner with a modified cloverleaf interchange in an effort to reduce traffic congestion . Construction on the interchange began in September of that year . The interchange between US 13 / US 40 and DE 41 / DE 141 was completed in 1956 . Plans were made to widen the Philadelphia Pike to a four @-@ lane road between Bellevue Road and Claymont in 1954 . The widening project was completed in 1956 . 
 In 1961 , the concrete bridge carrying southbound US 13 over the Drawyers Creek north of Odessa was closed due to deterioration from the tidal waters of the creek , with plans for a new bridge made . Two years later , the southbound lanes were moved to the new bridge over the creek , following a straighter alignment . 
 = = = Bypasses of Dover and Wilmington = = = 
 Plans were made in 1918 for a bypass to the east of downtown Wilmington for through traffic , avoiding Market Street . The bypass would utilize Heald Street , Church and Spruce streets , and would construct Northeast Boulevard heading northeast from the Eleventh Street Bridge . In 1934 , the state highway department began work on this bypass . Among them was the improvement of Church and Spruce streets by widening and paving them . In addition , the Northeast Boulevard was built , running from the Eleventh Street Bridge over the Brandywine Creek northeast to Edgemoor Road in Edgemoor . Construction began this year on an extension of the road northeast to Holly Oak . The following year , the Northeast Boulevard was completed between Edgemoor and Holly Oak . The construction of the Northeast Boulevard led to increased residential and industrial development along the route . In the later part of 1936 , construction began on the portion of the Wilmington bypass along Heald Street along with Northeast Boulevard ( renamed Governor Printz Boulevard ) between Holly Oak and Claymont . Both of these projects were finished in fall 1937 and completed a bypass of the portion of US 13 through Wilmington . This bypass route was designated as US 13 Alt. in 1939 . In 1939 , construction was authorized to widen Governor Printz Boulevard into a divided highway . The widening of the road to a divided highway was completed in 1940 . In 1942 , a bridge was completed on Heald Street that eliminated the grade crossing with a Pennsylvania Railroad line . US 13 Alt. was widened to four lanes between 11th Street and 30th Street in Wilmington in 1956 . In 1970 , US 13 was rerouted to bypass downtown Wilmington on the US 13 Alt. alignment while US 13 Bus. was designated onto the former US 13 alignment from the southern border of Wilmington to Claymont . 
 In 1935 , the portion of present @-@ day US 13 between Bay Road and State Street was built as part of a realigned US 113 . In 1950 , a contract was awarded to build a bypass of Dover , with construction soon following . The divided highway bypass for US 13 to the east of downtown Dover was completed in April 1952 , rerouting US 13 off Governors Avenue and State Street through Dover . This bypass route would run concurrent with US 113 between Bay Road and State Street . The former alignment of the route through Dover along Governors Avenue and State Street was designated US 13 Alt. by 1959 . The US 113 concurrency was removed from US 13 in 1966 ; this was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) in 1974 along with the rerouting of US 113 Alt. to follow the route between South State Street and US 113 . US 113 Alt. was removed from US 13 in 2004 as part of the truncation of US 113 from Dover to Milford . 
 = = = Relief Route = = = 
 Between 1958 and 1971 , studies were conducted for a bypass of the segment of US 13 through Dover along with a connector between Dover and Frederica . The proposed routing began at US 113 and DE 12 north of Frederica and continued northwest to Woodside , where it was planned to cross US 13 . From here , the bypass was to run to the west of Dover and head north to its terminus at US 13 north of Cheswold . As part of planning of the Dover Bypass , an archaeological survey had to be conducted along part of the proposed route between 1972 and 1975 . By 1976 , construction of the Dover Bypass was postponed indefinitely . From 1971 to 1978 , a north @-@ south extension of the Delaware Turnpike between Wilmington and Dover was studied . In 1983 , studies began for a " Relief Route " of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington . The new highway was proposed in order to relieve US 13 of traffic heading to the Delaware Beaches in the summer . Prior to the beginning of construction , an archaeological survey was conducted along the proposed route of the freeway in 1986 . The same year , plans were unveiled for the route , which would begin at US 113 south of Dover and head north to US 13 in Tybouts Corner . The Relief Route would cross US 13 several times , passing to the east of Dover and Smyrna and to the west of Odessa . The US 13 Relief Route would be designated DE 1 in 1988 , keeping US 13 on its original alignment . DE 1 was extended north from Milford to Tybouts Corner in 1988 , following US 13 between Dover and Tybouts Corner . 
 As part of building DE 1 , the Puncheon Run Connector was proposed to provide a connection between DE 1 and US 13 in the southern part of Dover . The original plan for the connector in 1987 called for upgrading US 13 into a freeway between Woodside and Dover , with interchanges at DE 10 in Camden and Webbs Lane in Dover . In 1992 , plans for the freeway upgrade to US 13 between Woodside and Dover were dropped . On December 21 , 1993 , DE 1 was completed between US 113 at Dover Air Force Base and US 13 north of Smyrna , with DE 1 rerouted off US 13 between Dover and Smyrna . 
 In December 1995 , the section of DE 1 between US 13 in St. Georges and US 13 in Tybouts Corner opened , which included the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge . Following the completion of this segment , DE 1 was rerouted off the surface alignment of US 13 that crossed the St. Georges Bridge . Subsequently , US 13 was rerouted to follow the new DE 1 between the DE 72 interchange and Tybouts Corner . Construction of the new DE 1 had severed US 13 south of Tybouts Corner , with part of the former alignment north of the DE 7 intersection becoming a two @-@ lane road while the section south of there became an extended DE 7 to the intersection with US 13 and DE 72 . In building DE 1 across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal , there were initially plans to demolish the aging St. Georges Bridge that carried US 13 over the canal . The plan drew concerns from residents in St. Georges who feared the community would be split in half . The St. Georges Bridge was instead kept and was refurbished . A southbound exit and northbound entrance at US 13 south of the <unk> and Delaware Canal Bridge along DE 1 was built as required by federal legislation that gave the state $ 115 million toward construction of the new canal bridge . 
 The segment of DE 1 between US 13 south of Odessa and US 13 in St. Georges opened in November 1999 . DE 1 was subsequently rerouted off US 13 between those two points . The construction of the final segment of DE 1 between Smyrna and Odessa resulted in a portion of US 13 south of Odessa being shifted further east as DE 1 would be built on top of the road . A service road would serve properties on the southbound side of US 13 . In October 2001 , northbound US 13 was realigned to the new alignment south of Odessa in order to build DE 1 in that area . In May 2002 , US 13 was shifted to a new southbound alignment south of Odessa , with the former portion of the route in that area becoming a service road known as Harris Road . The final section of DE 1 between Smyrna and Odessa opened on May 21 , 2003 . As a result , DE 1 was moved off US 13 between Smyrna and Odessa .

 = Saratoga campaign = 
 The Saratoga Campaign in 1777 was an attempt by the British high command for North America to gain military control of the strategically important Hudson River valley during the American Revolutionary War . It ended in the surrender of the British army , which historian Edmund Morgan argues , " was a great turning point of the war , because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory . 
 The primary thrust of the campaign was planned and initiated by General John Burgoyne . Commanding a main force of some 8 @,@ 000 men , he moved south in June from Quebec , <unk> up Lake Champlain to middle New York , then marched over the divide and down the Hudson Valley to Saratoga . He initially skirmished there with the Patriot defenders with mixed results . Then , after losses in the Battles of Saratoga in September and October , his deteriorating position and ever increasing size of the American army forced him to surrender his forces to the American General Horatio Gates on October 17 . 
 The elaborate plans drawn up in London all failed . Colonel Barry St. Leger was assigned to move on Albany , New York east through the Mohawk River valley , but was forced to retreat during the siege of Fort Stanwix after losing his Indian allies . The major expedition from the south never materialized due to miscommunication with London when General William Howe sent his army to take Philadelphia rather than sending it up the Hudson River to coordinate with Burgoyne . A last @-@ minute effort to reinforce Burgoyne from New York City was made in early October , but it was too little , too late . 
 The American victory was an enormous morale boost to the fledgling nation . More important , it convinced France to enter the war in alliance with the United States , openly providing money , soldiers , and munitions , as well fighting a naval war worldwide against Britain . 
 = = British strategy = = 
 Toward the end of 1776 it was apparent to many in England that pacification of New England was very difficult due to the high concentration of Patriots ; and so London decided to isolate New England and concentrate on the central and southern regions where Loyalists supposedly could be rallied . 
 In December 1776 General John Burgoyne met with Lord Germain , the British Secretary of State for the Colonies and the government official responsible for managing the war , to set strategy for 1777 . There were two main armies in North America to work with : General Guy Carleton 's army in Quebec and General William Howe 's army , which had driven George Washington 's army from New York City in the New York campaign . 
 = = = Howe 's plan to attack Philadelphia = = = 
 On November 30 , 1776 , Howe — the British commander @-@ in @-@ chief in North America — wrote to Germain , outlining an ambitious plan for the 1777 campaign . Howe said that if Germain sent him substantial reinforcements , he could launch multiple offensives , including sending 10 @,@ 000 men up the Hudson River to take Albany , New York . Then , in the autumn , Howe could move south and capture the U.S. capital of Philadelphia . Howe soon changed his mind after writing this letter : the reinforcements might not arrive , and the retreat of the Continental Army over the winter of 1776 – 77 made Philadelphia an increasingly vulnerable target . Therefore , Howe decided that he would make the capture Philadelphia the primary object of the 1777 campaign . Howe sent Germain this revised plan , which Germain received on February 23 , 1777 . 
 = = = Burgoyne 's plan to capture Albany = = = 
 Burgoyne , seeking to command a major force , proposed to isolate New England by an invasion from Quebec into New York . This had already been attempted by General Carleton in 1776 , although he had stopped short of a full @-@ scale invasion due to the lateness of the season . Carleton was heavily criticized in London for not taking advantage of the American retreat from Quebec , and he was also intensely disliked by Germain . This , combined with rival Henry Clinton 's failed attempt to capture Charleston , South Carolina , placed Burgoyne in a good position to get command of the 1777 northern campaign . 
 Burgoyne presented a written plan to Lord Germain on February 28 , 1777 ; Germain approved it and gave Burgoyne command of the main expedition . 
 Burgoyne 's invasion plan from Quebec had two components : he would lead the main force of about 8 @,@ 000 men south from Montreal along Lake Champlain and the Hudson River Valley while a second column of about 2 @,@ 000 men ( which Barry St. Leger was chosen to lead ) , would move from Lake Ontario east down the Mohawk River valley in a strategic diversion . Both expeditions would converge upon Albany , where they would link up with troops from Howe 's army marching up the Hudson . Control of the Lake Champlain @-@ Lake George @-@ Hudson River route from Canada to New York City would cut off New England from the rest of the American colonies . 
 The last part of Burgoyne 's proposal , the advance by Howe up the Hudson from New York City , proved to be the most controversial part of the campaign . Germain approved Burgoyne 's plan after having received Howe 's letter detailing his proposed offensive against Philadelphia . Whether Germain told Burgoyne , who was still in London at that time , about Howe 's revised plans is unclear : while some sources claim he did , others state that Burgoyne was not notified of the changes until the campaign was well underway . Historian Robert Ketchum believes that Burgoyne would probably have been aware of the problems that lay ahead had he been notified of the Philadelphia plan . 
 Whether Germain , Howe , and Burgoyne had the same expectations about the degree to which Howe was supposed to support the invasion from Quebec is also unclear . What is clear is that Germain either left his generals with too much latitude , or without a clearly defined overall strategy . In March 1777 Germain had approved of Howe 's Philadelphia expedition and did not include any express orders for Howe to go to Albany . Yet Germain also sent Howe a copy of his instructions to Carleton which plainly stated that the northern army was to make a junction with Howe 's army at Albany . In a letter from Germain to Howe dated May 18 , 1777 he made clear that the Philadelphia expedition should " be executed in time for you to co @-@ operate with the army ordered to proceed from Canada and put itself under your command . " This last letter , however , was not received by Howe until after he had departed New York for the Chesapeake . To attack Philadelphia Howe could either have moved overland through New Jersey or by sea via the Delaware Bay , both options would have kept him a position to aid Burgoyne if necessary . The final route he took , through the Chesapeake Bay , was immensely time @-@ consuming and left him wholly unable to assist Burgoyne as Germain had envisioned . The decision was so difficult to understand that Howe 's more hostile critics accused him of deliberate treachery . 
 Burgoyne returned to Quebec on May 6 , 1777 , bearing a letter from Lord Germain which introduced the plan but lacked some details . This produced another of the conflicts of command that plagued the British throughout the war . Lieutenant General Burgoyne technically outranked Major General Carleton , but Carleton was still the governor of Quebec . Germain 's instructions to Burgoyne and Carleton had specifically limited Carleton 's role to operations in Quebec . This slight against Carleton , combined with Carleton 's failure to get command of the expedition , led to his resignation later in 1777 , and to his refusal to supply troops from the Quebec regiments to garrison the forts at Crown Point and Ticonderoga after they were captured . 
 = = American strategy = = 
 George Washington , whose army was encamped at Morristown , New Jersey , and the American military command did not have a good picture of British plans for 1777 . The principal question on the minds of Washington and his generals Horatio Gates and Philip Schuyler — who both were at turns responsible for the Continental Army 's Northern Department and its defense of the Hudson River — was of the movements of Howe 's army in New York . They had no significant knowledge of what was being planned for the British forces in Quebec , in spite of Burgoyne 's complaints that everyone in Montreal knew what he was planning . The three generals disagreed on what Burgoyne 's most likely movement was , and Congress also rendered the opinion that Burgoyne 's army was likely to move to New York by sea . 
 Partly as a result of this indecision , and the fact that it would be isolated from its supply lines if Howe moved north , the garrisons at Fort Ticonderoga and elsewhere in the Mohawk and Hudson valleys were not significantly increased . Schuyler took the measure in April 1777 of sending a large regiment under Colonel Peter Gansevoort to rehabilitate Fort Stanwix in the upper Mohawk valley as a step in defending against British movements in that area . Washington also ordered four regiments to be held at Peekskill , New York that could be directed either to the north or the south in response to British movements . 
 American troops were allocated throughout New York theater in June 1777 . About 1 @,@ 500 troops ( including those of Colonel Gansevoort ) were in outposts along the Mohawk River , about 3 @,@ 000 troops were in the Hudson River highlands under the command of General Israel Putnam , and Schuyler commanded about 4 @,@ 000 troops ( inclusive of local militia and the troops at Ticonderoga under St. Clair ) . 
 = = International interest = = 
 Ever since the Seven Years ' War , France 's foreign ministers , beginning with Choiseul , had followed the general idea that the independence of Britain 's North American colonies would be good for France and bad for Britain , and furthermore that French attempts to recover parts of New France would be detrimental to that cause . When war broke out in 1775 , the Comte de Vergennes , then the Foreign Minister , outlined a series of proposals that led to secret French and also Spanish support of Congress , and some preparations for the possibility of war , including expansion of their navies . Vergennes did not think open participation in the war was diplomatically or politically feasible until Washington 's army demonstrated its strength and ability to gain military victories without significant assistance . 
 To further the aim of French participation in the war , Vergennes closely monitored news from North America and London , and worked to remove impediments to Spanish participation in the war . Vergennes went so far as to propose war to King Louis XVI in August 1776 , but news of Howe 's capture of New York City scuttled that plan . 
 = = Campaign begins = = 
 Most of Burgoyne 's army had arrived in Quebec in the spring of 1776 , and participated in the routing of Continental Army troops from the province . In addition to British regulars , the troops in Quebec included several regiments from the German principalities of Hesse @-@ Hanau ( from whose name the common reference of Hessian comes ) and Brunswick under the command of Baron Friedrich Adolph Riedesel . Of these regular forces , 200 British regulars and 300 to 400 Germans were assigned to St. Leger 's Mohawk valley expedition , and about 3 @,@ 500 men remained in Quebec to protect the province . The remaining forces were assigned to Burgoyne for the campaign to Albany . The regular forces were supposed to be augmented by as many as 2 @,@ 000 militia raised in Quebec ; by June , Carleton had managed to raise only three small companies . Burgoyne had also expected as many as 1 @,@ 000 Indians to support the expedition . About 500 joined between Montreal and Crown Point . 
 Burgoyne 's army was beset by transport difficulties before it left Quebec , something that apparently neither Burgoyne nor Carleton anticipated . As the expedition expected to travel mainly over water , there were few wagons , horses , and other draft animals available to move the large amount of equipment and supplies on the land portions of the route . Only in early June did Carleton issue orders to procure carts sufficient to move the army . Consequently , the carts were poorly constructed of green wood , and the teams were driven by civilians who were at a higher risk of desertion . 
 On June 13 , 1777 , Burgoyne and Carleton reviewed the assembled forces at St. John 's on the Richelieu River , just north of Lake Champlain , and Burgoyne was ceremonially given command . In addition to five sailing ships built the previous year , a sixth had been built and three had been captured after the Battle of Valcour Island . These provided some transport as well as military cover for the large fleet of transport boats that moved the army south on the lake . 
 The army that Burgoyne launched the next day had about 7 @,@ 000 regulars and over 130 artillery pieces ranging from light mortars to 24 pound ( 11 kg ) pieces . His regulars were organized into an advance force under Brigadier General Simon Fraser , and two divisions . Major General William Phillips led the 3 @,@ 900 British regulars on the right , while Baron Riedesel 's 3 @,@ 100 Brunswickers and <unk> held the left . His regular troops started out in good condition but some , notably some of the German dragoons , were poorly equipped for wilderness fighting . 
 Colonel St. Leger 's expedition was also assembled by mid @-@ June . His force , a mixed company of British regulars , Loyalists , Hessians , and rangers from the Indian department , numbering about 750 men left Lachine , near Montreal , on June 23 . 
 = = Ticonderoga falls = = 
 Burgoyne 's army traveled up the lake and occupied the undefended Fort Crown Point by June 30 . The screening activities of Burgoyne 's Indian support were highly effective at keeping the Americans from learning the details of his movements . General Arthur St. Clair , who had been left in command of Fort Ticonderoga and its surrounding defenses with a garrison of about 3 @,@ 000 regulars and militia , had no idea on July 1 of the full strength of Burgoyne 's army , large elements of which were then just 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) away . St. Clair had been ordered by General Schuyler to hold out as long as possible , and had planned two avenues of retreat . 
 Open skirmishing began on the outer defense works of Ticonderoga on July 2 . By July 4 , most of the American garrison was either at Fort Ticonderoga or nearby Mount Independence , the extensive fortifications on the Vermont side of the lake . Unknown to the Americans , their withdrawal from an outer defensive position cleared a way for the British to place artillery on the hilltop known then as Sugar Loaf ( now Mount Defiance ) , whose heights commanded the fort . St. Clair withdrew the night after spotting British cannon on Sugar Loaf on July 5 , and Burgoyne 's men occupied the main fortification and the positions on Mount Independence on July 6 . The uncontested surrender of the supposedly impregnable fort caused a public and political uproar . Although a later investigation cleared both Schuyler and St. Clair of any wrongdoing in the withdrawal , it caused the Continental Congress to replace Schuyler with General Horatio Gates as commander of the Northern Department of the Continental Army in August . 
 Burgoyne sent forces out from his main body to pursue the retreating army , which St. Clair had sent south via two different routes . The British caught up with elements of the retreating Americans at least three times . General Fraser and elements of Baron Riedesel 's troops faced determined resistance in Battle of Hubbardton on July 7 , and a skirmish that same day between the vanguard of the main army met Pierse Long 's retreating companies in a skirmish at Skenesboro . These were followed by another standoff in the Battle of Fort Anne on July 8 , in which a forward company of the British army was nearly decimated . These actions cost the Americans about 50 % more casualties than those incurred by the British , and they demonstrated to the British officers present that the Americans were capable of putting up stiff resistance . Burgoyne 's army was reduced by about 1 @,@ 500 men as a result of the Ticonderoga actions . He left 400 men to garrison the magazine at Crown Point and another 900 to defend Ticonderoga , and the battles that followed resulted in about 200 casualties . 
 The bulk of St. Clair 's army retreated through the New Hampshire Grants ( present @-@ day Vermont ) . St. Clair issued appeals to the states for militia support , and also arranged to have as much of the area 's livestock and supplies delivered to Fort Edward on the Hudson River , where the American armies would regroup . St. Clair reached Fort Edward on July 12 after five days of grueling marches . Some of the remnants that had been scattered at Hubbardton rejoined the army , but Seth Warner and the remains of his regiment were stationed at Manchester in the Grants . 
 = = Reaction and delay = = 
 Burgoyne settled into the house of Loyalist Philip Skene at Skenesboro while the pieces of his army regrouped and he considered his next steps . He penned letters describing the British victory , intended for public consumption . When this news reached the capitals of Europe , King George was happy , and the Comte de Vergennes was not , as the news effectively scuttled an early proposal for French entry into the war . British diplomats increased pressure on the French and Spanish , demanding that they close their ports to American shipping . While this demand was refused , it markedly increased the tensions between the powers . The news was also harshly received by Congress and the American public , including slanders that St. Clair and Schuyler had been bribed . 
 On July 10 Burgoyne issued orders for the next series of movements . Most of the army was to take the rough road from Skenesboro to Fort Edward via Fort Anne , while the heavy artillery was to be transported down Lake George to Fort Edward . Riedesel 's troops were sent back up the road toward Castleton , primarily as a diversion intended to suggest that he might be aiming for the Connecticut River . Burgoyne 's decision to move the army overland via Fort Anne was a curious one , for it contradicted his own earlier commentaries on planning the expedition , in which he presciently observed that defenders could easily block the route . His decision appears to have been motivated by two factors ; the first being the perception that moving the army over water via Lake George would require a retrograde movement that could be perceived as a retreat , and the second being the influence of Philip Skene , whose property would benefit by the improved road Burgoyne would have to build . 
 General Schuyler , at Albany when he received word of Ticonderoga 's fall , immediately rode to Fort Edward , where there was a garrison of about 700 regulars and 1 @,@ 400 militia . He decided to make Burgoyne 's passage as difficult as possible , using the axe as a weapon ; as it was much easier to fell large trees in the enemy 's path than to remove them after they were down , this brought Burgoyne 's advance to a crawl , tiring his troops and forcing them to use up supplies . On July 11 Burgoyne wrote to Lord Germain , complaining that the Americans were systematically felling trees , destroying bridges , and damming streams along the road to Fort Edward . Schuyler also employed scorched earth tactics to deny the British access to local provisions . In spite of Burgoyne 's lack of movement , his scouts were active ; some of Schuyler 's work crews were attacked . 
 Schuyler 's tactics required Burgoyne to build a road through the wilderness for his guns and troops , a task that took about two weeks . They moved out of Skenesboro on July 24 , and reached Fort Edward on July 29 , finding that Schuyler had already abandoned it , in a retreat that ended at Stillwater , New York . Before he left Skenesboro , Burgoyne was joined by about 500 Indians ( mostly Ottawas , but also Fox , Mississauga , Chippewa , and Ojibwe , as well as members of the Iroquois ) from the Great Lakes region under the leadership of St. Luc de la Corne and Charles Michel de Langlade . 
 = = St. Leger 's expedition = = 
 Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger sailed up the St. Lawrence and crossed Lake Ontario to arrive at Oswego without incident . He had about 300 regulars , supported by 650 Canadian and Loyalist militia , and they were joined by 1 @,@ 000 Indians led by John Butler and the Iroquois war chiefs Joseph Brant , Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter . Leaving Oswego on July 25 , they marched to Fort Stanwix on the Mohawk River , and began besieging it on August 2 . About 800 members of the Tryon County militia and their Indian allies marched to relieve the siege , but some of St. Leger 's British and Indians ambushed them on August 6 at the bloody Battle of Oriskany . While the Americans held the field of battle , they retreated because of the heavy casualties they suffered , including the mortal wounding of their leader , General Nicholas Herkimer . Warriors from Iroquois nations fought on both sides of the battle , marking the beginning of a civil war within the Six Nations . During the Oriskany action , the besieged Americans staged a sortie from Fort Stanwix and raided the nearly empty Indian camp . Combined with the significant Indian casualties at Oriskany , this was a significant blow to Indian morale . 
 On August 10 , Benedict Arnold left Stillwater , New York for Fort Stanwix with 800 men of the Continental Army from Schuyler 's Northern Department . He expected to recruit members of the Tryon County militia when he arrived at Fort Dayton on August 21 . Arnold could only raise about 100 militia , as most of the militia men that had been at Oriskany were not interested in joining , so he instead resorted to subterfuge . He staged the escape of a Loyalist captive , who convinced St. Leger that Arnold was coming with a much larger force than he actually had . On this news , Joseph Brant and the rest of St. Leger 's Indians withdrew . They took most of his remaining supplies with them , and St. Leger was forced to raise the siege and head back through Oswego to Quebec . Arnold sent a detachment a short way after them , and turned the rest of his force east to rejoin the American forces at Saratoga . St. Leger 's remaining men eventually arrived at Fort Ticonderoga on September 27 . Their arrival was too late to effectively support Burgoyne , whose army was already being hemmed in by the growing American forces around him . 
 = = Mounting difficulties = = 
 The advance of Burgoyne 's army to Fort Edward was , as with the approach to Ticonderoga , preceded by a wave of Indians , which chased away the small contingent of troops left there by Schuyler . These allies became impatient and began indiscriminate raids on frontier families and settlements , which had the effect of increasing rather than reducing local support to the American rebels . In particular , the death at Indian hands of the attractive young Loyalist settler Jane McCrea was widely publicized and served as a catalyst for rebel support , as Burgoyne 's decision to not punish the perpetrators was seen as unwillingness or inability to keep the Indians under control . 
 Even though the bulk of his army made the trip from Skenesboro to Fort Edward in just five days , the army 's lack of adequate transport served to delay the army again , as the supply train , hampered by a lack of draft animals and carts and wagons that were capable of dealing with the rough tracks through the wilderness , took time to follow . 
 On August 3 , messengers from General Howe finally succeeded in making their way through the American lines to Burgoyne 's camp at Fort Edward . ( Numerous attempts by the British generals to communicate were frustrated by the capture and hanging of their messengers by the Americans . ) The messengers did not bring good news . On July 17 Howe wrote that he was preparing to depart by sea with his army to capture Philadelphia , and that General Clinton , responsible for New York City 's defense , would " act as occurrences may direct " . Burgoyne refused to divulge the contents of this dispatch to his staff . 
 Realizing that he now had a serious supply problem , Burgoyne decided to act on a suggestion that Baron Riedesel had made to him in July . Riedesel , whose forces Burgoyne had stationed at Castleton for a time while he was at Skenesboro , had observed that the area was rich in draft animals and horses , which might be seized for the army 's benefit ( including the mounting of Riedesel 's currently unmounted dragoons ) . Pursuing this idea , Burgoyne sent Colonel Friedrich Baum 's regiment toward western Massachusetts and the New Hampshire Grants on August 9 , along with some Brunswick dragoons . Most of Baum 's detachment never returned from the August 16 Battle of Bennington , and the reinforcements he had sent after them came back after they were ravaged in the same battle , which deprived Burgoyne of nearly 1 @,@ 000 men and the much @-@ needed supplies . What Burgoyne had been unaware of was that St. Clair 's calls for militia support following the withdrawal from Ticonderoga had been answered , and General John Stark had placed 2 @,@ 000 men at Bennington . Stark 's force enveloped Baum 's at Bennington , killing him and capturing much of his detachment . 
 The death of Jane McCrea and the Battle of Bennington , besides acting as rallying cries for the Americans , had another important effect . Burgoyne blamed his Indian and Canadian allies for McCrea 's death , and , even after the Indians had lost 80 of their number at Bennington , Burgoyne showed them no gratitude . As a result , Langlade , La Corne , and most of the Indians left the British camp , leaving Burgoyne with fewer than 100 Indian scouts . Burgoyne was left with no protection in the woods against the American rangers . Burgoyne would later blame La Corne for deserting him , while La Corne countered that Burgoyne never respected the Indians . In the British Parliament , Lord Germain sided with La Corne . 
 = = American change of fortune = = 
 While the tactic of delay worked well in the field , the result in the Continental Congress was a different matter . General Horatio Gates was in Philadelphia when Congress discussed its shock at the fall of Ticonderoga , and Gates was more than willing to help assign the blame to reluctant generals . Some in the Congress had already been impatient with General George Washington , wanting a large , direct confrontation that might eliminate occupation forces but which Washington feared would probably lose the war . John Adams , the head of the War Committee , praised Gates and remarked that " we shall never hold a post until we shoot a general . " Over the objections of the New York delegation , Congress sent Gates to take command of the Northern Department on August 10 . It also ordered states from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts to call out their militias . On August 19 , Gates arrived at Albany to take charge . He was cold and arrogant in manner , and pointedly excluded Schuyler from his first war council . Schuyler left for Philadelphia shortly after , depriving Gates of his intimate knowledge of the area . 
 Throughout the month of August , and continuing into September , militia companies arrived at the Continental Army camps on the Hudson . These were augmented by troops Washington ordered north from the Hudson Highlands as part of General Arnold 's operation to relieve Stanwix . Those troops arrived at the end of August and included the crack sharpshooters of Daniel Morgan 's rifle corps , which he sent north from his own army . News of the American successes at Bennington and Fort Stanwix , combined with outrage over the death of Jane McCrea , rallied support , swelling Gates ' army to over 6 @,@ 000 rank and file . This number did not include Stark 's small army at Bennington , which was reduced in size by disease and the departure of some of its companies , but was also augmented by several hundred troops raised by General Benjamin Lincoln , who was assigned to make attacks against Burgoyne 's supply and communications . 
 = = Saratoga = = 
 The " Battle of Saratoga " is often depicted as a single event , but it was actually a month @-@ long series of maneuvers punctuated by two battles . At the beginning of September 1777 , Burgoyne 's army , now just over 7 @,@ 000 strong , was located on the east bank of the Hudson . He had learned of St. Leger 's failure at Stanwix on August 28 , and even earlier that Howe would not be giving him substantial support from New York City . Faced with the need to reach defensible winter quarters , which would require either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany , he decided on the latter . Subsequent to this decision , he made two further crucial decisions . He decided to deliberately cut communications to the north , so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga , and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position . He therefore ordered Riedesel , whose forces were in the rear , to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south , and ordered the army to cross the river just north of Saratoga , which it did between September 13 and 15 . Moving cautiously , since the departure of his Indian support had deprived him of reliable scouting , Burgoyne advanced to the south . On September 18 the vanguard of his army had reached a position just north of Saratoga , about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from the American defensive line , and skirmishes occurred between the leading elements of the armies . 
 When Gates took over Schuyler 's army , much of it was located near the mouth of the Mohawk River , south of Stillwater . On September 8 he ordered the army , then about 10 @,@ 000 men ( of whom about 8 @,@ 500 were effective combat troops ) , to Stillwater with the idea of setting up defenses there . The Polish engineer Tadeusz Kościuszko found the area inadequate for proper defensive works , so a new location was found about three miles further north ( and about 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Saratoga ) . At this location Kosciusko laid out defensive lines stretching from the river to the bluffs called Bemis Heights . 
 The right side of these defenses was nominally given to General Lincoln , but as he was leading troops intended for a diversion against Ticonderoga , Gates assumed command of that portion of the line himself . Gates put General Arnold , with whom he had previously had a good relationship , in command of the army 's left , the western defenses on Bemis Heights . The relationship between the two soured when Arnold chose to staff his command with friends of Schuyler , whom Gates hated . Combined with the prickly natures of both Gates and Arnold , this eventually brought internal power squabbles to a boil . 
 = = = Freeman 's Farm = = = 
 Both Generals Burgoyne and Arnold recognized the importance of the American left flank . Burgoyne recognized that the American position could be flanked , and divided his forces , sending a large detachment to the west on September 19 . Arnold , also recognizing that a British attack on the left was likely , asked Gates for permission to move his forces out to Freeman 's Farm to anticipate that maneuver . Gates refused to carry out a general movement , since he wanted to wait behind his defenses for the expected frontal attack ; but he did permit Arnold to send Daniel Morgan 's riflemen and some light infantry out for a reconnaissance in force . These forces precipitated the Battle of Freeman 's Farm when they made contact with Burgoyne 's right flank . In the ensuing battle , the British gained control of Freeman 's Farm , but at the cost of 600 casualties , ten percent of their forces . 
 After the battle the feud between Gates and Arnold erupted . Not only did Gates not mention Arnold at all in the official account of the battle he sent to Congress , but he also transferred Morgan 's company ( which had been technically independent but operated under Arnold 's command in the battle ) to his direct command . Arnold and Gates had a noisy argument in Gates ' quarters , in which Gates said that General Lincoln would be replacing him . Following the argument Arnold drafted a letter to Gates outlining his grievances and requesting a transfer to Washington 's command . Gates gave Arnold a pass to leave , and continued to inflict petty indignities on Arnold . A commonly referenced reason why Arnold chose to remain is that a petition signed by all of the line officers except Gates and Lincoln convinced him to stay . While proposals for such a document were considered , there is no contemporary evidence of one actually being drafted and signed . 
 Burgoyne considered renewing the attack the next day , but called it off when Fraser noted that many men were fatigued from the previous day 's exertions . He therefore dug his army in , and waited for news that he would receive some assistance from the south , as a letter he received from General Clinton in New York on September 21 suggested that a movement up the Hudson would draw off some of Gates ' army . Although he was aware of the persistent desertions that were reducing the size of his army and that the army was running short of food and other critical supplies , he did not know that the American army was also daily growing in size , or that Gates had intelligence on how dire the situation was in his camp . 
 = = = Attack on Ticonderoga = = = 
 Unknown to either side at Saratoga until after the battle , General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged an attack against the British position at Fort Ticonderoga . Lincoln had collected 2 @,@ 000 men at Bennington by early September . After marching north to Pawlet , they received word that the guard at Ticonderoga might be susceptible to surprise . Lincoln sent three detachments of 500 men each to " annoy , divide , and distract the enemy . " One went to Skenesboro , which was found to be abandoned by the British . The second went to capture Mount Independence on the east side of Lake Champlain , while the third , led by John Brown , made the approach to Ticonderoga . 
 On the morning of September 18 , Brown surprised the British defenders at the southern end of the portage trail connecting Lake George to Lake Champlain . Rapidly moving up the trail his men continued to surprise British defenders and capture artillery pieces until they reached the height of land just before Ticonderoga , where they occupied the " old French lines " ( so named because it was there that a French defense improbably held against a much larger British army in the 1758 Battle of Carillon ) . On the way he released 100 prisoners ( thus increasing the size of his force ) and captured nearly 300 . His demand for the fort 's surrender was refused , and for the next four days Brown 's men and the fort exchanged cannon fire , to little effect . Since he had insufficient manpower to actually assault the fort , Brown then withdrew to Lake George , where he made an unsuccessful attempt to capture a storage depot on an island in the lake . 
 General Gates wrote to Lincoln on the day of Freeman 's Farm , ordering his force back to Saratoga and that " not one moment should be lost " . Lincoln reached Bemis Heights on September 22 , but the last of his troops did not arrive until the 29th . 
 = = = Sir Henry Clinton attempts a diversion = = = 
 General Howe , when he left New York for Philadelphia , had put General Sir Henry Clinton in charge of New York 's defense , with instructions to assist Burgoyne if opportunities arose . Clinton wrote to Burgoyne on September 12 that he would " make a push at [ Fort ] Montgomery in about ten days " if " you think 2000 men can assist you effectually . " When Burgoyne received the letter he immediately replied , appealing to Clinton for instruction on whether he should attempt to advance or retreat , based on the likelihood of Clinton 's arrival at Albany for support . Burgoyne indicated that if he did not receive a response by October 12 he would be forced to retreat . 
 On October 3 , Clinton sailed up the Hudson River with 3 @,@ 000 men , and on October 6 , one day after receiving Burgoyne 's appeal , captured the highland forts named Clinton and Montgomery . Burgoyne never received Clinton 's dispatches following this victory , as all three messengers were captured . Clinton followed up the victory by dismantling the chain across the Hudson , and sent a raiding force up the river that reached as far north as Livingston Manor on October 16 before turning back . Word of Clinton 's movements only reached Gates after the battle of Bemis Heights . 
 = = = Bemis Heights = = = 
 In addition to the Lincoln 's 2 @,@ 000 men , militia units poured into the American camp , swelling the American army to over 15 @,@ 000 men . Burgoyne , who had put his army on short rations on October 3 , called a council the next day . The decision of this meeting was to launch a reconnaissance in force of about 1 @,@ 700 men toward the American left flank . Burgoyne and Fraser led this detachment out early on the afternoon of October 7 . Their movements were spotted , and Gates wanted to order only Daniel Morgan 's men out in opposition . Arnold said that this was clearly insufficient , and that a large force had to be sent . Gates , put off one last time by Arnold 's tone , dismissed him , saying , " You have no business here . " However , Gates did accede to similar advice given by Lincoln . In addition to sending Morgan 's company around the British right , he also sent Enoch Poor 's brigade against Burgoyne 's left . When Poor 's men made contact , the Battle of Bemis Heights was underway . 
 The initial American attack was highly effective , and Burgoyne attempted to order a withdrawal , but his aide was shot down before the order could be broadcast . In intense fighting , the flanks of Burgoyne 's force were exposed , while the Brunswickers at the center held against Learned 's determined attack . General Fraser was mortally wounded in this phase of the battle . While frequently claimed to be the work of Timothy Murphy , one of Morgan 's men , the story appears to be a 19th @-@ century fabrication . After Fraser 's fall and the arrival of additional American troops , Burgoyne ordered what was left of the force to retreat behind their entrenched lines . 
 General Arnold , frustrated by the sound of fighting he was not involved in , rode off from the American headquarters to join the fray . Arnold , who some claimed was in a drunken fury , took the battle to the British position . The right side of the British line consisted of two earthen redoubts that had been erected on Freeman 's Farm , and were manned by Brunswickers under Heinrich Breymann and light infantry under Lord Balcarres . Arnold first rallied troops to attack Balcarres ' redoubt , without success . He then boldly rode through the gap between the two redoubts , a space guarded by a small company of Canadian irregulars . Learned 's men followed , and made an assault on the open rear of Breymann 's redoubt . Arnold 's horse was shot out from under him , pinning him and breaking his leg . Breymann was killed in the fierce action , and his position was taken . However , night was falling , and the battle came to an end . The battle was a bloodbath for Burgoyne 's troops : nearly 900 men were killed , wounded , or captured , compared to about 150 for the Americans . 
 = = Surrender = = 
 Simon Fraser died of his wounds early the next day , but it was not until nearly sunset that he was buried . Burgoyne then ordered the army , whose entrenchments had been subjected to persistent harassment by the Americans , to retreat . ( One consequence of the skirmishing was that General Lincoln was also wounded . Combined with Arnold 's wounds , this deprived Gates of his top two field commanders . ) 
 It took the army nearly two days to reach Saratoga , in which heavy rain and American probes against the column slowed the army 's pace . Burgoyne was aided by logistical problems in the American camp , where the army 's ability to move forward was hampered by delays in bringing forward and issuing rations . However , Gates did order detachments to take positions on the east side of the Hudson to oppose any attempted crossings . By the morning of October 13 Burgoyne 's army was completely surrounded , so his council voted to open negotiations . Terms were agreed on October 16 that Burgoyne insisted on calling a " convention " rather than a capitulation . 
 Baroness Riedesel , wife of the commander of the German troops , vividly describes in her journal the confusion and besetting starvation of the retreating British army . Her account of the tribulation and death of officers and men , and of the terrified women who had taken shelter in the cellar of what later became known as the Marshall House dramatizes the desperation of the besieged army . 
 On October 17 , following a ceremony in which Burgoyne gave his sword to Gates , only to have it returned , Burgoyne 's army ( approaching 6 @,@ 000 strong ) marched out to surrender their arms while the American musicians played " Yankee Doodle " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 British troops withdrew from Ticonderoga and Crown Point in November , and Lake Champlain was free of British troops by early December . American troops , on the other hand , still had work to do . Alerted to General Clinton 's raids on the Hudson , most of the army marched south toward Albany on October 18 , while other detachments accompanied the " Convention Army " east . Burgoyne and Riedesel became guests of General Schuyler , who had come north from Albany to witness the surrender . Burgoyne was allowed to return to England on parole in May 1778 , where he spent the next two years defending his actions in Parliament and the press . He was eventually exchanged for more than 1 @,@ 000 American prisoners . 
 In response to Burgoyne 's surrender , Congress declared December 18 , 1777 as a national day " for solemn Thanksgiving and praise " in recognition of the military success at Saratoga ; it was the nation 's first official observance of a holiday with that name . 
 = = = Convention Army = = = 
 Under the terms of the convention Burgoyne 's army was to march to Boston , where British ships would transport it back to England , on condition that its members not participate in the conflict until they were formally exchanged . Congress demanded that Burgoyne provide a list of troops in the army so that the terms of the agreement concerning future combat could be enforced . When he refused , Congress decided not to honor the terms of the convention , and the army remained in captivity . The army was kept for some time in sparse camps throughout New England . Although individual officers were exchanged , much of the " Convention Army " was eventually marched south to Virginia , where it remained prisoner for several years . Throughout its captivity , a large number of men ( more than 1 @,@ 300 in the first year alone ) escaped and effectively deserted , settling in the United States . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 On December 4 , 1777 , word reached Benjamin Franklin at Versailles that Philadelphia had fallen and that Burgoyne had surrendered . Two days later , King Louis XVI assented to negotiations for an alliance . The treaty was signed on February 6 , 1778 , and France declared war on Britain one month later , with hostilities beginning with naval skirmishes off Ushant in June . Spain did not enter into the war until 1779 , when it entered the war as an ally of France pursuant to the secret Treaty of Aranjuez . Vergennes ' diplomatic moves following the French entry into the war also had material impact on the later entry of the Dutch Republic into the war , and declarations of neutrality on the part of other important geopolitical players like Russia . 
 The British government of Lord North came under sharp criticism when the news of Burgoyne 's surrender reached London . Of Lord Germain it was said that " the secretary is incapable of conducting a war " , and Horace Walpole opined ( incorrectly , as it turned out ) that " we are ... very near the end of the American war . " Lord North issued a proposal for peace terms in Parliament that did not include independence ; when these were finally delivered to Congress by the Carlisle Peace Commission they were rejected .

 Most of the battlefields of the campaign have been preserved in some way , usually as state or national parks , but also as historic sites under state or federal control . Some monuments erected to mark the battles are listed as National Historic Landmarks and some are separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Many of the battles are regularly reenacted , and the Battle of Bennington ( although it was actually fought in present @-@ day Walloomsac , New York ) is marked in the state of Vermont by Bennington Battle Day . 
 The commemorations of Benedict Arnold 's contributions to the American success of the campaign are particularly noteworthy . The obelisk at Saratoga National Historical Park has , on three of its four sides , alcoves bearing statues of three generals instrumental in the success at Saratoga : Gates , Schuyler , and Morgan . The fourth alcove , representing Arnold , is empty . The park also contains the Boot Monument which , though again without identifying Arnold by name , clearly honors his contribution in the second Saratoga battle . 
 = Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector = 
 In classical mechanics , the Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector ( or simply the LRL vector ) is a vector used chiefly to describe the shape and orientation of the orbit of one astronomical body around another , such as a planet revolving around a star . For two bodies interacting by Newtonian gravity , the LRL vector is a constant of motion , meaning that it is the same no matter where it is calculated on the orbit ; equivalently , the LRL vector is said to be conserved . More generally , the LRL vector is conserved in all problems in which two bodies interact by a central force that varies as the inverse square of the distance between them ; such problems are called Kepler problems . 
 The hydrogen atom is a Kepler problem , since it comprises two charged particles interacting by Coulomb 's law of electrostatics , another inverse square central force . The LRL vector was essential in the first quantum mechanical derivation of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom , before the development of the Schrödinger equation . However , this approach is rarely used today . 
 In classical and quantum mechanics , conserved quantities generally correspond to a symmetry of the system . The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to an unusual symmetry ; the Kepler problem is mathematically equivalent to a particle moving freely on the surface of a four @-@ dimensional ( <unk> ) sphere , so that the whole problem is symmetric under certain rotations of the four @-@ dimensional space . This higher symmetry results from two properties of the Kepler problem : the velocity vector always moves in a perfect circle and , for a given total energy , all such velocity circles intersect each other in the same two points . 
 The Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector is named after Pierre @-@ Simon de Laplace , Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz . It is also known as the Laplace vector , the Runge – Lenz vector and the Lenz vector . Ironically , none of those scientists discovered it . The LRL vector has been re @-@ discovered several times and is also equivalent to the dimensionless eccentricity vector of celestial mechanics . Various generalizations of the LRL vector have been defined , which incorporate the effects of special relativity , electromagnetic fields and even different types of central forces . 
 = = Context = = 
 A single particle moving under any conservative central force has at least four constants of motion , the total energy E and the three Cartesian components of the angular momentum vector L with respect to the origin . The particle 's orbit is confined to a plane defined by the particle 's initial momentum p ( or , equivalently , its velocity v ) and the vector r between the particle and the center of force ( see Figure 1 , below ) . 
 As defined below ( see Mathematical definition ) , the Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector ( LRL vector ) A always lies in the plane of motion for any central force . However , A is constant only for an inverse @-@ square central force . For most central forces , however , this vector A is not constant , but changes in both length and direction ; if the central force is approximately an inverse @-@ square law , the vector A is approximately constant in length , but slowly rotates its direction . A generalized conserved LRL vector <formula> can be defined for all central forces , but this generalized vector is a complicated function of position , and usually not expressible in closed form . 
 The plane of motion is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector L , which is constant ; this may be expressed mathematically by the vector dot product equation r · L 
 = 0 ; likewise , since A lies in that plane , A · L = 
 0 . 
 The LRL vector differs from other conserved quantities in the following property . Whereas for typical conserved quantities , there is a corresponding cyclic coordinate in the three @-@ dimensional Lagrangian of the system , there does not exist such a coordinate for the LRL vector . Thus , the conservation of the LRL vector must be derived directly , e.g. , by the method of Poisson brackets , as described below . Conserved quantities of this kind are called " dynamic " , in contrast to the usual " geometric " conservation laws , e.g. , that of the angular momentum . 
 = = History of rediscovery = = 
 The LRL vector A is a constant of motion of the important Kepler problem , and is useful in describing astronomical orbits , such as the motion of the planets . Nevertheless , it has never been well known among physicists , possibly because it is less intuitive than momentum and angular momentum . Consequently , it has been rediscovered independently several times over the last three centuries . 
 Jakob Hermann was the first to show that A is conserved for a special case of the inverse @-@ square central force , and worked out its connection to the eccentricity of the orbital ellipse . Hermann 's work was generalized to its modern form by Johann Bernoulli in 1710 . At the end of the century , Pierre @-@ Simon de Laplace rediscovered the conservation of A , deriving it analytically , rather than geometrically . In the middle of the nineteenth century , William Rowan Hamilton derived the equivalent eccentricity vector defined below , using it to show that the momentum vector p moves on a circle for motion under an inverse @-@ square central force ( Figure 3 ) . 
 At the beginning of the twentieth century , Josiah Willard Gibbs derived the same vector by vector analysis . Gibbs ' derivation was used as an example by Carle Runge in a popular German textbook on vectors , which was referenced by Wilhelm Lenz in his paper on the ( old ) quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom . In 1926 , the vector was used by Wolfgang Pauli to derive the spectrum of hydrogen using modern quantum mechanics , but not the Schrödinger equation ; after Pauli 's publication , it became known mainly as the Runge – Lenz vector . 
 = = Mathematical definition = = 
 For a single particle acted on by an inverse @-@ square central force described by the equation 
 <formula> 
 the LRL vector A is defined mathematically by the formula 
 where 
 m is the mass of the point particle moving under the central force , 
 p is its momentum vector , 
 L = r × p is its angular momentum vector , 
 k is a parameter that describes the strength of the central force , 
 r is the position vector of the particle ( Figure 1 ) , and 
 <formula> is the corresponding unit vector , i.e. , <formula> where r is the magnitude of r . 
 Since the assumed force is conservative , the total energy E is a constant of motion , 
 <formula> 
 Furthermore , the assumed force is a central force , and thus the angular momentum vector L is also conserved and defines the plane in which the particle travels . The LRL vector A is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector L because both p × L and r are perpendicular to L. It follows that A lies in the plane of the orbit . 
 This definition of the LRL vector A pertains to a single point particle of mass m moving under the action of a fixed force . However , the same definition may be extended to two @-@ body problems such as Kepler 's problem , by taking m as the reduced mass of the two bodies and r as the vector between the two bodies . 
 A variety of alternative formulations for the same constant of motion may also be used . The most common is to scale by mk to define the eccentricity vector 
 <formula> 
 = = Derivation of the Kepler orbits = = 
 The shape and orientation of the Kepler problem orbits can be determined from the LRL vector as follows . Taking the dot product of A with the position vector r gives the equation 
 <formula> 
 where θ is the angle between r and A ( Figure 2 ) . <unk> the scalar triple product 
 <formula> 
 and rearranging yields the defining formula for a conic section , provided that A is a constant , which is the case for the inverse square force law , 
 of eccentricity e , 
 <formula> 
 and latus rectum 
 <formula> 
 The major semiaxis a of the conic section may be defined using the latus rectum and the eccentricity 
 <formula> 
 where the minus sign pertains to ellipses and the plus sign to <unk> . 
 Taking the dot product of A with itself yields an equation involving the energy E , 
 <formula> 
 which may be rewritten in terms of the eccentricity , 
 <formula> 
 Thus , if the energy E is negative ( bound orbits ) , the eccentricity is less than one and the orbit is an ellipse . Conversely , if the energy is positive ( unbound orbits , also called " scattered orbits " ) , the eccentricity is greater than one and the orbit is a hyperbola . Finally , if the energy is exactly zero , the eccentricity is one and the orbit is a parabola . In all cases , the direction of A lies along the symmetry axis of the conic section and points from the center of force toward the periapsis , the point of closest approach . 
 = = Circular momentum hodographs = = 
 The conservation of the LRL vector A and angular momentum vector L is useful in showing that the momentum vector p moves on a circle under an inverse @-@ square central force . 
 Taking the dot product of 
 <formula> 
 with itself yields 
 <formula> 
 Further choosing L along the z @-@ axis , and the major semiaxis as the x @-@ axis , yields the locus equation for p , 
 . 
 In other words , the momentum vector p is confined to a circle of radius mk / L = L / ℓ centered on ( 0 , A / L ) . The eccentricity e corresponds to the cosine of the angle η shown in Figure 3 . 
 In the degenerate limit of circular orbits , and thus vanishing A , the circle centers at the origin ( 0 @,@ 0 ) . For brevity , it is also useful to introduce the variable <formula> . 
 This circular <unk> is useful in illustrating the symmetry of the Kepler problem . 
 = = Constants of motion and <unk> = = 
 The seven scalar quantities E , A and L ( being vectors , the latter two contribute three conserved quantities each ) are related by two equations , A · L 
 = 0 and A2 = 
 <unk> + 2 <unk> , giving five independent constants of motion . ( Since the magnitude of A , hence the eccentricity e of the orbit , can be determined from the total angular momentum L and the energy E , only the direction of A is conserved independently ; moreover , since A must be perpendicular to L , it contributes only one additional conserved quantity . ) 
 This is consistent with the six initial conditions ( the particle 's initial position and velocity vectors , each with three components ) that specify the orbit of the particle , since the initial time is not determined by a constant of motion . The resulting 1 @-@ dimensional orbit in 6 @-@ dimensional phase space is thus completely specified . 
 A mechanical system with d degrees of freedom can have at most 2d − 1 constants of motion , since there are 2d initial conditions and the initial time cannot be determined by a constant of motion . A system with more than d constants of motion is called superintegrable and a system with 2d − 1 constants is called maximally superintegrable . Since the solution of the Hamilton – Jacobi equation in one coordinate system can yield only d constants of motion , superintegrable systems must be separable in more than one coordinate system . The Kepler problem is maximally superintegrable , since it has three degrees of freedom ( d = 3 ) and five independent constant of motion ; its Hamilton – Jacobi equation is separable in both spherical coordinates and parabolic coordinates , as described below . 
 <unk> superintegrable systems follow closed , one @-@ dimensional orbits in phase space , since the orbit is the intersection of the phase @-@ space <unk> of their constants of motion . Consequently , the orbits are perpendicular to all gradients of all these independent <unk> , five in this specific problem , and hence are determined by the generalized cross products of all of these gradients . As a result , all superintegrable systems are automatically describable by Nambu mechanics , alternatively , and equivalently , to Hamiltonian mechanics . 
 <unk> superintegrable systems can be quantized using commutation relations , as illustrated below . Nevertheless , equivalently , they are also quantized in the Nambu framework , such as this classical Kepler problem into the quantum hydrogen atom . 
 = = Evolution under perturbed potentials = = 
 The Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector A is conserved only for a perfect inverse @-@ square central force . In most practical problems such as planetary motion , however , the interaction potential energy between two bodies is not exactly an inverse square law , but may include an additional central force , a so @-@ called perturbation described by a potential energy h ( r ) . In such cases , the LRL vector rotates slowly in the plane of the orbit , corresponding to a slow apsidal precession of the orbit . 
 By assumption , the perturbing potential h ( r ) is a conservative central force , which implies that the total energy E and angular momentum vector L are conserved . Thus , the motion still lies in a plane perpendicular to L and the magnitude A is conserved , from the equation A2 
 = <unk> + <unk> . The perturbation potential h ( r ) may be any sort of function , but should be significantly weaker than the main inverse @-@ square force between the two bodies . 
 The rate at which the LRL vector rotates provides information about the perturbing potential h ( r ) . Using canonical perturbation theory and action @-@ angle coordinates , it is straightforward to show that A rotates at a rate of ,

 m r2 <unk> was used to convert the time integral into an angular integral ( Figure 5 ) . The expression in angular brackets , 〈 h ( r ) 〉 , represents the perturbing potential , but averaged over one full period ; that is , averaged over one full passage of the body around its orbit . Mathematically , this time average corresponds to the following quantity in curly braces . This averaging helps to suppress fluctuations in the rate of rotation . 
 This approach was used to help verify Einstein 's theory of general relativity , which adds a small effective inverse @-@ cubic perturbation to the normal Newtonian gravitational potential , 
 <formula> 
 Inserting this function into the integral and using the equation 
 <formula> 
 to express r in terms of θ , the precession rate of the periapsis caused by this non @-@ Newtonian perturbation is calculated to be 
 <formula> 
 which closely matches the observed anomalous precession of Mercury and binary pulsars . This agreement with experiment is strong evidence for general relativity . 
 = = Poisson brackets = = 
 The algebraic structure of the problem is , as explained in later sections , SO ( 4 ) / <unk> ~ SO ( 3 ) × SO ( 3 ) . The three components Li of the angular momentum vector L have the Poisson brackets 
 <formula> 
 where i = 1 @,@ 2 @,@ 3 and <unk> is the fully antisymmetric tensor , i.e. , the Levi @-@ Civita symbol ; the summation index s is used here to avoid confusion with the force parameter k defined above . The Poisson brackets will be extended to quantum mechanical commutation relations in the next section and Lie brackets in a following section . 
 As noted below , a scaled Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector D may be defined with the same units as angular momentum by dividing A by <formula> . The Poisson brackets of D with the angular momentum vector L can then be written in a similar form 
 <formula> 
 The Poisson brackets of D with itself depend on the sign of E , i.e. , on whether the total energy E is negative ( producing closed , elliptical orbits under an inverse @-@ square central force ) or positive ( producing open , hyperbolic orbits under an inverse @-@ square central force ) . For negative energies – i.e. , for bound systems – the Poisson brackets are 
 <formula> 
 whereas , for positive energy , the Poisson brackets have the opposite sign , 
 <formula> 
 The Casimir invariants for negative energies are 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 and have vanishing Poisson brackets with all components of D and L , 
 <formula> 
 C2 is trivially zero , since the two vectors are always perpendicular . 
 However , the other invariant , C1 , is non @-@ trivial and depends only on m , k and E. Upon canonical quantization , this invariant allows the energy levels of hydrogen @-@ like atoms to be derived using only quantum mechanical canonical commutation relations , instead of the conventional solution of the Schrödinger equation . 
 = = Quantum mechanics of the hydrogen atom = = 
 Poisson brackets provide a simple guide for quantizing most classical systems : the commutation relation of two quantum mechanical operators is specified by the Poisson bracket of the corresponding classical variables , multiplied by <unk> . 
 By carrying out this quantization and calculating the eigenvalues of the C1 Casimir operator for the Kepler problem , Wolfgang Pauli was able to derive the energy levels of hydrogen @-@ like atoms ( Figure 6 ) and , thus , their atomic emission spectrum . This elegant 1926 derivation was obtained before the development of the Schrödinger equation . 
 A subtlety of the quantum mechanical operator for the LRL vector A is that the momentum and angular momentum operators do not commute ; hence , the quantum operator cross product of p and L must be defined carefully . Typically , the operators for the Cartesian components As are defined using a <unk> ( Hermitian ) product , 
 <formula> 
 from which the corresponding additional ladder operators for L can be defined , 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 These further connect different eigenstates of L2 , so different spin <unk> , among themselves . 
 A normalized first Casimir invariant operator , quantum analog of the above , can likewise be defined , 
 <formula> 
 where H − 1 is the inverse of the Hamiltonian energy operator , and I is the identity operator . 
 Applying these ladder operators to the eigenstates | <unk> 〉 of the total angular momentum , azimuthal angular momentum and energy operators , the eigenvalues of the first Casimir operator , C1 , are seen to be quantized , n2 − 1 . Importantly , by dint of the vanishing of C2 , they are independent of the ℓ and m quantum numbers , making the energy levels degenerate . 
 Hence , the energy levels are given by 
 <formula> 
 which coincides with the Rydberg formula for hydrogen @-@ like atoms ( Figure 6 ) . The additional symmetry operators A have connected the different ℓ <unk> among themselves , for a given energy ( and C1 ) , dictating n2 states at each level . In effect , they have enlarged the angular momentum group SO ( 3 ) to SO ( 4 ) / <unk> ~ SO ( 3 ) × SO ( 3 ) . 
 = = Conservation and symmetry = = 
 The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to a subtle symmetry of the system . In classical mechanics , symmetries are continuous operations that map one orbit onto another without changing the energy of the system ; in quantum mechanics , symmetries are continuous operations that " mix " electronic orbitals of the same energy , i.e. , degenerate energy levels . A conserved quantity is usually associated with such symmetries . For example , every central force is symmetric under the rotation group SO ( 3 ) , leading to the conservation of angular momentum L. Classically , an overall rotation of the system does not affect the energy of an orbit ; quantum mechanically , rotations mix the spherical harmonics of the same quantum number l without changing the energy . 
 The symmetry for the inverse @-@ square central force is higher and more subtle . The peculiar symmetry of the Kepler problem results in the conservation of both the angular momentum vector L and the LRL vector A ( as defined above ) and , quantum mechanically , ensures that the energy levels of hydrogen do not depend on the angular momentum quantum numbers l and m . The symmetry is more subtle , however , because the symmetry operation must take place in a higher @-@ dimensional space ; such symmetries are often called " hidden symmetries " . 
 Classically , the higher symmetry of the Kepler problem allows for continuous alterations of the orbits that preserve energy but not angular momentum ; expressed another way , orbits of the same energy but different angular momentum ( eccentricity ) can be transformed continuously into one another . Quantum mechanically , this corresponds to mixing orbitals that differ in the l and m quantum numbers , such as the s ( l 
 = 0 ) and p ( l = 
 1 ) atomic orbitals . Such mixing cannot be done with ordinary three @-@ dimensional translations or rotations , but is equivalent to a rotation in a higher dimension . 
 For negative energies – i.e. , for bound systems – the higher symmetry group is SO ( 4 ) , which preserves the length of four @-@ dimensional vectors 
 <formula> 
 In 1935 , Vladimir Fock showed that the quantum mechanical bound Kepler problem is equivalent to the problem of a free particle confined to a three @-@ dimensional unit sphere in four @-@ dimensional space . Specifically , Fock showed that the Schrödinger wavefunction in the momentum space for the Kepler problem was the stereographic projection of the spherical harmonics on the sphere . Rotation of the sphere and <unk> results in a continuous mapping of the elliptical orbits without changing the energy ; quantum mechanically , this corresponds to a mixing of all orbitals of the same energy quantum number n . Valentine <unk> noted subsequently that the Poisson brackets for the angular momentum vector L and the scaled LRL vector D formed the Lie algebra for SO ( 4 ) . Simply put , the six quantities D and L correspond to the six conserved angular momenta in four dimensions , associated with the six possible simple rotations in that space ( there are six ways of choosing two axes from four ) . This conclusion does not imply that our universe is a three @-@ dimensional sphere ; it merely means that this particular physics problem ( the two @-@ body problem for inverse @-@ square central forces ) is mathematically equivalent to a free particle on a three @-@ dimensional sphere . 
 For positive energies – i.e. , for unbound , " scattered " systems – the higher symmetry group is SO ( 3 @,@ 1 ) , which preserves the Minkowski length of 4 @-@ vectors 
 <formula> 
 Both the <unk> and positive @-@ energy cases were considered by Fock and <unk> and have been reviewed <unk> by <unk> and <unk> . 
 The orbits of central @-@ force systems – and those of the Kepler problem in particular – are also symmetric under reflection . Therefore , the SO ( 3 ) , SO ( 4 ) and SO ( 3 @,@ 1 ) groups cited above are not the full symmetry groups of their orbits ; the full groups are O ( 3 ) , O ( 4 ) and O ( 3 @,@ 1 ) , respectively . Nevertheless , only the connected subgroups , SO ( 3 ) , SO ( 4 ) and SO ( 3 @,@ 1 ) , are needed to demonstrate the conservation of the angular momentum and LRL vectors ; the reflection symmetry is irrelevant for conservation , which may be derived from the Lie algebra of the group . 
 = = Rotational symmetry in four dimensions = = 
 The connection between the Kepler problem and four @-@ dimensional rotational symmetry SO ( 4 ) can be readily visualized . Let the four @-@ dimensional Cartesian coordinates be denoted ( w , x , y , z ) where ( x , y , z ) represent the Cartesian coordinates of the normal position vector r . The three @-@ dimensional momentum vector p is associated with a four @-@ dimensional vector <formula> on a three @-@ dimensional unit sphere 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> is the unit vector along the new w @-@ axis . The transformation mapping p to η can be uniquely inverted ; for example , the x @-@ component of the momentum equals 
 <formula> 
 and similarly for py and <unk> . In other words , the three @-@ dimensional vector p is a stereographic projection of the four @-@ dimensional <formula> vector , scaled by p0 ( Figure 8 ) . 
 Without loss of generality , we may eliminate the normal rotational symmetry by choosing the Cartesian coordinates such that the z @-@ axis is aligned with the angular momentum vector L and the momentum hodographs are aligned as they are in Figure 7 , with the centers of the circles on the y @-@ axis . Since the motion is planar , and p and L are perpendicular , <unk> 
 = <unk> = 
 0 and attention may be restricted to the three @-@ dimensional vector <formula> 
 = ( <unk> , ηx , <unk> ) . The family of Apollonian circles of momentum hodographs ( Figure 7 ) correspond to a family of great circles on the three @-@ dimensional <formula> sphere , all of which intersect the ηx @-@ axis at the two foci ηx = 
 ± 1 , corresponding to the momentum <unk> foci at px = ± p0 . These great circles are related by a simple rotation about the ηx @-@ axis ( Figure 8 ) . This rotational symmetry transforms all the orbits of the same energy into one another ; however , such a rotation is orthogonal to the usual three @-@ dimensional rotations , since it transforms the fourth dimension <unk> . This higher symmetry is characteristic of the Kepler problem and corresponds to the conservation of the LRL vector . 
 An elegant action @-@ angle variables solution for the Kepler problem can be obtained by eliminating the redundant four @-@ dimensional coordinates <formula> in favor of elliptic cylindrical coordinates ( χ , ψ , φ ) 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 where sn , cn and dn are Jacobi 's elliptic functions . 
 = = Generalizations to other potentials and relativity = = 
 The Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector can also be generalized to identify conserved quantities that apply to other situations . 
 In the presence of a uniform electric field E , the generalized Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector <formula> is 
 <formula> 
 where q is the charge of the orbiting particle . Although <formula> is not conserved , it gives rise to a conserved quantity , namely <formula> . 
 Further generalizing the Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector to other potentials and special relativity , the most general form can be written as 
 <formula> 
 where u 
 = 1 / r ( cf . Bertrand 's theorem ) and ξ = 
 cos θ , with the angle θ defined by 
 <formula> 
 and γ is the Lorentz factor . As before , we may obtain a conserved binormal vector B by taking the cross product with the conserved angular momentum vector 
 <formula> 
 These two vectors may likewise be combined into a conserved dyadic tensor W , 
 <formula> 
 In illustration , the LRL vector for a non @-@ relativistic , isotropic harmonic oscillator can be calculated . Since the force is central , 
 <formula> 
 the angular momentum vector is conserved and the motion lies in a plane . 
 The conserved dyadic tensor can be written in a simple form 
 <formula> 
 although it should be noted that p and r are not necessarily perpendicular . 
 The corresponding Runge – Lenz vector is more complicated , 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> 
 is the natural oscillation frequency and 
 <formula> 
 = = Proofs that the Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector is conserved in Kepler problems = = 
 The following are arguments showing that the LRL vector is conserved under central forces that obey an inverse @-@ square law . 
 = = = Direct proof of conservation = = = 
 A central force <formula> acting on the particle is 
 <formula> 
 for some function <formula> of the radius <formula> . Since the angular momentum <formula> is conserved under central forces , <formula> and 
 <formula> 
 where the momentum <formula> and where the triple cross product has been simplified using Lagrange 's formula 
 <formula> 
 The identity 
 <formula> 
 yields the equation 
 <formula> 
 For the special case of an inverse @-@ square central force <formula> , this equals 
 <formula> 
 Therefore , A is conserved for inverse @-@ square central forces 
 <formula> 
 A shorter proof is obtained by using the relation of angular momentum to angular velocity , <formula> , which holds for a particle traveling in a plane perpendicular to <formula> . Specifying to inverse @-@ square central forces , the time derivative of <formula> is 
 <formula> 
 where the last equality holds because a unit vector can only change by rotation , and <formula> is the orbital velocity of the rotating vector . Thus , A is seen to be a difference of two vectors with equal time derivatives . 
 As described below , this LRL vector A is a special case of a general conserved vector <formula> that can be defined for all central forces . However , since most central forces do not produce closed orbits ( see Bertrand 's theorem ) , the analogous vector <formula> rarely has a simple definition and is generally a multivalued function of the angle θ between r and <formula> . 
 = = = Hamilton – Jacobi equation in parabolic coordinates = = = 
 The constancy of the LRL vector can also be derived from the Hamilton – Jacobi equation in parabolic coordinates ( ξ , η ) , which are defined by the equations 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 where r represents the radius in the plane of the orbit 
 <formula> 
 The inversion of these coordinates is 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 Separation of the Hamilton – Jacobi equation in these coordinates yields the two equivalent equations 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 where Γ is a constant of motion . Subtraction and re @-@ expression in terms of the Cartesian momenta px and py shows that Γ is equivalent to the LRL vector 
 <formula> 
 = = = Noether 's theorem = = = 
 The connection between the rotational symmetry described above and the conservation of the LRL vector can be made quantitative by way of Noether 's theorem . This theorem , which is used for finding constants of motion , states that any infinitesimal variation of the generalized coordinates of a physical system 
 <formula> 
 that causes the Lagrangian to vary to first order by a total time derivative 
 <formula> 
 corresponds to a conserved quantity Γ 
 <formula> 
 In particular , the conserved LRL vector component As corresponds to the variation in the coordinates 
 <formula> 
 where i equals 1 , 2 and 3 , with xi and pi being the ith components of the position and momentum vectors r and p , respectively ; as usual , <unk> represents the Kronecker delta . The resulting first @-@ order change in the Lagrangian is 
 <formula> 
 Substitution into the general formula for the conserved quantity Γ yields the conserved component As of the LRL vector , 
 <formula> 
 = = = Lie transformation = = = 
 The Noether theorem derivation of the conservation of the LRL vector A is elegant , but has one drawback : the coordinate variation <unk> involves not only the position r , but also the momentum p or , equivalently , the velocity v. This drawback may be eliminated by instead deriving the conservation of A using an approach pioneered by Sophus Lie . Specifically , one may define a Lie transformation in which the coordinates r and the time t are scaled by different powers of a parameter λ ( Figure 9 ) , 
 <formula> 
 This transformation changes the total angular momentum L and energy E , 
 <formula> 
 but preserves their product <unk> . Therefore , the eccentricity e and the magnitude A are preserved , as may be seen from the equation for A2 
 <formula> 
 The direction of A is preserved as well , since the <unk> are not altered by a global scaling . This transformation also preserves Kepler 's third law , namely , that the semiaxis a and the period T form a constant T2 / a3 . 
 = = Alternative <unk> , symbols and formulations = = 
 Unlike the momentum and angular momentum vectors p and L , there is no universally accepted definition of the Laplace – Runge – Lenz vector ; several different scaling factors and symbols are used in the scientific literature . The most common definition is given above , but another common alternative is to divide by the constant mk to obtain a dimensionless conserved eccentricity vector 
 <formula> 
 where v is the velocity vector . This scaled vector e has the same direction as A and its magnitude equals the eccentricity of the orbit . Other scaled versions are also possible , e.g. , by dividing A by m alone 
 <formula> 
 or by p0 
 <formula> 
 which has the same units as the angular momentum vector L. In rare cases , the sign of the LRL vector may be reversed , i.e. , scaled by − 1 . Other common symbols for the LRL vector include a , R , F , J and V. However , the choice of scaling and symbol for the LRL vector do not affect its conservation . 
 An alternative conserved vector is the binormal vector B studied by William Rowan Hamilton 
 <formula> 
 which is conserved and points along the minor semiaxis of the ellipse ; the LRL vector A 
 = B × L is the cross product of B and L ( Figure 4 ) . 
 The vector B is denoted as " binormal " since it is perpendicular to both A and L. Similar to the LRL vector itself , the binormal vector can be defined with different <unk> and symbols . 
 The two conserved vectors , A and B can be combined to form a conserved dyadic tensor W , 
 <formula> 
 where α and β are arbitrary scaling constants and <formula> represents the tensor product ( which is not related to the vector cross product , despite their similar symbol ) . Written in explicit components , this equation reads 
 <formula> 
 Being perpendicular to each another , the vectors A and B can be viewed as the principal axes of the conserved tensor W , i.e. , its scaled eigenvectors . W is perpendicular to L 
 <formula> 
 since A and B are both perpendicular to L as well , L ⋅ A = 
 L ⋅ B = 0 . For clarification , this equation reads , in explicit components ,

 Set in the future , Doll centers around relationships between humans and the eponymous androids — created by Kaoru and Motohiko Kirishima and manufactured by SG Corporation . During the development of the " Sterol @-@ 2 " Doll , Kaoru 's mental condition begins to deteriorate ; after attempting to retain a copy of her mind and memories in a prototype of a Doll , Motohiko realizes his mistake of trying to replace his wife . Retiring from the corporation to care for her , he leaves behind eight other prototypes , which are seen throughout the series : a nameless male Doll , who was the constant companion for a woman and cremated with her by her greedy stepson ; Chocolat , a maid who was discovered in a trash heap by an elderly farming community ; Honey , a secretary loyal to the SG Corporation president ; Cherry , the maid to an award @-@ winning , bulimic writer ; Vanilla , a maid to an elderly man and his unfaithful , younger wife ; the sexaroid Veronica , one of two Dolls built for sexual intercourse , and her unnamed partner ; and S , who hunts down illegally reprogrammed Dolls for SG Corporation . 
 Doll also focuses on Ichiro , a reprogrammer of Dolls who was abused by his stepmother and <unk> . Chosen to become the next president of SG Corporation , he was castrated by his beloved Doll on the orders of his jealous relatives . His Doll , the only one who had shown him kindness , was then destroyed . No longer the successor , Ichiro studied all the aspects of the Doll business . At eighteen years old , he left and began to reprogram Dolls illegally , seeking revenge on SG Corporation . Years later , Ichiro finds the unnamed sexaroid , after Veronica is destroyed by a sadistic owner . Ichiro reprograms the sexaroid to mimic human emotions , and the sexaroid becomes Ichiro 's companion . 
 They eventually find and purchase Vanilla , who acts as if she suffers from psychological trauma . While on a date with the sexaroid , Vanilla recovers her memories of having been ordered to bury her master 's corpse by her mistress . Meanwhile , Ichiro is captured by agents of the SG Corporation . Learning of this , the sexaroid leaves to rescue him , against the wishes of another reprogrammer , Psycho Candy . Captured , tagged for destruction , and reunited with Ichiro , the sexaroid finds himself ordered by Ichiro to switch places with him and escape . Ichiro then gives the sexaroid a name , Itsuki . With Itsuki 's tag for destruction , Ichiro is killed at the moment his father finally recognizes him . Doll concludes with SG Corporation 's scandal and subsequent bankruptcy , as Motohiko and his wife are content with knowing that they left Dolls in the world , while Vanilla and Itsuki live together in a house purchased by Ichiro .

 The character Vanilla , the concept of the Dolls , and SG Corporation first appeared in manga artist Mitsukazu Mihara 's earlier short manga " The Sunflower Quality Of An Integrated Circuit " ( 集積回路のヒマワリ ) ( 1995 ) , later collected in IC in a Sunflower ( 1997 ) . Doll began as " the simple notion of humans vs. robots " . Although she often uses Lolita fashion — a clothing style influenced by the Rococo style and the Victorian and Edwardian eras — in her character designs as a way to convey the duality of her characters , she felt that the fashion failed to give the manga depth . She then centered the plots on the psychological aspects . As Mihara has expressed an interest in exploring the impact of the childhood environment on a person , especially his or her relationships with parents , the stories in Doll involve the eponymous androids and family life . Each short story contains an independent theme ; " A Maid Servant " , for example , takes its inspiration from a book about aging fears , and " <unk> " serves as the theme for a story about cram school , inspired by a book about the inadequacy of solely teaching theories . 
 The overarching plot of Doll started with the second volume ; she envisioned a prodigy burdened by " parental pressure " and a Doll to heal the psychological pain . She explained that while her flaws may appear in the human characters , her " hopes for perfection " may appear in the Dolls . The Dolls , however , never developed consciousness , with the remodeled Dolls only capable of mimicking human emotion — in contrast to the typical progression of other stories in the genre . Mihara never considered making the androids capable of emotion , wishing for the narrative to center on the human characters .

While finding Mihara 's art well @-@ done , yet " not especially memorable " , Patrick King of Animefringe wrote that Mihara 's focus on the social effects of the Dolls and their environments greatly contributed to the appeal of the series .

 = Edith Rogers ( Alberta politician ) = 
 Edith Blanche Rogers ( née Edith Blanche Cox ) ( September 20 , 1894 – July 17 , 1985 ) was a Canadian politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1935 until 1940 . Born in Nova Scotia , she came west to Alberta to accept a job as a teacher . She later moved to Calgary where she encountered evangelist William Aberhart and became a convert to his social credit economic theories . After advocating these theories across the province , she was elected in the 1935 provincial election as a candidate of Aberhart 's newly formed Social Credit League . 
 Left out of cabinet despite her loyalty to Aberhart , she sided with the insurgents during the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers ' revolt , rejoining Aberhart 's followers once a settlement was reached . She was defeated in the 1940 election . After her defeat , she abandoned Social Credit for the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation , moved to Edmonton , and served for fifteen years as a school trustee . Edith Rogers died in 1985 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in Eastville , Nova Scotia to Samuel G. and <unk> ( née Graham ) Cox , Rogers was raised on a farm and attended Eastville High School and Normal School . She worked as a teacher in Nova Scotia until 1913 , when she visited her aunt , Margaret Redmond , in Edgerton , Alberta . While there , she accepted an offer to teach at Bloomington School . She attended Camrose Normal School in 1914 , after which she taught in Edgerton and near Tofield until 1918 . Disillusioned with teaching in rural schoolhouses , she took a business course and began work as a bank teller for the Merchants Bank of Canada , which later merged with the Bank of Montreal , in Edgerton ; this was an unusual career choice for a woman at the time . In 1922 she moved to Tofield , where she continued to work as a teller . The next year she moved to Killam , where she married William Rogers , the local high school principal , October 12 , 1923 . 
 In 1929 , the couple moved to Calgary , where they became friends with William Aberhart and his family . Rogers ' first foray into politics took place during the 1930 federal election , when she assisted with R. B. Bennett 's successful Calgary West campaign . Governments ' inability to end or alleviate the effects of the Great Depression soon disillusioned her with conventional politics . Upon hearing that Aberhart was beginning to incorporate politics and economics into his weekly gospel radio addresses , she began to listen and soon became a convert to his version of social credit . 
 = = Early involvement in social credit = = 
 In 1932 Rogers convinced Aberhart to hold public meetings on social credit in Calgary ; she subsequently organized neighbourhood study groups on the theory . In 1933 the Central Council of Social Credit in Calgary , which coordinated the city 's sixty social credit study groups , named her women 's organizer , in which capacity she held mass meetings designed to recruit women to social credit . In 1934 she embarked on a sixteen @-@ month speaking tour of Alberta . At the same time , she organized social credit study groups around the province , including seventy @-@ two in Edmonton . She concluded her tour by organizing a mass meeting there in the spring of 1935 , where Aberhart spoke before 9 @,@ 000 people . 
 When fissures appeared between Aberhart and people who supported the more orthodox version of social credit proposed by C. H. Douglas , the movement 's British founder , Rogers remained <unk> loyal to Aberhart . In the assessment of T. C. Byrne , her loyalty to Aberhart was second only to that of Ernest Manning , Aberhart 's young protégé . 
 When Aberhart decided to run Social Credit candidates in the 1935 provincial election , he adopted an unusual system of candidate nomination : each constituency would nominate three or four candidates , with a committee headed by Aberhart deciding which one would actually run . Six different constituencies nominated Rogers as one of their candidates , and Aberhart decided that she should run in Ponoka . Her opponent from the governing United Farmers of Alberta ( UFA ) was former Premier John Edward Brownlee , who had resigned the previous year in the wake of a sex scandal in which he was sued for the seduction of a young woman . Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster speculates that the selection of a female candidate to run against the so @-@ called " sober faced seducer " was a deliberate strategic decision by Aberhart , and noted further that " aside from Aberhart himself , [ Social Credit ] could not have fielded a stronger candidate " in Ponoka . 
 = = Member of the Legislative Assembly = = 
 Rogers won the riding with 2 @,@ 295 votes , more than 1 @,@ 400 ahead of Brownlee . In fact , the UFA lost every seat it contested , and Social Credit candidates won 56 of Alberta 's 63 seats . Aberhart became premier . He did not appoint Rogers ( or any other woman ) to his cabinet , and Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel has suggested that her gender cost her such an appointment . Female cabinet ministers were not unprecedented in Alberta ( Irene Parlby was a cabinet minister throughout the UFA 's time in office ) and Finkel argues , given that Rogers was " recognized as sharp , articulate , and hard @-@ working " , that she could reasonably have expected a cabinet portfolio . 
 Despite her loyalty to Aberhart , Rogers became frustrated with his delay in implementing the social credit economic reforms he had promised . During the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers ' revolt she sided with the insurgents who threatened to bring down the government unless it took concrete steps to implement social credit . Once the insurgents reached a settlement with Aberhart , she returned to her former position of loyalty , and sought re @-@ election as a Social Crediter in the 1940 election . Prior to this election , Social Credit 's opponents , including Liberals , Conservatives , and those elements of the UFA that had not moved to Social Credit , formed the People 's League , which ran nominally independent candidates . One of these candidates , Percy McKelvey , led Rogers by 13 votes on the first count . The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation ( CCF ) ' s C. A. Johnson was in a distant third . When Johnson 's votes were redistributed , in accordance with Alberta 's electoral laws at the time , McKelvey 's margin increased to nearly two hundred votes , and he was declared the victor .

 After her defeat , Rogers and her husband moved to Edmonton . She disapproved of the Social Credit government 's move to the right under new premier Ernest Manning , and joined the socialist CCF . Finkel considers this surprising , in light of her long @-@ time devotion to the ideals of social credit , the role the CCF played in her 1940 election defeat , and his assessment that she " seemed more interested in monetary reform than in the general social critique put forward by the CCF . " She served as a member of the CCF 's Edmonton membership and organization committee . 
 Rogers was elected to the board of Edmonton Public Schools in the 1959 Edmonton election as a candidate of the left @-@ leaning Civic Reform Association ( CRA ) .

 = No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF = 
 No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron ( 5ACS ) was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) construction squadron . The unit was first formed in July 1942 and served in the New Guinea Campaign and Borneo Campaign during World War II . The squadron was one of only a few RAAF airfield construction units to be retained at the end of the war , and formed part of Australia 's contribution to the occupation of Japan from 1945 until it was disbanded in June 1949 . 5ACS was re @-@ raised in August 1951 and worked on several RAAF airfields in Australia . In addition , it also provided small detachments of engineers to support RAAF deployments to South Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War . The squadron was the RAAF 's only airfield construction unit from 1961 onward , and was disbanded in December 1974 .

 = = = World War II = = = 
 On 7 July 1942 , 250 men of No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron were detached from the unit while it was stationed at Ascot Vale , Victoria and organised into a new squadron intended to serve in New Guinea . This unit was designated No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron ( Special Works Force ) , and arrived at Port Moresby on 7 August after a difficult voyage during which the ship carrying it from Australia it ran aground twice . The squadron began work constructing Wards Airfield on 14 August , and the first of the airfield 's runways was ready for use three weeks later . The airfield 's completion was delayed until January 1943 due to shortages of personnel and equipment , however . No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron ( Special Works Force ) was redesignated No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron ( 5MWS ) on 16 November . In order to support Allied offensives in New Guinea 5MWS moved to Goodenough Island between late February and March 1943 where it constructed Vivigani Airfield . This facility initially comprised a 1 @,@ 524 @-@ metre ( 5 @,@ 000 ft ) fighter runway and 1 @,@ 829 @-@ metre ( 6 @,@ 001 ft ) bomber runway as well as headquarters , maintenance and logistics facilities . During March and April a detachment from the squadron also assisted No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron at Milne Bay . 5MWS departed Goodenough Island on 21 November for a period of rest and reconstitution in Australia . 
 In early 1944 5MWS became part of a force of RAAF and United States Army aviation engineer units which were selected to build airfields at Aitape in New Guinea from which air support would be provided to Allied operations around Hollandia after US Army forces landed there on 22 April . 5MWS departed Melbourne on 15 February , and eventually joined up with the main body of the airfield engineer force at Lae on 1 April where it received training in infantry tactics . The Landing at Aitape took place on 22 April , and 5MWS came ashore the next day . The airfield at Aitape was ready to be used from 25 April and was later expanded by the aviation engineers . On 6 July 5MWS landed on Noemfoor Island where it again formed part of an aviation engineer force tasked with repairing and expanding the island 's airfields . Allied forces had first landed on the island on 2 July , and it was still not secure when construction work began . As a result , 5MWS personnel were required to man perimeter defences , during which they captured 12 Japanese personnel . While at Noemfoor 5MWS was redesignated No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron ( 5ACS ) on 18 July . As at 25 November , No. 4 Airfield Construction Squadron and 5ACS were the main units of No. 62 Wing . This wing formed part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force , which was the RAAF 's main mobile force . 
 In January 1945 <unk> and 5ACS moved to Biak island where they worked on improving facilities used by the US Army and United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) . In mid @-@ May 1945 <unk> and 5ACS traveled together to Morotai . They remained on this island until June when they departed as part of the Australian @-@ led Battle of North Borneo . The two squadrons landed at Labuan on 11 June and worked on repairing and maintaining the island 's airfield until the end of the war on 15 August . 
 = = = Occupation of Japan = = = 
 While most of the RAAF 's airfield construction squadrons were disbanded at the end of the war , on 17 November 1945 5ACS was informed that it would form part of Australia 's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . For this deployment it was assigned to No. 81 Wing . 5ACS ' advance party arrived in Japan in late 1945 and the rest of the squadron arrived at Iwakuni to the east of Hiroshima on 22 February 1946 . At this time the unit was under strength as only 14 officers and 189 airmen had volunteered for occupation duties , though a further 173 personnel arrived in March and April . 
 5ACS provided engineering support to BCOF for the next three years . Its initial priorities were to repair the airfields at Bofu , Iwakuni and Miho . By mid @-@ 1946 5ACS was engaged in work on these airfields , building small forward airstrips for army reconnaissance aircraft and maintaining another four airfields in BCOF 's area of responsibility . These tasks were of great importance to the BCOF , and Australian aviation historian Alan Stephens has written that " No. 5 ACS 's achievements were probably the most significant of any Australian unit — land , sea or air " during the occupation of Japan . Japanese labourers and tradesmen were employed on all of 5ACS ' projects , with the squadron 's personnel undertaking specialist roles . The size of BCOF was reduced in 1948 and the Australian Government decided to reduce the RAAF force in Japan to a single flying squadron . Accordingly , 5ACS ' remaining responsibilities were gradually transferred to the works officer of No. 77 Squadron and the squadron was disbanded at Iwakuni on 30 June 1949 . 
 = = = Cold War = = = 
 5ACS was reformed on 8 August 1951 at Bankstown , New South Wales to fill the RAAF 's need for engineering units and provide a nucleus for the potential formation of other airfield construction squadrons . It initially worked on projects in Sydney before moving to RAAF Base Williamtown in 1952 where it undertook a major upgrade of that base which lasted until 1955 . During this period , the squadron also worked on other RAAF facilities in New South Wales . Between March and November 1952 a detachment of 30 men from 5ACS was deployed to the Montebello Islands off the coast of Western Australia to support the British nuclear weapons test in the area , Operation Hurricane . Another detachment from the squadron assisted with the construction of range facilities at the Woomera Test Range in South Australia between 1952 and 1955 . Most of 5ACS moved to Darwin in 1955 to build a 13 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 4 @,@ 000 m ) -long runway and supporting facilities at RAAF Base Darwin , though a detachment remained at Williamtown until June 1963 and two other detachments were formed to undertake engineering tasks in the Sydney region and rebuild the runway at RAAF Base Amberley . The expansion of RAAF Base Darwin was completed in 1964 . Following the disbandment of No. 2 Airfield Construction Squadron on 28 April 1961 , 5ACS was left as the RAAF 's only construction unit and took on some of <unk> ' personnel and equipment . For a short period the remnants of <unk> was designated Detachment C of 5ACS while it completed works on RAAF Base East Sale ; this sub @-@ unit was disbanded in September 1961 . 
 Once RAAF Base Darwin was completed 5ACS headed south to develop RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine in the Northern Territory . The squadron 's advance party arrived at Tindal in October 1963 and work began on the base in late 1964 . The 2 @,@ 743 @-@ metre ( 8 @,@ 999 ft ) runway was opened in March 1967 and the base was ready to support RAAF units in early 1968 . Work on expanding Tindal continued during 1968 and 1969 . During this period detachments of 5ACS also worked on projects at Darwin and Amberley , and 5ACS ' headquarters moved to Amberley on 14 September 1969 . 
 Detachments from 5ACS formed part of Australia 's contribution to the Vietnam War . Following the deployment of No. 79 Squadron to Ubon Air Force Base in Thailand in June 1962 , a party of 5ACS personnel was also sent to Ubon to plan and oversee the construction of facilities for the squadron . Work on these facilities was undertaken by 100 Thai civilians who had built over 50 huts and other support infrastructure for No. 79 Squadron by the time the project concluded at the end of 1962 . RAAF units began to be deployed to South Vietnam in 1964 , and in May 1966 Detachment A of 5ACS was formed at Vũng Tàu to improve the airfield there so it could support the UH @-@ 1 Iroquois @-@ equipped No. 9 Squadron . The 19 members of this detachment returned to Australia on 8 October 1966 . Detachment B of 5ACS was subsequently deployed to South Vietnam in January 1967 to build facilities for eight No. 2 Squadron Canberra bombers at Phan Rang Air Base . This task was completed in April , and in June Detachment B moved to Vũng Tàu to complete the construction of facilities there . Work on Vũng Tàu Airport was finished on 20 January 1968 and the detachment was disbanded on 17 February 1968 . 
 5ACS ' last major project was the development of RAAF Base Learmonth in Western Australia . Initial works began on this project in March 1970 when Detachment E of 5ACS was formed there , and the main body of the squadron arrived on 1 February 1971 . 5ACS ' task was to extend the existing runway at the site and build facilities to support RAAF combat aircraft in the case of a war with Indonesia . These works were undertaken in difficult climatic conditions and the living conditions provided for the airmen and their families were inadequate . Nonetheless , the runway and extensive support facilities were officially opened on 15 December 1972 , though further work needed to be completed at this time . In August 1973 it was announced that 5ACS was going to be disbanded . The squadron 's strength declined during 1974 as personnel left the RAAF or moved to other units , and it was disbanded at Learmonth on 15 December 1974 . 5ACS was the last of the RAAF 's airfield construction units , and since its disbandment civilian contractors have been used to build and maintain air bases . A memorial plaque commemorating 5ACS was unveiled at the RAAF Memorial Grove outside of Canberra on 21 March 2014 . 
 = 2008 UEFA Champions League Final = 
 The 2008 UEFA Champions League Final was a football match that took place on Wednesday , 21 May 2008 , at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow , Russia , to determine the winner of the 2007 – 08 UEFA Champions League . It was contested by Manchester United and Chelsea , making it an all @-@ English club final for the first time in the history of the competition . This was only the third time that two clubs from the same country had contested the final ; the others being the 2000 and 2003 finals . It was the first European Cup final played in Russia , and hence the easternmost final in the tournament 's history . It also marked the 100th anniversary of Manchester United 's first league triumph , the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster , and the 40th anniversary of United 's first European Cup triumph in 1968 . It was Manchester United 's third European Cup final after 1968 and 1999 , while it was Chelsea 's first . 
 Manchester United won the match 6 – 5 on penalties , after a 1 – 1 draw following extra time . Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for Manchester United in the 26th minute with a header from a cross by Wes Brown , but Frank Lampard equalised shortly before half @-@ time . The second half and most of extra time passed without incident until Chelsea 's Didier Drogba was sent off for slapping Nemanja Vidić four minutes from the end . In the penalty shoot @-@ out , Ronaldo missed Manchester United 's third kick , giving John Terry the chance to win the game for Chelsea , only for him to slip and hit the post . Edwin van der Sar then saved Nicolas Anelka 's effort from Chelsea 's seventh kick to give Manchester United their third European Cup title . 
 More than 67 @,@ 000 people watched the game in the stadium , along with more than 17 @.@ 5 million television viewers in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland . In addition to prize money received from earlier in the competition , Manchester United received € 7 million for winning the final , while Chelsea received € 4 million . As winners , Manchester United went on to play in the 2008 UEFA Super Cup , losing 2 – 1 to 2007 – 08 UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg , and the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup , which they won after beating 2008 Copa Libertadores winners LDU Quito 1 – 0 in the final . 
 = = Background = = 
 Manchester United and Chelsea had played each other 150 times prior to the Champions League final , with 18 meetings in domestic cup competitions ( including the FA Community Shield ) . Due to various historical restrictions regarding the number of teams from the same country entering European competitions , they had never met in Europe before . Manchester United held the upper hand in the teams ' 150 previous meetings , winning 65 times to Chelsea 's 41 , with 44 draws . Their cup record was equally good , winning 10 of the 18 cup meetings , with the remaining eight ties split equally between draws and Chelsea wins . However , honours were even in cup finals , with Manchester United having won the 1994 FA Cup Final 4 – 0 , while Chelsea won the 2007 FA Cup Final 1 – 0 , the last cup game between the two sides . Manchester United responded to defeat in the 2007 FA Cup Final by beating Chelsea in the 2007 FA Community Shield the following August , winning 3 – 0 on penalties after a 1 – 1 draw in normal time . They went on to claim their 17th league title at the end of the 2007 – 08 Premier League season , finishing two points ahead of Chelsea . In the two sides ' league meetings that season , United won 2 – 0 at Old Trafford in Avram Grant 's first game in charge of Chelsea on 23 September 2007 , while Chelsea won 2 – 1 at Stamford Bridge in the return game on 26 April 2008 . 
 Because of the aforementioned entry restrictions , Manchester United had only met English opposition in Europe twice before , while Chelsea had far more experience against English opposition , having played 12 matches against compatriot clubs , winning five , drawing five and losing just two . There had been two previous Champions League finals between teams from the same country : in 2000 , when Real Madrid beat fellow Spanish side Valencia 3 – 0 at the Stade de France ; and in 2003 , when Italian sides Milan and Juventus played out a 0 – 0 draw before Milan won 3 – 2 on penalties . 
 Both sides had a connection to the early history of European football ; Chelsea were invited to take part in the inaugural European Cup in 1955 – 56 as champions of England , only to be denied entry by The Football League , allowing Manchester United to become the first English entrants in the competition the following season . In February 1958 , eight Manchester United players were killed in the Munich air disaster , when the aeroplane carrying their team back from a match in Belgrade crashed while attempting to take off from a refuelling stop in Munich . Manager Matt Busby was seriously injured in the crash and almost died as a result , but he rebuilt the team , and in May 1968 , Manchester United became the first English winners of the European Cup , beating Benfica 4 – 1 in the 1968 European Cup Final . Chelsea won their first European trophy three years later , when they beat Real Madrid 2 – 1 in the 1971 European Cup Winners ' Cup Final replay after a 1 – 1 draw in the first match . Both Chelsea and Manchester United won that same competition during the 1990s – first Manchester United beat Barcelona 2 – 1 in the 1991 final ( followed by victory over Red Star Belgrade in the 1991 Super Cup ) , and then Chelsea beat VfB Stuttgart in the 1998 final ( followed by victory over Real Madrid in the 1998 Super Cup , their most recent European success ) . Manchester United then won their second European Cup the following year , beating Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final .

 Manchester United were drawn in Group F along with Roma , Sporting and Dynamo Kyiv . United won their first five group games ; they first travelled to Lisbon , where Cristiano Ronaldo 's header secured a 1 – 0 win against his old club , Sporting . Next was another 1 – 0 win at home to Roma , followed by back @-@ to @-@ back four @-@ goal victories over Dynamo Kyiv ( 4 – 2 in Ukraine and 4 – 0 at Old Trafford ) . United secured top spot in the group with a 2 – 1 win at home to Sporting in their fifth game . They travelled to Roma for the final group game , in which both teams were already guaranteed to progress ; it finished as a 1 – 1 draw , with Gerard Piqué scoring his first goal for the club before Mancini 's equaliser . United finished with 16 points , the most of all the group winners . 
 In the first knockout round , United were drawn against Lyon , against whom they drew the away leg 1 – 1 , thanks to a late equaliser from Carlos Tevez . The Red Devils then won the second leg 1 – 0 – Ronaldo scoring the only goal – to ensure a 2 – 1 aggregate win and a place in the quarter @-@ finals , where they were again drawn against Roma . 
 The quarter @-@ final matches represented the fifth and sixth times these two clubs had met in Europe in just over 12 months ; they had met at the same stage of the previous season 's competition and then again in the group stage this season . United went to Rome and secured a 2 – 0 win with a first @-@ half header from Ronaldo and a second @-@ half goal tapped in by Wayne Rooney . United went on to secure the tie in the second leg with a 1 – 0 win , their record 11th consecutive home Champions League win . 
 The semi @-@ final pitted United against Barcelona ; the teams had not met since the group stage of the 1998 – 99 tournament , the last time United won it . The teams also had identical records going into the semi @-@ final , each having won eight and drawn two of their 10 games , scoring 18 goals and conceding just five . The first leg at the Camp Nou saw United spend most of the game defending , while Barcelona tried to pass the ball around them . United were awarded a penalty in the first minute , but Ronaldo sent the ball wide , hitting the stanchion behind the goal . That was as close as either team got to a goal in the first leg and it ended 0 – 0 . The second leg at Old Trafford was a game of higher tempo , which United won 1 – 0 thanks to a goal from Paul Scholes after 14 minutes . This result increased United 's consecutive home win record in the Champions League to 12 and ensured that they reached the final unbeaten . 
 In reaching the final , United won nine and drew three of their 12 matches , dwarfing their record of four wins and six draws in the 10 games they took to reach the final in 1999 ( when there was no first knockout round and teams advanced from the group stage directly into the quarter @-@ finals ) . United scored 19 goals en route to the final , Ronaldo scoring seven of them , more than any other player .

 In the group stage , Chelsea were drawn into Group B , along with Schalke 04 of Germany , Rosenborg of Norway and Spanish club Valencia . Chelsea 's first match in the group was against Rosenborg at Stamford Bridge , where they were held to a 1 – 1 draw . Two days later , manager José Mourinho left Chelsea by mutual consent , and was replaced by their director of football , former Israeli national team coach Avram Grant . Chelsea 's second match was against Valencia , whom they beat 2 – 1 , leaving Chelsea with four points from their two matches . Chelsea 's next two matches were against Schalke 04 . The first match was played at Stamford Bridge , with Chelsea winning 2 – 0 , while the return match in Gelsenkirchen ended in a 0 – 0 draw . Chelsea 's final two matches in their group resulted in a 4 – 0 victory away to Rosenborg and a 0 – 0 draw at home to Valencia . Chelsea progressed as group winners with 12 points out of six games . 
 Chelsea faced Greek side Olympiacos in the first knockout round . The first leg in Athens ended in a 0 – 0 draw , but a 3 – 0 win in the second leg , with goals from Michael Ballack , Frank Lampard and Salomon Kalou , saw Chelsea through to the quarter @-@ finals . There , they were drawn against Fenerbahçe of Turkey . The first leg was held at the <unk> <unk> Stadium in Istanbul , and ended in a 2 – 1 defeat , as <unk> made up for an early own goal by scoring the winner nine minutes from time after Colin Kazim @-@ Richards ' equaliser . Chelsea won the second leg at Stamford Bridge 2 – 0 , with goals from Ballack and Lampard , to claim a 3 – 2 aggregate victory over the Turkish side . 
 Chelsea faced fellow English club Liverpool in the semi @-@ finals . This was the fourth year in succession that these teams had met in the Champions League , following semi @-@ final meetings in 2004 – 05 and 2006 – 07 , and two group stage matches in 2005 – 06 . The first leg at Anfield was a 1 – 1 draw , in which Chelsea got a 95th @-@ minute equaliser through a John Arne Riise own goal after Dirk Kuyt had put Liverpool 1 – 0 up just before half @-@ time . Chelsea won the second leg 3 – 2 after extra time , with two goals from Didier Drogba and one from Lampard sending the Blues through to the first Champions League final in their history .

 The Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow was selected as the venue for the match at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Ljubljana , Slovenia , on 4 October 2006 . The committee – who decided the venue for the 2009 final and the 2008 and 2009 UEFA Cup Finals at the same meeting – based their decision on a number of factors , including stadium capacity , safety and security facilities , and accessibility . The other venues in contention were the Estadio Olímpico in Sevilla , the Olympiastadion in Berlin , Wembley Stadium in London , and the Stadio Olimpico in Rome , which was chosen to host the 2009 final . 
 The European Cup final had never before been played in Russia , making this match the easternmost final in the tournament 's history ; however , the Luzhniki Stadium had previously played host to the 1999 UEFA Cup Final , in which Italian club Parma beat French side Marseille 3 – 0 . Because of the difference in time zones , the match kicked off at 22 : 45 Moscow Time , making it the first Champions League final to start on one day and finish in the next . 
 Originally known as the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium , the ground opened in 1956 as a new national stadium for the Soviet Union national football team . In 1973 , it served as the principal venue for the seventh Summer Universiade , before going on to perform the same function at the 1980 Summer Olympics . By this point , the stadium 's capacity was 103 @,@ 000 ; however , renovations in the mid @-@ 1990s reduced the capacity to just under 85 @,@ 000 . The stadium was given five @-@ star status by UEFA in 1998 , before hosting the UEFA Cup final the following year . To help the stadium cope with the cold Russian winters , the grass pitch was replaced by an artificial FieldTurf surface in 2002 . Although UEFA allowed matches in earlier rounds to be played on the synthetic surface , they mandated that the final should be played on natural grass . Turf was shipped in from Slovakia especially for the final at a cost of £ 160 @,@ 000 , and laid on top of the existing playing surface , resulting in the pitch being 35 cm ( 14 in ) higher than normal . There were originally concerns over the players ' safety on the new field , which had to be relaid twice after patches died in transit . 
 As part of the marketing for the match , a unique design concept has been developed for each Champions League final since 1997 , inspired by the cultural and historical heritage of the host city . The 2008 final 's design was announced on 31 October 2007 in a ceremony at the Luzhniki Stadium , attended by the ambassador for the final , former Russian goalkeeper Rinat Dasayev . The design was based on a colour scheme of deep red and gold , inspired by the predominant colours of Red Square , the Kremlin and the gold domes of Moscow 's cathedrals , and featured images of the Moscow skyline , as well as the UEFA Champions League logo and trophy rendered in a Russian artistic style , with text in a font similar to Cyrillic script . 
 As has taken place for every Champions League final since 1997 , a ceremonial handover of the UEFA Champions League trophy was held in the host city ; the 2008 ceremony was at the <unk> Centre in Moscow 's Red Square on 3 April 2008 . On behalf of 2007 champions Milan , their technical operations director and former player Leonardo , and club director Umberto <unk> presented the trophy back to UEFA president Michel Platini , who passed it on to the Mayor of Moscow , Yury Luzhkov , for it to be displayed in five cities around the country – Kazan , Yekaterinburg , Krasnodar , Saint Petersburg and Samara – before returning to Moscow ahead of the final . Also in attendance at the ceremony were final ambassador Rinat Dasayev and Russian Football Union president Vitaly Mutko . 
 = = = Ticketing and supporters = = = 
 Although the Luzhniki Stadium had a usual capacity of almost 85 @,@ 000 spectators , that was reduced to 69 @,@ 500 for the final . Of those tickets , approximately 21 @,@ 000 were reserved for each finalist club , with a further 10 @,@ 500 available for purchase by the general public via the UEFA website . Recipients of those tickets were determined by a random ballot following an online application process that ran from 28 February to 19 March 2008 . Tickets were available in three categories , priced at € 80 , € 140 and € 200 depending on their location in the stadium . UEFA received around 125 @,@ 000 applications for tickets from the general public over the course of the three @-@ week application process . 
 The clubs were able to distribute their tickets however they wished ; Manchester United chose to make their allocation available to all Executive Seat Holders and any Season Ticket Holders who had successfully applied for a ticket to at least one of the club 's five away Champions League matches between the group stage and the quarter @-@ finals , while Chelsea opened up applications to all club members and season ticket holders . 
 Manchester United chief executive David Gill expressed disappointment that his club had only been allocated 21 @,@ 000 tickets for their supporters , claiming that they could have potentially sold up to 100 @,@ 000 . While Manchester United managed to sell out their entire allocation , UEFA director of communications William Gaillard indicated that Chelsea still had " up to a couple of thousand " tickets unsold the day before the game , despite claims by Chelsea 's chief operations officer , Ron Gourlay , to the contrary . 
 One of the major concerns for English fans attending the final was the acquisition of visas for entry into Russia . However , after a period of negotiations between representatives of Russia , the United Kingdom , UEFA and the two clubs , it was agreed that fans with tickets for the match would not require a visa , provided they were also able to produce a passport with at least six months before expiry and a completed immigration card on entry into Russia . The visa @-@ free period was initially supposed to run for 72 hours between 19 May and 23 May , but this was later extended to an eight @-@ day period lasting from 17 May to 25 May . Because of the difficulty and expense of acquiring a ticket and visa , fans who had not already got tickets were advised against travelling to Moscow by UEFA 's William Gaillard , who also warned fans about Russia 's strict laws regarding the consumption of alcohol . 
 Although the two clubs claimed to have sold most of the 42 @,@ 000 tickets allocated to them , only about 25 @,@ 000 fans were said to have travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom , with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game . According to the head of the Russian national tourist office , Mikhail Ignatiev , many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation . Additionally , most of Moscow 's hotels were full on the night of the game . As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match , The Moscow Times reported that the black @-@ market price dropped from a high of € 2 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @,@ 600 ) to around € 500 ( £ 400 ) , while Russian TV channel Sport @-@ 1 was reporting prices as low as £ 300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow . Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games ( LOCOG ) Sebastian Coe , who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics , and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall , who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth .

 The match ball for the final was the Adidas Finale Moscow , the eighth in the Adidas Finale range . The ball 's design was based around the " <unk> " pattern , inspired by the UEFA Champions League logo ; the stars are dark red with gold detailing , tying in with the overall design concept for the final . Technically , the ball is based on the Adidas Europass , which was used at UEFA Euro 2008 later that summer ; it has the same 14 @-@ panel configuration as the Adidas <unk> , but with the proprietary surface texture developed for the Europass . The ball was unveiled at a ceremony in Moscow 's <unk> Square , attended by UEFA General Secretary David Taylor , former Germany player and coach Franz Beckenbauer , final ambassador Rinat Dasayev and Russian Football Union president Vitaly Mutko .

Having presided over the 2003 UEFA Cup Final , Micheľ was the second man to referee the finals of both the Champions League and UEFA Cup since the latter changed to a single @-@ legged affair in 1998 ; the other was Pierluigi Collina . Micheľ began refereeing in 1987 at the age of 19 , and took charge of his first top @-@ flight game in 1993 .

 Micheľ 's first UEFA Champions League matches came in the 1998 – 99 season , including Manchester United 's 5 – 0 win over Brøndby in the group stage . Up to the 2008 final , he refereed 55 Champions League matches ( including qualifying ) , notably the second leg of the semi @-@ final between Chelsea and Liverpool in 2005 , in which Liverpool 's Luis García scored a controversial goal , which Micheľ chose to allow . He was also selected to referee at the 2000 Summer Olympics , the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups , and the European Championships in 2004 and 2008 .

 Sir Alex Ferguson guaranteed a place in the starting line @-@ up for Paul Scholes , after the midfielder had missed the 1999 final through suspension . Ferguson made one change from the team that had beaten Wigan Athletic to secure the league title 10 days earlier , with Owen Hargreaves starting on the right side of midfield in a 4 – 4 – 2 formation in place of Park Ji @-@ sung ; Cristiano Ronaldo started on the left wing , where he was pitted against makeshift Chelsea right @-@ back Michael Essien . This went against the prediction of The Guardian 's David Pleat , who thought a duel between Ronaldo and Ashley Cole would be key to the final . Ferguson hoped his substitutes might have a big impact on the match , just as Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær did in 1999 , when the pair came off the bench to help Manchester United come from behind and beat Bayern Munich . A week before the game , Ryan Giggs was philosophical about his chances of making the starting line @-@ up ; he was eventually named as one of seven allowed substitutes . 
 The day before the match , Avram Grant predicted that the game would throw up few tactical surprises due to the two teams ' knowledge of each other from the domestic league . Nevertheless , he decided to start with Florent Malouda on the left @-@ wing instead of Salomon Kalou , and also chose to deploy Michael Essien at right @-@ back ahead of Paulo Ferreira and Juliano Belletti , rather than in his preferred midfield position . The rest of Chelsea 's team was fairly predictable , with key players John Terry ( dislocated elbow ) and Didier Drogba ( knee ) recovering from injuries suffered against Bolton Wanderers on the last day of the league season 10 days earlier to start the game . Ashley Cole also started despite hurting his right ankle in training the day before the game under a heavy challenge from Claude Makélélé . His replacement would have likely been Wayne Bridge , but he recovered sufficiently that Bridge was not even included in the matchday squad as cover .

 After a fairly cagey first 21 minutes , the first major incident of the game occurred when Paul Scholes and Claude Makélélé clashed in mid @-@ air , resulting in both players being booked and Scholes having to leave the field for treatment to a bloody nose . The first goal of the game came five minutes later , when an interchange of passes between Scholes and Wes Brown after a throw @-@ in on the right flank gave Brown time to pick out a cross for Cristiano Ronaldo , who directed his header past Petr Čech . Chelsea almost equalised in the 33rd minute when Frank Lampard 's cross was headed back into the goal area by Didier Drogba . United 's Rio Ferdinand , under pressure from Michael Ballack , was forced to head the ball towards his own goal and Edwin van der Sar pulled off a one @-@ handed save to deny Chelsea a goal . United spent the rest of the first half pressing for a second goal , and had two good opportunities to extend their lead , but were denied by a double @-@ save from Čech . Wayne Rooney delivered a long ball into the path of Ronaldo and the United goalscorer placed his cross on the head of the diving Carlos Tevez , only for Čech to deny him . Chelsea 's failure to clear the loose ball gave Michael Carrick the chance to extend his side 's lead , but Čech was again equal to the task with another save . 
 Chelsea survived the pressure , as Tevez failed to connect with a low cross from Rooney , and equalised in the final minute of the first half . The goal followed from a long @-@ range shot by Michael Essien , which deflected first off Nemanja Vidić and then Ferdinand . The ball 's change in direction caused Van der Sar to lose his footing , leaving Lampard , who had made a run from deep , with a simple finish . In celebration , Lampard looked up and pointed to the sky with both hands in memory of his mother , Pat , who had died a month earlier . At the end of the first half , Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confronted match referee Ľuboš Micheľ , " jabbing out an angry finger and spitting out a few choice words " . 
 = = = = Second half = = = = 
 Lampard 's equaliser at the end of the first half led to a transformed Chelsea in the second , and they kept United on the back foot for long periods . Nevertheless , the Red Devils managed to contain most of Chelsea 's attacks . Chelsea had a few opportunities to take the lead , with Essien breaking free of United 's defence in the 54th minute , only for his left @-@ footed shot to curl well over the goal . Chelsea 's closest opportunity to take the lead came in the 77th minute when a Drogba shot struck the post from 25 yards ( 23 m ) out . The Ivorian striker came very close to turning Joe Cole 's low cross home for the winner four minutes from time , but fired wide . Ryan Giggs was then introduced in place of Scholes , making a record 759th appearance for Manchester United . 
 = = = = Extra time = = = = 
 The game moved into extra time , and both teams had chances to score a vital second goal ; first , Lampard hit the underside of the bar with a left @-@ footed shot after the ball was played in to him with a disguised pass from Ballack , then Giggs stabbed the ball left @-@ footed towards goal instead of sweeping it with his weaker right foot , only to see it headed off the line by Terry . Late in the second half of extra time , the ball was put out of play so players could be treated for cramp . In returning the ball to Chelsea , Carlos Tevez put it out for another throw @-@ in deep in Chelsea 's half then signalled to his team @-@ mates to put pressure on the restart . John Terry and Michael Ballack reacted angrily to this and were joined by several of their team @-@ mates , while Manchester United 's players rushed in to protect Tevez . Ultimately , most of the 22 players were involved in the fracas . Amid the melée , assistant referee Martin Balko saw Drogba slap Nemanja Vidić and reported the incident to referee Ľuboš Micheľ . After showing a yellow card to Ballack , Micheľ showed a red card to Drogba for violent conduct , making him only the second player in history to be sent off in a European Cup final after Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in 2006 . 
 = = = = Penalty shoot @-@ out = = = = 
 As the match went to penalties , Rio Ferdinand won the coin toss for Manchester United , and opted for his side to go first in the shoot @-@ out , which would be taken at the end housing the Manchester United fans . Tevez stepped up first and sent Čech the wrong way . Ballack was next up , shooting powerfully past Van der Sar . Carrick buried his spot @-@ kick , as did Juliano Belletti with his first touch of the game , having come on for Makélélé at the end of extra time . The first miss of the shoot @-@ out came from Ronaldo , who characteristically stuttered in his run @-@ up in an attempt to put Čech off , but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save . 
 Lampard then put Chelsea 3 – 2 ahead , but Hargreaves levelled things up with a shot into the top corner . Ashley Cole was the next up , and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but could not keep it out . Nani then knew he had to score to keep United in it , and he did , leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea ; however , Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball , and , even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way , Terry 's mis @-@ hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide . 
 Anderson scored the first penalty in sudden death . Kalou then sent Van der Sar the wrong way to make it 5 – 5 . Giggs was next up and he was also successful . Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United ; he pointed to his left to indicate to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side , as had the six players who had kicked before him , only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka , whose kick was at a good height to be saved , securing European football 's top prize for United for the third time in their history .

 Having missed what could have been Chelsea 's winning penalty , John Terry had to be consoled by his manager , Avram Grant . The Manchester United players formed a guard of honour for Chelsea , lining up in two opposite rows at the foot of the steps up to the presentation party and applauding as the Chelsea team – led by chief executive Peter Kenyon – walked through . As Didier Drogba had been sent off during the game , he was not allowed to collect his medal himself and it was given to Grant ; when he returned to pitch level , Grant tossed his own medal into the crowd . After Chelsea 's team received their medals , Munich air disaster survivor Bobby Charlton , who had captained United to the European Cup title in 1968 , led his team up to collect their medals in his capacity as a club director . UEFA President Michel Platini presented both Kenyon and Charlton with commemorative plaques and medals , but Charlton declined to accept his medal ; he later donated it to the club museum . When all the players had received their medals , Platini presented Manchester United with the trophy , which Rio Ferdinand – as team captain for the match – and Ryan Giggs – standing in for club captain Gary Neville – lifted together . 
 United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side deserved to win the game despite Chelsea performing better in the second half , and acknowledged the historical significance of the win , which came 40 years after the club 's first European Cup title and 50 years after the Munich air disaster . He also said it was the first penalty shoot @-@ out he had ever won as a manager : " I won the Charity Shield that way , but that doesn 't really count . The European Cup ? The FA Cup ? The Scottish cups ? Never . I 've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United , so seventh time lucky — magnificent . " Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji @-@ sung for not including him in the matchday squad . Cristiano Ronaldo expressed his relief at his side 's shoot @-@ out victory , saying , " In my opinion I played well in the game , scored a goal , and then missed the penalty . It would have been the worst day of my life . We deserved to win as we played better in the whole game . It means everything to me , we have won both trophies , it is the best day in my life . " He then attempted to quash further speculation about his future and a potential transfer to Real Madrid , saying , " I am going to stay . " 
 Ricardo Carvalho , Frank Lampard and Avram Grant all refused to point the finger of blame at John Terry , but assistant manager Henk ten Cate admitted that Terry was not originally due to take one of the first five penalties ( if Drogba had not been sent off , he would have taken the fifth penalty ) . Chelsea offered Terry counselling as a result of his devastation following the miss of his penalty , and subsequently , the loss of the final . Terry was later accused of spitting at Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez , but a UEFA report into the video evidence cleared him of any wrongdoing . Terry also wrote an open letter , published on Chelsea 's official website , apologising for missing the penalty and costing Chelsea the trophy . Nicolas Anelka , who took the decisive kick , revealed he did not actually want to take a penalty , citing lack of warm @-@ up time . 
 Following the loss , Avram Grant 's future as manager was thrown into doubt , with owner Roman Abramovich ( who attended the final ) , chief executive Peter Kenyon , director Eugene Tenenbaum and chairman Bruce Buck reportedly already seeking a replacement for Grant the day after the game . Buck was unimpressed with Chelsea 's second @-@ place league finish and being runners @-@ up in the Champions League , saying " we have very high expectations at Chelsea and a couple of second place finishes is just not good enough for us " . Grant was officially sacked three days after the match . Buck also confirmed plans to trim the Chelsea squad by selling at least three players , and said that discussions were due to take place regarding Didier Drogba 's future with the club , after the striker reportedly expressed a desire to leave earlier in the season . 
 In Moscow , around 6 @,@ 000 police were on duty to prevent a repeat of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots a week earlier , but police reported that none of the 40 @,@ 000 visiting fans were arrested , due in part to public safety measures such as a ban on public drinking and no large screens being set up for members of the public to watch the game outdoors . In London , violence escalated outside Fulham Broadway tube station , near Chelsea 's Stamford Bridge ground ; police arrested 12 people on public order offences , while one man was arrested for grievous bodily harm , drink driving and dangerous driving , after he hit a 31 @-@ year @-@ old while attempting to drive down Fulham Broadway . Five police were also believed to have been injured in the incident . 
 Manchester United had originally intended to hold a parade through the streets of Manchester to celebrate their Double triumph on their return from Moscow on 22 May . However , following the violence that occurred at the UEFA Cup final , Greater Manchester Police determined that any victory parade could only take place later in the summer . The public parade was ultimately cancelled , but fans were given the opportunity to photograph the players with the Premier League and Champions League trophies before the kick @-@ off of Manchester United 's home friendly against Juventus on 6 August 2008 .

 The match was shown simultaneously in the United Kingdom by free @-@ to @-@ air channel ITV 1 and subscription channel Sky Sports 1 , who in 2005 won the rights to broadcast UEFA Champions League matches for three seasons from 2006 – 07 to 2008 – 09 . Sky acted as the host broadcaster for UEFA , providing pictures to all other networks covering the final with around 30 cameras and 100 crew members . The ITV broadcast was led by Steve Rider , with Clive Tyldesley commentating , David Pleat as an analyst , and Andy Townsend and Mark Hughes as in @-@ studio pundits . Sky 's team consisted of presenter Richard Keys , joined in the studio by Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp , and Ruud Gullit via phone , with commentary from Martin Tyler and analysis from Andy Gray .

 In addition to the € 23 @.@ 4 million and € 19 @.@ 8 million earned respectively by the two clubs as prize money , Manchester United and Chelsea received money from the UEFA market pool share . The market pool share had a total value of € 277 million , shared between the 32 clubs that qualified for the group stage . The pool was split in proportion to each national association 's strength in the television market , with the Premier League clubs receiving around € 60 million in total from the pool . The money was then split between the four teams who qualified for the Champions League from the 2006 – 07 FA Premier League based on their position in the league and the number of matches played in the 2007 – 08 Champions League . This meant that Manchester United , having won the 2006 – 07 Premier League , received around € 19 @.@ 5 million , and Chelsea , as runners @-@ up , received around € 16 @.@ 5 million .

 = John Clarke ( Baptist minister ) = 
 John Clarke ( October 1609 – 20 April 1676 ) was a physician , Baptist minister , co @-@ founder of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , author of its influential charter , and a leading advocate of religious freedom in the Americas . 
 Born in Westhorpe , Suffolk , England , Clarke received an extensive education , including a master 's degree in England , followed by medical training in Leiden , Holland . He arrived in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1637 during the Antinomian Controversy , and decided to go to Rhode Island with many exiles from the conflict . As an original founder of Newport , Rhode Island , he established the second Baptist Church in America there . Because Baptists were considered heretics , and banned from Massachusetts , Clarke wanted to make inroads there , and spent time in the Boston jail after making a mission trip to the town of Lynn . Following his poor treatment in prison , he went to England where he published a book on the persecutions of the Baptists in Massachusetts , and on his theological beliefs . Since the fledgling Rhode Island colony needed an agent in England , Clarke remained there for over a decade , handling the colony 's interests . 
 All of the other New England colonies were hostile to Rhode Island , and both Massachusetts and Connecticut had made incursions into Rhode Island territory . After the restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660 , it was imperative that Rhode Island receive a royal charter to protect its territorial integrity . It was Clarke 's role to obtain such a document , and he saw this as an opportunity to include religious freedoms never seen before in any constitutional charter . After writing ten petitions and letters to King Charles II , and negotiating for months with Connecticut over territorial boundaries , Clarke drafted the Rhode Island Royal Charter and presented it to the king ; it was approved with the king 's seal on 8 July 1663 . This charter , granting unprecedented freedom and religious liberty to Rhode Islanders , remained in effect for 180 years , making it the longest @-@ lasting constitutional charter in history . 
 Following his success at procuring a charter , Clarke returned to Rhode Island where he became very active in civil affairs , and continued to pastor his church in Newport until his death in 1676 . He left an extensive will , setting up the first educational trust in America . He was an avid proponent of soul @-@ liberty that was included in the Rhode Island charter , and later in the United States Constitution . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Clarke was born at Westhorpe in the county of Suffolk , England and baptized there on 8 October 1609 , the son of Thomas Clarke and Rose <unk> ( or Kerridge ) . He was one of seven children , six of whom left England and settled in New England . Other than the parish records of his baptism , and those of his siblings , no definitive record has been found concerning his life in England . 
 That Clarke was highly educated is apparent from the fact that he arrived in New England at the age of 28 qualified as both a physician and a Baptist minister . A book that he wrote and published in 1652 , his masterful authorship of the Rhode Island Royal Charter of 1663 , and his will mentioning his Hebrew and Greek books and a Concordance and Lexicon that he wrote himself all point to many years of study . 
 The difficulty with tracing Clarke 's existence in England stems largely from his very common name . Rhode Island historical authority G. Andrews Moriarty wrote that Clarke was probably the one of his name who attended St Catharine 's College , Cambridge , but he may also have received a bachelor 's degree from Brasenose College , Oxford in 1628 , and a masters from there in 1632 . Another clue to his education comes from a catalog of students from Leiden University in Holland , one of Europe 's primary medical schools at the time . The school 's ledger of graduates includes , in Latin , " Johannes <unk> , <unk> , 17 July 1635 @-@ 273 " ( translated as John Clark , England , date as given ) . That Clarke earned a master 's degree is apparent from the concordance that he wrote , where the authorship is given as " John Clarke , Master of Arts " . 
 = = Antinomian Controversy = = 
 Clarke arrived in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in November 1637 . When he arrived , the colony was in the midst of a major theological and political crisis , usually referred to as the Antinomian Controversy . Members of the Boston Church could sense a difference in the preaching between the church 's original pastor , John Wilson , and that of their second pastor , John Cotton . Anne Hutchinson , a theologically astute midwife who had the ear of many of the colony 's women , became outspoken during gatherings , or conventicles , held at her house . She strongly supported Cotton 's " covenant of grace " ideas , and condemned the " covenant of works " theology of Wilson and most of the other ministers in the colony . 
 The Reverend John Wheelwright had arrived in the colony in May 1636 , aligning himself with the free grace advocates who adhered to Cotton 's doctrines , which included most of the members of the Boston Church . The controversy became much more political when , in the same month , the young aristocrat , Henry Vane , was elected as the governor of the colony . Vane was a free grace advocate and a strong supporter of Hutchinson , but also had his own unorthodox ideas about theology that were considered radical . By late 1636 the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony 's difficulties . Wheelwright had been invited as a guest preacher to the Boston church on the fast @-@ day in January 1637 , and though his sermon was encouraging to his free grace allies , it was considered inflammatory by most of the colony 's ministers . 
 When the General Court met in March 1637 , Wheelwright was called upon to answer for his sermon . In a close vote , he was judged guilty of " contempt & sedition " for having increased bitterness within the colony . The vote did not pass without a fight , however , and Wheelwright 's friends protested formally . Most members of the Boston church , favoring Wheelwright in the conflict , drafted a petition justifying Wheelwright 's sermon , and 60 people signed this remonstrance protesting the conviction . 
 Henry Vane returned to England that summer , and at the November 1637 court , Wheelwright , who would admit no wrongdoing , was banished from the colony and ordered to be gone within 14 days . Then Anne Hutchinson faced trial for " traducing " ( slandering ) the ministers , and was sentenced to banishment following a church trial the following March . The authorities feared an insurrection , and within a week of her sentencing the constables were sent from door to door throughout the colony 's towns to disarm those who signed the Wheelwright petition . Within ten days of being served , these individuals were ordered to deliver " all such guns , pistols , swords , powder , shot , & match as they shall be owners of , or have in their custody , upon <unk> of ten pound [ s ] for every default " . A great number of those who signed the petition , faced with losing their protection and in some cases livelihood , recanted under the pressure , and " acknowledged their error " in signing the petition . Those who refused to recant suffered hardships and many decided to leave the colony . While there was a man named John Clarke who signed the Wheelwright petition , it was not the subject John Clarke , who had arrived in Boston after the petition had circulated . Clarke wrote of the circumstances of his arrival in his 1652 book , Ill Newes from New England . 
 = = Rhode Island = = 
 Several of those affected by the events of the Antinomian Controversy went north with John Wheelwright in November 1637 to found the town of Exeter in what would become New Hampshire . A larger group , uncertain where to go , contacted Roger Williams , who suggested they purchase land from the natives along the Narraganset Bay , near his settlement in Providence . John Clarke apparently did both , based on what he wrote in his book : " By reason of the suffocating heat of the summer before [ 1637 ] , I went to the North to be somewhat cooler , but the winter following [ 1637 @-@ 8 ] proved so cold , that we were forced in the spring to make towards the South . " 
 On 7 March 1638 , just as Anne Hutchinson 's church trial was getting underway , a group of men , including John Clarke , gathered at the Boston home of William Coddington and drafted a compact for a new government . It is probable that Clarke wrote the document , based on its religious sentiment . Altogether , 23 individuals signed the instrument which was intended to form a " Bodie Politick " based on Christian principles , and Coddington was chosen as the leader of the group . Roger Williams suggested two places that the exiles could settle : Sowams ( later Barrington , Rhode Island ) , and Aquidneck Island , both locations being on or in the Narraganset Bay . Williams was uncertain about English claims to these lands , so Clarke led a delegation of three men to Plymouth where he was informed that Sowams was not only in use , but was considered so desirable that they called it the garden of the entire colony . However , the island was not claimed by the colony , and this suited Clarke whose desire for the exiles was to " get clear of all , and be ourselves " . 
 Aquidneck Island was in the territory of the Narragansett people , and Williams let it be known that it was not money that would make the island available ; it was instead the love these people had for both Williams and Henry Vane . However , Williams suggested that the exiles give the natives a gratuity in the form of tools , coats and wampum . On 24 March 1638 Williams drew up the deed granting Aquidneck Island to the settlers . The deed was signed " at Narragansett " ( likely Providence ) by the sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi , with Williams and Randall Holden being the witnesses . The names of many of the exiles were included on the deed ; Coddington 's name appeared first because he was responsible for the gratuity . 
 Clarke joined William and Anne Hutchinson and many others in building the new settlement of Pocasset on Aquidneck Island . Within a year of the founding of this settlement , however , there was dissension among the leaders , and Clarke joined Coddington , with several other inhabitants , in moving to the south end of the island , establishing the town of Newport . The Hutchinsons remained in Pocasset , soon renamed Portsmouth , and William Hutchinson became its new ruling magistrate or judge . On 2 January 1639 Clarke and three others were appointed to survey the new lands that would become Newport , and on 5 June they were appointed to proportion the land among the inhabitants . 
 In 1640 the two towns of Portsmouth and Newport united , and the title of the ruling magistrate was changed from Judge to Governor , with Coddington elected to that position . Roger Williams wanted royal recognition for these settlements , and protection against encroachments from their often hostile neighbors of Massachusetts , Plymouth , and Connecticut . In 1643 he went to England to obtain a patent bringing all four towns ( Newport , Portsmouth , Providence , and Warwick ) under one government , and being successful , the document was brought from England and read to representatives of the four towns in 1644 . Coddington was opposed to the Williams patent , because his island towns had grown and prospered much more than the mainland towns of Providence and Warwick . He managed to keep the two island towns from joining with Providence and Warwick until 1647 when representatives of the four towns ultimately met and adopted the patent . Well before this unification , on 13 March 1644 , the name of the island was changed from Aquidneck Island to Rhode Island , and subsequently the name of the colony became the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations . 
 Clarke had some legal training , and Baptist historian Albert Henry Newman argued that Clarke was the principal author of the first complete code of laws that was enacted by the fledgling colony in 1647 . Rhode Island historian and Lieutenant Governor Samuel G. Arnold extolled the virtues of this code , calling it broad in scope , vigorous , original , and bold . In his 1859 history of Rhode Island , Arnold wrote that the legal code of 1647 presented a model of legislation which had not , to that time , been surpassed . 
 = = Founding of the Newport church = = 
 In 1638 , Roger Williams established a Baptist church in Providence , now known as the First Baptist Church in America . The next Baptist congregation was created by John Clarke on Aquidneck Island , and likely had its beginnings when Clarke arrived on the island in 1638 . Massachusetts Governor John Winthrop wrote that from 1640 to 1641 there were " professed Anabaptists " on the island . Thomas <unk> , a Boston lawyer , wrote that there was a church on the island in 1640 , of which Clarke was the elder or pastor , but he understood that the church had been dissolved . Nevertheless , Clarke conducted public worship in Newport from the time of his arrival up until 1644 , when a church at Newport was founded . A much later pastor of the Newport church , the Reverend John Callender , stated in his 1738 " Century Sermon " that " It is said that in 1644 , Mr. John Clarke and some others formed a church on the scheme and principles of the Baptists . " 
 A long @-@ standing contention has existed as to whether Roger Williams or John Clarke established the first Baptist church in America . Though Williams preceded Clarke in becoming a baptized minister , he also vacillated in his convictions , leaving his church altogether . It wasn 't until the last half of the seventeenth century that his Providence church had any form of visible ministry . The only organized and functioning Baptist ministry in all of New England by 1650 was the Newport church under the leadership of Clarke and his elders . The church remains active in its ministry as a Particular ( or Calvinist ) Baptist Church , and carries the name of United Baptist Church , John Clarke Memorial in honor of its founder . 
 The religious beliefs held in the early Newport church were little different than those of the Puritans , other than the fact that the Baptists rejected infant baptism , insisting that a person not be baptized until they understood its spiritual significance . Like the Puritans , the Baptists rejected inspirational preaching of the Holy Spirit , as found later among the Quakers , and accepted predestination . Nevertheless , the Puritans labelled the Baptists , and most other <unk> sects , as Anabaptists , though incorrectly . Because the Puritans considered a second baptism as being a form of rebellion , they associated the Baptists with the dreaded sect of Anabaptists that rioted in Münster , Germany in the 1530s . In practice , Clarke 's church had no similarity to the early Anabaptists , and instead was similar to churches of the General Baptists in England . It offered preaching from multiple sources , allowed an open discussion of doctrine , did not ordain pastors , and did not follow a rigid creed . 
 An associate of Clarke in the early Newport church was Robert Lenthal , a Puritan turned Baptist , who arrived in New England in 1637 , and is considered the first public school teacher in America . Lenthal had been called as the minister in Weymouth , Massachusetts , but he opposed infant baptism , so was too unorthodox for the Bay colony . Shortly after Clarke and Coddington left Pocasset to found Newport , Lenthal arrived there to act as minister or co @-@ teacher . He was very helpful to Clarke and the Newport settlement , but returned to England after just a few years . However , when Clarke later went to England , he was re @-@ associated with Lenthal and with a minister named <unk> Knollys , both of whom had become Particular Baptists in London . Another important member of the early Newport church was Mark Lucar , who became an elder with whom Clarke shared pastoral duties . Lucar had become a Baptist while in England , and arrived in Newport sometime between 1641 and 1644 . He believed in total immersion for baptisms , and Clarke subsequently embraced this practice within the Newport church .

 In 1649 Clarke went to Seekonk ( then in Plymouth Colony but later in Rehoboth , Massachusetts ) to help organize a Baptist church there . Roger Williams confirmed this in a letter to Governor Winthrop when he wrote , " At Seekonk , a great many have lately concurred with Mr. John Clarke , and our Providence men , about the point of a new baptism and the manner by dipping ; and Mr. John Clarke hath been there lately , and Mr. Lucar , and hath dipped them . I believe their practice comes nearer to the first practice of our great Founder , Christ Jesus , than other practices of religion do . " Several members of the Seekonk church had quarreled with their minister , Samuel Newman , and broke off from the main church largely over the issue of infant baptism . Hearing of this division , Clarke and Lucar went to welcome the dissidents , and baptize them by immersion . One of the Seekonk men was Obadiah Holmes , with a disposition opposite to Clarke 's , and considered a " pugnacious man [ and ] a hot @-@ tempered fault @-@ finder " by Clarke biographer Sydney James . 
 When the Massachusetts clergymen and magistrates learned of the Seekonk baptisms , they were furious . In their eyes , these baptisms invalidated the earlier baptisms given to these parishioners as children , and thus invalidated the ministers who performed them . The Massachusetts magistrates then wrote to their counterparts in Plymouth accusing them of doing nothing about the practices . Pressured to act , the Seekonk church excommunicated Holmes , and following court action against him , he was compelled to move to Newport in 1650 or 1651 , with a few other dissidents . He subsequently became an elder of the Newport church .

 In July 1651 , William Witter , a blind and elderly man with Baptist sentiments , was living in Lynn , Massachusetts , but wanted to connect with his Baptist faith . Since he was too infirm to travel to Newport , Clarke , accompanied by Obadiah Holmes and John Crandall , visited him at his home . Following the uproar earlier in Plymouth , it is highly likely that the men 's mission was intended to provoke confrontation . The party arrived on 19 July , a Saturday evening , and held a religious service the next day . Those present included family and visitors and " four or five strangers that came in unexpected " . During the service two constables appeared with a warrant signed by local magistrate Robert Bridge , calling for the arrest of Clarke and his two associates . Though no baptisms had been performed , the wording of the warrant suggested that this was the reason for the men 's arrest . Following their arrest , the men were forced to attend a Puritan religious service . Because this was done against their will , they refused to remove their hats in church ; at the end of the service Clarke stood and explained to the congregation why they refused to remove their hats . The men were detained that evening , then brought before the local magistrates the following day . 
 After being arraigned , the men were free to return to Witter 's before being taken to Boston . While there , Clarke conducted a service and Holmes baptized three people . On 22 July , the prisoners were taken to Boston and held until their trial on 31 July . On the morning of the trial they were brought before Governor John Endicott for questioning , and were accused of being Anabaptists . Clarke replied that he was neither an Anabaptist , nor a <unk> ( one favoring infant baptism ) , nor a <unk> ( one opposing infant baptism ) . The governor said that the three men " deserved death , and he would not have such trash brought into his jurisdiction . " 
 During the trial , the court was represented by Governor Endicott , Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley , and magistrates Richard Bellingham , William Hibbins , and Increase Nowell . The Reverend John Cotton weighed in with denunciation for the prisoners , and the Reverend John Wilson struck Holmes while he was supposedly in the protection of the court . Charges made against the men were ( 1 ) holding an unauthorized religious meeting , ( 2 ) disrupting an authorized meeting ( wearing their hats ) , ( 3 ) administering sacraments illegally , ( 4 ) maintaining that the Massachusetts churches were not true churches , and ( 5 ) maintaining that infant baptism was false baptism . The men were sentenced without any accuser or witness speaking out against them . The outcome of the trial was that Holmes was fined £ 30 , Clarke was fined £ 20 , and Crandall £ 5 . Holmes had been given the heaviest fine because of his excommunication in Seekonk , and for administering the baptisms in Lynn . When Clarke protested their heavy fines , Governor Endicott replied that Clarke " was worthy to be hanged . " In court Endicott told Clarke that his beliefs would not stand up to those of the Puritan ministers . Being insulted by this , Clarke wrote a letter to the court from prison the following day , accepting the implied challenge to have a debate with the Puritan ministers on religious beliefs and practices . In this letter he wrote that " [ I ] do desire you would appoint the time when , and the person with whom " the points could be publicly disputed . The challenge was initially accepted , but without his knowledge , Clarke 's fine was paid by some friends , and he was released from jail . After departing the area , Clarke was then accused by the Puritan elders of defaulting on the challenge . Clarke nevertheless made two more attempts to debate the Puritan clergy , but the case was dropped by the court . Though the debate never took place , Clarke had drafted four points of discussion that detailed his beliefs and position . 
 Friends raised the money to pay the fines for Clarke and Crandall , but without their consent and contrary to their wishes . As soon as Holmes discovered what was happening , he was able to forbid the payment of his fine , as a matter of conscience , though friends attempted to pay for him as well . As a result , on 5 September 1651 Holmes was taken to the town 's whipping post , and given 30 lashes with a three @-@ corded whip . While Holmes told the magistrates , " You have struck me as with roses " , and he claimed to have felt no pain during the incident , for many days afterwards he could only sleep by resting on his knees and elbows . Much later , Rhode Island 's Governor Joseph <unk> wrote , " Those who have seen the scars on Mr. Holmes ' back ( which the old man was wont to call the marks of the Lord Jesus ) , have expressed a wonder that he should live . " 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Following the men 's arrest and ill treatment , Sir Richard Saltonstall wrote from England to Reverends Cotton and Wilson of the Boston church , rebuking them by writing , " These rigid wayes have lay 'd you very <unk> in the hearts of the <unk> . " Shortly after the incident , Roger Williams wrote a letter to Governor Endicott , making an earnest plea for toleration in matters of conscience and religion , but the request was unheeded . However , Williams did not let the matter rest , and used Clarke and Holmes as the subjects of his book The Bloody <unk> Yet More Bloody ( 1652 ) . In the copy of this book that Williams gave to Clarke , he penned the following note in the front , " For his honoured and beloved Mr. John Clarke , an eminent <unk> of Christ Jesus ag 'st ye <unk> Doctrine of persecution , & c . " 
 One positive outcome of the ordeal endured by these men was the conversion and baptism of some of the witnesses . One such witness was Henry Dunster , the first president of Harvard College . Dunster 's conversion in faith resulted in his removal as president in 1654 , but helped inspire the creation of the First Baptist Church of Boston . Some scholars have argued that Clarke 's mission trip was planned to provoke the Massachusetts officials in order to support the cause of Rhode Island in England . Shortly after Clarke arrived in England , he published a book and used it as leverage in obtaining a charter for the Rhode Island colony . 
 = = Time in England = = 
 William Coddington was unhappy with the colonial patent that Roger Williams had obtained in 1643 , and was resistant to the consolidated government of the four Rhode Island towns that ultimately came about in 1647 as a result of the patent . He wanted colonial independence for the two island towns of Newport and Portsmouth , and decided to go to England to present his case to the Colonial Commissioners in London . On 3 April 1651 , the Council of State of England gave Coddington the commission of a separate government for the island of Aquidneck and for the smaller neighboring island of Conanicut ( later Jamestown , Rhode Island ) , with him as governor for life . 
 = = = Repeal of Coddington Commission = = = 
 Criticism of Coddington arose as soon as he returned to Rhode Island with his commission . In September 1651 , William Arnold summed up the feelings of many of the Providence settlers when he wrote , " Whereas Mr. Coddington have gotten a charter of Road Iland and <unk> Iland [ Conanicut Island ] to himself , he have thereby broken the force of their charter that went under the name of Providence , because he have gotten away the greater part of that <unk> . " Clarke voiced his opposition to Coddington 's rule of the island , and on 15 October 1651 he was commissioned as the island 's agent to England . The following month he and William Dyer were sent to England to get the Coddington commission revoked . Simultaneously , the mainland towns of Providence and Warwick sent Roger Williams on a similar errand , and the three men sailed for England in November 1651 , just a few months after Clarke had been released from prison . Because of recent hostilities between the English and the Dutch , the men did not meet with the Council of State on New England until April 1652 . In October 1652 , with the help of Henry Vane , Coddington 's commission for the island government was revoked . William Dyer was the messenger who returned to Rhode Island the following February , bringing the news of the return of the colony to the Williams Patent of 1643 , but Clarke remained in England with his wife . 
 = = = Ill Newes from New England = = = 
 Very soon after arriving in England , Clarke published a book entitled Ill Newes from New England : or a Narrative of New England 's Persecution ... ( 1652 ) . The book begins with a letter to the English Parliament and Council of State , conveying an earnest plea for liberty of conscience and religious toleration . This is followed by another letter , addressed to the Puritan leaders in Massachusetts . The largest part of the book is primarily devoted to Clarke 's beliefs on conducting a church , and why he thought the Massachusetts churches were proceeding in the wrong direction . Even though less than half of the book concerns the persecution that Clarke and his companions experienced at the hands of the Massachusetts authorities , he nevertheless hoped to use the incident as leverage in gaining religious freedoms for the Rhode Island colony . He wrote " it is not the will of the Lord that any one should have dominion over another man 's conscience .... [ Conscience ] is such a sparkling beam from the Father of lights and spirits that it cannot be lorded over , commanded , or forced , either by men , devils , or angels . " 
 The book ultimately had the desired effect . The Massachusetts authorities became so alarmed over the contents of Ill Newes , that they had a rebuttal written by Thomas Cobbet , the minister of the Lynn church . This work , titled The Civil Magistrates Power in Matters of Religion Modestly Debated ( 1653 ) , defended the use of force to maintain the " correct " church in the Massachusetts colony . While this response was well written , it did more to confirm the persecutions of Clarke 's party than to defend the Massachusetts position . Ultimately , the book helped Rhode Island secure significant religious liberties , prompting one Baptist historian to describe Clarke as " the Baptist drum major for freedom in seventeenth century America . " 
 = = = Rhode Island agent = = = 
 Though Clarke was officially Rhode Island 's agent in England , he received little , if any , compensation for this work . However , he remained active in his religious commitment , and joined a Particular Baptist church under the pastorship of William Kiffin . One of his means of support was preaching at this church , which he called his " <unk> place for <unk> and preference " , possibly because this arrangement offered him room and board . Other ways that Clarke was able to find support was by offering legal services and practicing medicine in London . 
 Most of Clarke 's time in England was during the Interregnum when there was no monarch . King Charles I had been executed in 1649 , and his successor , Charles II , did not assume the throne until 1660 . During the intervening period , rule of the country was largely under Parliament or Oliver Cromwell as the Lord Protector . Cromwell wrote a letter to Rhode Island in 1655 , mostly concerning difficulties with France , but he also confirmed the continued validity of Rhode Island 's 1643 patent . While Clarke 's primary purpose in England was to secure a strengthened charter for the Rhode Island colony , one ensuring religious liberties , the relative chaos of England at the time did not offer an opportunity for doing so . Nevertheless , Clarke did assist the colony in 1656 by sending four barrels of powder and eight barrels of shot and bullets , and in 1657 he handled a letter from the colony requesting assistance with legal proceedings against William Harris . 
 With little diplomatic work to do , Clarke remained religiously active , and likely became a Fifth Monarchist ; he was also likely the John Clarke who signed a manifesto in London about the imminent return of Christ . He may have been the John Clarke who signed a document in 1657 asking Cromwell to avoid assuming the title of king , and was likely the one of his name arrested in 1658 for opposing Cromwell 's rule . 
 An important acquaintance of Clarke 's in London was Richard Baily , who provided Clarke with legal expertise , helped him draft petitions to the king , and may have even helped him write Rhode Island 's charter . When Clarke eventually returned to Newport , Baily sailed with him , later providing additional legal counsel , and writing Clarke 's extensive will . Upon Clarke 's death , Baily was the recipient of his books , concordance , and lexicon .
