 = = = Third day = = = 
 At daybreak on the third day , the Phocians guarding the path above Thermopylae became aware of the outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves . Herodotus says that they jumped up and were greatly amazed . Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces . He feared that they were Spartans , but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not . The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand ( assuming that the Persians had come to attack them ) . However , not wishing to be delayed , the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them , before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force . 
 Learning from a runner that the Phocians had not held the path , Leonidas called a council of war at dawn . According to Diodorus , a Persian called <unk> , a <unk> by birth , warned the Greeks . Some of the Greeks argued for withdrawal , but Leonidas resolved to stay at the pass with the Spartans . Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw ( without orders ) , or were ordered to leave by Leonidas ( Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened ) . The contingent of 700 Thespians , led by their general <unk> , refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight . Also present were the 400 Thebans , and probably the helots who had accompanied the Spartans . 
 Leonidas ' actions have been the subject of much discussion . It is commonly stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating , but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated . It is also possible that , recalling the words of the Oracle , Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta . However , since the prophecy was specific to him , this seems a poor reason to commit 1 @,@ 500 other men to a fight to the death . The most likely theory is that Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get away . If all the troops had retreated , the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks down . If they had all remained at the pass , they would have been encircled and would eventually have all been killed . By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass , Leonidas could save more than 3 @,@ 000 men , who would be able to fight again . The Thebans have also been the subject of some discussion . Herodotus suggests that they were brought to the battle as hostages to ensure the good behavior of Thebes . However , as Plutarch long ago pointed out , if they were hostages , why not send them away with the rest of the Greeks ? The likelihood is that these were the Theban ' loyalists ' , who unlike the majority of their fellow citizens , objected to Persian domination . They thus probably came to Thermopylae of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to Thebes if the Persians conquered Boeotia . The Thespians , resolved as they were not to submit to Xerxes , faced the destruction of their city if the Persians took Boeotia . However , this alone does not explain the fact that they remained ; the remainder of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there . It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self @-@ sacrifice , all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster . This seems to have been a particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history , a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death . 
 At dawn , Xerxes made libations , pausing to allow the Immortals sufficient time to descend the mountain , and then began his advance . A Persian force of ten thousand men , consisting of light infantry and cavalry , charged at the front of the Greek formation . The Greeks this time sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians in the wider part of the pass in an attempt to slaughter as many Persians as they could . They fought with spears until every spear was shattered and then switched to <unk> ( short swords ) . In this struggle , Herodotus states that two brothers of Xerxes fell : <unk> and <unk> . Leonidas also died in the assault , shot down by Persian archers , and the two sides fought over his body , the Greeks taking possession . As the Immortals approached , the Greeks withdrew and took a stand on a hill behind the wall . The Thebans " moved away from their companions , and with hands upraised , advanced toward the barbarians ... " ( Rawlinson translation ) , but a few were slain before their surrender was accepted . The king later had the Theban prisoners branded with the royal mark . Of the remaining defenders , Herodotus says : 
 " Here they defended themselves to the last , those who still had swords using them , and the others resisting with their hands and teeth . " 
 Tearing down part of the wall , Xerxes ordered the hill surrounded , and the Persians rained down arrows until every last Greek was dead . In 1939 , archaeologist Spyridon <unk> , excavating at Thermopylae , found large numbers of Persian bronze arrowheads on <unk> Hill , changing the identification of the hill on which the Greeks died from a smaller one nearer the wall . 
 The pass at Thermopylae was thus opened to the Persian army , according to Herodotus , at the cost to the Persians of up to 20 @,@ 000 fatalities . The Greek rearguard , meanwhile , was annihilated , with a probable loss of 2 @,@ 000 men , including those killed on the first two days of battle . Herodotus says at one point that 4 @,@ 000 Greeks died , but assuming that the Phocians guarding the track were not killed during the battle ( as Herodotus implies ) , this would be almost every Greek soldier present ( by Herodotus ' own estimates ) , and this number is probably too high . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 When the body of Leonidas was recovered by the Persians , Xerxes , in a rage against Leonidas , ordered that the head be cut off and the body crucified . Herodotus observes that it was very uncommon for the Persians , as they had the habit of treating " valiant warriors " with great honour ( the example of Pytheas , captured off Skiathos before the Battle of Artemisium , strengthens this suggestion ) . However , Xerxes was known for his rage . Legend has it that he had the Hellespont whipped , the water itself , because it would not obey him . 
 After the Persians ' departure , the Greeks collected their dead and buried them on the hill . After the Persian invasion was repulsed , a stone lion was erected at Thermopylae to commemorate Leonidas . A full 40 years after the battle , Leonidas ' bones were returned to Sparta , where he was buried again with full honors ; funeral games were held every year in his memory . 
 With Thermopylae now opened to the Persian army , the continuation of the blockade at Artemisium by the Greek fleet became irrelevant . The simultaneous naval Battle of Artemisium had been a tactical stalemate , and the Greek navy was able to retreat in good order to the Saronic Gulf , where they helped to ferry the remaining Athenian citizens to the island of Salamis . 
 Following Thermopylae , the Persian army proceeded to burn and sack Plataea and Thespiae , the Boeotian cities that had not submitted , before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens . Meanwhile , the Greeks ( for the most part Peloponnesians ) prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth , demolishing the single road that led through it and building a wall across it . As at Thermopylae , to make this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade , barring the passage of the Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf , so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese . However , instead of a mere blockade , Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet . Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis , the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Salamis , which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese . 
 Fearing that the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe , Xerxes now retreated with much of the army back to Asia , though nearly all of them died of starvation and disease on the return . He left a handpicked force under Mardonius to complete the conquest the following year . However , under pressure from the Athenians , the Peloponnesians eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle , and marched on Attica . Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain , and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea . At the Battle of Plataea , the Greek army won a decisive victory , destroying much of the Persian army , and ending the invasion of Greece . Meanwhile , at the near @-@ simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale , they also destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet , thereby reducing the threat of further invasions . 
 Thermopylae is arguably the most famous battle in European ancient history , repeatedly referenced in ancient , recent , and contemporary culture . In Western culture at least , it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle . However , within the context of the Persian invasion , Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks . It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium ; whatever they may have intended , it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians . The Greek position at Thermopylae , despite being massively outnumbered , was nearly impregnable . If the position had been held for even a little longer , the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water . Thus , despite the heavy losses , forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory , but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well . The battle itself had showed that a few free men were willing to do anything for victory against the invaders . The defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs . That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion . 
 It is sometimes stated that Thermopylae was a Pyrrhic victory for the Persians , one in which the victor is as damaged by the battle as the defeated party . However , there is no suggestion by Herodotus that the effect on the Persian forces was that . The idea ignores the fact that the Persians would , in the aftermath of Thermopylae , conquer the majority of Greece , and the fact that they were still fighting in Greece a year later . Alternatively , the argument is sometimes advanced that the last stand at Thermopylae was a successful delaying action that gave the Greek navy time to prepare for the Battle of Salamis . However , compared to the probable time ( about one month ) between Thermopylae and Salamis , the time bought was negligible . Furthermore , this idea also neglects the fact that a Greek navy was fighting at Artemisium during the Battle of Thermopylae , incurring losses in the process . George Cawkwell suggests that the gap between Thermopylae and Salamis was caused by Xerxes systematically reducing Greek opposition in Phocis and Boeotia , and not as a result of the Battle of Thermopylae ; thus , as a delaying action , Thermopylae was insignificant compared to Xerxes 's own procrastination . Far from labeling Thermopylae as a Pyrrhic victory , modern academic treatises on the Greco @-@ Persian Wars tend to emphasise the success of Xerxes in breaching the formidable Greek position and the subsequent conquest of the majority of Greece . For instance , Cawkwell states that " he was successful on both land and sea , and the Great Invasion began with a brilliant success . .. Xerxes had every reason to congratulate himself " , while Lazenby describes the Greek defeat as " disastrous " . 
 The fame of Thermopylae is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set . Thermopylae is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard , who , despite facing certain death , remained at the pass . Ever since , the events of Thermopylae have been the source of effusive praise from many sources : " ... the fairest sister @-@ victories which the Sun has ever seen , yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men . " A second reason is the example it set of free men , fighting for their country and their freedom : 
 So almost immediately , contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson . In universal terms , a small , free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash . More specifically , the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where , how , and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchy — freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae , and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested . 
 While this paradigm of " free men " <unk> " slaves " can be seen as a rather sweeping over @-@ generalization ( there are plenty of counter @-@ examples ) , it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used Thermopylae to illustrate this point . 
 Militarily , although the battle was actually not decisive in the context of the Persian invasion , Thermopylae is also of some significance , on the basis of the first two days of fighting . The performance of the defenders is used as an example of the advantages of training , equipment , and good use of terrain as force multipliers .

 = = = Monuments = = = 
 There are several monuments around the battlefield of Thermopylae . 
 = = = = Epitaph of Simonides = = = = 
 A well @-@ known epigram , usually attributed to Simonides , was engraved as an epitaph on a commemorative stone placed on top of the burial mound of the Spartans at Thermopylae . It is also the hill on which the last of them died . The original stone has not survived , but in 1955 , the epitaph was engraved on a new stone . The text from Herodotus is : 
 <unk> <unk> ' , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> , τοῖς <unk> <unk> πειθόμενοι . 
 Ō <unk> ' , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 Oh stranger , tell the Lacedaemonians that 
 we lie here , trusting their words . 
 The alternative ancient reading πειθόμενοι <unk> for <unk> πειθόμενοι substitutes " laws " or " orders " for " words . " In other words , the " orders " are not personal but refer to official and binding phrases ( the Ancient Greek term can also refer to a formal speech ) . 
 The form of this ancient Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet , commonly used for epitaphs . Some English renderings are given in the table below . It is also an example of Laconian brevity , a spartan style of verse that allows for varying interpretations of the meaning of the poem . Ioannis <unk> points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible , and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators . 
 It was well known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who had been sent to Thermopylae had been killed there ( with the exception of Aristodemus and <unk> ) , and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta . Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader ( always called ' stranger ' ) for sympathy , but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual , asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out . The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died ' fulfilling their orders ' . 
 The first line of the epigram was used as the title of the short story " Stranger , Bear Word to the Spartans We … " by German Nobel Prize laureate Heinrich Böll . A variant of the epigram is inscribed on the Polish Cemetery at Monte Cassino . 
 John Ruskin expressed the importance of this ideal to Western civilization as follows : 
 Also obedience in its highest form is not obedience to a constant and compulsory law , but a persuaded or voluntary yielded obedience to an issued command .... His name who leads the armies of Heaven is " Faithful and True " ... and all deeds which are done in alliance with these armies ... are essentially deeds of faith , which therefore ... is at once the source and the substance of all known deed , rightly so called ... as set forth in the last word of the noblest group of words ever , so far as I know , uttered by simple man concerning his practice , being the final testimony of the leaders of a great practical nation ... [ the epitaph in Greek ] 
 = = = = Leonidas monument = = = = 
 Additionally , there is a modern monument at the site , called the " Leonidas Monument " , in honor of the Spartan king . It features a bronze statue of Leonidas . A sign , under the statue , reads simply : " Μολὼν λαβέ " ( " Come and take them ! " — as in answer to Xerxes ' demand that the Greeks give up their weapons ) . The <unk> below depicts battle scenes . The two marble statues on the left and the right of the monument represent , respectively , the river Eurotas and Mount <unk> , famous landmarks of Sparta . 
 = = = = Thespian monument = = = = 
 In 1997 , a second monument was officially unveiled by the Greek government , dedicated to the 700 Thespians who fought with the Spartans . The monument is made of marble and features a bronze statue depicting the god Eros , to whom the ancient Thespians accorded particular religious veneration . Under the statue , a sign reads " In memory of the seven hundred Thespians . " 
 A plate , below the statue , explains its symbolism : 
 The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country . 
 The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle , the gallantry , the strength , the bravery and the courage . 
 The open wing symbolizes the victory , the glory , the soul , the spirit and the freedom . 
 The broken wing symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death . 
 The naked body symbolizes Eros , the most important god of the ancient Thespians , a god of creation , beauty and life . 
 The monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans . 
 = = = Associated legends = = = 
 Herodotus ' colorful account of the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events . These accounts are obviously not verifiable , but they form an integral part of the legend of the battle . They often demonstrate the Laconic speech ( and wit ) of the Spartans to good effect . 
 For instance , Plutarch recounts in his Sayings of Spartan Women that upon his departure , Leonidas ' wife Gorgo asked what she should do if he did not return ; to which Leonidas replied , " Marry a good man and have good children . " 
 It is reported that , upon arriving at Thermopylae , the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter . The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp , observe them , and depart . When the scout reported to Xerxes the size of the Greek force and that the Spartans were indulging in calisthenics and combing their long hair , Xerxes found the reports laughable . Seeking the counsel of Demaratus , an exiled Spartan king in his retinue , Xerxes was told that the Spartans were preparing for battle and that it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives . Demaratus called them " the bravest men in Greece " and warned the Great King that they intended to dispute the pass . He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign , but the king had refused to believe him . He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans , " there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defense . " 
 Herodotus also describes the reception of a Persian embassy by Leonidas . The ambassador told Leonidas that Xerxes would offer him the kingship of all Greece if he joined with Xerxes . Leonidas answered : " If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life , you would refrain from coveting others ' possessions ; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race . " Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms . To this Leonidas gave his famous answer : Μολὼν λαβέ ( pronounced Greek pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ) " Come and get them . " 
 Such Laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale . Herodotus writes that when <unk> , a Spartan soldier , was informed that Persian arrows would be so numerous as " to block out the sun " , he retorted , unconcerned ; " So much the better ... then we shall fight our battle in the shade . " 
 After the battle , Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do ( presumably because they had had so few men ) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence . The answer was that all the other men were participating in the Olympic Games . When Xerxes asked what was the prize for the winner , the answer was " an olive @-@ wreath " . Upon hearing this , Tigranes , a Persian general , said : " Good heavens , Mardonius , what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us ? It is not for riches that they contend but for honor ! " ( Godley translation ) or otherwise " Ye Gods , Mardonius , what men have you brought us to fight against ? Men that fight not for gold , but for glory . " 
 = = = In popular culture = = = 
 The Battle of Thermopylae has remained an icon of western civilization ever since it was fought . The battle is revisited in countless <unk> , in literature in song , and in films , television programs and video games . The battle is discussed in many books and articles on the theory and practice of warfare . The movies The 300 Spartans ( 1962 ) and 300 ( 2007 ) were based on the events during and close to the time of the battle . 
 Prior to the battle , the Hellenes remembered the Dorians , an ethnic distinction to which the Spartans belonged , as the conquerors and <unk> of the Ionians in the Peloponnesus . After the battle , Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation , a phenomenon known as <unk> . 
 = Honda Super Cub = 
 The Honda Super Cub is a Honda underbone motorcycle with a four stroke single cylinder engine ranging in displacement from 49 to 109 cc ( 3 @.@ 0 to 6 @.@ 7 cu in ) . 
 In continuous manufacture since 1958 with production surpassing 60 million in 2008 , and 87 million in 2014 , the Super Cub is the most produced motor vehicle * in history . Variants include the C100 , C50 , C70 , C90 , C100EX and C70 Passport . 
 The Super Cub 's US advertising campaign , You meet the nicest people on a Honda , had a lasting impact on Honda 's image and on American attitudes to motorcycling , and is often used as a marketing case study . 
 = = Development = = 
 The idea for a new 50 @-@ cubic @-@ centimetre ( 3 @.@ 1 cu in ) motorcycle was conceived in 1956 , when Honda Motor 's Soichiro Honda and Takeo Fujisawa toured Germany and witnessed the popularity of mopeds and lightweight motorcycles . Soichiro Honda was primarily the engineering and production leader of the company , always with an eye towards winning on the racetrack , while his close partner Fujisawa was the man of finance and business , heading up sales and formulating strategies intended to dominate markets and utterly destroy Honda Motor 's competitors . Fujisawa had been thinking about a long term expansion strategy , and unlike other Japanese companies , they did not want to simply boost production to cash in on the recent economic boom in Japan . A small , high @-@ performance motorcycle was central to his plans . <unk> mobile consumers in postwar Europe typically went from a bicycle to a clip on engine , then bought a scooter , then a bubble car , and then a small car and onwards . Fujisawa saw that a motorcycle did not fit in this pattern for the average person , and he saw an opportunity to change that . Soichiro Honda was at the time tired of listening to Fujisawa talk about his new motorcycle idea ; Honda came to Europe to win the Isle of Man TT race and wanted to think about little else . 
 Fujisawa and Honda visited <unk> and <unk> showrooms , as well as others , researching the kind of motorcycle Fujisawa had in mind . Fujisawa said the designs had " no future " and would not sell well . His concept was a two wheeler for everyman , one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries , urban and rural . The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up to date know how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies . The common consumer complaints of noise , poor reliability , especially in the electrics , and general difficulty of use would have to be addressed . Because Honda was a large company growing larger , it needed a mass appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale . The design had to be sorted out before production began , because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured . The scooter type nearly fitted the bill , but was too complex for developing countries to maintain , and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads . Another of <unk> 's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles , saying to Honda , " If you can design a small motorcycle , say 50 cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside , I can sell it . I don 't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan , but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries . " 
 Once interested , Soichiro Honda began developing the Super Cub on his return to Japan . The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched what he had in mind , Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30 @,@ 000 per month , half again as many as the entire monthly two @-@ wheeler market in Japan . His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan , when most companies ' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies . Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States . To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959 . In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany , then in Belgium and the UK in 1962 , and then France in 1964 . 
 The Honda Juno had been the first scooter to use polyester resin , or fiberglass reinforced plastic ( FRP ) , bodywork , and even though production of the Juno had stopped in 1954 as a result of Honda Motor 's financial and labor problems at the time , Fujisawa continued to encourage research in polyester resin casting techniques , and these efforts bore fruit for the Super Cub . The new motorcycle 's fairing would be polyethylene , the most widely used plastic , which reduced weight over FRP , but Honda 's supplier had never made such a large die cast before , so the die had to be provided by Honda . The Super Cub was the first motorcycle ever to use a plastic fairing . <unk> historian Clement Salvadori wrote that the plastic front fender and leg shields were , " perhaps the Cub 's greatest contribution ; plastic did the job just as well as metal at considerably lower cost . " The technology developed in the Isle of Man TT racing program was equally vital to the new lightweight motorcycle , making possible 3 @.@ 4 kilowatts ( 4 @.@ 5 hp ) from a 50 cc four @-@ stroke Honda engine , where the first engine the company built a decade earlier , a " fairly exact copy " of the 50 cc two stroke war @-@ surplus <unk> engine Honda had been selling as motorized bicycle auxiliary engine , had only a 0 @.@ 37 – 0 @.@ 75 kilowatts ( 0 @.@ 5 – 1 hp ) output . Honda 's first four stroke , the 1951 E @-@ type , had just a little more power than the Super Cub , 3 @.@ 7 kilowatts ( 5 bhp ) , with nearly triple the displacement , 146 cc ( 8 @.@ 9 cu in ) . 
 To make the new motorcycle , Honda built a new ¥ 10 billion factory in Suzuka , Mie to manufacture 30 @,@ 000 , and with two shifts , 50 @,@ 000 , Super Cubs per month . The factory was modeled on the Volkswagen Beetle production line in Wolfsburg , Germany . Until then , Honda 's top models had sold only 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 per month , and observers thought the cost of the new plant too risky an expenditure . Edward Turner of BSA went to Japan to see the motorcycle industry in September 1960 , and said that investments the size of the Suzuka plant were " extremely dangerous " because the US motorcycle market was already saturated . When completed in 1960 , the Suzuka Factory was the largest motorcycle factory in the world , and was a model for Honda 's mass production facilities of the future . The economies of scale achieved at Suzuka cut 18 % from the cost of producing each Super Cub when Suzuka could be run at full capacity , but in the short term Honda faced excess inventory problems when the new factory went into operation before the full sales and distribution network was in place . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Super Cub has been compared to the Ford Model T , Volkswagen Beetle and the Jeep as an icon of 20th century industry and transport . The C100 used a pressed steel monocoque chassis , with the horizontal engine placed below the central spine , a configuration now called the ' step through ' or ' underbone ' motorcycle . By some criteria , the type of motorcycle the Super Cub falls into is difficult to classify , landing somewhere between a scooter and a motorcycle , and sometimes it was called a moped , " step @-@ thru " , or <unk> . 
 A plastic fairing ran from below the handlebars and under the <unk> , protecting the rider 's legs from wind and road debris , as well as hiding the engine from view . This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter , but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle . This had several benefits . It moved the engine down and away from the seat , detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight . It also made engine cooling air flow more direct , and made it possible to fit larger wheels . Placing the engine in the center of the frame , rather than close to the rear wheel , gave it proper front @-@ rear balance . The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat , which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet . The 17 inch wheels , in comparison to the typical 10 inch wheels of a scooter , were more stable , particularly on rough roads , and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar , having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small @-@ wheel scooter . 
 The <unk> overhead valve ( OHV ) air @-@ cooled four stroke single cylinder engine had a 40 @-@ by @-@ 39 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in × 1 @.@ 5 in ) bore × stroke , displacing 49 cubic centimetres ( 3 @.@ 0 cu in ) , and could produce 3 @.@ 4 kilowatts ( 4 @.@ 5 hp ) at 9 @,@ 500 rpm , for maximum speed of 69 km / h ( 43 mph ) , under favorable conditions . The low compression ratio meant the engine could consume inexpensive and commonly available low octane fuel , as well as minimizing the effort to kick start the engine , making the extra weight and expense of an electric starter an unnecessary creature comfort . Though some of the many Super Cub variations came with both kick and electric start , the majority sold well without it . Even the latest 2011 model year Japanese domestic market ( <unk> ) Super Cub 50 and Super Cub 110 versions , with modern technology and conveniences like fuel injection and a fuel gauge , were not offered with an electric start option . 
 The sequential shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted , but <unk> , without the need for a clutch lever control , using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a plate clutch slaved to the <unk> lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine . While not intuitive to learn , once the rider got used to it , the semi @-@ automatic transmission , " took the terror out of motorcycling " for novice riders . Unlike many scooter <unk> , the centrifugal clutch made it possible to push start the Super Cub , a useful advantage if the need arose . 
 The early Super Cubs used a 6 volt ignition magneto mounted on the flywheel , with a battery to help maintain power to the lights , while later ones were upgraded to capacitor discharge ignition ( CDI ) systems . The lubrication system did not use an oil pump or oil filter , but was a primitive splash @-@ fed system for both the crankcase and gearbox , with a non @-@ consumable screen strainer to collect debris in the engine oil . Both the front and rear brakes were drums . On both the front and rear wheels were 2 @.@ 25 " × 17 " wire spoke wheels , with full @-@ width hubs . 
 Honda recommended daily checks of the lights , horn , tire pressure , brakes , fuel and oil level , and a weekly check of the battery electrolyte level . The new engine break in maintenance was done at 320 kilometres ( 200 mi ) , requiring adjustment of the valve <unk> and contact breaker points , and an oil change , and the rider was advised to stay under 48 kilometres per hour ( 30 mph ) for the first 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) . Every 1 @,@ 600 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 000 mi ) the spark plug needed cleaning , and the chain adjustment checked , and every 3 @,@ 200 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 000 mi ) an oil change , breaker point check , and valve adjustment was due . At 8 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 5 @,@ 000 mi ) , major maintenance was due , requiring the removal and cleaning of the carburetor , drive chain , exhaust silencer , and wheel bearings . The rider closed a manual choke to aid in starting at cold temperatures . By the standards of the day , this was a simple motorcycle , with minimal maintenance demands , and it earned a reputation for high reliability . 
 = = You meet the nicest people on a Honda = = 
 In June 1963 in US media , Honda began the 12 @-@ year @-@ long advertising campaign " You meet the nicest people on a Honda " , created by Grey Advertising . Grey had bought the idea from a UCLA undergraduate student , who had created the concept for a class assignment . The event marked the beginning of the decline of domestic and British motorcycle brands in the US market , and the rise of Honda and the other Japanese companies . In December 1965 , Edward Turner said the sale of small Japanese motorcycles was good for BSA , by attracting new riders who would graduate to larger machines , not anticipating that the Japanese would advance over the next 5 years to directly threaten British bikes with technically sophisticated models such as the Honda <unk> , and the Kawasaki Z1 . As a case study in business and marketing , the campaign is still remembered half a century later , with one strategic management textbook saying , " Honda and the <unk> is probably the best known and most debated case in business strategy . " It was credited with having " invented the concept of lifestyle marketing . " 
 Specific elements of the Super Cub 's design were integral to the campaign , such as the enclosed chain that kept chain lubricant from being flung on the rider 's clothing , and the leg shield that similarly blocked road debris and hid the engine , and the convenience of the semi @-@ automatic transmission . Presenting the Super Cub as a consumer appliance not requiring mechanical aptitude and an identity change into " a motorcyclist " , or worse , " a biker " , differentiated Honda 's offering , because , " the dedication required to maintain bikes of that era limited ownership to a relatively small demographic , often regarded as young men known for their black leather jackets and snarling <unk> . " 
 Rather than remaining limited to trying to convince traditional downmarket male buyers to switch to Honda from other brands with the macho approach of most motorcycle advertising at the time , Honda broke new ground . The ad campaign sought to improve the image of motorcycling in general and expand the overall size of the motorcycle market by attracting new riders . In a stroke of good fortune for Honda , Brian Wilson and Mike Love composed the 1964 song " Little Honda " , extolling the joys of riding the Honda 50 , and even inviting the listener to visit their local Honda dealership , in language that sounded as if it could have been written , or at least paid for , by Honda 's advertising <unk> , yet it was not a commercial jingle . The song was released by The <unk> in 1964 , followed by the release of the original recording by The Beach Boys . In 1965 The <unk> released " You Meet the Nicest People on a Honda " , another song promoting the Super Cub , which was actually used in Honda 's TV spots , as a B side to their version of " Sea Cruise . " 
 The long @-@ running campaign , including the slogan , the music , and the upbeat images of respectable , middle and upper @-@ class people , particularly women , riding Hondas became closely associated with the Honda brand ever since . The image Honda created was contrasted with the one <unk> " bad boy " biker and became a focal point of Japan bashing boosterism of US @-@ made Harley @-@ Davidson motorcycles . 
 Aside from Harley @-@ Davidson fans , the company itself had a more conflicted reaction to the successful Honda " You meet the nicest people " campaign . At first they were offended at the suggestion that Harley @-@ Davidson riders were not " nice people . " Harley @-@ Davidson had , since its founding in 1903 , scrupulously cultivated an image of staid respectability , and would not begin to tentatively embrace the " outlaw " demographic of their customer base for at least another ten years . In 1964 they denied any association with one @-@ <unk> bikers , and so distanced themselves from the implications of Honda 's campaign . But they also " tried to have it both ways " , and soon joined Vespa and Yamaha in producing ads that were " suspiciously similar " to " You meet the nicest people . " Whether they were being offended by or imitating Honda , at the time Harley @-@ Davidson did not share the interpretation that Honda 's advertisements , " added to the macho Harley image . "

 The Honda Super Cub debuted in 1958 , ten years after the establishment of Honda Motor Co . Ltd . The original 1952 Honda Cub F had been a clip @-@ on bicycle engine . Honda kept the name but added the prefix ' Super ' for the all @-@ new lightweight machine . The Super Cub sold poorly at first , owing mainly to the recession in Japan , and then 3 months after the 1958 launch , customer complaints began rolling in about slipping clutches . Honda salesmen and factory workers gave up holidays to repair the affected Super Cubs , visiting each customer in person . When it was imported to the US , the name was changed to Honda 50 , and later Honda Passport C70 , and C90 , because the Piper Super Cub airplane trademark had precedence . Similarly , in Britain they were only badged ' Honda 50 ' , ' Honda 90 ' etc. as the Triumph Tiger Cub preceded . 
 The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan ( Japanese ) , included the 1958 Honda Super Cub C100 as one of their 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology . 
 = = = Super Cub line = = = 
 The first Super Cub variation was the C102 , launched in April 1960 . The C102 had electric start in addition to kick starting , and battery & coil ignition instead of magneto , but was otherwise the same as the C100 . 
 The enlarged 86 @.@ 7 cc ( 5 @.@ 29 cu in ) OHV engine of the 1963 C200 was used on the 1965 <unk> step @-@ through . New in 1965 was a 63 cc ( 3 @.@ 8 cu in ) engine with a chain @-@ driven overhead camshaft ( OHC ) . This was used in two new models : the C65 , a step @-@ through with 4 @.@ 1 kW ( 5 @.@ 5 bhp ) , and the <unk> , with a frame like the C110 / C200 and 4 @.@ 6 kW ( 6 @.@ 2 bhp ) @ 10 @,@ 000 rpm . 
 In 1966 the C50 appeared and remained in production through the mid 80s , becoming one of the most widespread and familiar versions of the Super Cub . Honda replaced the C100 's 40 mm × 39 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in × 1 @.@ 5 in ) 50 cc OHV engine with the 39 mm × 41 @.@ 4 mm ( 1 @.@ 54 in × 1 @.@ 63 in ) OHC alloy head and iron cylinder engine from the <unk> and C65 , which increased power from 3 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 6 kW ( 4 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 8 bhp ) . Similarly the <unk> was replaced in 1966 with the 89 @.@ 5 cc ( 5 @.@ 46 cu in ) 5 @.@ 6 kW ( 7 @.@ 5 bhp ) OHC <unk> , which a year later on 1967 , got restyled forks and headlamp like the C50 , to become the familiar C90 . Though the basic design of Cub remained unchanged , new styling and improvements included enclosed front forks . The C100 stayed in production alongside the newer versions one more year , until 1967 . After 1980 the USA C70 was called the C70 Passport . 
 In 1982 , for most markets , Honda fitted a new capacitor discharge ignition ( CDI ) system to replace the earlier contact points ignition , thereby helping to meet emission standards in markets such as the US . At the same time the electrical system was changed from 6 volt to 12 volt . 
 In 1984 , Honda released restyled versions of the Cubs on some markets , with square lamps and plastic @-@ covered handlebars and rear <unk> . On the domestic Japanese market the square style was optional , but in some places such as the UK they replaced imports of the traditionally styled round lamp Cub . 
 In 1986 , a larger 100 cc <unk> engine model was introduced especially for Asian markets . The newer 100 cc model was developed exclusively for Southeast Asian market , especially in Thailand , Malaysia and Vietnam , where <unk> were very popular , with new features such as a telescopic front suspension to replace the older leading link suspension , and a four @-@ speed transmission to replace the older three @-@ speed transmission used in older Cub variants . The 100 cc model was initially known as the Honda Dream in Thailand and Honda EX5 in Malaysia , before being standardised as the Honda EX5 Dream in 2003 . In addition , Honda Japan began importing the made @-@ in @-@ Thailand Dream as the Super Cub C100EX in 1988 . The Japanese C100EX was later being facelifted in 1993 , while the Southeast Asian EX5 Dream retains the 1986 design until today with only minor cosmetic changes . On 2011 , the <unk> EX5 Dream was phased out in Thailand and being replaced with the fuel @-@ injected Honda Dream <unk> , with the powertrain being derived from the fuel @-@ injected Honda Wave <unk> . 
 In the late 1990s , Honda introduced their newer NF series motorcycles , known as Honda Wave series , called the Honda Innova in some markets , which use steel tube frames , front disc brake and plastic cover sets in various displacement options : 100 cc , 110 cc and 125 cc . Though not Cubs , these bikes sold consistently well particularly in European countries , where the production of Honda Cub models had been previously discontinued . However , the production of Honda Cubs in Asia , Africa and South America still continues today even though the newer Honda Wave Series and other designs have been introduced alongside the Cub . 
 In 2007 , Honda began installing their PGM @-@ FI fuel injection system for the Honda Cubs in the Japanese market for lower smog @-@ forming emission . 
 = = = Sports Cub = = = 
 The C110 Sports Cub debuted in October 1960 . The C110 was more like a traditional motorcycle that the rider had to straddle , not a step @-@ through . It had a different frame , with the fuel tank in the on top of the frame and in front of the seat , and the frame 's steel tube spine ran horizontally from the head tube to the seat . It also had a bit more power , increased from 3 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 7 kW ( 4 @.@ 5 to 5 bhp ) @ 9 @,@ 500 rpm . Sub @-@ variants of the Sports Cub were the <unk> , absent the pillion seat , and <unk> , also called <unk> , which had a low exhaust pipe . Early versions of the Sport Cub had a 3 speed gearbox but later this was changed to 4 speed . The C102 stayed in production for six model years , through 1965 , and the C110 Sports Cub through 1966 . 
 In 1963 came an enlarged OHV engine of 86 @.@ 7 cc ( 5 @.@ 29 cu in ) and 4 @.@ 8 kW ( 6 @.@ 5 bhp ) . It was used first in the C200 , which had a frame like the C110 , with more upright handlebars . 
 The <unk> 's last year of production was 1967 , and the <unk> and <unk> took its place for only one year , 1968 . These had the higher @-@ revving 4 @.@ 6 kW ( 6 @.@ 2 bhp ) 63 cc ( 3 @.@ 8 cu in ) engine of the <unk> . Then the 4 @.@ 6 kW ( 6 @.@ 2 bhp ) 71 @.@ 8 cc ( 4 @.@ 38 cu in ) C70 replaced the C65 and <unk> in 1969 . It had the same peak horsepower , but at 9 @,@ 000 rpm instead of 10 @,@ 000 , and more torque , 0 @.@ 53 kg · m ( 5 @.@ 2 N · m ; 3 @.@ 8 lbf · ft ) at 7 @,@ 000 rpm instead of 0 @.@ 48 kg · m ( 4 @.@ 7 N · m ; 3 @.@ 5 lbf · ft ) at 8 @,@ 000 rpm . It was introduced in the USA , Canada and Asia at launch and in the UK in 1972 . 
 = = = Mini bikes = = = 
 In 1960 the <unk> arrived , using the same engine in a much smaller frame with only 5 " wheels . First of the Honda Z series , the <unk> was meant only as a short @-@ distance novelty or paddock bike , but instead found popularity in the monkey bike niche . 
 = = = Trail = = = 
 An on- and off @-@ road version of the Super Cub , what today would be classed as a dual @-@ sport motorcycle but called a trail bike at the time , the <unk> Trail 50 , came out in 1961 . Jack McCormack , the first national sales manager of American Honda Motor Company , said the Trail 50 , and even more so the later Honda <unk> , was the result of Honda 's willingness to listen to and respond customer demand . " When you talk about Japanese manufacturers , their strength ( besides the quality of their equipment ) was that they listened to the marketplace . People always suggest that it was about Japanese management , but , to be frank , I was never impressed with Japanese management . They did what no other motorcycle make did — they listened . " 
 In 1960 , McCormack noticed that one Honda dealer in Boise , Idaho was selling more Honda 50s than the combined total of all six dealers in Los Angeles . He found out that the Idaho dealer , Herb Uhl , † was selling the <unk> as a trail bike by adding knobby tires for off @-@ road traction and a " cheater sprocket , " that is , increasing the final drive ratio by using a larger rear sprocket with more teeth , which increased the effective torque of the rear wheel , trading off lower top speed as a result . Uhl said the advantages of light weight and the automatic clutch allowed unskilled riders to enjoy off @-@ road riding , in comparison to traditional big trail bikes that could be difficult to handle . McCormack shipped a version of Uhl 's customized <unk> to Japan and requested Honda put it into production , and by March 1961 the Trail 50 was available to US dealers . Cycle World praised the simple pleasure of trail riding on the new bike , and it was a US sales success .

 Sales for Super Cubs have increased in Japan with upgrades on the engine and the installation of fuel injection for Japanese domestic market models starting from 2007 , making it more powerful , more economical and cleaner . With respect to newer , plastic body underbone designs , such as the Wave , the original Cub remains popular . 
 Cycle World magazine 's Peter Egan and Steve Kimball entered a stock Honda C70 Passport in the 1981 Craig Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge , competing against specially designed high @-@ mileage two wheelers built by teams of engineering students , and an entry from American Honda . The course was a 65 @-@ mile ( 105 km ) loop near San Luis Obispo that had to be completed in 1 hour and 40 minutes , give or take 10 minutes , meaning an average speed of 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) . Kimball , riding the Passport , won the event through skillful and error @-@ free riding , with 198 miles per US gallon ( 1 @.@ 19 L / 100 km ; 238 mpg @-@ imp ) . 
 In Vietnam , Super Cubs are the predominant model of motorcycle taxi , so that " Honda " has become a genericized trademark or metonymy , equivalent to " <unk> <unk> " referring to any motorcycle taxi . In the English speaking world as well , " Honda " was often a synonym for " motorcycle " as a result of the ubiquity of the Super Cub . 
 The Super Cub was included in The Guggenheim 's 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition . In 2006 , on the Discovery Channel 's The Greatest Ever series , an episode on motorcycles placed the 1958 49 cc Super Cub in first place . James May , a co @-@ presenter on the popular television series Top Gear , bought a Honda Super Cub for the 2008 Season 12 Vietnam special . Author Roland Brown wrote that , " of all the brilliant bikes Honda have built — the <unk> <unk> , Mike Hailwood 's six @-@ cylinder racers , the mighty Gold Wing , you name them — the most important of all is the C100 Super Cub of 1958 . " 
 In 2014 , the Super Cub became the first vehicle in Japan to be granted a three @-@ dimensional trademark .

 Chongqing Guangyu Motorcycle Manufacture Co , of China , known as <unk> , has a line of motorcycles based on the Super Cub Design , licensed from Honda , including the EEC Super Cub . This Super Cub ' remake ' was developed solely for the European market in cooperation with Super Motor Company . Super Motor Company which is the sole European distributor of the EEC Super Cub sells 3 different variations ; the Super 25 , the Super 50 and the Super 100 . <unk> imported a <unk> Super Cub variant to the US , under the name Fly Scout . Similarly , China <unk> Industrial Co . , Ltd. has ten models based on Honda 's Super Cub design , including the <unk> @-@ 2 and <unk> @-@ 1 which are faithful to the original 1958 styling , as well as several more modern <unk> . <unk> Group exports a version to the UK , the 97 cc ( 5 @.@ 9 cu in ) <unk> , which features telescopic forks , a four speed gearbox and a digital gear indicator . 
 <unk> Motors of Taiwan licensed the Super Cub design as the Symba 100 , previously called the Symba 110 , which they exported to the US . While keeping the basic design , <unk> increased the size of the front brake from 110 to 130 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 to 5 @.@ 1 in ) , and added an LED fuel gauge . Instead of leading link front forks , it uses telescopic forks . The Symba engine has a <unk> 101 @.@ 4 cc ( 6 @.@ 19 cu in ) single claimed to produce 6 @.@ 5 hp ( 4 @.@ 8 kW ) at 8500 rpm , with a four speed gearbox using a centrifugal clutch semi @-@ automatic transmission .

 At the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show , Honda presented the EV @-@ Cub concept vehicle , an electric motorcycle patterned after the venerable Super Cub , featuring two @-@ wheel drive by means of electric motors mounted in the hubs of each of the wheels . Honda said they felt keeping the 1958 layout for their 21st century concept bike made sense because , " the human body has not changed in the past 50 years , " and , " the size , shape and position of all the Super Cub parts had a kind of necessity to them , and that the design of the Super Cub was very rational and rider @-@ centric . " The additional space created by the absence of the engine in the center of the frame and the lack of a gas tank created room for <unk> helmet storage , typical of a scooter . Integrated with the new electric motorcycle was an interactive communications system , to let riders converse while riding . Several other companies , including <unk> , KTM , <unk> , and Yamaha have done development on two @-@ wheel drive motorcycles , and have found that the addition of power to the front as well as the rear wheel aids in stability , particularly in corners and in the hands of novice riders . At the time Honda hinted that they would bring the EV @-@ Cub to market in 2010 .

 = First inauguration of Barack Obama = 
 The first inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States took place on Tuesday , January 20 , 2009 . The inauguration , which set a record attendance for any event held in Washington , D.C. , marked the commencement of the first four @-@ year term of Barack Obama as President and Joe Biden as Vice President . Based on the combined attendance numbers , television viewership , and Internet traffic , it was among the most @-@ observed events ever by the global audience . 
 " A New Birth of Freedom " , a phrase from the Gettysburg Address , served as the inaugural theme to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln . In his speeches to the crowds , Obama referred to ideals expressed by Lincoln about renewal , continuity and national unity . Obama mentioned these ideals in his speech to stress the need for shared sacrifice and a new sense of responsibility to answer America 's challenges at home and abroad . 
 Obama and others paid homage to Lincoln in the form of tributes and references during several of the events , starting with a commemorative train tour from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , to Washington , D.C. on January 17 , 2009 . The inaugural events held in Washington from January 18 to 21 , 2009 , included concerts , a national day of community service on Martin Luther King , Jr . Day , the swearing @-@ in ceremony , luncheon and parade , inaugural balls , and the interfaith inaugural prayer service . The presidential oath as administered to Obama during his swearing @-@ in ceremony on January 20 strayed slightly from the oath of office prescribed in the United States Constitution , which led to its re ‑ administration the next day . 
 In addition to a larger than usual celebrity attendance , the Presidential Inaugural Committee increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations . For the first time , the committee opened the entire length of the National Mall as the public viewing area for the swearing @-@ in ceremony , breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations . Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events , and a philanthropist organized a People 's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities . Among the celebrations for the inauguration , the committee hosted a first @-@ ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens . 
 = = Context = = 
 By definition , the inauguration marked the formal culmination of the presidential transition of Barack Obama that began when he won the United States presidential election on November 4 , 2008 and became the President @-@ elect . In accordance with Article I , Section 6 of the United States Constitution , Obama resigned from the United States Senate effective November 16 , 2008 . He was formally elected by the Electoral College on December 15 , 2008 . The results were certified by a joint session of Congress on January 8 , 2009 . 
 Obama , who originally campaigned using the slogan " Change We Can Believe In " and later " Change We Need " , was widely celebrated as the first African American president of the United States and a symbol of change from his Republican predecessor , George W. Bush . Obama also represented a generational change as the first man elected President who was born in the 1960s . He inherited what Peter <unk> termed an " economic mess " that became known as the late @-@ 2000s financial crisis . According to a CNN poll , he embodied youthful energy and transition at a time of economic despair , and inspired more confidence than his immediate predecessors . 
 = = Planning = = 
 The inauguration was planned primarily by two committees : the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee . Although the election was scheduled for November 4 , 2008 , the congressional committee began construction of the inaugural platform on September 24 , 2008 . 
 = = = Joint Congressional Committee = = = 
 The swearing @-@ in ceremony and the inaugural luncheon for President @-@ elect Obama and Vice President @-@ elect Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies , a committee composed of United States Senators Dianne Feinstein , committee chair , Bob Bennett and Harry Reid , and United States Representatives John Boehner , Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi . The committee is overseen by the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration . 
 The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies chose the inaugural theme , " A New Birth of Freedom " , a phrase from Abraham Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address from the Civil War era . The theme , which was selected by the committee to mark the inaugural occasion and honor the 200th anniversary year of Lincoln 's birth , expressed " Lincoln 's hope that the sacrifice of those who died to preserve the United States would lead to ' a new birth of freedom ' for the nation . ' " In his reliance on the inaugural theme , Obama wanted " to give Americans reassurance that today , as in Lincoln 's time , the country would find its way through any crisis " . 
 The congressional committee released the full schedule of the January 20 inaugural events on December 17 , 2008 . The inauguration schedule referred to the President ‑ elect as " Barack H. Obama " , although Obama specified previously that he intended to use his full name for his swearing @-@ in ceremony , including his middle name Hussein . Obama decided to use his full name " Barack Hussein Obama " to " follow the tradition , not trying to make a statement one way or the other " for the inaugural ceremony . During the election campaign , Obama 's detractors tried to use his middle name to imply falsely that he was a Muslim . 
 The District of Columbia City Council passed legislation to enable bars and restaurants to stay open around ‑ the ‑ clock to provide hospitality services to the inaugural festivities attendees . After reaching an agreement with the congressional committee , District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty signed legislation to temporarily allow bars and restaurants to operate 24 hours during the weekend leading up to the inauguration , but with 4 : 00 am EST as the cut ‑ off for alcoholic beverage service . The Hotel Association of Metropolitan Washington agreed to pay for extended train service provided by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority on January 19 to accommodate visitors attending inaugural events and workers providing support for those events .

 The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee organized several other inauguration ‑ related events at the direction of the President ‑ elect and Vice President ‑ elect of the United States , such as the train ride , concerts , parade , balls and prayer service . The co @-@ chairs of the committee were William Daley , Penny Pritzker , John Rogers , Patrick Ryan and Julianna Smoot . 
 For the first time in history , the Presidential Inaugural Committee opened the full length of National Mall , which extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial , as the public viewing area for the swearing @-@ in ceremony . The presidential committee set aside a section of the mall close to the U.S. Capitol for people holding reserved tickets for the inaugural event . The committee directed the opening of the entire National Mall to make the event " ' the most open and accessible in history , ' allowing those who [ could not ] get the [ reserved ] tickets to the swearing @-@ in ceremony on the Capitol grounds to fill the mall " . To enable people in attendance to see and hear the swearing @-@ in ceremony , the committee arranged for placement of <unk> at points along the entire mall . 
 Despite criticism that such a large event could not be carbon @-@ friendly , the presidential committee incorporated environment @-@ friendly measures in its planning of the inaugural events . The environmental measures included the use of recyclable carpet for the platform , retrieval of recyclable items from outdoor areas after an event , and the use of recycled paper for invitations and inaugural ball tickets . 
 = = = = Fundraising = = = = 
 The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee attempted to raise more individual contributions in smaller dollar amounts compared with the second inauguration of George W. Bush in 2005 . The 2009 contribution limit was set at $ 50 @,@ 000 for donations by individuals , whereas individuals and companies were able to give a maximum of $ 250 @,@ 000 apiece for the 2005 event . As of January 30 , 2009 , the presidential committee raised more than $ 53 million , with at least 458 people giving the committee @-@ imposed maximum of $ 50 @,@ 000 , including celebrity donors such as George Soros , Halle Berry , Jamie Foxx and George Lucas . Emphasizing a change from business as usual , the committee set stringent guidelines for campaign contributions , barring donations from corporations , political action committees , registered federal lobbyists , labor and trade unions , registered foreign agents and non @-@ U.S. citizens . The committee did accept donations from people with active lobbying interests before the federal government , but not registered as federal lobbyists , such as Google executive Eric Schmidt and Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer . 
 Based on its fundraising efforts and crowd estimates for the Obama inauguration , the presidential committee set its budget at $ 160 – $ 170 million for the inauguration , including about $ 45 million for the gala events . The federal government contributed about $ 49 million , including $ 1 @.@ 2 million to cover the actual swearing @-@ in ceremony . The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $ 75 million alone for police , fire and medical services .

 The Presidential Inaugural Committee and members of the 111th U.S. Congress distributed invitations and color @-@ coded tickets to both dignitaries and ordinary citizens for the reserved sections on or near the U.S. Capitol grounds to view the swearing @-@ in ceremony . Invitations and tickets were sent to ambassadors and chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses , but not to other representatives of foreign countries , and invitations were distributed to U.S. politicians and an array of dignitaries across the spectrum of business and industry . House and Senate congressional members distributed free tickets for the inaugural ceremony to the public by lottery or on a first ‑ come , first served basis because of overwhelming requests to attend the event . 
 Because of high demand and limited availability of the reserved tickets , some people planned to offer their tickets for sale through ticket brokers , Internet auctions and classified listing services . Sales offers for tickets reached as high as $ 1 @,@ 750 each for the reserved standing room section behind the Capitol Reflecting Pool , $ 5 @,@ 500 each for the reserved standing room section in front of the Reflecting Pool and $ 20 @,@ 000 each for the VIP section on the Capitol grounds . In one case , a former legislative aide to Representative Ted Poe was exposed by a prospective buyer after the former aide used Craigslist and e ‑ mail to offer five tickets to the buyer for $ 4 @,@ 500 . 
 Federal and state officials became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing @-@ in ceremony . Senator Dianne Feinstein , chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies , introduced legislation in mid @-@ November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing @-@ in ceremony . At the same time , the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators , ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets . To address the committee 's concerns , StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing @-@ in ceremony on all of its sites . Senator Feinstein re @-@ introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing @-@ in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising . The U.S. Senate failed to pass the final bill , which caused the bill to die in the closing days of the lame duck legislative session .

 = = = Train ride : Commemorating Lincoln = = = 
 On January 17 , 2009 , Obama hosted a whistle stop train tour in honor of the 200th anniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln . Obama reenacted the final part of Lincoln 's 1861 train tour from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania to Washington , D.C. to capture the mood of the 1861 Springfield to Washington train tour traveled by Lincoln to his own inauguration . For his train ride to the nation 's capital , Obama rode in the Georgia 300 , a vintage railroad car used by past presidents and the same one he used for touring Pennsylvania during his presidential primary campaign . On the tour , Obama was accompanied by his wife Michelle , their daughters Malia and Sasha , and a host of friends and guests . 
 For the train ride to Washington , Obama invited 41 " everyday Americans " that he met during his presidential campaign to accompany him on the tour and attend other inaugural events , including the swearing @-@ in ceremony , the parade and an inaugural ball . The group of citizens who joined the tour had shared stories with then @-@ candidate Obama about themselves and their families during the presidential campaign , and included Matt Kuntz and Lilly Ledbetter . Kuntz , who lost his own step ‑ brother to suicide after returning home from the Gulf War , dedicated his efforts to improve mental health screening for Iraq War veterans . Ledbetter , who learned years later that her employer had discriminated against her in pay based on gender , lost her case before the Supreme Court because she did not file her claim within 180 days of the discriminatory act . Nine days after his inauguration , Obama as president signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , allowing claims filed against employers not only within 180 days of the pay discrimination , but also restarting the 180 @-@ day period for claims upon receiving any paycheck based on a discriminatory pay action . 
 Obama commenced the tour in Philadelphia by holding a town hall meeting at 30th Street Station with a few hundred supporters . At the first stop in Wilmington , Delaware Vice President ‑ elect Biden and his family joined the tour . Biden , dubbed " Amtrak Joe " for his daily commutes on Amtrak between Wilmington and Washington , built a reputation as a supporter of increased funding for U.S. commuter rail transportation . The train continued to Baltimore , Maryland , its second stop , where Obama spoke to a crowd of about 40 @,@ 000 people . 
 During his speeches to the crowds , he emphasized the theme " A New Birth of Freedom " using phrases associated with Lincoln such as " better angels " and " a new declaration of independence " . Obama referred to patriotic forebearers in his speech when he reminded the crowds that " we should never forget that we are the heirs of that first band of patriots , ordinary men and women who refused to give up when it all seemed so improbable ; and who somehow believed that they had the power to make the world anew . " Thousands of well ‑ wishers gathered at various points along the train route taking pictures , cheering and waving American flags and homemade signs , with Obama reciting his trademark rejoinder " I love you back " to the enthusiastic crowds . The one @-@ day train tour concluded at Union Station in Washington , D.C.

 On January 18 , 2009 , the day after Obama arrived in Washington , D.C. , an inaugural concert , " We Are One " , took place at the Lincoln Memorial . The concert featured performances and readings of historical passages by more than three dozen celebrities . Attendance at the concert was free to the public , and HBO broadcast the concert live on an open feed , enabling anyone with cable television to watch the event . An estimated 400 @,@ 000 people attended the concert at the Lincoln Memorial . The Washington Metro recorded 616 @,@ 324 passenger trips during the day , breaking the old Sunday ridership record of 540 @,@ 945 passenger trips set on July 4 , 1999 .

 The eve of the Inauguration Day , January 19 , 2009 , fell on Martin Luther King , Jr . Day , a U.S. federal holiday in recognition of Dr. King 's birthday . Obama called upon communities everywhere to observe the King Day of Service , a day of citizen volunteer service honoring the human rights leader . More than 13 @,@ 000 community service events took place across the nation on the day , the largest participation in the 14 years since Congress passed the King Holiday and Service Act and more than double the previous year 's events . 
 Obama spent an hour at Walter Reed Army Medical Center meeting privately with the families of troops who were recovering from wounds sustained in the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan . After visiting the medical center , he , along with Martin Luther King , III , headed to the Sasha Bruce House homeless shelter for teens to participate with others in service activities . 
 Joe Biden hung drywall at a Habitat for Humanity home in N.E. Washington , D.C. Biden 's wife , Jill , their daughter , Ashley Biden , Michelle Obama and the Obamas ' daughters , Malia and Sasha , spent the morning at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium where they helped thousands of volunteers prepare more than 85 @,@ 000 care packages destined for U.S. troops overseas .

 The inaugural ceremony took place at the West Front of the United States Capitol on January 20 , 2009 . The ceremony opened with the playing of pre ‑ recorded music and a live performance by " The President 's Own " United States Marine Band , followed by live performances by the San Francisco Boys Chorus and San Francisco Girls Chorus . Senator Dianne Feinstein , chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the first woman to preside over a U.S. presidential inauguration , acted as the day 's Master of Ceremonies . 
 Evangelical pastor Rick Warren delivered the invocation for the inaugural ceremony , followed by a performance by vocalist Aretha Franklin , who sang " My Country , ' Tis of Thee " . The program featured a performance of John Williams ' composition " Air and Simple Gifts " , which was both pre @-@ recorded and performed live synched with the recording by cellist Yo @-@ Yo Ma , violinist Itzhak Perlman , pianist Gabriela Montero and clarinetist Anthony McGill . National Public Radio described the performance by the quartet as " a transporting moment that moved many with its beauty and calm " , while The New York Times called it the " classical @-@ music equivalent of lip @-@ syncing " . Aretha Franklin made a fashion statement by wearing a hat with a distinctive Swarovski crystal @-@ studded bow . 
 Vice President ‑ elect Biden took his oath from Associate Justice John Paul Stevens . After he completed his oath of office , Biden received in his honor as the new Vice President the first playing of four ruffles and flourishes and the march " Hail , Columbia " by members of the armed forces . After the performance of " Air and Simple Gifts " , Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to President ‑ elect Obama shortly after noon . The inaugural ceremony ran longer than scheduled , which delayed the administering of the oath so that it finished around 12 : 05 pm EST ( 17 : 05 UTC ) . However , Obama assumed the presidency at the expiration of President Bush 's term at noon under the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution . After he completed the presidential oath , Obama received in his honor as the new President the 21 @-@ gun salute , and the first playing of four ruffles and flourishes and the march " Hail to the Chief " by members of the armed forces . 
 Obama delivered his inaugural address to the crowds as the President of the United States following his swearing @-@ in ceremony . Poet Elizabeth Alexander then delivered the inaugural poem , " Praise Song for the Day " , and civil rights activist Joseph Lowery , minister of the United Methodist Church , delivered the benediction . The United States Navy Band " Sea Chanters " chorus concluded the ceremony with a performance of the United States national anthem , " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " . 
 = = = = Oath of office = = = = 
 Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to Obama . Michelle Obama held the Bible , which was used by Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration , as Barack Obama placed his hand on the Bible and recited the presidential oath . Nearly four years earlier , then @-@ Senator Obama had been one of 22 Senators to vote against Roberts during Roberts ' Supreme Court nomination ; the inauguration marked the first time a Chief Justice administered the oath to a President @-@ elect who had previously voted against the Chief Justice 's confirmation . 
 Roberts and Obama made several mistakes as they recited the oath . The proper wording for the oath of office is prescribed in the Constitution : 
 I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . 
 Roberts had practiced for the ceremony carefully . However , a memo noting his planned pauses in the recitation of the oath failed to reach Obama 's staff before the swearing @-@ in . As a result , Obama inadvertently interrupted Roberts during the first phrase , stating " I , Barack " while Roberts was finishing " do solemnly swear " . Obama then correctly repeated the entire phrase " I , Barack Hussein Obama , do solemnly swear . " 
 Roberts , who was not using notes , rendered the next phrase as " that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully , " misplacing the word faithfully and saying president to instead of president of . Obama repeated , " that I will execute " , then paused . Roberts attempted to correct the wording , but stumbled : " the off – faithfully the pres – the office of President of the United States . " Obama then repeated Roberts ' initial incorrect wording . 
 Roberts ended the presidential oath by appending the phrase " so help you God " to the end of the constitutionally prescribed oath , and Obama responded " so help me God " when he was prompted . Obama had asked previously to include " so help me God " after the oath . Roberts then congratulated Obama as the new President . 
 = = = = Second oath ceremony = = = = 
 Much public discussion arose about the errors in administering and reciting the oath . Several constitutional scholars said that Obama should retake the oath . Boston University constitutional scholar Jack Beerman suggested that while the courts would likely never even consider a challenge , he would still advise Obama to retake the oath if he were his lawyer since " the Constitution says what he 's supposed to say . " Although Robert Gibbs , White House press secretary , indicated at first that President Obama did not plan to retake the oath , Chief Justice Roberts agreed to re @-@ administer the oath at the request of White House counsel Greg Craig . The second oath ceremony took place on the evening of January 21 , 2009 in the Map Room of the White House before a small audience of presidential aides , reporters and a White House photographer . Craig said that the White House ultimately decided to re @-@ administer the oath out of an abundance of caution . Craig added that " the oath of office was administered effectively and ... the President was sworn in appropriately ... But the oath appears in the Constitution itself . " No Bible was present during the retake of the inauguration . 
 = = = = Inaugural address = = = = 
 A central theme of President Obama 's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility — both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved . Obama 's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases . Instead , he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation 's history in a speech that was understated deliberately , according to rhetoric expert James Mackin . 
 Obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying , " we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents . " The speech reinforced words such as " legacy " and " heritage " , as well as values such as " honesty " , " courage " and " patriotism " , which " are old " values . Near the end of the speech , Obama referred to words written by Thomas Paine in The American Crisis , which were ordered by George Washington to be read to his troops : " Let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter , when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country , alarmed at one common danger , came forth to meet [ it ] . " Because Obama 's campaign message focused on the need for change , Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation 's traditions . 
 Obama 's goal for his Inaugural speech was to stir the following response among Americans : " This is why I want to go into public service and be a better politician . This is why I want to go home and be a better parent , better worker , better citizen . " 
 As part of Obama 's call for responsibility , he said " what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility — a recognition , on the part of every American " and " those of us who manage the public 's dollars will be held to account . " Obama quoted the lyrics of the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields song " Pick Yourself Up " from the musical comedy Swing Time , saying that " starting today , we must pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off , and begin again the work of remaking America . " In an article for The New York Times , columnist and former drama critic Frank Rich noted the link to the lyric in Field 's song from the movie , writing that Obama offered in his address " one subtle whiff of the Great Depression " . 
 Obama 's speech contained several biblical references and was compared to oratory of the " black church tradition . " Obama also highlighted the United States ' religious diversity , referring to the country 's " patchwork heritage " as a strength and saying , " We are a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus and non @-@ believers . " This was the first time a United States President acknowledged American non @-@ believers in an inaugural address . 
 Obama 's inaugural address received mixed reviews , with some describing the tone of the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking , while others described the speech as low @-@ brow and cliched . Despite his optimism , Obama was critical of former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton . David E. Sanger , chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times , described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt 's call for restoration of American values . The Bush administration was upset about the tone of the speech , saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe . Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity , while Rahm Emanuel , Obama 's White House Chief of Staff , described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people . In an analysis of the inaugural address , one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage . 
 = = = = Prayers = = = = 
 Obama 's selections of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial . Warren had a history of vocal opposition to same @-@ sex marriage , and Lowery had a background as a civil rights activist . Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community . In the invocation , Warren asked for " forgiveness for Americans ' when we fight each other ' and ' civility in our attitudes even when we differ . ' " Warren mentioned Dr. Martin Luther King and Jesus in the invocation , and he concluded the invocation with the Lord 's Prayer . Lowery used humor as he delivered the benediction . One of his messages was the statement that " as we leave this mountaintop , help us to hold on to the spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family . " Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day " when brown can stick around , when yellow will be mellow , when the red man can get ahead man and when white would embrace what is right " . Conservatives , including Rush Limbaugh decried Lowery 's benediction , which quoted from " Lift Every Voice and Sing " ( the " Black National Anthem " ) , as racist , while Democrats disagreed . Another of Lowery 's rhymes , " When black will not be asked to get in back " , particularly offended the likes of Limbaugh who felt that Obama 's ascension on that day symbolized the fact that America had come to that point already .

 After the inaugural ceremony , President Obama , First Lady Michelle Obama , Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden escorted former President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush to a departure ceremony on the east side of the U.S. Capitol . Before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition , President Obama signed his first presidential orders in the President 's Room at the Capitol , and then signed the guest book for the luncheon . The first order signed by Obama was a proclamation declaring his Inauguration Day a " National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation " , in which he called " upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century " . Next , Obama signed orders to officially present the nominations for his Cabinet and several sub ‑ Cabinet officials to the U.S. Congress for its approval . The Obamas and Bidens then attended an inaugural luncheon at the U.S. Capitol before traveling from there to the presidential reviewing stand at the White House to watch the parade . 
 = = = = Luncheon = = = = 
 As former President and Mrs. Bush began their journey to their Texas home , the Obamas and Bidens joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in National Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol . Guests included top Washington lawmakers as well as former Presidents and Vice Presidents . Commemorating the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial , the red and white china used during the luncheon were replicas of those used in the Lincoln White House . 
 A luncheon at the U.S. Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 ( before that time , the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady ) . The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon , which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President , included seafood stew , duck and pheasant entrees with Pinot noir wine , and a dessert of apple cinnamon sponge cake with sweet cream <unk> . Since 1985 , a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table . For the 2009 inaugural luncheon , the featured painting was Thomas Hill 's 1865 View of the Yosemite Valley , a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln 's 1864 signing of the Yosemite Grant , which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use . 
 During the luncheon , Senator Ted Kennedy collapsed after suffering a seizure , and he was transported to a hospital for medical treatment . Early reports about the medical emergency suggested erroneously that Senator Robert Byrd , the oldest member of the Senate , also fell ill during the luncheon . These reports were later denied , and Byrd , a longtime friend of Kennedy , eventually explained that the Kennedy incident disturbed him and caused him to leave .

 The inaugural parade route ran along Pennsylvania Avenue , N.W. from the U.S. Capitol , ending at the north face of the White House . During most of the parade , President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama traveled in the new armored limousine because of potential security threats . The President and First Lady twice exited their limousine , walking on Pennsylvania Avenue for portions of the parade . Vice President Biden and his wife Jill walked the parade route at several points with their children Beau , Hunter and Ashley . 
 The parade lasted more than two hours during the afternoon and early evening following the inaugural ceremony . Parade participants included 15 @,@ 000 people , 240 horses , a mariachi band , dozens of marching bands , the Virginia Military Institute corps of cadets , and two drum and bugle corps : The Cadets and the Colts . Obama invited the marching band from Punahou School , his high school in Hawaii , to perform in the parade along with the marching unit of its Junior Reserve Officers ' Training Corps . 
 Vice President Joe Biden invited several groups from Delaware to march in the parade . The Delaware section was led by the Delaware Volunteer Firemen 's Association of which Biden is an honorary member , the Fightin ' Blue Hen Marching Band , The Pride of Delaware , from Biden 's alma mater , the University of Delaware , and the Delaware State University Hornets Approaching Storm marching band . 
 NASA astronaut Rex J. <unk> marched in the parade carrying an American flag and wearing a prototype of NASA 's next generation spacesuit . Astronaut Michael L.

In addition to Astronauts <unk> and Gernhardt , the crew of the STS @-@ 126 Space Shuttle Endeavour mission also marched in the inaugural parade .

 President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended 10 official inaugural balls during the evening of January 20 , 2009 . Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx , a Chicago @-@ based menswear company . He also wore a white bow tie , instead of the conventional black . Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas , as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white waistcoat and tails . Michelle Obama wore a white , one @-@ shouldered , sleeveless gown designed by 26 @-@ year @-@ old New York @-@ based designer Jason Wu , breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton , who showcased designers from their hometowns . 
 The Neighborhood Inaugural Ball , one of six balls held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center , was the first stop of the evening for the President and First Lady . The Obamas danced their first song as Beyoncé Knowles serenaded them with her rendition of the Etta James classic " At Last " . According to the Presidential Inaugural Committee , the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball was the first ball ever with free or affordable tickets , a contrast to recent history in which " inaugural balls generally have been closed to everyday Americans , populated instead by an exclusive circle of dignitaries and donors . " A portion of the tickets for the ball was reserved for Washington D.C. residents . 
 The nine other official inaugural balls attended by the Obamas that evening included : 
 The Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief 's Ball , National Building Museum , held only for the second time , included active and reserve duty members of the United States military , the families of American service members currently deployed overseas , the families of military personnel killed in action and recipients of the Purple Heart .

The prayer service was attended by about 3 @,@ 200 other invited guests , including members of the U.S. Congress , diplomats and other dignitaries . 
 The theme of the interfaith worship service reflected inclusiveness and religious diversity , with a mix of Protestant pastors , female Hindu and Muslim religious leaders , rabbis and Catholic and Episcopal bishops who delivered scripture readings and prayers throughout the service . Prayers for the service drew from passages from the 1789 inauguration prayer service of George Washington and the 1865 inaugural address of Abraham Lincoln , including phrases such as " with malice toward none , with charity for all " . The featured sermon for the inaugural prayer service was delivered by Reverend Sharon E. Watkins , general minister and president of the Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) and the first woman to deliver the sermon for the inaugural prayer service . In her sermon , Watkins integrated passages from a variety of sources , such as passages summoned from sources rooted in the Hindu , Jewish , Muslim and Cherokee faiths .

 No official count was taken of the number of people attending the inaugural ceremony , although multiple sources concluded that the ceremony had the largest audience of any event ever held in Washington , D.C. Government agencies and federal officials , who coordinated security and traffic management , determined the attendance count to be 1 @.@ 8 million people based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground . The Washington Post reported the estimated crowd size for the inaugural ceremony , and the National Park Service said it did not contest the estimate . 
 Stephen Doig , a professor at Arizona State University , estimated that 1 @.@ 1 million people attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image . Although the image was taken a little less than 45 minutes before Obama 's swearing @-@ in ceremony , Doig adjusted his estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event . In spite of his crowd estimate , Doig stated that " if I had to bet , I would say the [ Barack ] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [ Johnson ] or any of the other things ... I 'm wholly prepared to think it was the largest crowd . " Approximately 1 @.@ 2 million people had attended the second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 . 
 Amid the massive crowds that arrived at the U.S. Capitol for the inauguration , about 4 @,@ 000 ticket holders were unable to gain entry to reserved areas on the Capitol grounds after security personnel closed the gates at the start of the formal ceremony . Many ticket holders were stuck in underground tunnels where pedestrian traffic was directed to and from the National Mall .

Others remained stuck in long lines as they waited to gain entry to the reserved areas .

 As with the 54th and 55th Presidential <unk> , in 2001 and 2005 , respectively , the 56th Presidential Inauguration in 2009 was designated as a National Special Security Event ( NSSE ) , resulting in the United States Secret Service being the lead Federal agency for the development and implementation of the overall security plan ; the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) being the lead Federal agency for counter terrorism , intelligence , and criminal investigation ; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) being the lead Federal agency for crisis management in the aftermath of any terrorist attack , natural disaster or other catastrophic incident . The United States Capitol Police had primary responsibility for security and emergency response within the Capitol Complex to include the Inaugural Platform and the Inaugural Luncheon . The NSSE designation was made by Michael Chertoff , Secretary of Homeland Security , on December 10 , 2008 . The inauguration took place in an era of enhanced security in the decade following the September 11 attacks . Because of the size of the crowds expected in Washington , D.C. for the inaugural activities , planners raised concerns about public safety and security . Army General Richard Rowe , head of the joint military task force for the Washington , D.C. area , explained that security forces had to stretch their imagination to anticipate previously unthinkable security threats , especially in light of the Mumbai attacks in India that occurred in November 2008 . Attention was heightened by terrorist threats . 
 The police presence in the District of Columbia temporarily doubled , augmented by the addition of 8 @,@ 000 police officers from around the United States . The police force was assisted by 1 @,@ 000 FBI agents to provide security for the event , and the Secret Service <unk> team was assigned to hidden locations throughout the area . The Transportation Security Administration had over 300 officers from its National Deployment Force on hand to assist the Secret Service with security inspections of attendees entering the National Mall . Ten thousand National Guard troops were on site , with 5 @,@ 000 troops providing security duty in a ceremonial capacity and 1 @,@ 300 unarmed troops aiding Park Police in crowd control at the National Mall . C Company of the 1 – 175 Infantry provided security between the first and second public viewing areas of the National Mall at the 7th Street , N.W. intersection , while the remaining members performed other security functions . The Federal Aviation Administration implemented additional airspace restrictions over Washington , D.C. between 10 : 00 am and 6 : 00 pm on January 20 , 2009 . Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was chosen as the designated survivor to ensure continuity of government in case of catastrophe , and he spent Inauguration Day at a U.S. military installation outside of the Washington , D.C. area . 
 No one from the crowds at the swearing @-@ in ceremony or parade was arrested on Inauguration Day . According to a senior federal agent associated with managing security , the fact that no arrests were made by any agency during the inaugural events was unheard of for a record crowd of nearly two million gathering in Washington , D.C. In the 2009 book In the President 's Secret Service , author and journalist Ronald Kessler said intelligence officials received information that individuals associated with Al @-@ Shabaab , a Somalia @-@ based Islamist insurgency group , might try to disrupt the inauguration . More than a dozen counter @-@ sniper teams were stationed along the inauguration parade route in response , and the criminal records of nearby employees and hotel guests were scrutinized , but no such attack took place . Kessler also reported a number of perceived inadequacies in the security during the inauguration , including an instance in which more than 100 major campaign donors and VIPs were able to board " secure " buses without being checked .

 Nielsen television ratings indicated that 29 @.@ 2 % of televisions in the 56 largest media markets in the United States were tuned to the inauguration , the largest audience since Ronald Reagan 's first inauguration in 1981 and nearly double the viewership of the 2005 inauguration of George W. Bush . The Raleigh @-@ Durham market had the largest TV audience with more than 51 % of households tuned into the day 's events , a number attributed in part to a snowstorm that kept people inside and in part to the large African American population in that community . Of the top 10 media markets in terms of viewership , four were in North Carolina , two were in Virginia and one was in Maryland , with the Washington D.C. market ranking second highest in television viewership . In addition , schools and workplaces across the country allowed viewing of the inauguration because the event occurred on a weekday . 
 As measured between 10 : 00 am and 5 : 00 pm EST , U.S. television viewership for the Obama inaugural events achieved an average of 37 @.@ 8 million across 17 broadcast and cable channels , not including online viewers who watched live streaming video of the events . Although the Obama inaugural events achieved an average U.S. television viewership of 37 @.@ 8 million across both broadcast networks and cable channels , viewership for the events was lower than the U.S. television viewership for the 1981 Reagan inaugural festivities , which averaged 41 @.@ 8 million across the ABC , CBS and NBC broadcast networks alone .

 The international community paid unprecedented attention to the inauguration of Barack Obama . Millions of people , including citizens of numerous countries around the world and American expatriates living in those countries , watched the Obama inauguration live on television and on the Internet . In some countries , the Obama inauguration garnered as much viewership as the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics . 
 Celebrations surrounding the inauguration , praise of the event 's significance and congratulations to Obama on his inauguration were internationally diverse . In Kenya , the home country of Obama 's father , people celebrated the inauguration as a public holiday . Indonesians and Americans in Jakarta watched the inauguration at a free midnight ball featuring performances by students from State Elementary School Menteng 01 , the school that Obama attended as a child . The city of Obama in Japan celebrated the event with fireworks , bell @-@ ringing and hula @-@ dancing at the <unk> Temple . Governor General Michaëlle Jean and Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada extended congratulations on behalf of Canadians , while Mexican President Felipe Calderón wished Obama " great success in the work as the new President of the United States " . Israeli President Shimon Peres described Obama 's inauguration as a " great day " for the United States , and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown noted that " The whole world is watching the inauguration of President Obama , witnessing a new chapter in both American history and the world 's history . " 
 Leaders of some countries reserved enthusiasm for the Obama inauguration , with coverage of the event even muted in some places . Cuban President Raúl Castro , brother of former Cuban president Fidel Castro , declared that " [ Obama ] looks like a good man , I hope he is lucky " , while Ricardo Alarcón , president of the Cuban legislature , admitted in his comments about Obama that " the incoming [ U.S. ] president ' is a big question mark .

" State @-@ owned Channel One Russia , Russia 's flagship early evening news show , covered Obama 's presidential inauguration as a minor news story , devoting much of the day 's airtime instead to the gas war with Ukraine . The People 's Republic of China covered the Obama inauguration live on its state ‑ controlled China Central Television , providing simultaneous translation into Mandarin Chinese with a brief delay to allow censoring of Obama 's comments . When President Obama mentioned " earlier generations faced down fascism and communism " , Chinese state television officials cut away abruptly from the televised speech and switched to a discussion in the studio . State @-@ controlled print , radio and television media in North Korea provided no coverage or mention of the Obama inauguration in the hours after the event , opting instead to cover news about Equatorial Guinea welcoming the North Korean ambassador . 
 Ordinary citizens in Iraq even viewed the new president with cautious optimism . One Iraqi citizen opined that " If [ Obama ] can do as well as he talks , then all our problems are over " , adding a belief that " [ Obama ] is a good man , but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests . " Another citizen noted that " Obama won 't get the same treatment , ' ... ' But he won 't have too long to prove himself to us . ' " 
 = Castle Hill , Mere = 
 Castle Hill , also called Mere Castle , was a medieval fortification built by Richard , the Earl of Cornwall , in 1253 on a hill overlooking the village of Mere , Wiltshire , England . The castle was constructed in stone , with six towers , inner buildings and gates . It was abandoned in the 14th century and stripped of its stone and metalwork .

 The village of Mere was a small and unimportant settlement in the early 13th century . In 1243 Richard , the Earl of Cornwall , acquired the manor . Richard was the brother of Henry III and immensely rich . In 1253 he began to build a castle at Mere . 
 The castle was built on Long Hill , a chalk ridge overlooking the village ; the hill was flattened and scarped , with a 5 @-@ metre ( 16 ft ) deep ditch cut into the west side . As archaeologist Phil <unk> describes , documentary sources imply the castle was " a rectangular stone @-@ built structure with six towers , incorporating a hall , an inner and outer gate , a deep well and a chapel " , and it may have resembled a smaller version of Framlingham Castle . The castle was probably entered from the west , with a possible road running up the south side of the hill . At the same time the village was expanded into a planned town with an unofficial market . The castle was renovated in 1300 , possibly in response to the threat of rebellion in England at the time . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 Richard 's son Edmund inherited the property , but on his death it was taken back by the Crown . Edward II gave it to his royal favourite , Piers Gaveston , whom he made Earl of Cornwall . Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and John , Edward 's second son , took possession as the new Earl of Cornwall . Edward III then reacquired the castle , which became a permanent part of the Duchy of Cornwall . 
 During the 14th century , however , the castle had declined and became abandoned . In 1398 Richard II had the lead taken from the castle roofs for reuse at Portchester Castle . In 1660 , visitors ' accounts imply that the stonework had all been dismantled , and 18th @-@ century accounts suggest that this was reused for construction work in the town below , which had prospered from the wool and later linen trade .

 In the 21st century the site is protected under law as a scheduled monument . It is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall , and leased to the local parish council .

 = Barbara Gordon = 
 Barbara Gordon is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics and related media . The character was created by William Dozier , Julius Schwartz , and Carmine Infantino . At the request of the producers of the 1960s Batman television series , DC editor Schwartz called for a new female counterpart to the superhero Batman that could be introduced into publication and the third season of the show simultaneously . The character subsequently made her first comic book appearance as Batgirl in Detective Comics No. 359 , titled " The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl ! " ( 1967 ) , by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino . Written as the daughter of Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon , her civilian identity is given a doctorate in library science and she is employed as head of Gotham City Public Library , as well as later being elected to the United States Congress . 
 In addition to appearing in other DC publications , she receives her first starring role in Batman Family which debuted in 1975 , partnered with the original Robin , Dick Grayson . In 1988 , following the editorial retirement of the character 's Batgirl persona in Barbara Kesel 's Batgirl Special No. 1 , Alan Moore 's graphic novel Batman : The Killing Joke depicts the Joker shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity , resulting in paraplegia . In subsequent stories , editor Kim Yale and writer John Ostrander establish the character as a computer expert and information broker known as Oracle . Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes , she makes her first appearance as Oracle in Suicide Squad No. 23 ( 1989 ) . She is featured in the one @-@ shot comic Black Canary / Oracle : Birds of Prey ( 1996 ) written by Chuck Dixon , which later became the monthly title Birds of Prey starring both characters . The series depicts her as a great intellect uninhibited by her paralysis , skilled in the martial art of eskrima . Employing Black Canary as her partner and field agent , Oracle later operates as the leader of a full team of female <unk> who engage in global espionage missions , under writer Gail Simone . In 2011 , following a company wide relaunch of all DC Comics titles , the character 's mobility is restored and she is given a starring role in the eponymous Batgirl monthly comic , as well as Birds of Prey , as part of The New 52 . 
 Barbara Gordon is described as one of the most popular characters to appear during the Silver Age of Comic Books and is also regarded as a pop icon due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure . She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under the Birds of Prey publication and as a disability icon . The character has been the subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women , librarians and people living with disabilities in mainstream media . The events of The Killing Joke , which led to the character 's paralysis , as well as the restoration of her mobility , has been a subject of debate among comic book writers , artists , editors and readership . Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books , to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabled characters existing in a fictional universe where magic , technology , and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world . As both Batgirl and Oracle , Barbara Gordon has been adapted into various media relating to the Batman franchise , including television , film , animation , video games , and other merchandise . In 2011 , she was ranked 17th in both Comics Buyer 's Guide 's " 100 Sexiest Women in Comics " and IGN 's " Top 100 Comic Books Heroes " .

 Prior to the introduction of Barbara Gordon , the Batwoman character and her side @-@ kick Bat @-@ Girl appeared in Batman @-@ related publications , but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic . Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s . Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City 's Police Commissioner James Gordon , and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl . When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices , they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network . Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl , stating " Bob Kane had had a Bat @-@ Girl for about three stories in the ’ 50s but she had nothing to do with a bat . She was like a pesky girl version of Robin . I knew we could do a lot better , so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl , who was so popular she almost got her own TV show . " Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show 's third season . Barbara Gordon and alter ego Batgirl debuted in Detective Comics No. 359 , " The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl " ( 1967 ) , as the daughter of Gotham City 's Police Commissioner James Gordon . In the debut story , while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman , Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain Killer Moth , attracting Batman 's attention and leading to a crime @-@ fighting career . Although Batman insists she give up crime @-@ fighting because of her gender , Batgirl disregards his objections . 
 In her civilian identity , Barbara Gordon , Ph.D. , is depicted as a career woman with a doctorate in library science , as well as being head of Gotham City public library , " presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality . " She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue # 384 ( February 1969 ) , alternating issues with Robin until issue # 404 , after which she had the backup slot to herself . Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups , which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck . Barbara Gordon ’ s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat @-@ Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity , and readers requested for her to appear in other titles . Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication , DC responded to the fan @-@ based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics No. 417 ( 1971 ) , stating : " I 'd like to say a few words about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl . These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat @-@ girls from years back ... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman 's life . But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor , these hapless females are gone for good . In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime @-@ fighter , a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [ by ] Batman . " 
 Batgirl continues to appear in DC Comics publications throughout the late 1960s and 1970s , as a supporting character in Detective Comics , in addition to guest appearances in various titles such as Justice League of America , World 's Finest Comics , The Brave and the Bold , Action Comics , and Superman . In the mid @-@ 1970s , Batgirl reveals her secret identity to her father ( who had already discovered it on his own ) , and serves as a member of the United States House of Representatives . She moves to Washington , D.C. , intending to give up her career as Batgirl and in June 1972 , appeared in a story entitled " Batgirl 's Last Case . " Julius Schwartz brought her back a year later in Superman No. 268 ( 1973 ) , in which she has a blind date with Clark Kent , establishing their friendship , and fights alongside Superman . Batgirl and Superman team up twice more , in Superman No. 279 and DC Comics Presents # 19 . Batgirl also guest @-@ starred in other Superman related titles such as No. 453 of Adventure Comics , and in Superman Family No. 171 , where she teams with Supergirl . The character is given a starring role in DC 's Batman Family comic book which debuted in 1975 . The original Robin Dick Grayson became her partner in the series and the two were frequently referred to as the " Dynamite Duo : Batgirl & Robin . " Batgirl meets Batwoman in Batman Family No. 10 , when the retired superhero briefly returns to crime @-@ fighting ( before Kane is murdered by the Bronze Tiger ) . The two fight Killer Moth and Cavalier , and learn each other 's secret identities . Batwoman retires once again at the conclusion of the story , leaving Batgirl to continue crime @-@ fighting . Although this series ended after three years of publication , Batgirl continued to appear in back up stories published in Detective Comics through issue No. 519 ( October 1982 ) . 
 Crisis on Infinite Earths , a limited miniseries published in 1985 , was written in order to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity . Although Batgirl is a featured character , her role is relatively small — she delivers Supergirl 's eulogy in issue seven of the 12 @-@ part series . The conclusion of Crisis on Infinite Earths changed DC Universe continuity in many ways . Following the reboot , Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon , and she is Jim Gordon 's niece / adopted daughter in current canon . Post @-@ Crisis , Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle ; many adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by Power Girl . In Secret Origins # 20 : Batgirl and the Golden Age Dr. Mid @-@ Nite ( 1987 ) , Barbara Gordon 's origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randal . Within the storyline , Gordon recounts the series of events that led to her career as Batgirl , including her first encounter with Batman as a child , studying martial arts under the tutelage of a sensei , memorizing maps and blue prints of the city , excelling in academics in order to skip grades , and pushing herself to become a star athlete .

 DC officially retired the hero in the one @-@ shot comic Batgirl Special No. 1 ( July 1988 ) , written by Barbara Kesel . 
 Later that year , Barbara Gordon appeared in Alan Moore 's Batman : The Killing Joke . In this graphic novel , the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara in an attempt to drive her father insane , thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised . Although events in The Killing Joke exert a great impact on the character , the story has little to do with her . She is employed as a plot device to cement the Joker ’ s vendetta against Commissioner Gordon and Batman . In 2006 , during an interview with Wizard , Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it " shallow and ill @-@ conceived . " He stated prior to writing the graphic novel , " I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon — who was Batgirl at the time — and if I remember , I spoke to Len Wein , who was our editor on the project " , and following a discussion with then @-@ Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano , " Len got back onto the phone and said , ‘ Yeah , okay , cripple the bitch . ' " Although there has been speculation as to whether or not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character 's paralysis become permanent , Brian Cronin , author of Was Superman A Spy ? : And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed ( 2009 ) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the Batgirl Special specifically to retire the character and set her in place for The Killing Joke . 
 Following the release of the graphic novel , comic book editor and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband , fellow comic writer John Ostrander . Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity , the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability . 
 Gail Simone would include the character 's paralysis in a list of " major female characters that had been killed , mutilated , and depowered " , dubbing the phenomenon " Women in Refrigerators " in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend 's mutilated body in his refrigerator .

 Yale and Ostrander oversaw the development of Barbara Gordon 's new persona as Oracle for the next several years . The character made her first comic book appearance as Oracle in Suicide Squad No. 23 , anonymously offering her services to the government 's Task Force X. In the following two years , Oracle , under pen of Ostrander and Yale , made guest appearances in various DC titles until her identity was revealed to be Barbara Gordon in Suicide Squad No. 38 ( 1990 ) and she officially becomes a member of the Squad in issue No. 48 following an invitation from Amanda Waller . In 1992 , Dennis O ’ Neil wrote Oracle as Batman ’ s sole source of information in Batman : Sword of Azrael # 1 . This newly forged partnership established Oracle ’ s status as Batman 's intellectual equal . She is subsequently featured in the 12 @-@ issue miniseries The Hacker Files ( 1993 ) . In " Oracle : Year One " — a story arc contained in The Batman Chronicles No. 5 ( 1996 ) — Yale and Ostrander tell the origin of Barbara Gordon 's new persona as Oracle . Initially , Gordon 's paralysis plunges her into a state of reactive depression . However , she soon realizes that her aptitude for and training in information sciences have provided her with tremendous skills that could be deployed to fight crime . In a world increasingly centered on technology and information , she possesses a genius @-@ level intellect ; photographic memory ; deep knowledge of computers and electronics ; expert skills as a hacker ; and graduate training in library sciences . One night , she has a dream in which an all @-@ knowing woman ( similar to Oracle at Delphi of Greek mythology ) has her own face ; it 's then that she adopts " Oracle " as her codename . She serves as an information broker , gathering and disseminating intelligence to law enforcement organizations and members of the superhero community . She trains under the tutelage of Richard Dragon , one of DC 's premiere martial artists , to engage in combat ( using eskrima ) from her wheelchair . She develops her upper @-@ body strength and targeting skills with both firearms and batarangs . 
 The success of Chuck Dixon ’ s Black Canary / Oracle : Birds of Prey ( 1996 ) led to the comic series Birds of Prey starring the two title characters . During Chuck Dixon 's crossover series Nightwing : Hunt for Oracle , Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long @-@ term friendship . They form the nucleus of the Birds of Prey organization . While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations , Black Canary becomes her full @-@ time employee and field agent . In 2000 , the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character . Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series , acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl , alongside Batman . Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue No. 56 , taking the series in a " Bold New Direction ! " In an interview , Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon stating : " Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator and one of the most fascinating characters in comics . From there , Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She ’ s fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself , she ’ s tremendously compelling . The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place . " Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic , making her a central character in the series as Oracle 's secondary field agent . In 2003 , comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon ’ s origin with the miniseries Batgirl : Year One . Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early , but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths . 
 During the 2004 crossover event Batman : War Games , Black Mask commandeers Oracle 's computers and satellites and engages in a fight to the death with Batman . In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary , Oracle initiates the Clock Tower 's self @-@ destruct sequence , provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle . This results in the destruction of Gordon 's home and headquarters in the clock tower . Subsequently , Oracle decides to move on , and leaves Gotham City altogether . She cuts her ties with Batman , and after a temporary world trip with her team , relocates to Metropolis . In the events comprising Gail Simone 's Birds of Prey : Between Dark and Dawn ( 2005 ) , and Birds of Prey : The Battle Within ( 2005 ) , Oracle is possessed by arch @-@ villain Brainiac , an artificial intelligence entity , in order to become a biological being . Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body , the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence . The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body . Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems . Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid @-@ Nite , she discovers she can move her toes . However , this proves to be short @-@ lived ; Gordon remains paralyzed . 
 During the company @-@ wide crossover Infinite Crisis ( 2005 ) , Oracle teams with the Martian Manhunter in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike against the Secret Society 's global jailbreak . The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is also cut short by the Infinite Crisis storyline . 
 When DC continuity jumps forward one year after the events of Infinite Crisis , Oracle and her team continue to work in Metropolis . Oracle works with Batman , although not on a regular basis as before . Oracle continues to lead the Birds of Prey , and expands the ranks of the operation . In Birds of Prey No. 99 , Black Canary leaves the team and the Huntress becomes the team 's de facto field leader , while Big Barda is brought in as the group 's heavy @-@ hitter alongside a larger , rotating roster . Oracle also makes an attempt to reforge her alliance with Power Girl . However , when Oracle invites her to rejoin the team , she replies that she will do so " when Hell freezes over . " 
 In the crossover event Countdown to Final Crisis ( 2007 ) , Oracle dispatches the Question and Batwoman to capture Trickster and Piper following their role in the murder of Bart Allen . She struggles to keep the identities of the world 's heroes from being stolen and coordinates the response to a global crisis engineered by the Calculator , a villainous hacker and information broker . In issue No. 5 of the comic book series The All @-@ New Booster Gold ( 2007 ) , the title hero is given the mission of traveling back in time in order to prevent " a tragedy that he discovers never should 've happened — the Joker shooting and paralyzing Barbara Gordon , Batgirl . " Although Booster Gold makes several attempts to prevent the events which took place in Batman : The Killing Joke , he ultimately fails and Barbara Gordon 's chronological history remains unchanged . Rip Hunter convinces him that Barbara 's destiny is to become Oracle . Later , Batman reveals that he kept Joker 's photos of Barbara and Booster Gold for years and waited until Booster Gold 's correct age before confronting him . Batman then thanks Booster Gold for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship . 
 In " Whitewater " , Gail Simone 's final story arc on Birds of Prey ( 2007 ) , Oracle and her team struggle for power with Spy Smasher , a government agent who has taken over the Birds of Prey organization . Eventually , Spy Smasher is forced to admit her defeat and returns control of the Birds of Prey organization to Oracle . At the conclusion of the arc , Oracle also adopts Misfit into the Birds of Prey . Sean McKeever temporarily took over as author of Birds of Prey , writing issues # 113 – 117 , Birds of Prey : Metropolis or Dust ( 2008 ) . The following arch of the series Birds of Prey : Platinum Flats ( 2008 ) is written by Tony <unk> . In the company @-@ wide 2008 Final Crisis storyline , Darkseid — who has finally gained control of the Anti @-@ Life Equation — attempts to put the mind @-@ control equation on the internet . Both Oracle and Mister Terrific make desperate attempts to stop Darkseid , even attempting to shut down the entire Internet . Unfortunately , they both fail and those affected ended up mindless slaves of Darkseid . Freed from Darkseid 's control after the restoration of the Multiverse , she attempts to shut down the criminal <unk> set up by her opposite number , the Calculator , as a Darkseid @-@ free replacement for the regular Internet and still used by tech @-@ savvy criminals . However , the Calculator , preventing her moves , takes control of the <unk> % re , gaining the ability to thrive in cyberspace by controlling digital and cybernetic avatars , and tracks Oracle down with his newfound powers . Even though Oracle foils him , she starts doubting her abilities and fears she 's losing her edge and brilliance , which results in her disbanding the Birds of Prey team to do some soul @-@ searching . Birds of Prey received cancellation in early 2009 , with the final issue being # 127 . 
 Oracle is subsequently featured in a limited series written by Kevin <unk> titled Oracle : The Cure , a crossover arch with Batman : Battle for the Cowl ( 2009 ) . The story chronologically follows the events of Final Crisis and Batman R.I.P. ( 2008 ) . Oracle has returned to Gotham , and although the Birds of Prey are disbanded , she continues to summon them to help Nightwing and Robin deal with the growing crime in Gotham . The Calculator 's plans finally come to their fruition , and <unk> , hoping to save his dying daughter Wendy takes on the " Babbage " alias and begins prowling the digital world of Alta Viva , a virtual world game , for fragments of the Anti @-@ Life Equation unleashed by Darkseid . Oracle , now living in a dilapidated rented apartment in Gotham , becomes aware of <unk> 's activities after " <unk> " , one of her informants , is brutally killed , with the Anti @-@ Life Equation itself , after coming in contact with Babbage . Hoping to stop the Calculator and prevent him from piecing together the fragments of the Anti @-@ Life Equation in his possession , Oracle travels to Hong Kong , hoping to steal them back by the means of an advanced supercomputer programmed to track the chunk of data left behind by Babbage . However the Calculator discovers her attempts , swearing vengeance upon her . She manages to defeat Calculator , rendering the Anti @-@ Life Equation 's fragments useless . 
 In 2009 , the Batgirl comic book was relaunched with Stephanie Brown starring as the title character . Although Oracle initially tries to discourage Brown from crime @-@ fighting , she eventually comes to accept her as Batgirl . In addition , she also mentors the Calculator 's daughter , Wendy Harris , who was crippled following an attack at Titans Tower . Oracle later takes a job as an assistant professor at Gotham University .

During the crisis , Oracle is rendered unconscious by an explosion and is possessed by Deadman , who uses Oracle 's body to save Commissioner Gordon from the reanimated King Snake and the Trigger Twins . After being rescued by Batman , Robin , and Red Robin , the Gordons were attacked by Batman and Red Robin 's parents with their saviors , the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes . While Grayson and Drake battle the Black Lanterns , Robin takes the Gordons to their underground base where Alfred tends her and her father 's wounds . 
 In Greg Rucka 's Detective Comics No. 862 , Barbara Gordon is approached by Huntress and Renee Montoya ( the new Question ) for help in tracking down a mysterious criminal who ordered a hit on them . Montoya is flabbergasted upon discovering that " Commissioner Gordon 's daughter " is a superhero . In 2010 , Birds of Prey was relaunched with Gail Simone returning to write the comic . The first arch is a tie @-@ in with the Green Lantern Brightest Day limited series . Oracle reforms the Birds of Prey , this time with Dove and the recently resurrected Hawk as members . A new villainess calling herself the White Canary begins menacing the Birds , and publicly reveals Black Canary 's civilian identity and frames her for a murder . While the team contends with White Canary in the streets of Gotham , Oracle is kidnapped by her former associates , Savant and <unk> . This is eventually revealed to be a ruse in order to trick White Canary . Following the team 's victory against White Canary , Oracle fakes her death during a battle with Calculator .

 In September , 2011 , following the company @-@ wide relaunch , Barbara Gordon stars in a new Batgirl series — one of The New 52 titles featuring the company 's most iconic characters . The conclusion of the limited series Flashpoint ( 2011 ) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe , with all characters regressing to a younger age and earlier stage in their careers , while remaining in a modern timeline . DC Senior VP of Sales , Bob Wayne , explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue No. 1 , " our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approach — not only with each character , but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole , and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters . " Wayne also stated that " The Killing Joke still happened and she was Oracle . Now she will go through physical rehabilitation and become a more seasoned and nuanced character because she had these incredible and diverse experiences . Public reaction to the change has been mixed , and has included criticism that DC has reduced the diversity of their character lineup , as well as " being disrespectful of the power the character had gained as a symbol to the disabled community in her role as Oracle . " Dan DiDio , Co @-@ Publisher of DC Comics explained the decision by stating that " [ w ] e didn 't want to turn our back on the diversity issue , but she 'll always be the most recognizable [ Batgirl ] . We are working with concerns to diversify the line . We 're always looking to re @-@ position to be reflective of today 's audience . " Gail Simone , who will be writing the series , stated : " For many years , I got to write the character as Oracle , and there is to this day , no character who means more to me . This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived , with a few big surprises . It ’ s a bit of a shock , to be sure , but we ’ re doing everything we can to be respectful to this character ’ s amazing legacy , while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time ... Barbara Gordon leaping , fighting , and swinging over Gotham . Now , when citizens of that city look up , they are going to see <unk> . And that is absolutely thrilling . " 
 In the new , revised continuity , the events of The Killing Joke took place three years before the current storyline , and while it is established she was paraplegic during that time , Barbara Gordon is written as having regained her mobility after undergoing experimental surgery at a South African clinic . Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is " one of the smartest and toughest women in comics ... One thing the book is truly about , is that the after @-@ effects of something like PTSD ( post @-@ traumatic stress disorder ) or other trauma @-@ related syndromes , can strike even very smart , very intellectually tough people , even soldiers and cops " , a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books . She also explained the method of the character 's recovery is based upon real life experiences in that " some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa . People have been talking about this as if it 's some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead , but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases . Barbara 's spine was not severed . That makes her a candidate . " 
 Prior to release , Batgirl No. 1 sold out at the distribution level with over 100 @,@ 000 copies printed in its first run according to Diamond Comic Distributors . Along with Action Comics No. 1 , Justice League No. 1 , Batman No. 1 , Batman and Robin No. 1 , Batman : The Dark Knight No. 1 , Detective Comics No. 1 , Flash No. 1 , Green Lantern No. 1 , and Superman No. 1 , retailers were required to order a second printing . Calvin Reid of Publishers Weekly states in a review of the first issue : " The artwork is okay though conventional , while Simone ’ s script tries to tie up of the end of the previous Barbara Gordon / Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl . Her formula : murderous villains , blood splattering violence and high flying superheroics mixed with single @-@ white @-@ female bonding ... plus a cliffhanger ending to the first issue that offers a nifty [ segue ] into the new world of Barbara Gordon and Batgirl . " The New York Times critic George Gene <unk> wrote : " Unlike some of the other DC comics I read this week , Batgirl achieves a deft hat trick : a well @-@ shaped reintroduction to a character , an elegant acknowledgement of fundamental history and the establishment of a new status quo . This is a must @-@ buy series . " Earning a B + rating in a review from Entertainment Weekly , Ken Tucker writes that Simone " [ takes ] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl . The result is a burst of exhilaration , as Barbara / Batgirl revels in her new freedom even as she encounters a so @-@ far not @-@ terribly @-@ chilling villain called Mirror . " 
 Since the series relaunch in September 2011 , Batgirl has remained within the top 30 of the 300 best @-@ selling monthly comic book publications sold in North America . Monthly estimated sales figures are as follows : Batgirl No. 1 with 81 @,@ 489 copies ( ranked 12th overall ) , Batgirl No. 2 with 75 @,@ 227 ( ranked 14th ) , Batgirl No. 3 with 62 @,@ 974 ( ranked 18th ) , Batgirl No. 4 with 53 @,@ 975 ( ranked 23rd ) , Batgirl No. 5 with 51 @,@ 327 ( ranked 26th ) , and Batgirl No. 6 with 47 @,@ 836 ( ranked 30th ) . The <unk> edition of volume 1 , Batgirl : The Darkest Reflection , which collects issues # 1 @-@ 6 , made the The New York Times Best Seller list , alongside Animal Man : The Hunt , Batman & Robin : Born to Kill , Batman : Detective Comics , Wonder Woman : Blood , Batwoman : Hydrology , Green Lantern : Sinestro . 
 Additionally , Barbara Gordon makes an appearance in Birds of Prey No. 1 , where Black Canary offers her a spot on the new Birds of Prey roster . She declines Canary 's invitation , suggesting that Katana take her place instead . Series writer Duane <unk> has stated that Batgirl will join the team in issue # 4 . He commented that while she " is an essential part of this team " , she is not the focus of the series , as she is hesitant to be associated with the other characters because of their status as outlaws . 
 In October 2014 , the monthly Batgirl title underwent a soft reboot with the new creative team Brenden Fletcher ( writer ) Cameron Stewart ( writer , layouts ) , Babs Tarr ( artist ) and Maris Wicks ( colors ) . The first six @-@ issue story explored Barbara Gordon 's attempt to start a new life as a PhD student in the hip Gotham borough of Burnside . While seemingly light and engaging compared to Gail Simone 's darker preceding run , the new arc ultimately dealt with Babs ' inability to fully escape her earlier trauma and the villain was revealed as her own brain scans , an algorithm similar to the pre @-@ New 52 Oracle . While the reboot was highly praised for its innovative use of social media , its fun and energy , and particularly for Tarr 's art , several critics condemned the villain Dagger Type in issue # 37 as a transphobic caricature . In response , the creative team issued a joint apology and revised the issue for the subsequent collected edition , Batgirl Vol . 1 : The Batgirl of Burnside . 
 On March 13 , 2015 DC Comics released 25 Joker @-@ themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June , in celebration of the character 's 75th anniversary . Among them was a cover to Batgirl # 41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke . The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl , who has a red smile painted across her mouth . The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl 's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand , as if gesturing to shoot her . The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character 's history , especially when juxtaposed with the youthful , more optimistic direction of the series at the time . The hashtag # changethecover drew hundreds of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant . DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque , who stated , " My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art ... For that reason , I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled . "

 In March 2016 , DC Comics announced it would be relaunching all of its monthly titles under the DC Rebirth event . The relaunch restores elements of the pre @-@ Flashpoint DC continuity while maintaining elements of The New 52 as well . Among the new titles and creative teams announced , Batgirl written by Hope Larson and Batgirl and the Birds of Prey written by Julie Benson and Shawna Benson were included . 
 = = = Alternative versions = = = 
 Various alterations of the Barbara Gordon character have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles . Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel , such as the crossover limited series Zero Hour : Crisis in Time , a follow @-@ up story preceded by the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths which altered mainstream continuity . Notable imprints of DC Comics such as Elseworlds and All Star DC Comics have also featured alternate versions of the character . The Elseworlds imprint takes the company 's iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines , places and events making heroes " as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow . " Barbara Gordon , as both Batgirl and Oracle , has made several appearances in Elseworlds comics since 1997 . The character is given starring roles in the noir @-@ style storyline Thrillkiller : Batgirl & Robin ( 1997 ) , its sequel Batgirl + Batman : Thrillkiller ' 62 ( 1998 ) , and the one @-@ shot comic Elseworld 's Finest : Supergirl & Batgirl ( 1998 ) . In addition , the character has supporting roles in JLA : The Nail ( 1998 ) , JLA : Created Equal ( 2000 ) , Superman & Batman : Generations ( 2003 ) , Batman : Year 100 ( 2006 ) , and Batman : Earth One ( 2012 ) . A version of her appears as " Nightwing " in the Smallville comic series , replacing Stephanie Brown as previously promoted . 
 In 2005 , DC Comics launched its All Star imprint — an ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company 's most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry . Similar to Elseworlds , All Star is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership . According to Dan DiDio , " [ t ] hese books are created to literally reach the widest audience possible , and not just the comic book audience , but anyone who has ever wanted to read or see anything about Superman or Batman . " An alternate Barbara Gordon was adapted into Frank Miller 's All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder ( 2005 ) as a teenage Batgirl . In addition , another variation of the character had been set to star in an eponymous All Star Batgirl title , written by Geoff Johns ; however , the series was canceled prior to publication . 
 In 2015 , DC started publishing DC Bombshells , a title that places its characters in an alternate history primarily set during the 1930s and 1940s . In Digital Issue 42 ( collected in Print Issue 14 ) , Harley Quinn tells Pamela Isley about encountering " the Belle of the Bog " , who appears to be Barbara Gordon as a vampire . Barbara Gordon 's origins as the first Bombshell Batgirl will be explored in DC Comics Bombshells Annual # 1 , set to be published on 31 August 2016 . 
 = = Critical and editorial commentary = = 
 In the aftermath of Batman : The Killing Joke , Barbara Gordon 's paralysis has been the subject of debate , with arguments in favor of , and against , restoring her mobility . Writers , artists , editorial staff and critics have spoken in great length about the nature of subject , citing responses from readership , issues of sexism , diversity and representation , as well as other considerations that have impacted decisions regarding the character 's portrayal . 
 = = = Commentary in favor of Batgirl = = = 
 Reacting to The Killing Joke and Barbara Gordon 's later character development as Oracle in Batman : Gotham Knights , Ray Tate , a reviewer at Comics Bulletin , wrote " [ t ] here is absolutely no reason why Barbara Gordon should be in a wheelchair . Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant The Killing Joke as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker ... [ Batman ] himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry . There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime . His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world . There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair . " Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability , and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl , Tate asserts " [ i ] t 's ridiculous to think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair , and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap . Rubbish . Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle . Batgirl has saved Batman 's life on numerous occasions . Oracle has not . Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character , but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl . " Shannon Cochran in an article for Bitch magazine entitled " The Cold Shoulder : Saving <unk> from Comic @-@ book Violence " noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes . She quotes Gail Simone , who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis : " Both had their backs broken [ Batman broke his in a dramatic Batcave confrontation with the villain Bane ; Batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the Joker , never given a chance to fight ] . Less than a year later , Batman was fine . Batgirl — now named Oracle — was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years . ” Artist Alex Ross and writer / producer Paul Dini have made attempts to return the character to her original conception . Ross explained in an interview that he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a Lazarus Pit , a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it . He stated that " we pitched then @-@ Batman editor Denny O 'Neil with these drawings of that costume design . The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit , she was in a way , more compromised as a character ... Denny shot it down , because , according to him , everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character . The theory was that DC didn 't have enough handicapped characters , so they weren 't going to do anything with Barbara as she was . And the design went into the drawer . " Kate Kane , the modern Batwoman introduced during 52 , wears a variation of what would have been Gordon 's new Batgirl costume designed by Ross .

 Although critical reception of Barbara Gordon 's evolution into Oracle have been mixed among critics and other observers , according to John Ostrander : " We have , over the years , on those occasions when I have worked with the character , gotten some letters from those who have disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive . I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle . " Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character , regardless of the events that caused her paralysis . In her persona as Oracle , Barbara Gordon is not limited to the Batman Family , serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe . DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments , " Some stories ... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime . The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry 's sacrifice , or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker . " The character went through possible restoration during Birds of Prey when she is infected with microscopic machines known as nanites by the super villain Brainiac , which attempted to repair her DNA . Marc <unk> , author of War , Politics and Superheroes : Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film ( 2011 ) commented that DC writers and editors would not allow her to recover completely , and that " [ t ] he decision was made because there were not enough handicapped superheroes in the DC Universe to justify ' curing ' one , and because it would have been odd to see Barbara Gordon escape from her wheelchair in the world of fiction when Christopher Reeve never had that opportunity . "

 In June 2011 , DC announced that Barbara Gordon would be returning to the role of Batgirl in September 2011 , in her own eponymous monthly comic , as part of a company @-@ wide relaunch of all of their titles . In addition , former Birds of Prey writer Gail Simone would be writing the series . This announcement became one of the most controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch . Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle have expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community . Journalist and blogger Jill <unk> , who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy , stated that " people being disabled is part of the real world , it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well ... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini @-@ series Oracle : The Cure . It ’ s that type of honesty I expect more of ... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years , Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I ’ ve seen in a long time . " Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon 's mobility , she fought to keep her as a disabled character , even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed . However , part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing Batgirl with Gordon as the title character was that " [ a ] <unk> and legs get ripped off , and they grow back , somehow . Graves don 't stay filled . But the one constant is that Barbara stays in that chair . Role model or not , that is problematic and uncomfortable , and the excuses to not cure her , in a world of purple rays and magic and super @-@ science , are often unconvincing or wholly meta @-@ textual . And the longer it goes on , the more it has stretched credibility . But now , everything has changed . If nearly everyone in the DCU , not just Batgirl but almost everyone , is now at a much earlier stage in their career , then my main objection no longer applies , because we are seeing Barbara at an earlier starting point . " Former Batman writer and editor Dennis O 'Neil and Oracle co @-@ creator John Ostrander have expressed disappointment over the change . O 'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC , " [ W ] e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals ... We didn 't have anybody like Oracle , who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective in a way that didn 't involve violence . " However , he also stated that from an alternate point of view , " Barbara Gordon 's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration . " Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl , but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone 's skills as a writer . He commented that " [ t ] <unk> change and characters and people evolve . I changed things when I wrote characters , including changing Barbara to Oracle . Others do the same for this era ... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I 'm sure her work will be wonderful . "

 At the time of her conception , Barbara Gordon 's character was intended to reflect the women 's liberation movement as an educated , career @-@ oriented young woman , as well as a capable crime @-@ fighter . Batgirl is considered to be one of the most popular character to have emerged during the Silver Age of Comic Books . In The Supergirls : Fashion , Feminism , Fantasy , and the History of Comic Book Heroines ( 2009 ) , author Mike Madrid states : " While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated <unk> , in the backdrop of the history of comic books , Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the ' 40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs . " Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime @-@ fighting , she defiantly ignores his objections . Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl . In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies , but her father , Commissioner Gordon , Batman and Robin , she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian . In her civilian identity , she is seen with her hair " tied up tightly in a bun . And she wears traditionally conservative — not to say dowdy — clothing . In other words , she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the <unk> doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior . " Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology , aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist , such as the fact that " [ m ] uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat @-@ purse attached to her utility belt [ . ] " 
 = = = Bronze Age = = = 
 In spite of shortcomings in her characterization during the late 1960s , " by the early 1970s , Batgirl had matured , using her keen intellect , athletic dexterity , and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not @-@ so @-@ petty thefts " . However , by the end of the Bronze Age of Comic Books in the mid @-@ 1980s ( and with the dark , gritty influence of Frank Miller 's work on the Batman @-@ related titles ) , Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise " where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels " . In this environment , Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime @-@ fighting permanently .

 Robin Anne Reid , in her 2008 book , Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy : Overviews notes a lack of characterization given to Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in Batman : The Killing Joke , stating , " Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona ; she was portrayed as a coco @-@ serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings . " Following the character 's recreation as Oracle , she is shown having overcome her paralysis at the hands of the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime @-@ fighting as an information broker . Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability , comic writer Devin Grayson stated that being " [ h ] <unk> @-@ defensive about her [ paralysis ] , she has , if anything , over compensated . However , her very determination to remain self @-@ reliant , though admirable and inspiring , has made her less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind . " One defining characteristic is her sense of morality , which differs from that of Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary . Oracle has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force , such as in Chuck Dixon 's Birds of Prey issue No. 10 , " State of War " , which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters . Dixon stated an interview that " [ s ] he 's less morally conflicted than other characters . She 's very ' means to an end ' oriented . She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives . She 's not comfortable with that but accepts it . She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but , when push comes to shove , she 'll drop the hammer . " She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone 's Birds of Prey : Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information , which denies criminals the right of due process . Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force , she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology . 
 = = = The New 52 = = = 
 As part of DC Comics ' 2011 relaunch , The New 52 , Barbara Gordon 's paralysis is described as lasting only three years time . In Batgirl ( volume 4 ) , the character 's age is reduced , and she is depicted as a recent college graduate , having earned a degree in forensic psychology . Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility , she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder , causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage . The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not . In a September 2011 interview , Gail Simone stated , " I 'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life . She 's younger , she doesn 't know everything , she 's been immersed in school and her life @-@ plan . Events conspire to change that plan , and she 's nervous about that . I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions , but this really is a key time for her . "

 According to the character 's fictional biography , Barbara Gordon trained in judo and karate , earning black belts prior to her tenure as Batgirl and is described as being a " star athlete . " Following the events of The Killing Joke , Barbara Gordon continued to train in martial arts as Oracle , despite being paralyzed from the waist down . She has extensive skills with eskrima fighting sticks , small firearms , and batarangs ; she customarily keeps a pair of eskrima sticks stored in the armrests of her wheelchair as a contingency . In the revised continuity of The New 52 , she reflects on the fact that she has been taking self @-@ defense training since age six in Batgirl # 0 ( 2012 ) . 
 = = = Intelligence and technological skill = = = 
 Gordon is written as having a genius @-@ level intellect and naturally possessing a photographic memory . She is described by Gail Simone as the most intelligent member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City . Prior to the character 's career as a vigilante , Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills , including vast knowledge of computers and electronics , expert skills as a hacker , and graduate training in library sciences . Like Batman , Barbara Gordon originally used a wide variety of computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl . These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume , various bat @-@ inspired weaponry , and the Batcycle . According to Gail Simone , Oracle maintains control over the twelve technologically advanced satellites that were created by Lex Luthor during his tenure as President of the United States . 
 = = = Information broker = = = 
 As Oracle , Barbara Gordon placed her considerable skills and knowledge at the disposal of many of the DC Universe 's heroes . She is a skilled hacker , capable of retrieving and dispersing information from private satellites , military installations , government files , and the properties of Lex Luthor . Batman , himself a genius with a wide knowledge base and access to vast information resources , routinely consults Oracle for assistance . Writer and editor Dennis O 'Neil , who first established Oracle as Batman 's intellectual equal and source of information , stated that " [ i ] t was logical for her to be there in Batman 's world ... Batman would need someone like that . " 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 Since her debut in DC Comics publication , and fueled by her adaptation into the Batman television series in 1967 , Barbara Gordon has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons . Author Brian Cronin , in Was Superman A Spy ? : And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed ( 2009 ) notes that following her 1967 debut , " Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon . " Similarly , Cronin states that following the publication of The Killing Joke , Barbara Gordon — in her new persona as Oracle — became " more popular , in fact , than she was when she was Batgirl . She even gained her own title , Birds of Prey , about her and a group of superhero operatives she organizes [ . ] " The character has been the subject of analysis in academia , regarding the portrayal of women , librarians , and those living with disabilities in mainstream media . Throughout the course of the character 's history , Barbara Gordon 's intelligence has been one of her defining attributes . According to BusinessWeek , she is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional superheroes appearing in American comics , and is the only female character to appear on the list . In 2011 , IGN ranked Barbara Gordon 17th in the Top 100 Comic Books Heroes . 
 = = = Feminist interpretations = = = 
 In The Supergirls : Fashion , Feminism , Fantasy , and the History of Comic Book Heroines ( 2009 ) , author Mike Madrid states that what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime @-@ fighting . Unlike Batwoman who preceded her , " she wears his symbol on her chest , but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden . " Because she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman , " Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime , the same way he would a male . " Historian Peter Sanderson observed that while " Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian ... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s . ( Moreover , by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her ' civilian identity ' and ran for Congress . ) " 
 In the 1980s , Barbara Kesel , after writing a complaint to DC Comics over the negative portrayal of female characters , was given the opportunity to write for Barbara Gordon in Detective Comics . Robin Anne Reid , in Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy : Overviews ( 2009 ) , wrote that " Kesel 's version of Batgirl established her as a character separate from Batman and Robin : a woman motivated to do what men do , but alone and in her own way . Her Secret Origins ( 1987 ) and Batgirl Special ( 1988 ) countered the victimized and objectified presentation of Barbara Gordon / Batgirl in Alan Moore 's acclaimed The Killing Joke ( 1988 ) . " She notes that Kesel 's interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence , technological skill , and ability to overcome fear . Commenting on Barbara Gordon 's eventual evolution into Oracle , she states " [ m ] any readers and individuals within the industry believe that Barbara Gordon became a ' better ' character after she was paralyzed , but few people comment on specifics of the event that allowed her to become that ' better ' character . " 
 In Superheroes and <unk> : Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks ( 2010 ) , author Sharon Packer wrote that " [ a ] nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [ Gordon 's ] accident is advised to consult the source material " , calling the work " sadistic to the core . " Brian Cronin noted that " [ many ] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much , and even Moore , in retrospect , has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out . " Jeffrey A. Brown , author of Dangerous Curves : Action Heroines , Gender , Fetishism , and Popular Culture ( 2011 ) noted The Killing Joke as an example of the " inherent misogyny of the male @-@ dominated comic book industry " in light of the " relatively unequal violence [ female characters ] are subjected to . " While male characters may be critically injured or killed , they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception , while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage . Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated , " if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl , it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly . " 
 Despite views that present the character 's Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment , a long @-@ held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman " rather than standing alone as leader , such as Wonder Woman " who had no pre @-@ existing male counterpart . In analyzing stereotypes in gender , Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes ( such as Batman ) are depicted as hyper @-@ masculine and anti @-@ social , " while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names " such as the Batgirl character . Professor James B. South , chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Marquette University , stated that Barbara Gordon 's character development as Oracle gave her a sense of independence she could not achieve as Batgirl . During her tenure as Batman 's protege , " she seems to develop her own style of fighting as Batgirl , [ but ] she 's still basically following in Batman 's footsteps . " Following The Killing Joke , her recreation as Oracle , and the launch of Birds of Prey , " we see Barbara Gordon as a team leader and her transformation from a girl into a woman . " 
 = = = Representation for library and information science = = = 
 In The Image and Role of the Librarian ( 2002 ) , Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that her portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession , in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career . Even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for United States Congress , Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a " career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up . " In the essay " Librarians , Professionalism and Image : Stereotype and Reality " ( 2007 ) , Abigail <unk> views the character less favorably , stating that " [ t ] he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low @-@ visibility disguise for her crime @-@ fighting alter @-@ ego , and while her information @-@ locating skills may have been useful to her extra @-@ curricular activities no direct examples are given . " Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl , " [ a ] s Oracle , Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian @-@ as @-@ super @-@ hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book ( as opposed to a super @-@ hero who happens to be a librarian in his / her private life ) . " Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel note that Oracle exerts her influence over the DC Universe primarily from home , putting " to full use the information science skills [ she ] learned on her way to her PhD " In her new persona , " the physically challenged but superbly resourceful Oracle occupies a unique place in the annals of superhero @-@ dom — the ' information goddess ' as crime stopper . " Using Barbara Gordon in her role as Oracle , author Sean Wise asserts her character as a model for business networking . In How to Be a Business Superhero : Prepare for Everything , Train with the Best , Make Your Own Destiny at Work ( 2008 ) he states that " [ o ] ver the last decade , Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts , and in doing so she shows Business Superheroes the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals . " 
 Over the years , the American Library Association and DC Comics have collaborated on multiple projects to promote literacy . These efforts frequently involve Barbara Gordon . In 2004 , artist Gene Ha created a poster and bookmark that depicted Barbara Gordon walking in a library . Her Batgirl costume appears in a window 's reflection . The tagline " Librarians are heroes every day ! " appears at the bottom of the poster and bookmark . In 2009 , a poster featured Barbara Gordon as the Oracle alongside Batman , Nightwing , Robin , the Cassandra Cain version of Batgirl , and Huntress . In 2015 , the ALA and DC Comics collaborated on a new set of posters and bookmarks in the ALA 's " READ " campaign . By herself , Barbara Gordon appears in the " Batgirl of Burnside " guise as envisioned by Babs Tarr . In another design , she appears as the Oracle alongside other members of the extended Bat Family . 
 = = = Representation for the disabled = = = 
 Following the character 's reinvention as the information broker Oracle , she has been regarded as a symbol of empowerment for those living with disabilities . In Unleashing the Superhero in Us All ( 2008 ) , author T. James <unk> notes that " [ f ] or quite sometime , any handicap was considered insurmountable " citing Franklin D. Roosevelt as an example , who was never photographed in a wheelchair to avoid a perception of weakness . In reference to Barbara Gordon , he states " [ r ] ather than quitting crime fighting , Barbara combines her intellect and computer skills to help the superhero community by gathering and passing along information . " Her character thus signifies that " [ n ] o longer is a handicap overwhelming , a person can live a strong good life , handicap or not . " In The Superhero Book : The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic @-@ Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes ( 2004 ) , author Gina Renée <unk> observes that while disabled characters in comic book are typically utilized as gimmicks , or — as with Charles Xavier and Daredevil — are introduced with a pre @-@ existing condition as part of their origin myth , " [ a ] s Oracle ... Gordon stands tall as the most empowering disabled superhero . Readers witnessed her tragedy , and watched her rise above it . " James B. South 's chapter " Barbara Gordon and Moral <unk> " in the 2004 book Superheroes and Philosophy analyzes how the changes in her life " from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle " drive her to pursue a higher self , illustrating the philosophical theory of moral perfectionism .

 Portrayed by Yvonne Craig , the character 's first adaptation outside of comic books took place in the third season of Batman ( 1967 ) . Les Daniels , in Batman : The Complete History ( 2004 ) wrote that the goal of ABC was to " attract new audience members , especially idealistic young girls and less high @-@ minded older men . " According to Craig : " I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle ... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice . " A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes portrayed later in television ( such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman ) , is that she was not allowed to engage in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat on screen . As such , " her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent 's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use . " However , Craig has also stated : " I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model ... They say it 's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do , and sometimes better . I think that ’ s lovely . " During the early 1970s , Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women . Since Batman , the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media . As Batgirl , Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series , voiced by Jane Webb in The Batman / Superman Hour ( 1968 ) , <unk> Britt in The New Adventures of Batman ( 1977 ) , Melissa Gilbert in Batman : The Animated Series ( 1992 ) , Tara Strong in The New Batman Adventures ( 1997 ) and Beware the Batman ( 2013 ) , Danielle Judovits in The Batman ( 2004 ) , Mae Whitman in Batman : The Brave and the Bold ( 2008 ) and Alyson Stoner in Young Justice ( 2011 ) . The Batman series also showcased the character 's first animated adaptation as Oracle , voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode " Artifacts " ( 2007 ) . 
 Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series Birds of Prey ( 2002 ) . It became the first adaptation to show the character 's progression from Batgirl to Oracle , which included her paralysis at the hands of the Joker . Meyer commented on her character 's complex history stating : " She 's multidimensional . She was a former superhero . She was extremely active physically for years , fighting alongside Batman . The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs ... but rather than give up and throw in the towel , as she could 've done so easily , she went and studied <unk> ( a martial art ) , got stronger in her mental state and , while helping out her father on a case one day , realized she had a knack for solving mysteries . And all of a sudden she became this computer genius . " Overall , the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot . It aired for one season before receiving cancellation . 
 Although , in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans she is slated to appear in the live @-@ action Titans series for TNT . This version of the character will be a wheelchair @-@ bound computer expert , but will not yet be known as Oracle . 
 Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon , voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999 's Batman Beyond , who after retiring as Batgirl , became commissioner of Gotham City police . 
 In addition to live @-@ action television and animation , the character has appeared in a number of video games included in the Batman franchise . She appears in The Adventures of Batman & Robin , Batman : Vengeance , Batman : Rise of Sin Tzu and Batman : The Killing Joke voiced by Tara Strong . She is also in Batman : Dark Tomorrow for the first time as Oracle . She also appears in LEGO Batman for the PC , PlayStation 2 , PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , Wii , DS , and PlayStation Portable . She plays a supporting role as Oracle in Batman : Arkham Asylum for the PC , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 , serving as Batman 's guide through Arkham , and is voiced by Kimberly Brooks . She also appears as the radio guide alongside Alfred Pennyworth , as they both serve as Batman 's guides in the sequel , Batman : Arkham City . A teenage Barbara also appears in the prequel Batman : Arkham Origins , voiced by Kelsey Lansdowne . In the 2008 live @-@ action film , The Dark Knight , a very young Barbara Gordon is depicted . She is credited as " Gordon 's Daughter " , while the name " Barbara Gordon " is reserved for Commissioner Gordon 's wife . She also acts as the primary contact for hero characters as Oracle in DC Universe Online , voiced by Katherine Catmull for the PC and the PlayStation 3 . She assists the player through the tutorial and will offer comments and advice throughout the game including a guided tour of the JLA Watchtower . She is a playable character in Injustice : Gods Among Us , with Kimberly Brooks reprising her role . Barbara has returned in Batman : Arkham Knight where she is voiced by Ashley Greene . In addition , Barbara also appears as a playable character as part of the game 's season pass . 
 In the fourth season of the TV series Arrow , after Felicity Smoak suffered a similar paralyzing injury , Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that " Oracle " was taken . 
 She also appeared in DC Super Hero Girls voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl .

 = 2007 UEFA Champions League Final = 
 The 2007 UEFA Champions League Final was an association football match between A.C. Milan of Italy and Liverpool F.C. of England on 23 May 2007 at the Olympic Stadium , Athens , Greece . The showpiece event was the final match of the 2006 – 07 season of Europe 's premier cup competition , the UEFA Champions League . The teams were appearing in the final , two years after facing each other in the 2005 final which Liverpool won 3 – 2 in a penalty shootout after the match finished 3 – 3 . 
 Both teams had to pass through five rounds before they reached the final . They both entered in the third qualifying round and won their respective groups before they reached the knockout stage , where matches were contested over two legs , with a match at each team 's home ground . Milan 's victories varied from close affairs to comfortable victories . They defeated Celtic by a single goal over two legs , while they beat Manchester United 5 – 3 on aggregate in the semi @-@ final . Liverpool 's matches were mainly all close affairs ; they beat defending champions Barcelona on the away goals rule in the first knockout round and beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout in the semi @-@ finals , although they did record a 4 – 0 aggregate win over PSV Eindhoven in the quarter @-@ finals . 
 Before the match there were ticketing problems because a large number of fans gained entry to the stadium without valid tickets . After the match , a UEFA spokesman accused Liverpool of having the worst fans in Europe , a claim later denied by UEFA president Michel Platini . Watched by a crowd of 74 @,@ 000 , Milan took the lead when Andrea Pirlo 's free @-@ kick deflected off Filippo Inzaghi in the first half . Milan extended their lead in the second half when Inzaghi scored a second goal . Liverpool scored a late goal through Dirk Kuyt , but were unable to equalise before the end of the match . Milan won the match 2 – 1 to win their seventh Champions League .

 Milan gained entry to the competition by finishing third in the 2005 – 06 Serie A. Milan had originally finished second in Serie A , but were docked 30 points for their part in a match @-@ fixing scandal . The original punishment , reduced on appeal , would have barred them from the Champions League altogether . Their opponents in the third qualifying round were Serbian team Red Star Belgrade . Two victories , 1 – 0 at home and 2 – 1 away , ensured Milan 's passage to the group stage of the Champions League . They were drawn in Group H alongside AEK Athens of Greece , Anderlecht of Belgium and French team Lille . Milan won three matches , drew one and lost two to finish top of the group with 10 points and progress to the knockout stage . 
 They were drawn against Scottish team Celtic . The first leg at Celtic 's home ground Celtic Park finished 0 – 0 . The return leg at Milan 's home ground the San Siro also finished 0 – 0 after 90 minutes with Celtic managing to limit the goalscoring opportunities Milan had . However , three minutes into extra time Milan scored when Kaká curled a shot past Celtic goalkeeper Artur <unk> . Celtic were unable to score the away goal they needed to beat Milan , ensuring the Italians progressed to the quarter finals after a 1 – 0 aggregate victory . 
 Milan were drawn against German team Bayern Munich in the quarter @-@ finals . The first leg at the San Siro ended in a 2 – 2 draw after Bayern had scored an equaliser three minutes into stoppage time . The second leg at Bayern 's home ground the Allianz Arena was more comfortable for Milan , as they scored two first half goals to win the match 2 – 0 and win the tie 4 – 2 on aggregate . Milan were drawn against English team Manchester United in the semi @-@ finals . The first leg at United 's home ground Old Trafford , Kaka scored twice to give Milan a 2 – 1 lead after Cristiano Ronaldo had scored an early goal . However , two goals from Wayne Rooney in the second half meant United won the first leg 3 – 2 . The second leg at the San Siro saw Milan win 3 – 0 to progress to the final after a 5 – 3 aggregate victory .

 Liverpool gained entry to the competition after finishing third in the 2005 – 06 FA Premier League . As a result of that league position , Liverpool entered the Champions League in the third qualifying round , where their opponents were Maccabi Haifa of Israel . Liverpool won the first leg 2 – 1 at their home ground Anfield and a 1 – 1 draw in the away leg in Israel ensured Liverpool progressed to the group stage of the competition . Liverpool were drawn in Group C alongside French team Bordeaux , Dutch team PSV Eindhoven and Galatasaray of Turkey . After six games including four wins , one draw and one defeat , Liverpool finished top of the group with 13 points to qualify for the knockout stage . 
 Liverpool were drawn against defending champions Barcelona in the first knockout round . Before the first leg in Barcelona , there had been a training ground fracas between Craig Bellamy and John Arne Riise . Coincidentally , it was Bellamy and Riise who secured a 2 – 1 victory for Liverpool , completing a comeback after Deco had given Barcelona the lead . The second leg at Anfield was won 1 – 0 by Barcelona , however Liverpool progressed to the quarter @-@ finals on the away goals rule , having scored more goals away from home than their opponents . 
 Their opponents in the quarter @-@ finals were PSV Eindhoven , who they had played in the group stage . The first leg at PSV 's home ground the Philips Stadion was won 3 – 0 by Liverpool all but securing their progression to the semi @-@ finals . The second leg at Anfield was not as one @-@ sided , a 1 – 0 victory for Liverpool ensured they would progress to the semi @-@ finals courtesy of a 4 – 0 aggregate victory . Their opponents in the semi @-@ finals were fellow English team Chelsea . The first leg at Chelsea 's home ground Stamford Bridge was a close affair with Chelsea winning 1 – 0 courtesy of a first half Joe Cole goal . The second leg at Anfield was similar , however it was Liverpool who won 1 – 0 thanks to a Daniel Agger goal . With the teams tied at 1 – 1 aggregate after 90 minutes and extra time the tie went to a penalty shootout , which Liverpool won 4 – 1 to progress to the final .

Liverpool were appearing in their seventh final . They had previously won the competition five times ( 1977 , 1978 , 1981 , 1984 , 2005 ) , while they lost the 1985 final to Juventus . The final was a rematch of the 2005 final which Liverpool won 3 – 2 in a penalty shootout , after recovering from a three @-@ goal deficit at half @-@ time to level the score at 3 – 3 after full @-@ time and extra time . 
 The Olympic Stadium in Athens was selected as the venue for the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final at the April 2005 meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Tallinn , Estonia . The meeting also determined the venues for the 2006 final and the 2006 and 2007 UEFA Cup finals . Shortly before the final , the UEFA Champions League trophy was returned to UEFA by Ludovic Giuly , representing the 2006 winners , Barcelona . UEFA president Michel Platini then presented the trophy to the Mayor of Athens , <unk> <unk> , so that it might be put on display in and around the city . The stadium had hosted the showpiece event before . The most recent was the 1994 final . Coincidentally Milan were the winners , beating Barcelona 4 – 0 . The other final held at the ground was in 1983 , when Hamburg beat Juventus 1 – 0 . The ground had also played host to the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup final in 1987 , when Ajax beat Lokomotiv Leipzig 1 – 0 . 
 Adidas , the official match ball supplier to all major UEFA , FIFA and IOC tournaments , unveiled the official match ball for the 2007 UEFA Champions League final on 9 March 2007 , presenting the Adidas Finale Athens . The design of the Adidas Finale Athens was based on the widely recognisable UEFA Champions League <unk> logo and was blue and white , representing the colours of the Greek national flag . The final matched two of the top goal @-@ scorers in the competition that season . Milan 's Kaká finished on top of the scoring charts with ten goals , and Liverpool 's Peter Crouch entered the game tied for third with six goals in total . 
 Despite being drawn as the " home " team for the match , Milan chose to wear their all @-@ white away strip for the final ; they consider that strip to be their " lucky kit " ( Italian : maglia <unk> ) , having won the European Cup five times in those colours . However , Milan had also lost two final wearing all @-@ white , most recently against Liverpool in 2005 . This decision by Milan meant that Liverpool played the final in their traditional home kit of red shirts , red shorts and red socks . Each of Liverpool 's five European Cup titles were won in their all @-@ red strip , and two of these came when they were playing against Italian teams who played in all @-@ white . 
 Milan fielded the oldest starting eleven ever in a Champions League final , with the average age at 31 years , 34 days , while Paolo Maldini was the oldest outfield player ever to play in the final , in what his eighth final at 38 years and 331 days . Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti opted to start striker Filippo Inzaghi , who had missed the 2005 final ahead of Hernán Crespo . Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez opted to field a five @-@ man midfield with Jermaine Pennant and Boudewijn Zenden on the wings , while Steven Gerrard was deployed behind lone striker Dirk Kuyt . Liverpool fielded five of the players that started the 2005 final : Xabi Alonso , Jamie Carragher , Steve Finnan , Steven Gerrard and John Arne Riise . 
 = = = Problems before the match = = = 
 Out of 63 @,@ 800 tickets , only 9 @,@ 000 tickets for the final went on general sale ; the remainder were shared between the two teams , who got 17 @,@ 000 each , and the UEFA family and sponsors , who received 20 @,@ 800 tickets . This led to some of the problems before the match . While fans were still queuing to gain entry to the stadium , the Greek police informed them that the stadium was full and denied entry to a number of fans who had genuine tickets . UEFA sources said that as many as 5 @,@ 000 fans either without tickets or brandishing fakes had entered the 74 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity Olympic Stadium . Simultaneously , thousands of fans with genuine tickets were refused entry as police closed the entrance to the ground amid fears that allowing any more to enter could have led to a disaster . The resulting situation became disorderly , with some Liverpool fans attempting to break through checkpoints , set up by the Greek police . Greek riot police used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd . UEFA spokesman William Gaillard blamed Liverpool fans for causing the problems , stating , " Milan supporters didn 't face the same problems because they didn 't behave in the same way " . 
 A UEFA report released soon after the final branded Liverpool supporters " the worst fans in Europe " , with Gaillard stating : " What other set of fans steal tickets from their fellow supporters or out of the hands of children ? " However , UEFA President Michel Platini later denied that Liverpool fans were the worst behaved in Europe . UEFA was itself criticised for poor ticket @-@ checking procedures and for implementing insufficient measures to deal with the large number of fans . Simon Gass , the British ambassador to Greece , said , " Clearly there was some element of breakdown where those fake tickets appeared to be legitimate – that 's something UEFA must look at . " Meanwhile , Liverpool co @-@ owner Tom Hicks described UEFA 's allocation of 17 @,@ 000 tickets to each team , knowing that Liverpool would be bringing 40 @,@ 000 supporters , as " insane " and accused Gaillard of blaming Liverpool fans in order to cover up for his own mistakes . UEFA was further criticised by Milan and Liverpool for their lack of provision for the clubs ' disabled fans , providing the clubs with only sixteen disabled tickets each .

 Milan won the toss and Liverpool kicked off . Playing in a 4 – 2 – 3 – 1 formation , they had the first attack of the match , but Jermaine Pennant could not reach Steven Gerrard 's cross @-@ field pass . Milan responded with two low attempts on the Liverpool goal , but Jamie Carragher was able to clear them both . The second clearance led to a corner , from which Milan failed to score . Liverpool had the first chance of the match in the ninth minute . A slip from Milan defender Marek <unk> allowed Pennant to run into space , he passed the ball to Dirk Kuyt who passed it back to him , Pennant 's subsequent shot was saved by Milan goalkeeper Dida . Minutes later Gerrard won a header which found Pennant , however Gerrard was unable to make decent contact with the ball following Pennant 's pass . Milan had their first shot of the match a few minutes later . Kaká received the ball outside the area and moved to his right before shooting , however Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina saved the shot . Liverpool continued to exert pressure leading Milan defender Massimo Oddo to mis @-@ read a cross from Pennant , the ball reached Gerrard whose shot went over the goal . 
 Liverpool had another chance in the 27th minute . Frantic defending from Milan to deny the Liverpool forwards a scoring opportunity , led to the ball being passed to Xabi Alonso , whose shot went wide of the Milan goal . A mistake from <unk> allowed Gerrard to pass the ball to Kuyt in the penalty area , however Kuyt 's shot was blocked by Milan defender Alessandro Nesta . Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso was the first player to receive a yellow card , when he was cautioned in the 40th minute for a foul on Alonso . Minutes later , Alonso fouled Kaká on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area , giving away a free @-@ kick . The subsequent free @-@ kick taken by Andrea Pirlo deflected off the shoulder of Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi , and into the Liverpool goal . The deflection resulted in the ball being diverted past Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina , who had dived the other way in anticipation of the ball 's original trajectory . Replays showed that the ball struck Inzaghi 's upper arm on its way to the goal , but the referee did not judge this to have been a handball . Inzaghi later said that while the deflection was intended , he did not intend for the ball to hit his arm . With no further action in the first half , Milan went into half @-@ time leading 1 – 0 .

 Milan kicked @-@ off the second half . Two minutes into the half , Liverpool had the first attack but Nesta tackled Gerrard before he could reach Kuyt 's pass . <unk> received a yellow card in the 54th minute when he brought Pennant down . Immediately afterwards , Milan had an attack . Pirlo received the ball from a header by Clarence Seedorf , Pirlo played a high pass to Kaká who was ruled to be offside by the assistant referee , despite being behind the defence when the ball was played . Milan had another attack straight after the offside , but Liverpool defender Daniel Agger tackled Inzaghi before he could shoot . Liverpool had their first yellow card in the 59th minute when Javier Mascherano received one for bringing down Pirlo . After the yellow card , Liverpool decided to replace Boudewijn Zenden with Harry Kewell . Liverpool 's best goalscoring chance of the match occurred minutes later . Gerrard capitalised on an error by Gattuso to be one @-@ on @-@ one with Dida , but his shot did not possess enough power to beat the Milan goalkeeper . 
 Liverpool began to exert more pressure , although all their play was in front of the Milan penalty area , while Milan were unable to keep possession of the ball . In an attempt to bring about an equalising goal , Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez substituted Mascherano for striker Peter Crouch . Milan had an attack minutes later , but Inzaghi was unable to control the ball . Inzaghi made amends minutes later when he scored Milan 's second goal . With Mascherano substituted , Kaká had the space to pick out a pass to Inzaghi , who took the ball to the side of the Liverpool goalkeeper Reina and rolled it into the net to make the score 2 – 0 to Milan . Liverpool managed to pull one goal back in the 88th minute when Kuyt scored after Agger had flicked on Pennant 's corner . However , they were unable to find a second goal , and around 20 seconds before added time was up , the referee blew for full @-@ time with the score 2 – 1 to Milan .

 The trophy was presented to Milan captain Paolo Maldini in the Guest of Honour 's box , as UEFA President Michel Platini favoured a return to the past tradition of the winning captain receiving the trophy among the fans . It had become customary in recent years to have the presentation on a hastily constructed podium in the centre of the pitch . This was the first time that the trophy was presented to a winning captain by a UEFA president who had actually played against him in the past ; during Michel Platini 's final seasons with Juventus , the then @-@ teenager Paolo Maldini was making his professional début with Milan . 
 Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti was delighted with his team after their success . Ancelotti 's job had been under threat after a run of poor results in December , therefore the victory had extra significance for Ancelotti : " When I think back to December , we had to overcome so many hurdles so that makes it a very special victory . " Milan midfielder Clarence Seedorf , who had his fourth victory in the competition following Milan 's triumph was equally proud in the team 's achievement : " I am so proud to be part of this team . We worked hard this year , a very difficult year . " 
 A number of Milan players who had played in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous . Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result : " What happened then was strange , just six minutes when we played not so good and we paid for that . " Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his team @-@ mates sentiments : " The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime , but this is a different story . It 's our turn to celebrate now . " Striker Filippo Inzaghi , who missed the final in 2005 , was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan : " I 've scored quite a few times in Europe , but scoring in the Champions League final is something special . " Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success , adding that " the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight . " 
 Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez was disappointed that his team were unable to match their exploits of 2005 , when they beat Milan in a penalty shootout . Despite this he was still proud of his players efforts : " Thank you to our supporters , my staff and players who worked really hard and deserved a bit more . " Benítez was already thinking of making transfers in the aftermath of the match , hinting that his team lacked the same calibre of players that Milan had : " You could see the quality they had , and we need to start thinking how we can improve our team . " 
 Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was adamant that despite the defeat Liverpool would come back stronger next season : " We 've got to pick ourselves up , have a good rest in the summer and then go again next season . " Gerrard thought that although Liverpool controlled the first half , they did not control the match as much in the second half as they would have liked . Gerrard echoed his manager 's sentiments in regards to new players joining the club : " We need to strengthen and bring some quality into the club . The manager and the people in charge of the club know that and it will be an interesting summer . " 
 Winning the Champions League entitled Milan to compete in the 2007 UEFA Super Cup against UEFA Cup winners Sevilla . The match was overshadowed by the death of Sevilla player Antonio Puerta , which raised the possibility that the Super Cup might not go ahead . It did however , Milan beat Sevilla 3 – 1 to secure their fifth Super Cup victory . Milan 's success also entitled them to compete in the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup . They entered the competition in the semi @-@ finals , defeating Japanese team <unk> Red Diamonds 1 – 0 to progress to the final where they faced Argentine team Boca Juniors . Milan won the match 4 – 2 to secure their first FIFA Club World Cup triumph . 
 = Urðarbrunnr = 
 Urðarbrunnr ( Old Norse " Well of Urðr " ; either referring to a Germanic concept of fate — <unk> — or the norn named Urðr ) is a well in Norse mythology . Urðarbrunnr is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources , and the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson . In both sources , the well lies beneath the world tree Yggdrasil , and is associated with a trio of norns ( Urðr , Verðandi , and Skuld ) . In the Prose Edda , Urðarbrunnr is cited as one of three wells existing beneath three roots of Yggdrasil that reach into three distant , different lands ; the other two wells being Hvergelmir , located beneath a root in Niflheim , and Mímisbrunnr , located beneath a root near the home of the frost jötnar . Scholarly theory and speculation surrounds the well . 
 = = Attestations = = 
 Urðarbrunnr is attested in the following works : 
 = = = Poetic Edda = = = 
 In the Poetic Edda , Urðarbrunnr is mentioned in stanzas 19 and 20 of the poem Völuspá , and stanza 111 of the poem Hávamál . In stanza 19 of Völuspá , Urðarbrunnr is described as being located beneath Yggdrasil , and that Yggdrasil , an ever @-@ green ash @-@ tree , is covered with white mud or loam . Stanza 20 describes that three norns ( Urðr , Verðandi , and Skuld ) " come from " the well , here described as a " lake " , and that this trio of norns then " set down laws , they chose lives , for the sons of men the fates of men . " 
 Stanza 111 of Hávamál has been the matter of much debate and is considered unclear , having been referred to as " mysterious " , " obscure and much @-@ debated " . Benjamin Thorpe translates the stanza as : 
 Time ' tis to discourse from the preacher 's chair . 
 By the well of Urd I silent sat , 
 I saw and meditated , I listened to men 's words . 
 = = = Prose Edda = = = 
 In the Prose Edda , Urðarbrunnr is attested in Gylfaginning ( chapters 15 , 16 , and the beginning of chapter 17 ) , and twice in Skáldskaparmál . 
 = = = = Gylfaginning = = = = 
 In chapter 15 of Gylfaginning , a book of the Prose Edda , the throned figure of Just @-@ As @-@ High tells Gangleri ( described as King Gylfi in disguise ) about Yggdrasil and its roots . Just @-@ As @-@ High describes three roots that support Yggdrasil that stretch a great distance . The third root is located " among the Æsir " , " extends to heaven " and , beneath it , is the " very holy " Urðarbrunnr . Just @-@ As @-@ High details that , every day , the gods ride over the bridge Bifröst to hold court at the well . 
 High provides more information regarding the well in chapter 16 . High says that there are many beautiful places in heaven , and " everywhere there is divine protection around it . " There , a beautiful hall stands under the ash ( Yggdrasil ) near the well ( Urðarbrunnr ) , and from this hall come " three maidens " whose names are Urðr , Verðandi , and Skuld . The maidens shape the lives of men , and " we call them norns " . High goes on to describe that there are other norns , and their nature . 
 Further into chapter 16 , High states that norns that dwell by Urðarbrunnr take water from the well and mud that lies around it , and pour it over the Yggdrasil so that its branches do not decay or rot . The water is described as so holy that anything that enters the well will become " as white as the membrane called the skin that lies round the inside of the eggshell . " High then quotes stanza 19 of Völuspá , and states that two swans feed from the well , from which all other swans descend . Chapter 17 starts off with Gangleri asking what other " chief centres " exist outside of Urðarbrunnr . 
 = = = = Skáldskaparmál = = = = 
 Two sections of the book Skáldskaparmál reference Urðarbrunnr . The first reference is in section 49 , where a fragment of a work by the 10th century skald Kormákr Ögmundarson is recited in explaining how " Odin 's fire " is a kenning for a sword . The passage reads " A sword is Odin 's fire , as <unk> said : Battle raged when the feeder of Grid 's steed [ wolf ] , he who waged war , advanced with ringing <unk> [ Odin 's ] fire . " and that Urðr " rose from the well . " 
 Urðarbrunnr is mentioned a second time in section 52 of Skáldskaparmál , this time associated with Christ . The section states that early skalds once referred to Christ in relation to Urðarbrunnr and Rome , and quotes the late 10th century skald Eilífr Goðrúnarson , who states that " thus has the powerful king of Rome increased his realm with lands of heath @-@ land divinities [ giants ; i.e. heathen lands ] " and that Christ is said to have his throne south of Urðarbrunnr . 
 = = Theories = = 
 = = = Temple at Uppsala = = = 
 Parallels have been pointed out between the description of Urðarbrunnr at the base of the world tree Yggdrasil and Christian medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen 's account of a well at the base of a sacred tree at the Temple at Uppsala , Sweden , found in his 11th century work Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum . 
 = = = Eilífr Goðrúnarson = = = 
 Eilífr Goðrúnarson 's Christianity @-@ influenced account of Urðarbrunnr ( section 52 of Skáldskaparmál ) associates the well with the south and Rome . Theories have been proposed that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr , though there may be no other causative connection . Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan skald , and this selection has been theorized as describing that , due to directly associating Christ with the well , Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate .

Registered users can read and post tweets , but those who are unregistered can only read them . Users access Twitter through the website interface , SMS or mobile device app . Twitter Inc. is based in San Francisco and has more than 25 offices around the world . 
 Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey , Evan Williams , Biz Stone , and Noah Glass and launched in July 2006 . The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity , with more than 100 million users posting 340 million tweets a day in 2012 . The service also handled 1 @.@ 6 billion search queries per day .

 Twitter 's origins lie in a " daylong brainstorming session " held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo . Jack Dorsey , then an undergraduate student at New York University , introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group . The original project code name for the service was twttr , an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass , inspired by Flickr and the five @-@ character length of American SMS short codes . The decision was also partly due to the fact that domain <unk> was already in use , and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter . The developers initially considered " <unk> " as a short code , but later changed it to " <unk> " for " ease of use and memorability " . Work on the project started on March 21 , 2006 , when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9 : 50 PM Pacific Standard Time ( PST ) : " just setting up my twttr " . Dorsey has explained the origin of the " Twitter " title : 
 ... we came across the word ' twitter ' , and it was just perfect . The definition was ' a short burst of inconsequential information , ' and ' chirps from birds ' . And that 's exactly what the product was . 
 The first Twitter prototype , developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber , was used as an internal service for Odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on July 15 , 2006 . In October 2006 , Biz Stone , Evan Williams , Dorsey , and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo , together with its assets — including <unk> and Twitter.com — from the investors and shareholders . Williams fired Glass , who was silent about his part in Twitter 's startup until 2011 . Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007 . Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview : 
 With Twitter , it wasn 't clear what it was . They called it a social network , they called it microblogging , but it was hard to define , because it didn 't replace anything . There was this path of discovery with something like that , where over time you figure out what it is . Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning , which we described as status updates and a social utility . It is that , in part , but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network . 
 The tipping point for Twitter 's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive ( <unk> ) conference . During the event , Twitter usage increased from 20 @,@ 000 tweets per day to 60 @,@ 000 . " The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60 @-@ inch plasma screens in the conference hallways , exclusively streaming Twitter messages , " remarked Newsweek 's Steven Levy . " Hundreds of conference @-@ goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters . Panelists and speakers mentioned the service , and the bloggers in attendance touted it . " 
 Reaction at the conference was highly positive . Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter was " absolutely ruling " <unk> . Social software researcher <unk> <unk> said Twitter was " owning " the conference . Twitter staff received the festival 's Web Award prize with the remark " we 'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less . And we just did ! " The first unassisted off @-@ Earth Twitter message was posted from the International Space Station by NASA astronaut T. J. Creamer on January 22 , 2010 . By late November 2010 , an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts ' communal account , @ NASA _ Astronauts . NASA has also hosted over 25 " <unk> " , events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants ' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA . In August 2010 , the company appointed Adam Bain from News Corp. ' s Fox Audience Network as president of revenue . 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 The company experienced rapid initial growth . It had 400 @,@ 000 tweets posted per quarter in 2007 . This grew to 100 million tweets posted per quarter in 2008 . In February 2010 , Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day . By March 2010 , the company recorded over 70 @,@ 000 registered applications . As of June 2010 , about 65 million tweets were posted each day , equaling about 750 tweets sent each second , according to Twitter . As of March 2011 , that was about 140 million tweets posted daily . As noted on Compete.com , Twitter moved up to the third @-@ highest @-@ ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty @-@ second . 
 Twitter 's usage spikes during prominent events . For example , a record was set during the 2010 FIFA World Cup when fans wrote 2 @,@ 940 tweets per second in the thirty @-@ second period after Japan scored against Cameroon on June 14 . The record was broken again when 3 @,@ 085 tweets per second were posted after the Los Angeles Lakers ' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17 , and then again at the close of Japan 's victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3 @,@ 283 tweets per second . The record was set again during the 2011 FIFA Women 's World Cup Final between Japan and the United States , when 7 @,@ 196 tweets per second were published . When American singer Michael Jackson died on June 25 , 2009 , Twitter servers crashed after users were updating their status to include the words " Michael Jackson " at a rate of 100 @,@ 000 tweets per hour . The current record as of August 3 , 2013 was set in Japan , with 143 @,@ 199 tweets per second during a television screening of the movie Castle in the Sky ( beating the previous record of 33 @,@ 388 , also set by Japan for the television screening of the same movie ) . 
 Twitter acquired application developer <unk> on April 11 , 2010 . <unk> had developed the Apple Design Award @-@ winning Twitter client <unk> for the Mac and iPhone . The application , now called " Twitter " and distributed free of charge , is the official Twitter client for the iPhone , iPad and Mac . 
 From September through October 2010 , the company began rolling out " New Twitter " , an entirely revamped edition of <unk> Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites including YouTube and Flickr , and a complete overhaul of the interface , which shifted links such as ' @ mentions ' and ' <unk> ' above the Twitter stream , while ' Messages ' and ' Log Out ' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of <unk> As of November 1 , 2010 , the company confirmed that the " New Twitter experience " had been rolled out to all users .

He said while Twitter would " never lose that feeling " of speed , users could do more with the text . 
 = = Leadership = = 
 As chief executive officer , Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital funding by the venture capitalists who backed the company . On October 16 , 2008 , Williams took over the role of CEO , and Dorsey became chairman of the board . On October 4 , 2010 , Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO .

On October 4 , 2010 , Williams made an announcement saying that he will stay with the company and " be completely focused on product strategy " . 
 According to The New York Times , " Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship " when Williams was away . According to PC Magazine , Williams was " no longer involved in the day @-@ to @-@ day goings on at the company " . He was focused on developing a new startup , and became a member of Twitter 's board of directors , and promised to " help in any way I can " . In 2011 , Stone was still with Twitter but was working with AOL as an " advisor on volunteer efforts and philanthropy " . In January 2014 Stone announced the release of Jelly , a ' social Q & A network for mobile ' . Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011 , as executive chairman focusing on product development .

 = = Logo = = 
 Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo . The original logo was in use from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010 . A slightly modified version succeeded the first style when the website underwent its first redesign . 
 On February 27 , 2012 , a tweet from an employee that works on the company 's platform and API discussed the evolution of the " Larry the Bird " logo with Twitter 's creative director and it was revealed that it was named after Larry Bird of the NBA 's Boston Celtics fame . This detail had been confirmed when the Boston Celtics ' director of interactive media asked Twitter co @-@ founder Biz Stone about it in August 2011 . 
 On June 5 , 2012 , Twitter unveiled its third logo redesign , replacing Larry the Bird with an updated icon simply named as the " Twitter Bird " . As of this logo revision , the word " Twitter " and the lowercase letter " t " are no longer used , with the bird becoming the sole symbol for the company 's branding . According to Douglas Bowman , designer of Twitter , the new logo resembles a mountain bluebird . Twitter explains on their website not to modify the logo ( e.g. rotate the bird , change the logo 's color , etc . ) .

 Tweets are publicly visible by default , but senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers . Users can tweet via the Twitter website , compatible external applications ( such as for smartphones ) , or by Short Message Service ( SMS ) available in certain countries . Users may subscribe to other users ' tweets — this is known as " following " and subscribers are known as " followers " or " <unk> " , a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps . Individual tweets can be forwarded by other users to their own feed , a process known as a " retweet " . Users can also " like " ( formerly " favorite " ) individual tweets . Twitter allows users to update their profile via their mobile phone either by text messaging or by apps released for certain smartphones and tablets . Twitter has been compared to a web @-@ based Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) client . In a 2009 Time essay , technology author Steven Johnson described the basic mechanics of Twitter as " remarkably simple " : 
 As a social network , Twitter revolves around the principle of followers . When you choose to follow another Twitter user , that user 's tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main Twitter page . If you follow 20 people , you 'll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page : breakfast @-@ cereal updates , interesting new links , music recommendations , even musings on the future of education . 
 According to research published in April 2014 , around 44 percent of user accounts have never tweeted . 
 = = = = Content = = = = 
 San Antonio @-@ based market @-@ research firm Pear Analytics analyzed 2 @,@ 000 tweets ( originating from the United States and in English ) over a two @-@ week period in August 2009 from 11 : 00 am to 5 : 00 pm ( CST ) and separated them into six categories : 
 Pointless babble – 40 % 
 <unk> – 38 % 
 Pass @-@ along value – 9 % 
 Self @-@ promotion – 6 % 
 Spam – 4 % 
 News – 4 % 
 Despite Jack Dorsey 's own open contention that a message on Twitter is " a short burst of inconsequential information " , social networking researcher <unk> <unk> responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labelled " pointless babble " is better characterized as " social grooming " and / or " peripheral awareness " ( which she justifies as persons " want [ ing ] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling , even when co @-@ presence isn 't viable " ) . Similarly , a survey of Twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers . 
 = = = = Format = = = = 
 Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags – words or phrases prefixed with a " # " sign . Similarly , the " @ " sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users . To <unk> a message from another Twitter user and share it with one 's own followers , a user can click the retweet button within the Tweet . 
 In late 2009 , the " Twitter Lists " feature was added , making it possible for users to follow ad hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors . 
 Through SMS , users can communicate with Twitter through five gateway numbers : short codes for the United States , Canada , India , New Zealand , and an Isle of Man @-@ based number for international use . There is also a short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone , O2 and Orange networks . In India , since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel , an alternative platform called <unk> was set up by a user to work on all networks . A similar platform called <unk> exists for mobile phone users in Singapore and Malaysia . 
 The tweets were set to a largely constrictive 140 @-@ character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging , introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages . The 140 @-@ character limit also increased the usage of URL shortening services such as bit.ly , <unk> , and <unk> , and content @-@ hosting services , such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters . Since June 2011 , Twitter has used its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its website , making other link <unk> superfluous for staying within the 140 character limit . 
 On May 24 , 2016 , Twitter announced that media such as photos and videos , and the person 's handle , would not count against the 140 character limit . A user photo post used to count for about 24 characters . Attachments and links will also no longer be part of the character limit . 
 On July 17 , Twitter will launch a new way for advertisers to target users that have tweeted with a certain emoji or engaged with tweets with a certain emoji . 
 = = = = Trending topics = = = = 
 A word , phrase or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a " trending topic " . Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users , or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic . These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people 's opinions are about it . 
 Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena , particularly musicians like Lady Gaga ( known as Little Monsters ) , Justin Bieber ( <unk> ) , and One Direction ( <unk> ) , and fans of the Twilight ( <unk> ) , Rihanna fans ( <unk> Navy ) , and Harry Potter ( <unk> ) novels . Twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type , with limited success . 
 The Twitter web interface displays a list of trending topics on a sidebar on the home page , along with sponsored content ( see image ) . 
 Twitter often censors trending hashtags that are claimed to be abusive or offensive . Twitter censored the # <unk> and # <unk> hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive . There are allegations that Twitter removed # <unk> from the trending list and added an Indian National Congress @-@ sponsored hashtag . 
 = = = Adding and following content = = = 
 There are numerous tools for adding content , monitoring content and conversations including Telly ( video sharing , old name is <unk> ) , <unk> , Salesforce.com , <unk> , and <unk> . As of 2009 , fewer than half of tweets posted were posted using the web user interface with most users using third @-@ party applications ( based on an analysis of 500 million tweets by <unk> ) . 
 = = = Verified accounts = = = 
 A verified Twitter account formally validates the identity of the person or company that owns the account — the aim of the " verified " status is to prove that a real @-@ world person or company is not being impersonated , through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the top @-@ right corner of a user 's page , or next to the username in the platform 's Search function . Twitter is responsible for assigning the blue checkmark , and it is frequently applied to the accounts of notable people in politics , music , movies , business , fashion , government , sports , media , and journalism . 
 The owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard Twitter @-@ account holders . These features include : 
 The ability to choose how their notifications and mentions are presented . Since verified accounts typically receive a lot of followers , account holders can filter these notices based on whether or not they are from verified accounts . 
 The ability to view information about their followers and their involvement on Twitter . 
 The ability to receive direct messages from all followers or only selected followers . 
 In a breach of Twitter 's rules , some users placed the verified checkmark in their background — Twitter confirmed that such conduct is invalid . Following a design update of the Twitter platform , it is more difficult for users to impersonate a verified account because of the layout . 
 A limitation of the verified status is that if the account is hacked , the person or company can still be impersonated for a limited time , until control is regained over the account by the legitimate owners – as happened , for example , with Tesla Motors ' Twitter account briefly in 2015 . 
 = = = Mobile = = = 
 Twitter has mobile apps for iPhone , iPad , Android , Windows 10 , Windows Phone , BlackBerry , Firefox OS , and Nokia S40 . There is also version of the website for mobile devices , SMS and MMS service . For many years , Twitter has limited the use of third party applications accessing the service by implementing a 100 @,@ 000 user limit per application . 
 = = = Authentication = = = 
 Since August 31 , 2010 , third @-@ party Twitter applications have been required to use OAuth , an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application . The OAuth authentication method used to be optional , but it is now compulsory and the user @-@ name / password authentication method has been made redundant and is no longer functional . Twitter stated that the move to OAuth will mean " increased security and a better experience " . 
 = = = Related headlines feature = = = 
 This feature adds websites to the bottom of a tweet 's <unk> page . If a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories , the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet . This feature was added onto Twitter so if the viewer doesn 't understand what the tweet means , they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about .

 On October 21 , 2015 , Twitter began to roll out the ability to attach poll questions to tweets . Polls are open for 24 hours , and voters are not personally identified .

 Twitter is ranked as one of the ten @-@ most @-@ visited websites worldwide by Alexa 's web traffic analysis . Daily user estimates vary as the company does not publish statistics on active accounts . A February 2009 Compete.com blog entry ranked Twitter as the third most used social network based on their count of 6 million unique monthly visitors and 55 million monthly visits . In March 2009 , a <unk> blog ranked Twitter as the fastest @-@ growing website in the Member Communities category for February 2009 .

 In 2009 , Twitter was mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter , said Jeremiah <unk> , an industry analyst studying social media . " Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years , " he said . According to comScore only eleven percent of Twitter 's users are aged twelve to <unk> comScore attributed this to Twitter 's " early adopter period " when the social network first gained popularity in business settings and news outlets attracting primarily older users . However , comScore also stated in 2009 that Twitter had begun to " filter more into the mainstream " , and " along with it came a culture of celebrity as Shaq , Britney Spears and Ashton Kutcher joined the ranks of the <unk> " . 
 According to a study by <unk> in June 2009 , women make up a slightly larger Twitter demographic than men — fifty @-@ three percent over forty @-@ seven percent . It also stated that five percent of users accounted for seventy @-@ five percent of all activity , and that New York City has more Twitter users than other cities . 
 According to <unk> , twenty @-@ seven million people in the US used Twitter as of September 3 , 2009 .

 Twitter raised over US $ 57 million from venture capitalist growth funding , although exact numbers are not publicly disclosed . Twitter 's first A round of funding was for an undisclosed amount that is rumored to have been between US $ 1 million and US $ 5 million . Its second B round of funding in 2008 was for US $ 22 million and its third C round of funding in 2009 was for US $ 35 million from Institutional Venture Partners and Benchmark Capital along with an undisclosed amount from other investors including Union Square Ventures , Spark Capital , and Insight Venture Partners . Twitter is backed by Union Square Ventures , Digital Garage , Spark Capital , and Bezos Expeditions . 
 In May 2008 , The Industry Standard remarked that Twitter 's long @-@ term viability is limited by a lack of revenue . Twitter board member Todd Chaffee forecast that the company could profit from e @-@ commerce , noting that users may want to buy items directly from Twitter since it already provides product recommendations and promotions . 
 By March 2009 communications consultant Bill Douglass predicted in an interview that Twitter would be worth $ 1 billion within six months , which came to pass when the company closed a financing round valuing it at $ 1 billion in September of that year . 
 The company raised US $ 200 million in new venture capital in December 2010 , at a valuation of approximately US $ 3 @.@ 7 billion . In March 2011 , 35 @,@ 000 Twitter shares sold for US $ 34 @.@ 50 each on <unk> , an implied valuation of US $ 7 @.@ 8 billion . In August 2010 Twitter announced a " significant " investment led by Digital Sky Technologies that , at US $ 800 million , was reported to be the largest venture round in history .

 = = = Revenue sources = = = 
 In July 2009 , some of Twitter 's revenue and user growth documents were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll . The documents projected 2009 revenues of US $ 400 @,@ 000 in the third quarter and US $ 4 million in the fourth quarter along with 25 million users by the end of the year . The projections for the end of 2013 were US $ 1 @.@ 54 billion in revenue , US $ 111 million in net earnings , and 1 billion users . No information about how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published . In response , Twitter co @-@ founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker . 
 On April 13 , 2010 , Twitter announced plans to offer paid advertising for companies that would be able to purchase " promoted tweets " to appear in selective search results on the Twitter website , similar to Google <unk> ' advertising model . As of April 13 , Twitter announced it had already signed up a number of companies wishing to advertise , including Sony Pictures , Red Bull , Best Buy , and Starbucks . 
 The company generated US $ 45 million in annual revenue in 2010 , after beginning sales midway through that year ; the company operated at a loss through most of 2010 . 
 Users ' photos can generate royalty @-@ free revenue for Twitter , and an agreement with World Entertainment News Network ( <unk> ) was announced in May 2011 . In June 2011 , Twitter announced that it would offer small businesses a self @-@ service advertising system . Twitter generated US $ 139 @.@ 5 million in advertising sales during 2011 . 
 The self @-@ service advertising platform was launched in March 2012 to American Express card members and merchants in the U.S. on an invite @-@ only basis . Twitter later reported that numerous small businesses and people who used the self @-@ service tool provided feedback that indicated they were impressed by the feature . To continue their advertising campaign , Twitter announced on March 20 , 2012 that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices . In April 2013 , Twitter announced that its Twitter Ads self @-@ service platform , consisting of promoted tweets and promoted accounts , was available to all U.S. users without an invite .

 Twitter places great reliance on open @-@ source software . The Twitter Web interface uses the Ruby on Rails framework , deployed on a performance enhanced Ruby Enterprise Edition implementation of Ruby . 
 In the early days of Twitter , tweets were stored in MySQL databases that were temporally <unk> ( large databases were split based on time of posting ) . After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases , the company decided that the system needed re @-@ engineering . 
 As of April 6 , 2011 , Twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search stack , to a Java server they call Blender . 
 From Spring 2007 to 2008 the messages were handled by a Ruby persistent queue server called Starling , but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in Scala . The switch from Ruby to Scala and the <unk> has given Twitter a performance boost from 200 – 300 requests per second per host to around 10 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 requests per second per host . This boost was greater than the 10x improvement that Twitter 's engineers envisioned when starting the switch . The continued development of Twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls . 
 Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called snowflake , and geolocation data is added using ' <unk> ' . The URL <unk> t.co then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL . Next , the tweets are stored in a MySQL database using Gizzard , and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent . Tweets are then sent to search engines via the Firehose API . The process itself is managed by <unk> and takes an average of 350 ms . 
 On August 16 , 2013 , Twitter 's Vice President of Platform Engineering Raffi Krikorian shared in a blog post that the company 's infrastructure handled almost 143 @,@ 000 tweets per second during that week , setting a new record . Krikorian explained that Twitter achieved this record by blending its homegrown and open source technologies . 
 The service 's application programming interface ( API ) allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter .

 On April 30 , 2009 , Twitter adjusted its web interface , adding a search bar and a sidebar of " trending topics " — the most common phrases appearing in messages . Biz Stone explains that all messages are instantly indexed and that " with this newly launched feature , Twitter has become something unexpectedly important – a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now . " 
 In March 2012 , Twitter became available in Arabic , Farsi , Hebrew and Urdu , the first right @-@ to @-@ left language versions of the site . About 13 @,@ 000 volunteers helped with translating the menu options . In August 2012 , beta support for Basque , Czech and Greek was added , making the site available in 33 different languages .

 When Twitter experiences an outage , users once saw the " fail whale " error message image created by <unk> Lu , illustrating eight orange birds using a net to hoist a whale from the ocean captioned " Too many tweets ! Please wait a moment and try again . " In a November 2013 <unk> interview Chris Fry , VP of Engineering at that time , noted that the company had taken the " fail whale " out of production as the platform was now more stable . 
 Twitter had approximately ninety @-@ eight percent <unk> in 2007 ( or about six full days of downtime ) . The downtime was particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address . 
 May 2008 : Twitter 's new engineering team made architectural changes to deal with the scale of growth . Stability issues resulted in down time or temporary feature removal .

 June 12 , 2009 : In what was called a potential " <unk> " , the unique numerical identifier associated with each tweet exceeded the limit of 32 @-@ bit signed integers ( 2 @,@ 147 @,@ 483 @,@ 647 total messages ) . While Twitter itself was not affected , some third @-@ party clients could no longer access recent tweets . Patches were quickly released , though some iPhone applications had to wait for approval from the App Store .

 June – July 2010 : Twitter had a very high service rejection rate ( 10 – 20 % ) during the 2010 FIFA World Cup period , also , the response latency increased substantially . 
 November 2010 : A number of accounts encountered a fault that resulted in them seeing the " fail whale " when they tried to log in to their accounts . The accounts themselves were not locked out as account holders could still see their " mentions " page , and post from there , but the timeline and a number of other features were unavailable during this outage . 
 June 21 , 2012 : The site was down for around one hour and forty minutes , with the cause being described by Twitter as a " cascading bug " .

 Twitter messages are public , but users can also send private messages . Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public , though accounts can be changed to " protected " which limits this information ( and all tweets ) to approved followers . Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy . The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands . While Twitter displays no advertising , advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user . 
 A security vulnerability was reported on April 7 , 2007 , by <unk> <unk> and <unk> . Since Twitter used the phone number of the sender of an SMS message as authentication , malicious users could update someone else 's status page by using SMS spoofing . The vulnerability could be used if the <unk> knew the phone number registered to their victim 's account . Within a few weeks of this discovery , Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number ( PIN ) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS @-@ originating messages . 
 On January 5 , 2009 , 33 high @-@ profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator 's password was guessed by a dictionary attack . <unk> tweets — including sexually explicit and drug @-@ related messages — were sent from these accounts . 
 Twitter launched the beta version of their " Verified Accounts " service on June 11 , 2009 , allowing famous or notable people to announce their Twitter account name . The home pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status . 
 In May 2010 , a bug was discovered by <unk> <unk> that could allow a Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users ' consent or knowledge . For example , comedian Conan O 'Brien 's account , which had been set to follow only one person , was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions . 
 In response to Twitter 's security breaches , the US Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) brought charges against the service ; the charges were settled on June 24 , 2010 . This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses . The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users ' private information , including maintenance of a " comprehensive information security program " to be independently audited biannually . 
 On December 14 , 2010 , the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks . Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement , " ... it 's our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information , unless we are prevented by law from doing so . " 
 A " <unk> " exploit occurred on September 21 , 2010 , when an XSS Worm became active on Twitter . When a user held the mouse cursor over blacked @-@ out parts of a tweet , the worm within the script would automatically open links and re @-@ post itself on the reader 's account . The exploit was then re @-@ used to post pop @-@ up ads and links to pornographic sites . The origin of the worm is unclear , but Pearce H. Delphin ( known on Twitter as @ <unk> ) and a Scandinavian developer , Magnus Holm , both claim to have modified a related exploit found by another user ( possibly Masato <unk> ) who was using it to create coloured Tweets . <unk> , a Japanese developer , reported the XSS vulnerability to Twitter on August 14 . Later , when he found it was exploitable again , he created the account ' <unk> ' and used it to post coloured messages . Delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a JavaScript function for " <unk> " , and Holm later created and posted the XSS Worm that automatically re @-@ tweeted itself . Security firm Sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for " fun and games " , but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals . Twitter issued a statement on their status blog at 13 : 50 UTC that " The exploit is fully patched . " Twitter representative Carolyn Penner said no charges would be pressed . 
 In May 2011 , a claimant known as " CTB " ( subsequently identified as Ryan Giggs ) in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc . , Persons Unknown took legal action at the High Court of Justice in London against Twitter , requesting that Twitter release details of account holders . This followed gossip posted on Twitter about Giggs ' private life , causing conflict relating to privacy injunctions . Tony Wang , the head of Twitter in Europe , said that people who do " bad things " on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy , and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so . He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for " illegal activity " on the site . 
 On May 29 , 2011 , it was reported that South Tyneside council in England had successfully taken legal action against Twitter in a court in California , forcing Twitter to reveal the details of five user accounts .
