 Marketing for the film included $ 20 million spent by Disney for advertising as well as advertisers such as Burger King , PepsiCo , Coca @-@ Cola , and Payless ShoeSource paying $ 125 million in tied promotions for the film . A marketing consultant reflected on the promotion : " This will be a killer deal . How can a kid , sitting through a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hour movie with an army of recognizable toy characters , not want to own one ? " Despite this , Disney Consumer Products was slow to see the potential of Toy Story early on . When the Thanksgiving release date was announced in January 1995 , many toy companies were accustomed to having eighteen months to two years of runway time , and passed on the project . In February 1995 , Disney took the idea to Toy Fair , a toy industry trade show in New York . There , a Toronto @-@ based company with a factory based in China , Thinkway Toys , became interested . Although Thinkway was a small player in the industry , mainly producing toy banks in the form of film characters , it was able to scoop up the worldwide master license for Toy Story toys simply because no one else wanted it . Walt Disney Home Video put a trailer for the film on seven million copies of the VHS re @-@ release of Cinderella ; the Disney Channel ran a television special on the making of Toy Story ; Walt Disney World in Florida held a daily Toy Story parade at Disney @-@ MGM Studios . 
 It was screenwriter Joss Whedon 's idea to incorporate Barbie as a character who would rescue Woody and Buzz in the film 's final act . The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy . Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow the use of the toy as " They [ Mattel ] philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll . If you give the doll a voice and animate it , you 're creating a persona for it that might not be every little girl 's dream and desire . " Hasbro likewise refused to license G.I. Joe ( mainly because Sid was going to blow one up ) , but they did license Mr. Potato Head . The only toy in the movie that was not in production was Slinky Dog , which was discontinued since the 1970s . When designs for Slinky were sent to Betty James ( Richard James 's wife ) she said that Pixar had improved the toy and that it was " cuter " than the original .

 On October 2 , 2009 , the film was re @-@ released in Disney Digital 3 @-@ D. The film was also released with Toy Story 2 as a double feature for a two @-@ week run which was extended due to its success . In addition , the film 's second sequel , Toy Story 3 , was also released in the 3 @-@ D format . Lasseter commented on the new 3 @-@ D re @-@ release : 
 The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we 're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy in a whole new way thanks to the latest in 3 @-@ D technology . With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz , Woody and the gang from Andy 's room , we thought it would be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way . 
 Translating the film into 3 @-@ D involved revisiting the original computer data and virtually placing a second camera into each scene , creating left @-@ eye and right @-@ eye views needed to achieve the perception of depth . Unique to computer animation , Lasseter referred to this process as " digital archaeology . " The process took four months , as well as an additional six months for the two films to add the 3 @-@ D. The lead stereographer Bob Whitehill oversaw this process and sought to achieve an effect that affected the emotional storytelling of the film : 
 When I would look at the films as a whole , I would search for story reasons to use 3 @-@ D in different ways . In Toy Story , for instance , when the toys were alone in their world , I wanted it to feel consistent to a safer world . And when they went out to the human world , that 's when I really blew out the 3 @-@ D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming . 
 Unlike other countries , the United Kingdom received the films in 3 @-@ D as separate releases . Toy Story was released on October 2 , 2009 . Toy Story 2 was instead released January 22 , 2010 . The re @-@ release performed well at the box office , opening with $ 12 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 in its opening weekend , placing at the third position after Zombieland and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs .

It 's got a shot that 's always stuck with me , when Buzz Lightyear discovers he 's a toy . He 's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircase and the camera pulls back and he 's this tiny little figure . He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before ... and it 's stunning .

 Before the film 's release , executive producer and Apple Inc. co @-@ founder Steve Jobs stated " If Toy Story is a modest hit — say $ 75 million at the box office , we 'll [ Pixar and Disney ] both break even .

" Upon its release on November 22 , 1995 , Toy Story managed to gross more than $ 350 million worldwide . Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated " I don 't think either side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has .

 Susie Bootja Bootja Napaltjarri ( also referred to as Susie Bootja Bootja Napangardi , <unk> , or <unk> ) ( c . 1935 – 16 January 2003 ) was an Indigenous artist from Australia 's Western Desert region . Born south @-@ west of Balgo , Western Australia , in the 1950s Susie Bootja Bootja married artist Mick Gill Tjakamarra , with whom she had a son , Matthew Gill Tjupurrula ( also an artist ) . 
 Susie Bootja Bootja 's painting career followed the establishment of Warlayirti Artists , an Indigenous art centre at Balgo . One of the area 's strongest artists , her work was characterised by an expressive style , and has been acquired by major Australian galleries , including the Art Gallery of New South Wales and National Gallery of Victoria . She died in 2003 . 
 = = Life = = 
 Susie Bootja Bootja was born circa 1935 near <unk> , or Helena Spring , south @-@ west of Balgo , Western Australia ; the country is called <unk> in her own language , a name that appears as the title of one of her art works . The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time , often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events . While sources vary as to Susie 's skin name ( some indicating <unk> , others Napaltjarri ) , the similar birth dates , locations , and work history indicate that all are referring to the one individual . 
 'Napaljarri ' ( in Warlpiri ) or ' Napaltjarri ' ( in Western Desert dialects ) is a skin name , one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people . These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems . Although they may be used as terms of address , they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans . Thus ' Susie Bootja Bootja ' is the element of the artist 's name that is specifically hers . 
 Susie Bootja Bootja was of the <unk> language group . She married artist Mick Gill Tjakamarra at Old Balgo in the 1950s , and they had a son , Matthew Gill Tjupurrula ( born 1960 ) , who also became an artist . Susie Bootja Bootja died on 16 January 2003 .

 Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971 , assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon . Their work , which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures , rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia , particularly following the commencement of a government @-@ sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983 . By the 1980s and 1990s , such work was being exhibited internationally . The first artists , including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists ' company , had been men , and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting . However , there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate , and in the 1990s large numbers of them began to create paintings . In the western desert communities such as Kintore , Yuendumu , Balgo , and on the outstations , people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale . Art centres were important to this widespread creation of art works . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 The Balgo community did not establish an art centre for more than ten years after their colleagues at Papunya , with artistic activities commencing when an adult education centre was opened in 1981 . However once Warlayirti Artists was set up , the community went on to become one of Australia 's most successful Indigenous art centres . Painting at the centre is a sociable , communal activity , and Susie Bootja Bootja would <unk> collaborate with other painters , including her husband . 
 Susie Bootja Bootja was represented by Warlayirti artists at Balgo , where she was living and working in the 1990s . She was one of the strongest painters at Balgo . The work of Balgo artists such as Susie Bootja Bootja , and her fellow artists including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , are characterised by an expressive style , involving " linked dotting and blurred forms and edges " . 
 Works by Susie Bootja Bootja are held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the National Gallery of Victoria , and the Flinders University Art Museum Collection . She is also represented in major private collections , such as Nangara ( also known as the Ebes Collection ) , the Holmes à Court Collection and the Morven Estate . Works by both Susie Bootja Bootja and her husband were included in a 1991 exhibition ' <unk> : Peintres <unk> de Balgo et Lajamanu ' in Paris , and in ' Daughters of the Dreaming ' at the Art Gallery of Western Australia in 1997 . Her paintings feature in Christine Watson 's 2003 book , Piercing the Ground : Balgo Women 's Image Making and Relationship to Country . 
 Susie Bootja Bootja helped choose the site for , and participated in , a major ceremony for a 1993 Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary film , Milli Milli . The ceremony , called <unk> Kutjarra ( Two men ) Dreaming , was performed with others including fellow artist Peggy Rockman Napaljarri .

 = Elephant <unk> herpesvirus = 
 Elephant <unk> herpesviruses ( EEHV ) or <unk> herpesvirus 1 ' is a type of herpesvirus , which can cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants . In African elephants , related forms of these viruses , which have been identified in wild populations , are generally benign , occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions . However , some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants , which kills up to 80 % of severely affected individuals . The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs , but this has only been effective in around a third of cases . 
 The first case of a fatal form of the disease was documented in 1995 , though tissue samples from as early as the 1980s have since tested positive for the virus , and localized skin lesions in wild African elephants were recorded in the 1970s . Since 1995 , there have been over fifty documented disease cases in North America and Europe , of which only nine have been successfully cured . Those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity , though a small number of older wild @-@ born adults held in zoos have died , and a number of cases caused by the same pathogenic type of EEHV have been identified in both orphan and wild calves in Asian elephant populations . 
 = = Virus and transmission = = 
 The EEHVs are members of the <unk> genus , a novel clade most closely related to the mammalian <unk> that have been responsible for as many as 70 deaths of both zoo and wild Asian elephants worldwide , especially in young calves . There are currently six known species / types of the <unk> , and the most commonly encountered and most pathogenic form EEHV1 also has two chimeric subtypes , 1A and 1B . , as well as numerous distinct strains . 
 EEHV1A ( originally just known as EEHV1 ) was the first species / type identified , which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high mortality rate in Asian elephants . This form of the virus was originally believed to occur naturally in African elephants ( occasionally producing skin nodules ) , and to be transmitted to Asian elephants within captivity , but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species / types of EEHV ( e.g. EEHV2 , EEHV3 and EEHV6 ) instead have been identified in African elephants . A second lethal subtype , EEHV1B , was identified in Asian elephants in 2001 . EEHV3 , <unk> and <unk> have also each been responsible for the deaths of at least one Asian elephant calf . 
 EEHV2 has caused hemorrhagic disease in several African elephants as reported by . Along with EEHV3 and EEHV6 it has also been found in pulmonary lymph nodes of several autopsied wild and zoo African elephants . 
 There are a further five or six species / types and varieties of elephant <unk> ( <unk> ) found in eye and genital secretions of many healthy Asian and African zoo elephants - e.g. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ( also called <unk> herpesviruses <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> - which are gamma herpesviruses . But these are neither closely related to the EEHVs , nor the known cause of any disease symptoms . 
 Studies have also detected both EEHV1A and EEHV1B as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic Asian zoo elephant <unk> of calves that previously had <unk> and similarly for <unk> . Thus , similar to saliva for most human and animal herpesviruses , the trunk secretions may be a source of transmission for EEHVs . Because of concerns about the origins of EEHV1 and evidence of cross @-@ species transmission for EEHV3 , long @-@ term contact between Asian and African elephants has been discouraged , along with avoiding new contacts between young captive @-@ born Asian elephants and wild @-@ born Asian elephants , as the latter may be carriers of the disease . An analysis of a number of North American cases , which ruled out the direct transmission of the virus between any of the affected facilities studied , strongly supported the idea of a significant Asian carrier population . This is supported by the fact that some of the deceased calves had no possible contact with any African elephants . Artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor , notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times ( even at the same facility ) they nearly all had distinct strains of the virus , yet when two calves died or became infected at the same time at the same facility the pairs have always had identical virus strains . A program of enzyme @-@ linked immunosorbent assay testing began in 2005 , aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies to the virus in order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns . 
 = = Effects and treatment = = 
 In benign infections found in some wild and captive African elephants , these viruses can affect either the skin or the pulmonary system . In the former case , it produces small pinkish nodules on the head and trunk in juveniles , which appear for a few weeks and then regress , suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant . In the second case , it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults . These are both characteristic of EEHV2 , EEHV3 and EEHV6 . 
 In a fatal attack , however , it manifests very quickly . In a number of cases , death has occurred within 24 hours of the onset of the infection , while other cases do not last longer than around five days . The virus attacks endothelial cells , rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging ; once this reaches the heart , the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock . Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat , a rapid heartbeat , and decreased blood @-@ cell count , as well as cyanosis of the tongue , mouth ulcers , and oedema of the head and trunk . 
 Rapid treatment with famciclovir , sustained for around a month , has appeared to cure eight calves infected with EEHV1 ; however , this treatment is very expensive , only partially effective , and relies on early identification of the infection . 
 A polymerase chain reaction test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA , though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case . Prior to the development of the test , or in circumstances where it is not available , the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death , including <unk> and salmonellosis . 
 = = History = = 
 The virus has been identified in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants as far back as the 1970s . The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington , D.C. , in 1995 ; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus . These cases have so far been identified as early as 1983 . Since this date , there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe , nine of which were successfully treated . The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation . This gives a fatality rate of over 80 % among known symptomatic disease cases . In cases where antiviral medication was applied , treatment was effective in about one in three cases . As of 2005 , there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used , eight of which were fatal . As a fraction of the overall population , it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007 , 19 are known to have died of EEHV , and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication . 
 The affected animals are mostly young Asian elephants that had been born in captivity , with half the cases in North America being between the ages of one and four years ( and three @-@ quarters between one and eight years old ) . Some cases have affected newborns or adult elephants born in the wild ( oldest aged 40 years ) , and three recorded cases have affected African elephants . The first documented fatal case for African elephants was <unk> , an eleven @-@ month @-@ old male in 1996 . Since 2008 , a number of cases have been attributed to EEHV1 among wild Asian elephants . 
 The first suspected case in Asia was in 1997 , though it was not until the fifth suspected case that the presence of the virus could be confirmed . This case was reported in 2006 , with the death of a young wild @-@ born female calf at an elephant sanctuary in Cambodia . The virus was identified as part of the EEHV1 group , the same as previously identified in the North American and European captive populations . In 2013 , nine lethal cases from India were extensively characterized and found to consist of a wide variety of genetically diverged strains of EEHV1A and EEHV1B matching the subtypes and genetic range of nearly all those found previously in Europe and North America . Cases attributed to EEHV1A and <unk> have also been reported in Thailand and there is both confirmed and anecdotal evidence for similar hemorrhagic disease deaths of between 16 and 30 more calves in Asian countries including Thailand , India , Nepal , Myanmar and Indonesia within the past five years . Thus , this is not just a disease of captive elephants , but is endogenous to and possibly rampant in Asian elephants in the wild also . Further research has been noted as " urgently required " to study the situation in regions with wild Asian elephant populations .

 " Love Somebody " is a song recorded by American pop rock band Maroon 5 . The song was released on May 14 , 2013 , as the fourth and final single from their fourth studio album , Overexposed ( 2012 ) . It was written by Adam Levine , Nathaniel Motte , Ryan Tedder , and Noel Zancanella ; the latter two are also the producers . " Love Somebody " is a dance @-@ pop song that lyrically equates love and physical intimacy and explores " salvation on the dance floor " . 
 Upon release , the song was a respectable success on the charts and became the fourth top ten hit from the album on the Billboard Hot 100 . Despite its success , the single received mixed reviews from music critics who praised its composition , linking it to the works by Coldplay , but criticized its production and Levine 's vocals . Following the release of the album , due to strong digital downloads , the song peaked at number nine on the singles chart in South Korea .

According to Chris Payne of Billboard , Tedder and Zancanella 's influence is all over the song and inches through the verses " before bubbling over just before the chorus kicks in . " Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly in a review of the album , wrote that the song together with " Daylight " have " thickly " produced choruses . Lyrically , " Love Somebody " equates love and physical intimacy , with Levine singing : " I really wanna love somebody [ ... ] I really wanna touch somebody " . Nate Chinen of The New York Times described the lyrical theme of the song as " a plea for salvation on the dance floor or some other horizontal surface " .

 Suzanne Byrne of RTÉ.ie wrote that " Love Somebody " alongside " Daylight " , " The Man Who Never Lied " and " Lucky Strike " are potential single releases . Brittany Frederick of <unk> called the song " earnest " , while Cameron Adams of Herald Sun described it as Coldplay " trying to be " Katy Perry . Similarly as Adams , PopMatters ' Evan Sawdey wrote that " Love Somebody " is the group 's " sky @-@ scraping Coldplay moment " . Jeremy Thomas of 411 Mania labeled the song as one of the more emotional tracks on Overexposed and a " rare moment where the overhanging production tricks ease up just enough to make for an honest @-@ to @-@ God song with emotion and not just a laser scope aimed at the Billboard charts . 
 In a review of the album , Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote that the band had left " the strutting cockerel heat " of their 2004 single " This Love " for the " saturated rave bliss " of " Love Somebody " or " The Man Who Never Lied " . According to him that ’ s an effect of the market they have chosen to contribute on . Billboard 's Chris Payne thought that the song fades into the background of the other stronger tracks on Overexposed . Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly was more critical towards Levine 's vocals on " Love Somebody " and wrote that the singer 's voice is processed in a high disaffected whine — " like a male Rihanna or an android castrato " , which according to him , it 's ideal for tracing the contours of a pop hook .

 = Thrice = 
 Thrice is an American rock band from Irvine , California , formed in 1998 . The group was founded by guitarist / vocalist Dustin Kensrue and guitarist Teppei Teranishi while they were in high school . 
 Early in their career , the band was known for fast , hard music based in heavily distorted guitars , prominent lead guitar lines , and frequent changes in complex time signatures . This style is exemplified on their second album , The Illusion of Safety ( 2002 ) and their third album The Artist in the Ambulance ( 2003 ) . Their fourth album Vheissu ( 2005 ) made significant changes by incorporating electronic beats , keyboards , and more experimental and nuanced songwriting . Their fifth effort was a double album entitled The Alchemy Index ( 2007 / 2008 ) , released as two sets of two CDs that together make a 4 @-@ part , 24 @-@ song cycle . Each of the four 6 @-@ song EPs of the Alchemy Index features significantly different styles , based on different aspects of the band 's musical aesthetic which reflect the elemental themes of fire , water , air and earth , both lyrically and musically . The band 's sixth album , entitled Beggars , was released on August 11 , 2009 , and their seventh , Major / Minor on September 20 , 2011 . The most recent albums feature a refined combination of the band 's different experiments and explorations . On May 27 , 2016 , Thrice released their ninth studio album , To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere . Ten days earlier , they released the album 's only current single , " black honey " . 
 Each album released by Thrice has had a portion of its sales proceeds donated to a new charitable organization . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = First Impressions and Identity Crisis ( 1998 – 2001 ) = = = 
 Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi knew each other from school and had played in a band called Chapter 11 . Teppei recruited his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass , who then brought his brother Riley on as a drummer . In 1998 , before their first show , they realized they needed a name . Hard @-@ pressed for time , they decided to go with the name ' Thrice ' out of desperation . Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members , and they were going to use it only temporarily for their first show . However , they began to gain fans with the name , and people started to associate them with it , so they were forced to keep it . 
 In 1999 , the band self @-@ released an EP titled First Impressions which was the product of a two @-@ day session at A @-@ Room Studios with Brian <unk> . Only 1 @,@ 000 copies were made and the band members sold them out of their cars . Working with Death by Stereo 's Paul Miner , the quartet recorded 12 tracks , and by April 2000 , the group had released Identity Crisis on <unk> Records . A portion of the album 's proceeds were donated to a local charity called <unk> Services for Children and Families . More support gigs and local buzz followed , and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless / Sub City 's Louis Posen . In 2001 , Posen signed with the band , reissued Identity Crisis , and sent the group out on tour with <unk> . Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed . 
 = = = The Illusion of Safety ( 2002 ) = = = 
 Thrice re @-@ entered the studio with producer Brian <unk> to record its Hopeless / Sub City debut , The Illusion of Safety . The album was released in February 2002 and the band toured extensively to support it , opening for Further Seems Forever and Face to Face before embarking on its first headlining tour later that year . The band again donated a portion of the album 's proceeds , this time choosing a non @-@ profit youth shelter in South Central Los Angeles , A Place Called Home . The band 's donations were matched by their label . 
 The album received generally positive reviews and garnered the attention of several major labels . The band eventually signed with Island Records , who had agreed to match Thrice 's charitable donations in the same manner that Hopeless / Sub City had . That fall , the band toured with Hot Water Music and Coheed and Cambria before returning to the studio . 
 = = = The Artist in the Ambulance ( 2003 – 2004 ) = = = 
 In 2003 , the band released its Island Records debut , The Artist in the Ambulance . The album 's title is in reference to Burn Collector by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band 's desire to do more than make music and contribute to society through their charitable donations . A portion of the album 's proceeds were this time donated to the <unk> Savio Endowment , a financial aid organization for breast cancer patients . First pressings of the album were packaged in a digipak @-@ style case with postcards containing lyrics and notes from the band . 
 The album spawned two singles , " All That 's Left " and " Stare at the Sun . " Both songs , and their accompanying videos , received modest airplay , with " Stare at the Sun " being featured in the video game SSX 3 , published through EA Sports BIG Electronic Arts , and the band found themselves playing at larger venues as the year progressed . A co @-@ headlining fall tour with labelmates Thursday and opener Coheed and Cambria sold out across the United States , as well as a stint on the Honda Civic Tour with Dashboard Confessional , The Get Up Kids , and Hot Water Music . The song " The Artist In The Ambulance " was featured in the video game Test Drive Eve Of Destruction . 
 Throughout 2004 , the band continued to tour in support of The Artist in the Ambulance . Island Records issued a promotional disc ( that features an alternate version of " The Artist in the Ambulance " ) in early 2004 that would become the basis for If We Could Only See Us Now , a CD / DVD package outlining the group 's career . Named after a lyric from " So Strange I Remember You , " the CD portion contained live tracks from a performance at the Apple Store and various B @-@ sides . A slot to promote the CD / DVD came on the 2004 Vans Warped Tour . 
 = = = Vheissu ( 2005 – 2006 ) = = = 
 Thrice spent much of the first half of 2005 working with producer Steve Osborne on the follow @-@ up to The Artist in the Ambulance . Thrice released Vheissu in October 2005 with " Image of the Invisible " as the first single . The album 's title was taken from the Thomas Pynchon novel V. , and featured a wider variety of instrumentation than used in the band 's previous albums , including the use of strings , electronics , and a Rhodes Piano . Many of the album 's lyrics also feature biblical , spiritual , and abstract themes . 
 For the band 's donations related to this album 's sales proceeds , Thrice chose novelist Dave Eggers 's charity 826 Valencia , a tutorial program for underprivileged children , which promotes literacy and aids teens in developing creative writing skills . In return , Eggers created the cover art for Vheissu . 
 The band toured extensively in support of the album , including headlining the 2006 Taste of Chaos tour and performing " Image of the Invisible " on Jimmy Kimmel Live ! . In April 2006 , the band released " Red Sky " as the second single from the album . The accompanying video was directed by Tim Hope , who had previously directed videos for Coldplay and Jimmy Eat World . Instead of releasing just a single , Thrice opted to release the Red Sky EP in support of the single , which included two previously unreleased tracks and four live tracks . 
 = = = The Alchemy Index ( 2006 – 2008 ) = = = 
 In September 2006 , the band announced plans for a new album ( later titled The Alchemy Index ) on their official website . The album was conceived as a series of 4 EPs , each of which represents an element of nature : fire , water , air , and earth . The band maintained a studio blog titled " Alchemy Index " throughout the recording process . 
 During the recording process , the band announced that they were leaving Island Records , citing a difference of opinion on the band 's future direction as the reason for the split . The band joined Vagrant Records on August 9 , 2007 . 
 On October 12 , 2007 , Thrice released the first two songs from the Alchemy Index in their entirety through the band 's MySpace page . The Alchemy Index Vols . I & II was released on October 16 , 2007 and sold 28 @,@ 000 copies in its first week . It debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200 chart , and it topped at number five on the iTunes top @-@ selling albums . To promote the new album , Thrice toured with the bands MewithoutYou and Brand New , and followed with a series of Canadian shows with bands Say Anything and Attack in Black . The second half of the project , The Alchemy Index Vols . III & IV - Earth & Air , was released on April 15 , 2008 . 
 The final song on each disc is written in the form of a sonnet , depicting the relationship of man with each of the particular elements . Each of these songs is in iambic pentameter , with a concluding rhyming couplet . These final couplets also contain the same vocal melody and chord progression as each other , although they are in different keys . 
 Thrice toured with Circa Survive and Pelican in Spring 2008 to support The Alchemy Index , which had now been released in full . The third @-@ to @-@ last show of this tour — the May 28 , 2008 show at the House of Blues in Anaheim — was filmed for a live CD / DVD titled Live at the House of Blues . The live album spans 2 CDs and a DVD with live footage and an exclusive interview in which the band answers fan @-@ submitted questions . In Fall 2008 , they embarked on a tour supporting Rise Against , along with Alkaline Trio and The Gaslight Anthem . 
 = = = Beggars ( 2009 – 2010 ) = = = 
 On January 4 , 2009 , the band announced on its website that writing had begun for the follow @-@ up to The Alchemy Index , with the title announced as Beggars on June 15 , 2009 . A July update to the band 's website revealed the release date to be October 13 , 2009 . However , after the album was leaked several months in advance , the band announced on their website on July 23 , 2009 that the album would be released exclusively to iTunes on August 11 . The physical CD was released on September 15 , 2009 . Bonus content included two b @-@ sides from the Beggars sessions , two remixes , and a studio rendition of their cover of The Beatles ' " Helter Skelter " . 
 Feeling that the band 's previous two projects ( The Alchemy Index and Vheissu ) had a " sleepy feeling " to them , Thrice wanted to make a record that was " a little more upbeat and energetic . " Thrice 's members also hoped to save money and spend more time with their families by building a recording studio in guitarist Teppei Teranishi 's home . Originally , the band expressed interest in tracking the record live ( i.e. recording the full band all at once , instead of each instrument individually and mixing together at a later time ) in the home studio ; however Thrice later abandoned the idea of recording this way . Instead , the band recorded songs with " similar vibe [ s ] musically , and tonally " in the same session . Several wooden devices were constructed by the band for the home studio to make the recordings " sound better . " The self @-@ produced album was released through Vagrant Records . 
 Thrice played The Bamboozle Left festival in April , and played selected dates on the summer 's Warped Tour . Throughout the Warped Tour shows , Thrice played " All the World is Mad , " " At the Last " and " The Weight . " 
 The song " All the World is Mad " is featured in the Vagrant Song Pack for Guitar Hero , which was released on July 23 , 2009 . " Deadbolt " appears on Guitar Hero 5 . 
 On July 29 , Brand New announced that Thrice would be playing on select dates of their Fall North American tour . Multiple shows were sold out , and the band notably performed a cover of The Beatles 's " Helter Skelter " . After this leg of the tour , Thrice began a tour with The Dear Hunter , but they had to play without guitarist Teppei Teranishi who left due to a family emergency . 
 In 2009 , while on the Vans Warped Tour in Houston , TX , the band autographed a Gibson Guitar for the non @-@ profit Music Saves Lives and assisted in their goal of raising the nation 's blood supply . 
 Thrice posted a poll for fans to vote for which song from Beggars to use for a music video . " All the World is Mad " , " The Weight " , " Circles " and " In Exile " were the choices for the poll , with " In Exile " narrowly beating " The Weight " even after some voters hacked into the system to try to choose the winner . The live @-@ themed , black and white music video premiered on MySpace Music on Thanksgiving Day , November 26 , 2009 , their first live video since 2002 's " Deadbolt . " 
 Thrice 's Spring ( 2010 ) tour with Manchester Orchestra was unfortunately cut short on April 23 when Dustin Kensrue had to leave because of an illness in the family . 
 = = = Major / Minor and hiatus ( 2011 – 2012 ) = = = 
 In an interview with Blare Magazine on June 16 , 2010 , Kensrue revealed that each member had been writing music for a new Thrice album individually , and that " pretty soon " the band would enter the studio to write and record the album collectively . 
 On April 20 , 2011 Thrice announced on their website that their next album was ready to go and studio bound . The album was recorded in May 2011 at Red Bull Studios , with most of the parts being recorded there and the band adding overdubs and " tweaking " a few things in Teppei 's home recording studio ( New Grass Studios ) in the days after recording at Red Bull Studios . 
 The new album , titled Major / Minor , was released on September 20 , 2011 through Vagrant Records . 
 Following Thrice 's spring 2012 tour , the band went on hiatus . In the group 's public statement , Kensrue stated that " Thrice is not breaking up , " but that the band would be " taking a break from being a full @-@ time band . " 
 Thrice , accompanied by Animals as Leaders and O <unk> , began their farewell tour on May 4 , 2012 in San Diego and ended it with a 33 @-@ song solo show on June 19 , 2012 in Santa Ana . The tour 's setlist song pool was determined by a fan vote on their entire song catalog ( excluding First Impressions ) . Thrice 's second live album , Anthology , was released on October 30 , 2012 on two CDs and as a quadruple 180 gram LP box set limited to 3000 copies , and features 24 songs recorded at select shows along the tour . 
 Thrice 's last interview aired on June 18 , 2012 just one day after the band wrapped up their farewell tour . JC from <unk> Radio spoke with Eddie and Teppei .

 Banksiamyces is a genus of fungi in the order Helotiales , with a tentative placement in the family Helotiaceae . The genus contains four species , which grow on the seed follicles of the dead infructescences or " cones " of various species of Banksia , a genus in the plant family Proteaceae endemic to Australia . Fruit bodies of the fungus appear as small ( typically less than 10 mm diameter ) , shallow dark cups on the follicles of the Banksia fruit . The edges of dry fruit bodies fold inwards , appearing like narrow slits . The first specimens of Banksiamyces , known then as Tympanis toomansis , were described in 1887 . Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for almost 100 years before becoming examined more critically in the early 1980s , leading to the creation of a new genus to contain what was determined to be three distinct species , B. katerinae , B. macrocarpus , and B. toomansis . A fourth species , B. maccannii , was added in 1984 .

 In 1887 , English mycologists Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome described a species of fungus they named Tympanis toomansis , collected from dead infructescences ( " cones " ) of Banksia growing on the banks of the <unk> River in southern New South Wales , Australia . Its generic placement was a result of its resemblance to Tympanis , a genus in the family Helotiaceae of the Ascomycota . 
 Additional collections , then still believed to be T. toomansis , were made from South Australia in 1952 , again on dead cones of unspecified Banksia , and also in 1956 on dead cones of Banksia marginata . In 1957 and 1958 , R. W. G. Dennis redescribed the species , and after consultation with Canadian mycologist James Walton Groves , who had earlier completed a monograph on the genus Tympanis , transferred the taxon to the genus Encoelia ( family <unk> ) . Encoelia species are small , tough , brownish discomycetes that typically grow in clusters on hardwood or woody substrates . Because the original collections were incomplete and certain microscopic features inadequately described , various collections made from Australia were presumed to be variations of the original 1887 collection . 
 In the 1980s , the availability of fresh specimens of the fungus — collected by Australian mycologist Bruce A. Fuhrer from the cones of Banksia spinulosa — prompted Gordon Beaton and Gretna Weste to reexamine the previous collections . Various apparent and microscopic differences were found which suggested that three distinct species were represented in the collections , and further , the species differed enough from other Encoelia species to warrant the creation of a new genus , which Beaton and Weste named Banksiamyces . The three Banksiamyces species they described in 1982 were the original B. toomansis ( those initially named T. toomansis ) , as well as B. macrocarpus and B. katerinae . A fourth species , B. maccannii , was added to the genus by the same authors in 1984 . A 2006 study identified two additional taxa that did not quite meet the description for previously published species ; these have been called Banksiamyces aff. macrocarpus and Banksiamyces aff. toomansis . Some existing species were found on other banksia species , so evidence strengthened that the individual Banksiamyces fungi did not exclusively parasitize only one banksia species , a suggestion proposed by Beaton and Weste in 1982 . 
 Banksiamyces is classified in the Helotiaceae , a widespread but poorly known family of fungi , many species of which are saprobic on herbaceous or woody tissues . The placement in the Helotiaceae is tentative , and no molecular analysis has yet been performed that might clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Banksiamyces to other taxa in the Helotiales order . Based on physical similarity , Wen @-@ Ying Zhuang included Banksiamyces under Encoelia in his 1998 study of the <unk> subfamily of the Helotiaceae . He conceded , however , that he had not examined any specimens . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies , or apothecia , of Banksiamyces species are cup @-@ shaped receptacles borne on a stipe ( stalk ) , colored dark brown to black with a dark grey center . When dry , the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder . The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards ( especially when dry ) , or be twisted and somewhat flattened . Both the outermost tissue layer ( the ectal excipulum ) and the tissue of the stalk are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously <unk> or thin @-@ walled , covered with small particles ( granules ) , and spherical to ellipsoid . The middle tissue layer ( the medullary excipulum ) of both the cup and the internal tissue layer ( the medulla ) of the stalk contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum . A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous ; this layer may be present in either the medullary excipulum , the medulla , or both . 
 The asci are elongated reproductive structures that bear ascospores , in groups of eight . Banksiamyces species have asci that are cylindrical to club @-@ shaped , and contain a plug at their extreme tips that will absorb color when stained with iodine . The ascospores may be arranged in one or two rows ( <unk> and <unk> , respectively ) , or rarely , irregular . The ascospores are ellipsoid , translucent , have a slight curve and may be tapered ; most ascospores contain two oil drops . When in the ascus , the ascospores are covered with a translucent mucilage that is highly refractive to light . Paraphyses are filamentous hyphal cells present in the fertile spore @-@ bearing tissue , distributed amongst the asci . The free ends of the paraphyses fork and branch , combining with the tips of the asci to form a translucent to brown pigmented layer of tissue .

 B. katerinae is named after G. Beaton 's wife , the senior author of the 1982 <unk> . It was first discovered in 1964 , growing on the seed follicles of dead cones of Banksia ornata in the Mount Zero Area in the Grampians in northwestern Victoria . 
 B. maccannii , first described in 1984 , was found on dead Banksia saxicola cones . The specific epithet was chosen to honor Ian McCann , for his " discovery of the type collection and ... his years of ecological , educational and conservation work in the Victorian Grampians . " The fungus is distinguished from the other Banksiamyces species by its larger asci , larger spores , and tapering paraphyses tips . Further , the type collection was found fruiting in December and January , compared to winter and autumn for other Banksiamyces . 
 B. macrocarpus grows on the dead cones of Banksia spinulosa , and was first collected near <unk> , Victoria in 1981 . It is the type species of Banksiamyces . 
 B. toomansis is the species originally described and illustrated by Berkeley and Broome . The type collection was found on a cone of Banksia marginata on the banks of the <unk> River of New South Wales . It has also been recovered from a cone of Banksia sphaerocarpa from near Busselton in Western Australia , B. nutans , B. pulchella , B. speciosa , and B. occidentalis , all from Mount Merivale , 20 km ( 12 mi ) east of Esperance , B. baxteri cultivated at Cranbourne Botanic Gardens , B. integrifolia from the Blue Mountains , and B. marginata from Kangaroo Island . Synonyms include Tympanis toomansis Berk . & Br . , and Encoelia toomansis ( Berk . & Br . ) . Its ascospores can range in shape from elliptical to cylindrical , and have dimensions of 6 – 10 by 2 @.@ 5 – 3 µm . 
 = Who 's That Girl World Tour = 
 Who 's That Girl World Tour was the second concert tour by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna . The tour supported her third studio album , True Blue ( 1986 ) , as well as the soundtrack Who 's That Girl ( 1987 ) . It was Madonna 's first world tour , reaching Asia , North America and Europe . Madonna 's 1987 film Who 's That Girl was a box office failure , but its soundtrack proved to be a commercial success . Warner Bros. felt that they could <unk> on Madonna 's success further and they sent her on a world tour . Musically and technically superior to her previous Virgin Tour , the Who 's That Girl Tour incorporated multimedia components to make the show more appealing . 
 Madonna trained herself physically with aerobics , jogging and weight @-@ lifting , to cope with the choreography and the dance routines . For the costumes , she collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart , expanding on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage , reworking scenes from videos such as " True Blue " , " Open Your Heart " , " Papa Don 't Preach " and " La Isla Bonita " . The stage was huge , with four video screens , multimedia projectors and a flight of stairs in the middle . Patrick Leonard , who was the music director , encouraged Madonna to go with the idea of rearranging her older songs and presenting them in a new format . The title Who 's That Girl came to Madonna 's mind when during rehearsals one @-@ day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself , projected on a screen on the stage . 
 The show consisted of seven costume changes , with song @-@ and @-@ dance routines , theatrics , addressing social causes — during " Papa Don 't Preach " — as well as an encore , consisting of " La Isla Bonita " , the Who 's That Girl film title song and " Holiday " . The tour was critically appreciated , who commented on the extravagant nature of the concert and complimented Madonna for her dancing , costume changes and dynamic pacing . Who 's That Girl was a commercial success , grossing in total of US $ 25 million ( $ 52 @.@ 07 million in 2016 dollars ) by playing in front of 1 @.@ 5 million audience . According to Pollstar , it was the second top female concert tour of 1987 , behind Tina Turner 's Break Every Rule Tour . 
 Who 's That Girl was broadcast in a number of international television channels and was released in VHS titled Ciao Italia : Live from Italy . Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli commented that " Many female artists behave like a diva for a period when they reach superstar status , and the ' Who 's That Girl ? ' tour marked the beginning of Madonna 's . " It is also noted for giving rise to the term " new Madonna " , a stronger and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to the term Madonna wannabe . A statue of Madonna , wearing conical bra was elected in her name , at the center of the town of Pacentro in Italy , where her ancestors used to live .

 Madonna 's 1987 film Who 's That Girl was a box office failure , reason being Madonna trying to do many different things together in the film . According to Taraborrelli , Madonna appropriated a Judy Holliday voice , along with Marilyn Monroe 's hair and make @-@ up for the film , which — according to critics — was somehow designed for actress Carole Lombard , and hence it failed . However , the soundtrack of the film proved to be a big success . The album consisted of four Madonna songs , along with tracks by obscure Warner Bros. Records ' acts like Club Nouveau , Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson . Three of Madonna 's songs were released as singles , namely : " Who 's That Girl " , " Causing a Commotion " and " The Look of Love " , all of them were successful . 
 The album , released before the film , sold a million copies in the United States , and five million worldwide . Taraborrelli felt that at that moment , riding on Madonna 's coattails proved profitable for everyone involved , including Warner Bros. Records , which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists . But still they wanted to " milk @-@ in " the success of Madonna , a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters , executive producers of the film . Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do , since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film , as well as Madonna 's successful third studio album True Blue , released the year before . As Madonna 's first world tour , Who 's That Girl ended up being a resounding success , although by its end , Madonna declared that she did not want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one . " I returned feeling so burned out and I was convinced that I wouldn 't go near music for quite a while " , she said . 
 = = Development = = 
 The Who 's That Girl World Tour was musically and technically superior to Madonna 's Virgin Tour , because she incorporated multimedia components to make the show more compelling . As the tour was confirmed , Madonna and her team started planning for it . Madonna wanted a show which consisted of theatrics , drama , dance and choreography in " full @-@ force " . Her publicist Liz Rosenberg commented , " She wants a visual impact that would knock people out . She was very determined about this . And she 's the type that makes decisions quickly ; If something doesn 't work , she starts over . You 'll see a different look this year , but it 's still Madonna , still bigger than life . " In order to engage herself completely and handle the grueling dance routines , she started attending aerobics classes at Hollywood health centre The Sports Connection . By the time the tour drew nearer , she hired a personal trainer , and her daily routine involved jogging , weight @-@ lifting , dancing , gymnastics , trampoline , swimming and cycling . She started eating vegetarian food with plenty of protein and carbohydrate and avoided the sun . British funk band Level 42 was the supporting act of the tour . Madonna 's image was that of a blond girl with soft curls , making a striking contrast with the firm , almost hard lines of her eye make @-@ up and lipstick ; the idea of her friend actress Debi Mazar . 
 For the costumes , Madonna collaborated with designer Marlene Stewart . She expanded on the idea of bringing her popular video characters to life onstage , reworking scenes from " True Blue " , " Open Your Heart " , " Papa Don 't Preach " and " La Isla Bonita " . For " Open Your Heart " , Madonna reused the Stewart designed black bustier worn by her in the video , complete with tassels , golden tips and ribbing with fishnets on leg . Stewart 's other designs included a Spanish style dress for " La Isla Bonita " and a gold lamé jacket for the " White Heat " sequence . The last dress of the show was visually amusing and , according to Madonna , was for " anyone that takes me too seriously , or imagined and I take myself too seriously . " Inspired by Dame Edna Everage , the dress consisted of a hat strewn with fake fruits , flowers and feathers , jeweled batwing spectacles with heavy , black frames , a ruffled skirt and a bodice covered with objects such as watches and dolls and fishnets . The knickers were inscribed with the word " Kiss " . Continuing her tradition of message clothes , she spelt out the phrase " You Can Dance " on her jacket , using the letter U , a can of soup and the word " dance " at the back . 
 Calling the show a " theatrical multimedia spectacular " , Madonna wanted a huge stage with a central platform from which a flight of stairs descended . The central platform was flanked by two lower platforms , which housed the band and the musicians . A large video screen was suspended above the stairs , which descended during the show . Two projectors were situated at the front of the stage , which projected images of The Pope and President Ronald Reagan during the show . Patrick Leonard , who had produced True Blue , joined as the musical director for the shows . Instead of following every note on the records , Leonard encouraged the musicians to come up with new ideas for the songs . Hence a number of the old songs were rearranged , including introducing a medley of " Dress You Up " , " Material Girl " and " Like a Virgin " — which contained a sample from the Four Tops song " I Can 't Help Myself ( Sugar Pie Honey Bunch ) " . American choreographer Shabba Doo was signed to choreograph the show . 13 @-@ year @-@ old Christopher Finch was signed to play the part of the small boy from the " Open Your Heart " video , since Felix Howard , who played the original part , did not get a working license , and hence could not join the tour . Madonna wanted three backup singers , a team of male dancers and a succession of costume changes . She took inputs from her then husband , actor Sean Penn saying , " I really respect Sean 's opinion . He has great taste and is a very brilliant man . When I was putting my tour together , it was always in the back of my mind : ' I wonder what Sean will think of this ? ' He 's extremely opinionated and has really high standards , and that sometimes pushed me into making decisions I wouldn 't have otherwise made . " The title " Who 's That Girl Tour " came to Madonna 's mind during rehearsals one @-@ day when she looked at a gigantic image of herself , projected on a screen on the stage . She commented , 
 " Oh god , what have I done ? What have I created ? Is that me , or is this me , this small person standing down here on the stage ? That 's why I call the tour ' Who 's That Girl ? ' ; because I play a lot of characters , and every time I do a video or a song , people go , ' Oh , that 's what she 's like . ' And I 'm not like any of them . I 'm all of them . I 'm none of them . You know what I mean . ? "

 The show started with a performance by Level 42 . As their performance ended , the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage , looking for Madonna . He is followed by two other dancers , who jump around the stage and disappear . Then Madonna 's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it . She performs dance moves behind the screen , which starts going up slowly . She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of " Open Your Heart " . After dancing on the stairs , using a chair as a prop , Madonna descends and starts singing the song . Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends . This was followed by the performance of " Lucky Star " during which a disco ball spun above the stage ; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it , the light from the ball flickered on them like a star . For " True Blue " , Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue , silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom . The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video . Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends . At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance . During " Papa Don 't Preach " Madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around the stage while singing . The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then @-@ President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan , along with scenes of John Perry III 's short film , The Nightmare , ending with the words " Safe Sex " , as Madonna finished the song . She dedicated the song to the Pope , marking her first conflict with the Vatican , as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts . 
 During " White Heat " — which featured dialogues from the 1949 James Cagney film of the same name — a video screen displayed a scene from the film , with Cagney saying the dialogue : " A copper ... a copper fellas " . The video screen moves up and Madonna appears , wearing a lamé jacket and holding a plastic gun in her right hand . A large cut out of Cagney appears in the middle and Madonna finishes singing the song , while pointing the revolver towards her dancers and pretending to fire at them , as sounds of gunshots are heard . She followed it with " Causing a Commotion " which ended with Madonna pointing to her dancers and musicians across stage and uttering the line " He / She 's got the moves baby " numerous times . For " The Look of Love " the spotlight was focused on her . The introductory music of the song started and Madonna roamed around the stage , pretending that she was lost . She wanted to portray her Who 's That Girl film character Nikki , when she was lost in a similar sequence in the film . After she finished singing the song , Madonna pretended to walk forward by pushing through the air , as the conveyor belt took her backwards , ultimately taking her away from the stage . Then a red phone booth appears on the stage , in which Madonna 's silhouette appears to be changing costume . She emerges from the booth wearing the Edna Everage inspired costume and starts singing " Dress You Up " . Then she sang " Material Girl " , while stretching her legs on stage and showing her underwear and followed by " Like a Virgin " , during which she took off her outfit piece by piece , until she was standing in the same outfit from the beginning of the show , and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom . 
 A backdrop then started showing the newspaper reports on Madonna 's 1985 Playboy nude picture release . The backdrop moves up as Madonna appears , wearing a loose @-@ fitted black pant and top , with bejeweled glasses , for singing " Where 's the Party " . For " Into the Groove " Finch joins her on stage to dance alongside . Madonna then wore a pink bolero jacket which had the can of soup and the words " U " and " DANCE " flanking it . At the end she is joined by her backup singers and dancers . Together they take a bow to the audience and finish the performance . Next Madonna sang " La Isla Bonita " as a part of the encore , wearing the same red flamenco dress she had worn in the video . For " Who 's That Girl " , Madonna — flanked by Finch and a male dancer — strutted around the stage , asking the audience to join her on the chorus . Lastly , Madonna performed an energetic version of " Holiday " , signaling the celebratory and wholesome nature of the song 's theme . The song featured a new arrangement , with a guitar solo in the intermediate portion added by Leonard . She sang the final chorus twice , then asked the audience for a comb so that she could fix her hair and finished the performance , after taking a bow with her dancers to the audience . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Biographer Taraborrelli commented , " Madonna had more confidence in her stage presence , her music was showing a deeper maturity , her voice was fuller , and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers . J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented , " I 've seen the Springsteen stadium tour , I 've seen Dylan and the [ Grateful ] Dead , and I was at Live Aid . Out of all those shows , Madonna 's is the only one I want to see again . You need a larger @-@ than @-@ life show if you want to come off in a stadium , and Madonna does . She 's not that large physically , but she holds your attention . " Ann Ayers , assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient . " Madonna 's going for a certain kind of show : a Broadway , show @-@ biz , song @-@ and @-@ dance spectacle . In that context it 's hard to make a connection with the audience , and I 'd have to say that she didn 't . " Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said , " Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life , like her film , but she ain 't lost when she is singing . Especially during songs like ' Papa Don 't Preach ' , her vocal prowess was substantially notable . " Scott A <unk> and Elizabeth Snead , writing for Chicago Tribune , felt that " For the most part , the premiere concert on Madonna 's Who 's That Girl tour was a success , an extravaganza of multiple videos , flashing lights and precision dancing . If the high @-@ tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer , one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States . [ ... ] As a dancer , Madonna is supreme on stage . Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics . One minute she was stage left , another minute stage right . She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back @-@ up singers , then <unk> down to the stage floor , swinging her hips , accompanied by other dancers . " 
 Deborah Wilker from The Day commented that " Madonna 's got an almost rabid energy about her , which she maintains for the duration of 90 minutes . In fact she rarely leaves the stage — preferring to change costumes in a phone booth instead . Boy can she change . One minute she 's a 50 's teenager in a party dress , next she 's playing a speak @-@ easy chanteuse . It 's almost difficult to believe that a career as young as Madonna 's could contain so much popular material that on stage the star can barely get to half of it . " Don McLeese from Chicago Sun @-@ Times reviewed the performance at Soldier Field stadium said that " ' Shine ' seems like a dim possibility for her Soldier Field performance this month , because Madonna invariably takes the stage after dusk has turned to dark and brings back the sun again for the two hours that she played . " In another review , McCleese commented : " [ Madonna ] proceeded to show Soldier Field a few moves that would gain Walter Payton some yardage , while putting a whole new twist on the term ' backfield in motion ' . The girl really knows how to cause a commotion . " Richard Harrington from The Washington Post felt that the tour " would have played better to a full house at the Capital Centre or Merriweather Post Pavilion . But to her credit , Madonna performed last night as if the house was full , and the show is splendid pop theater . Madonna has described it as ' Broadway in a stadium ' , and with her nonstop dancing , costume changes , mini @-@ dramas and dynamic pacing , it is sort of a ' Liza With an M. ' " Jon Pareles from The New York Times reviewed the concert at Madison Square Garden in New York and felt that " For all its effort and professionalism , the concert wasn 't exactly moving ; Madonna had to ask the audience to get up and dance twice . But as shallow , kitschy , pop entertainment — no big messages , no revelations , familiar sounds and images , plenty of catchy tunes — the show was easy to enjoy . [ ... ] The tunes stick to her limited vocal range and usually use short phrases — the better to keep her from running out of breath as she dances across the stage . And her band knocked the songs out with solid precision , recreating the gleaming sound of her records .

 The concert at Korakuen Stadium , Tokyo was broadcast on June 22 , 1987 in Japan only . It was later released on VHS and Laserdisc as Who 's That Girl : Live In Japan . It was the first television broadcast using Dolby Surround Sound and was promoted by Mitsubishi , as Madonna had previously starred in television commercials for their video recorders . On September 4 , 1987 , Madonna 's concert special , Madonna in Concerto , filmed at the Comunale Stadium in Turin , Italy was broadcast live on TV in Italy ( RAI ) , France ( TF1 ) , Germany ( <unk> ) , Austria ( ORF ) and Spain ( TVE ) . Other countries including Australia and The Netherlands broadcast this show in 1987 . The concert was released commercially in 1988 as Ciao Italia : Live from Italy and was later available on Laserdisc and DVD . The video contains the full Who 's That Girl show , produced using footage from three different shows : Tokyo June 22 , 1987 , Turin September 4 , 1987 , and Florence September 6 , 1987 . Heather Phares from Allmusic said : " Madonna 's Ciao Italia : Live from Italy captures a performance from her 1988 world tour and features hits like ' Lucky Star ' , ' True Blue ' , ' La Isla Bonita ' , ' Like a Virgin ' , and ' Material Girl ' .

Ciao Italia also charted at number three on the Finnish DVD chart in 2009 .

 According to Taraborrelli , " Many female artists behave like a diva for a period when they reach superstar status , and the ' Who 's That Girl ? ' tour marked the beginning of Madonna 's . " For instance , she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her ; they had to talk to her representatives , lest they distract her from the business at hand . She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her . Moreover , when coming on and off the stage , Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of " those who couldn 't help but stare " . DeMann commented : " She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention " , to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was . " You don 't behave like a bitch until you are that successful . The tour sure helped cement her star status " , he commented . 
 The tour was also notable for giving rise to the term " new Madonna " , a stronger and more intelligent sexual image of her former self which had given rise to the term Madonna wannabe . Considine felt that " the important thing Madonna did on the tour was to demonstrate how female sexuality can be a source of strength . Traditionally in pop culture , there are two roles that a woman can play — the good girl and the bad girl , and the bad girl is never taken seriously . But Madonna shows up the trappings of a bad girl , and demanded to be taken up seriously because she just doesn 't roll over . I got more sense of the strength and power that was under her image all along . " Another important fact noted in the tour by scholars is the extensive use of multimedia technique to its maximum potential . Says Mark Bego , author of Madonna : Blonde Ambition , that " Madonna transformed the concept of a concert tour being focused on the songs . She turned her Who 's That Girl ? tour into a ubiquitous multimedia blitz technique by including songs , dancing , choreography , videos , big screens , backdrops — not to mention the subtle preaching and messages — that made singing a secondary quality for concert goers . Evident from the people that thronged to see the tour , they were there for the spectacle — and not see Madonna standing in front of the microphone and singing . 
 While in Italy , Madonna met some of her relatives from Pacentro , the village in which her grandfather and grandmother , Gaetano and <unk> Ciccone had been married . However , it was not the glorious home coming that she had expected ; some of her relatives made it very clear that they were scandalized by her appearance and behavior . One good thing came from the visit , there were talks of making her an honorary citizen of the town . Ultimately , a statue of Madonna , wearing conical bra was elected in her name , at the center of the town . The Vatican was outraged by the plans of erecting the statue , with the Pope 's spokesperson commenting : " The statue would be too sexy and might corrupt the morals of Italy 's fine young people .

Kriegsmarine ) but was sold to Germany , along with the others in her class , in November 1914 . Under German control , the class became known as the U 66 type and the boats were renumbered ; U @-@ 9 became U @-@ 68 , and was redesigned and reconstructed to German specifications . She was launched in June 1915 and commissioned in August . 
 Six days into her first war patrol , on 22 March 1916 , U @-@ 68 was sunk by Farnborough , a British Q @-@ ship , with all hands . U @-@ 68 sank no ships in her brief career . A post @-@ war German study found fault with U @-@ 68 's captain for not following established procedures for avoiding decoy ships .

 After the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy had competitively evaluated three foreign submarine designs , it selected the Germaniawerft 506d design , also known as the Type UD , for its new U @-@ 7 class of five submarines . The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913 . 
 The U @-@ 7 class was seen by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its U @-@ 3 class , which was also a Germaniawerft design . As designed for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , the boats were to displace 695 tonnes ( 684 long tons ) on the surface and 885 tonnes ( 871 long tons ) while submerged . The doubled @-@ hulled boats were to be 69 @.@ 50 metres ( 228 ft ) long overall with a beam of 6 @.@ 30 metres ( 20 @.@ 7 ft ) and a draft of 3 @.@ 79 metres ( 12 @.@ 4 ft ) . The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin diesel engines ( 2 @,@ 300 metric horsepower ( 2 @,@ 269 bhp ; 1 @,@ 692 kW ) total ) for surface running at up to 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) , and twin electric motors ( 1 @,@ 240 PS ( 1 @,@ 220 shp ; 910 kW ) total ) for a maximum of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) when submerged . The boats were designed with five 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes ; four located in the bow , one in the stern . The boats ' armament was to also include a single 6 @.@ 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) L / 26 deck gun . 
 U @-@ 9 was laid down on 31 December 1913 , the third of the U @-@ 7 boats . Her construction was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months . Neither U @-@ 9 nor any of her sister boats were complete when World War I began in August 1914 . With the boats under construction at Kiel , the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery of the boats , which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar , a British territory . As a result , U @-@ 9 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 . 
 U @-@ 9 was renumbered by the Germans as U @-@ 68 when her class was redesignated as the Type U 66 . The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards , which increased the surface displacement by 96 tonnes ( 94 long tons ) and the submerged by 48 tonnes ( 47 long tons ) . The torpedo load was increased by a third , from 9 to 12 , and the deck gun was upgraded from the 6 @.@ 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) gun originally specified to an 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) one .

 U @-@ 68 was launched on 1 June 1915 . On 17 August , SM U @-@ 68 was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy under the command of Kapitänleutnant Ludwig Güntzel , a new submarine commander . On 29 November , U @-@ 68 was assigned to the IV . U @-@ Halbflotille . 
 U @-@ 68 departed the Ems on 16 March 1916 to begin her first war patrol . Headed to her assigned operating area off Britain 's west coast , Güntzel and U @-@ 68 came across Farnborough , a British Q @-@ ship — in appearance unarmed — under the command of Gordon Campbell . At approximately 07 : 00 , U @-@ 68 fired a torpedo at Farnborough and narrowly missed the ship 's bow . Farnborough continued the deception and continued on at her same speed and course . At 07 : 20 , U @-@ 68 surfaced about 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) astern of Farnborough , moved to the ship 's port quarter , and fired a shot across the Q @-@ ship 's bow . 
 Farnborough stopped , blew off steam , and launched a boat to simulate a surrender . As U @-@ 68 closed to 800 yards ( 730 m ) , Farnborough raised the White Ensign , uncovered her guns and opened fire with three of her five 12 pounder ( 76 mm ) guns . The British gunners scored several hits on the U @-@ boat out of 21 rapidly fired rounds . As U @-@ 68 began to sink , Campbell steered Farnborough over U @-@ 68 's location and dropped a depth charge that blew the bow of the submarine out of the water . As U @-@ 68 began going down by the stern , Farnborough 's gunners scored another five hits on the U @-@ boat 's conning tower . U @-@ 68 sank with the loss of all 38 men at position 51 ° 54 ′ N 10 ° 53 ′ W off Dingle in southern Ireland . U @-@ 68 sank no ships during her brief service career . 
 A post @-@ war German study faulted U @-@ 68 's commander , Kptlt . Güntzel , for failing to follow established procedures for dealing with neutral @-@ flagged vessels in order to avoid decoy ships like Farnborough . According to the report , Güntzel had broken almost all the rules when approaching Farnborough . However , Kommodore Hermann Bauer , the commander of the German High Seas Fleet U @-@ boats , in his post @-@ war memoirs , reports Güntzel was an inexperienced captain and had not , contrary to usual practice , been first sent to sea under a more experienced U @-@ boat captain to gain knowledge . 
 = The Boat Race 1829 = 
 The 1st Boat Race took place at Henley @-@ on @-@ Thames on 10 June 1829 . The race came about following a challenge laid down to the University of Oxford by University of Cambridge " to row a match at or near London , each in an eight @-@ oared boat during the ensuing Easter vacation " . Oxford wore dark blue jerseys while Cambridge wore " white with pink waistbands " . In front of a crowd estimated to be around 20 @,@ 000 , and according to the official record , Oxford won the race " easily " in a time of 14 minutes 30 seconds . The Boat Race became an annual fixture , and as of 2015 , has been contested 161 times . 
 = = Background = = 
 <unk> eight rowing had been popular at the University of Oxford for a number of years before a club was established at the University of Cambridge around 1827 . At a meeting of the Cambridge University Boat Club in February 1829 , it was decided to challenge Oxford " to row a match at or near London , each in an eight @-@ oared boat during the ensuing Easter vacation " . The race was deferred to the summer , as rowing did not start at Oxford until after Easter , and scheduled for 10 June 1829 for a prize of 500 guineas . During the pre @-@ race betting , Cambridge were the favourites to win the race . 
 Oxford wore a dark blue check outfit for the race , while Cambridge wore white with pink waistbands . The two boats were said to be " very handsome , and wrought in a superior style of workmanship " by The Morning Post ; Oxford 's green boat was built by Stephen Davies and Isaac King of Oxford , and was slightly the shorter , measuring 44 feet ( 13 m ) . Cambridge 's pink boat was 18 inches ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) longer , and built by Searle of Westminster . The umpires for the race were Mr. Cyril Page ( for Oxford ) and Mr John Stuart <unk> ( for Cambridge ) . Should the umpires disagree about any aspect of the race , they had recourse to consult the referee , whose name was not recorded .

 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11 st 1 @.@ 75 lb ( 70 @.@ 5 kg ) ; as the records for the Oxford crew are incomplete , no average weight can be calculated . 
 = = Race = = 
 The course for the race was a 2 @.@ 25 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 62 km ) stretch of the River Thames between Hambleden Lock and Henley Bridge . Cambridge won the toss and elected to start on the Berkshire side of the river , handing the Buckinghamshire side to Oxford . According to the author William Fisher MacMichael , " it was as fine a day as our climate allows a June day to be . " The race had originally been scheduled to start at 6 : 00 p.m. but this was altered to 7 : 00 p.m. and was further delayed . Upon the start of the race , by which time around 20 @,@ 000 people were reckoned to be in attendance to watch , the Oxford boat was steered close to the Cambridge boat , forcing it to row close to the shore . This drew complaints from the Cambridge crew , who insisted that the race be restarted . The Oxford crew relented , and the race began for the second time at 7 : 55 p.m. In the early stages of the race , the two crews were evenly matched , but after they passed an island in the river , Oxford drew ahead . 
 Once they had passed the island , and were in the main flow of the river , the Oxford crew demonstrated their strength . The Morning Post report of the race records that both crews " put out the strength of their arms in excellent style " , and although the Cambridge boat maintained a higher stroke rate , Oxford maintained their lead throughout the rest of the race . Their margin of victory is variously reported as being between two and four lengths ( although is recorded officially as " easily " ) , in a time reported variously between 14 minutes and 14 minutes 30 seconds .

 The event , subsequently referred to as The Boat Race , or the University Boat Race , was held for a second time seven years later , in 1836 on the River Thames . It was then held intermittently until the 1856 race after which it became an annual event , interrupted only by the First and Second World Wars . As of 2016 , 162 Boat Races have been contested ; Cambridge lead overall with 82 victories to Oxford 's 79 , excluding the one " dead heat " recorded in the 1877 race . 
 = SMS Kaiser ( 1874 ) = 
 SMS Kaiser was the lead ship of the Kaiser @-@ class ironclads ; SMS Deutschland was her sister ship . Named for the title " Kaiser " ( German : Emperor ) , held by the leader of the then newly created German Empire , the ship was laid down in the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London in 1871 . The ship was launched in March 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet in February 1875 . Kaiser mounted a main battery of eight 26 cm ( 10 in ) guns in a central battery amidships . 
 Kaiser served with the fleet from her commissioning until 1896 , though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career . The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted with the exception of the mid @-@ 1880s , when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels . She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean , often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits . Kaiser was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an armored cruiser , though she was too slow to perform satisfactorily in this role . Nevertheless , she spent several years as the flagship of the East Asia Squadron before returning to Germany in 1899 . She was used in secondary roles after 1904 , until after the end of World War I in 1919 , when she was broken up for scrap . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Kaiser was ordered by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London , UK ; her keel was laid in 1871 . Kaiser and her sister Deutschland were ordered shortly after the end of the Franco @-@ Prussian War , under the assumption that the French would quickly attempt a war of revenge . The ship was launched on 19 March 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 13 February 1875 . Kaiser cost the German government 8 @,@ 226 @,@ 000 gold marks . 
 The ship was 89 @.@ 34 meters ( 293 @.@ 1 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 19 @.@ 10 m ( 62 @.@ 7 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 39 m ( 24 @.@ 2 ft ) forward . Kaiser was powered by one 2 @-@ cylinder single expansion engine , which was supplied with steam by eight coal @-@ fired trunk boilers . The ship 's top speed was 14 @.@ 6 knots ( 27 @.@ 0 km / h ; 16 @.@ 8 mph ) , at 5 @,@ 779 indicated horsepower ( 4 @,@ 309 kW ) . She was also equipped with a full ship rig . Her standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 568 enlisted men . 
 She was armed with eight 26 cm ( 10 in ) L / 20 guns mounted in a central battery amidships . As built , the ship was also equipped with a single 21 cm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) L / 22 gun . After being rebuilt in 1891 – 1895 , her armament was increased by six 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) L / 22 and one 8 @.@ 8 cm L / 30 guns , four and later twelve 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) auto @-@ cannons , and five 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , all mounted in the ship 's hull . Kaiser 's armor was made of wrought iron and backed with teak . The armored belt was 127 to 254 mm ( 5 @.@ 0 to 10 @.@ 0 in ) thick ; this was backed with 90 to 226 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 to 8 @.@ 9 in ) of teak .

 After commissioning in February 1875 , Kaiser spent the spring working up her engines to be ready for the annual summer training cruise . She joined the older ironclads Kronprinz and König Wilhelm and the new Hansa , under the command of Vice Admiral Ludwig von Henk . The four @-@ ship squadron remained in German waters for the entirety of the cruise , which finished with a review of the flotilla in Rostock by Kaiser Wilhelm I in September . The squadron was reactivated the next spring ; Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch replaced Henk as the squadron commander . Kaiser served as the flagship of Batsch 's squadron , which also included Kaiser 's sister Deutschland , Kronprinz , and Friedrich Carl . 
 At around the time Batch 's squadron was working up for the summer cruise , Henry Abbott , the German consul in Salonika , then in the Ottoman Empire , was murdered . Further attacks on German citizens living in the area were feared , and so Batsch was ordered to sail to the Mediterranean Sea to stage a naval demonstration in June 1876 . After arriving with the four ironclads , he was reinforced by three unarmored vessels . After the threat of violence subsided in August , Batsch departed with Kaiser and Deutschland ; the other two ironclads remained in the Mediterranean for the rest of the summer . 
 Kaiser joined the 1877 summer squadron , composed of Deutschland , Friedrich Carl , and the new turret ironclad Preussen . The squadron was again sent to the Mediterranean , in response to unrest in the Ottoman Empire related to the Russo @-@ Turkish War ; the violence threatened German citizens living there . The squadron , again under the command of Batsch , steamed to the ports of Haifa and Jaffa in July 1877 , but found no significant tensions ashore . Batsch then departed and cruised the Mediterranean for the remainder of the summer , returning to Germany in October . The newly commissioned Friedrich der Grosse and Grosser Kurfürst , sister ships of Preussen , replaced Kaiser and Deutschland in the 1878 maneuvers , during which Grosser Kurfürst was accidentally rammed and sank with great loss of life . 
 Kaiser and her sister Deutschland remained in reserve for the next six years . They were reactivated in the spring of 1883 for the summer maneuvers under the command of Wilhelm von Wickede . Due to their long period out of service , their engines proved troublesome during the training cruise . Regardless , the 1883 cruise was the first year the German navy completely abandoned the use of sails on its large ironclads . Kaiser went into reserve during the 1884 maneuvers , which were conducted by a homogenous squadron composed of the four Sachsen @-@ class ironclads . The ship did not see active duty again until August 1887 , when she joined König <unk> and Oldenburg as the I Squadron for three weeks of maneuvers with the rest of the fleet . 
 In May 1888 , Kaiser represented Germany at Barcelona 's World Fair , which held a naval review . During the summer of 1889 , Kaiser joined the fleet that steamed to Great Britain to celebrate the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II ; the ship joined her sister Deutschland and the turret ships Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse in the II Division . The fleet then held training maneuvers in the North Sea under command of Rear Admiral Friedrich Hollmann . Kaiser and the rest of the II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889 – 1890 , the first year the Kaiserliche Marine maintained a year @-@ round ironclad force . The squadron escorted Wilhelm II 's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean ; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire . The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890 , when it returned to Germany . 
 Kaiser participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890 . She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September , where the entire eight @-@ ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel . The II Division , including Kaiser , served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890 – 1891 . The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean , under the command of Rear Admiral Wilhelm Schröder . Between 1891 and 1895 , Kaiser was rebuilt in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven . The ship was converted into an armored cruiser ; her heavy guns were removed and replaced with lighter weapons , including one 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) , six 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) , and nine 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns . Her entire rigging equipment was removed and two heavy military masts were installed in place of the rigging . Despite the modernization , she remained quite slow . Deutschland and König Wilhelm were similarly converted . 
 = = = Service in East Asia = = = 
 In 1895 , Kaiser reinforced the East Asia Squadron , which also included the cruisers Irene and Prinzess Wilhelm and several smaller vessels . During the period of diplomatic tension between Britain and Germany caused by the Kruger telegram sent by Wilhelm II , Kaiser and several other overseas cruisers were ordered to return to German waters . This order was quickly reversed , as it was decided it would be seen as an act of weakness by Britain . In April 1896 , while entering the port of Amoy , Kaiser struck an uncharted rock . Only minor damage was done to the hull , but the ship was still out of service for twenty @-@ two days for repairs in Hong Kong . Kaiser served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Otto von Diederichs during his tenure as the squadron commander . Diederichs was tasked with locating a suitable concession to be used as the main port of the East Asia Squadron ; after surveying a number of sites aboard Kaiser , Diederichs settled on Kiautschou Bay . In the wake of two violent incidents against Germans in China , Wilhelm II gave Diederichs permission to seize Kiautschou by force in November 1897 . 
 After dusk on 10 November , Kaiser left Shanghai and headed toward Kiautschou . Prinzess Wilhelm and Cormoran were to leave the following day to allay suspicion . The three ships rendezvoused on the 12th at sea ; Diederichs intended to steam into Kiautschou on the 14th and seize the port . At 06 : 00 on the 14th , Cormoran steamed into the bay to bring the Chinese forts under fire , while Kaiser and Prinzess Wilhelm sent a landing force of some 700 men ashore . In the span of two hours , Diederichs 's forces had captured the central and outlying forts and destroyed the Chinese telegraph , preventing them from notifying their superiors of the German attack . After negotiating with General Chang , the commander of the Kiautschou garrison , Diederichs succeeded in forcing the Chinese concession of Kiautschou to Germany , which he proclaimed at 14 : 20 . Diederichs was promoted to Vice Admiral following the successful seizure of the port . 
 In May 1898 , Diederichs sent Kaiser to Nagasaki for periodic maintenance . The Spanish – American War , which saw action in the Philippines at the Battle of Manila Bay , necessitated a German naval presence in the area to protect German nationals . Kaiser was still in Nagasaki undergoing repairs , so Diederichs ordered her and Prinzess Wilhelm , also in dock for maintenance , to meet him in Manila as soon as was possible . Crew transfers during the repair process necessitated Irene and Cormoran to meet in Manila as well ; this concentration of five warships in the Philippines caused a serious crisis with the American Navy . Rear Admiral George Dewey objected to the size of the German force and to a meeting between Diederichs and Governor General Augustin , the Spanish governor of the Philippines . The German naval forces left the Philippines after the fall of Manila in August , though tensions with the United States continued for some time after . 
 Following his departure from Manila in August 1898 , Diederichs took Kaiser south to the Dutch East Indies . There , the ship represented Germany during celebrations for the coronation of Queen Wilhelmina . The ship then returned to Hong Kong via Singapore , before proceeding to <unk> for gunnery practice . While steaming into the bay , however , the ship ran aground on an uncharted rock . Arcona and Cormoran arrived to tow Kaiser off the rocks , after which Diederichs sent her back to Hong Kong for repairs . Kaiser remained overseas until 1899 , when she returned to Germany . She was reduced to a harbor ship on 3 May 1904 and renamed Uranus on 12 October 1905 . The ship was stricken from the naval register on 21 May 1906 and used as a barracks ship for Württemberg in Flensburg . Uranus was ultimately broken up in 1920 in Harburg . 
 = Community Transit = 
 Community Transit ( CT ) is the public transit authority of Snohomish County , Washington , United States , excluding the city of Everett , in the Seattle metropolitan area . It operates local bus , paratransit and vanpool service within Snohomish County , as well as commuter buses to Downtown Seattle and the University of Washington campus . CT is publicly funded , financed through sales taxes , farebox revenue and subsidies , with an operating budget of $ 133 @.@ 2 million . The entire agency carried more than 10 million passengers in 2015 , placing it fourth among transit agencies in the Puget Sound region . The city of Everett , which serves as the county seat , is served by Everett Transit , a municipal transit system . 
 Community Transit , officially the Snohomish County Public Transportation Benefit Area Corporation ( SCPTBA ) , operates a fleet of 225 accessible buses , 54 paratransit vehicles , and 412 vanpool vans , maintained at two bus bases located in the Paine Field industrial area in Everett . Service is provided year @-@ round at 1 @,@ 500 stops on 46 routes throughout the county public transportation benefit area ( PTBA ) . CT began operation as SCPTBA Public Transit on October 4 , 1976 , four months after the third attempt to establish public transit in Snohomish County was approved . Renamed to Community Transit in 1979 , the agency expanded service in its first decades of existence , later taking over King County Metro commuter routes to Seattle in 1989 and adding several cities into its PTBA in the 1980s and 1990s . CT service hours fell during two funding crises in the 2000s , after the passage of Initiative 695 in 1999 and during a severe recession from 2010 to 2012 . Despite the cuts , which forced service hours to fall short of rising demand , the agency debuted the state 's first bus rapid transit line , Swift , as well as introducing " Double Tall " double @-@ decker buses on its commuter routes to Seattle .

 Snohomish County established its public transportation benefit area ( PTBA ) , the first in the state , after municipal corporations for public transportation were added to the Revised Code of Washington by the Washington State Legislature in 1975 . The PTBA plan for a countywide bus system was approved during a general election on June 1 , 1976 , funded by a three @-@ tenths increase of the sales tax rate in member cities . Two previous attempts to establish a bus system , under the Snohomish County Transportation Authority ( SNOTRAN ) in 1974 , were rejected by voters from the entirety of Snohomish County . Heavy opposition came from the residents of Everett because of the high sales tax rate and planned absorption of Everett Transit , acquired by the city in 1969 , forcing the SCPTBA to exclude Everett in its successful attempt at creating a bus system . SCPTBA Public Transit began operating in the cities of Brier , Edmonds , Lynnwood , Marysville , Mountlake Terrace , Snohomish and Woodway on October 4 , 1976 , using 18 leased GMC buses on seven routes carrying 6 @,@ 414 passengers without fares during the first week . 
 SCPTBA Public Transit , nicknamed the " Blue Bus " for its blue livery , carried 951 @,@ 200 passengers in its first year of service on 15 local routes and 16 commuter express routes to Downtown Seattle and Northgate , contracted through King County Metro as a continuation of service provided by the Metropolitan Transit Corporation to southern Snohomish County prior to its merger with Seattle Transit System in 1973 . The buses ran for 16 hours a day , charging a base fare of 20 cents ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 00 in 2016 ) . Among the most popular lines was Route <unk> , accounting for 21 percent of system ridership in the first three months , running from the Edmonds waterfront to Lynnwood and the Boeing Everett Factory . The agency acquired its first federal subsidies from the Urban Mass Transit Administration for the 1978 fiscal year , to be used on the purchase of 18 new buses as well as bus stop amenities , such as stop signs and shelters . 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 Community Transit was selected as the official name of the agency on June 19 , 1979 , recommended by Seattle @-@ based public relations firm McConnell Company ahead of the winners of a public contest held by SCPTBA two years prior . CT continued to grow through the end of the decade , annexing the cities of Arlington , Lake Stevens , Monroe , Granite Falls , Mukilteo , Stanwood and Sultan into the PTBA by 1980 ; the bus system had the largest growth in ridership within the state in 1980 , with local routes gaining 68 @.@ 3 percent more riders and Metro @-@ operated " Cream Buses " to Seattle gaining 21 @.@ 4 percent more riders . Metro altered their numbering scheme for Snohomish County routes in 1981 , creating the 400 @-@ series of routes , after the opening of the state 's largest park and ride in Lynnwood . The annexations of outlying communities in northern and eastern Snohomish County and the completion of park and rides in Edmonds and Mountlake Terrace saw ridership rise to over 3 million passengers by 1983 . Community Transit took over the remaining commuter routes to Seattle in 1989 , after commuter service was subcontracted to American Transportation Enterprises in 1986 . The move to a private carrier was opposed by both Metro and the Amalgamated Transit Union , but the introduction of 49 air conditioned coaches by ATE led to a 25 percent increase in ridership by January 1987 . Commuter express service via Interstate 405 from CT park and rides in South Snohomish County to the Eastside cities of Bellevue and Redmond began in 1988 and 1990 , respectively , while Seattle service was expanded with weekend service in 1990 . The agency dedicated its own 20 @-@ acre ( 8 @.@ 1 ha ) bus base at Kasch Park in 1985 , replacing shared operations with the Edmonds School District and Everett Transit , at a cost of $ 4 @.@ 8 million ( equivalent to $ 106 million in 2016 ) that was mostly subsidized by the Urban Mass Transit Administration .

 CT was involved in a criminal investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) in the mid @-@ 1990s of Ed 's Transmission , a transmission shop in Everett used by the agency for bus parts . Detectives from the FBI and Snohomish County Sheriff seized records from both parties and began a two @-@ month audit of Community Transit management . The auditors released a report that criticized the management style of Executive Director Ken <unk> and his department heads , leading to the former 's resignation in December 1993 after nine years at his position . Federal prosecutors accused Ralph Woodall , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old co @-@ owner of the shop , of 15 counts of mail fraud after intentionally <unk> for transmission repairs . Community Transit Maintenance Director Michael Lynn resigned after confessing that he had accepted gifts from Woodall in exchange for sending all of CT 's transmissions to Ed 's Transmissions without going through competitive bidding . A U.S. District Court jury found Woodall guilty of 15 counts of mail fraud in December 1996 , with Judge John C. <unk> sentencing him to 2 @.@ 5 years in federal prison the following May , along with Ed 's Transmission being forced to pay a $ 825 @,@ 000 settlement after a civil suit was filed . 
 = = = = Proposed consolidations with Everett Transit = = = = 
 Attempted mergers of Community Transit with Everett Transit have been proposed by the Washington State Legislature and the CT Board since the formation of SNOTRAN in 1974 . The relative success of Community Transit in the late 1970s and 1980s prompted the Community Transit Board to propose consolidation with Everett Transit in 1988 , though long @-@ term planning under SNOTRAN for both agencies worked under the assumption that there would be no merger by 2000 . In 1990 , a second proposal was rejected by the Everett City Council after consultants determined that a merger would only save $ 350 @,@ 000 per year in deadheading for Community Transit and that both staffs would need to be retained because of the lack of service duplication between the two agencies . Throughout the 1990s , successive legislative bills proposing a merger were passed through the House Transportation Committee , but failed to gain support elsewhere because of successful lobbying from the City of Everett . State voters approved Referendum 49 in November 1998 , including state motor @-@ vehicle excise tax revenue for city @-@ run transit in Everett and Yakima . While Everett Transit gained $ 4 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 6 @.@ 53 million in 2016 ) in new annual funding , CT was set to lose $ 1 million ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 45 million in 2016 ) over the next five years in addition to the $ 2 million ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 9 million in 2016 ) used to operate service within Everett annually . The large cuts brought on by the passing of Initiative 695 and subsequent loss of excise tax revenue forced both agencies to consider merging in 2000 , with savings of an estimated $ 1 @.@ 7 million per year ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 27 million in 2016 ) according to a study commissioned by Community Transit . As a result of the failed mergers , CT proposed truncating its routes at Everett city limits , but ultimately decided to provide limited @-@ stop service on its routes through Everett to the newly constructed Everett Station in 2002 . Community Transit and Everett Transit signed their first partnership agreement in 2007 , with Everett helping fund Swift bus rapid transit through its service area and allowing CT to operate the route in exchange for the expansion of ET service into unincorporated areas surrounding Everett . The two agencies further collaborated with Sound Transit and the Washington State Department of Transportation in the construction of the South Everett Freeway Station the following year .

 In their most recent expansion in 1997 , the Snohomish County PTBA annexed the <unk> and Silver Firs census @-@ designated places between Everett and Mill Creek , as well as the <unk> Indian Reservation west of Marysville . During the same year , CT awarded its $ 31 @.@ 8 million ( equivalent to $ 46 @.@ 9 million in 2016 ) commuter service contract to Grosvenor Bus Lines , which would later fold into First Transit , replacing their first subcontractor , Ryder / ATE Management . The agency introduced the first low @-@ floor articulated buses in the United States into its fleet in 1999 , purchasing 17 60 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 18 m ) buses from New Flyer to improve accessibility for older and disabled riders . Service improvements throughout the 1990s , including raising service hours to over 11 million , led to ridership peaking at 8 @.@ 8 million by the end of the decade and the agency 's 100 millionth rider being celebrated in April 2000 . The passage of Initiative 695 in 1999 , which capped the state motor @-@ vehicle excise tax at $ 30 , forced transit agencies throughout the state to cut service in anticipation of lower revenue . Facing the loss of $ 18 million ( equivalent to $ 24 @.@ 7 million in 2016 ) , or 30 percent of its annual operating budget , Community Transit eliminated all weekend service and increased fares on its routes in February 2000 . With the service cuts , CT began its <unk> program to donate its retired paratransit minibuses to nonprofit organizations in Snohomish County instead of auctioning them off . Saturday service was reinstated in September 2000 , using emergency funds approved by the CT Board , while Sunday service returned in 2001 after the passage of a 0 @.@ 3 percentage @-@ point tax increase by voters in the PTBA . Further restoration of service came in 2003 , with increased frequency and the replacement of 50 buses in the agency 's fleet made possible by a budget surplus and the sales tax increase approved in 2002 , and in 2005 , with increased fares . 
 Community Transit introduced its current logo and slogan in 2005 , replacing an older one in use since 1986 and retaining its blue @-@ and @-@ white color scheme , as part of the roll @-@ out of the first New Flyer <unk> buses in the United States . CT began a three @-@ month pilot project in September 2005 that brought Wi @-@ Fi access to buses on its longest route , Route 422 between Stanwood and Seattle , with hopes of attracting customers and partial @-@ <unk> to its routes . The pilot project was deemed a success and expanded into the " Surf and Ride " program on all Route 422 trips in 2006 , as well as select trips on Routes 406 and 441 from Edmonds to Seattle and <unk> on the Eastside , respectively ; the Wi @-@ Fi program was canceled in 2010 , with the removal of equipment in buses brought on by low customer response , budget constraints and the adoption of improved cellular networks that support mobile browsing on smartphones . 
 CT and First Transit signed their third and most recent contract in 2007 , continuing the latter 's operation of CT commuter service to Seattle . Community Transit debuted the first double @-@ decker buses in the Puget Sound region during a year @-@ long test in 2007 , eventually buying its own fleet of Alexander Dennis Enviro500s for its " Double Tall " fleet to be used on commuter services . A PTBA expansion into the unincorporated areas of Cathcart , Clearview and Maltby was attempted during the 2008 general elections , but failed to gain a majority vote . In November 2009 , after three years of planning and a year of construction , Community Transit debuted the first bus rapid transit line in Washington , Swift . The service replaced Route 100 on State Route 99 between Aurora Village in Shoreline and Everett Station , featuring 12 @-@ minute headways , off @-@ board fare payment and transit signal priority . 
 = = = Service cuts and restoration = = = 
 The Great Recession of the late 2000s and subsequent loss of an estimated $ 180 million ( equivalent to $ 195 million in 2016 ) in sales tax revenue in Snohomish County forced CT to cut service by 15 percent in June 2010 , including the elimination of all service on Sundays and major holidays , to save $ 16 million ( equivalent to $ 17 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) until 2012 . A second cut , with 20 percent of service eliminated , took place in February 2012 ; the CT Board rejected a major restructure that would have truncated its northern and eastern express service to Seattle at Lynnwood Transit Center during this cut , instead opting to preserve its commuter service . Despite the decline in service hours , Community Transit and Sound Transit had record ridership for Snohomish County routes during the Super Bowl XLVIII parade in Downtown Seattle in February 2014 , carrying a total of 22 @,@ 500 passengers on 50 extra trips into Seattle . In March , the 2014 Oso mudslide destroyed a portion of State Route 530 and forced CT to re @-@ route its service to Darrington through Skagit County , offering one @-@ seat service to Smokey Point and Everett Station in the interim as Route 231 . The partial reopening of State Route 530 in June and full reopening in September restored the original Route 230 on its original route , now extended to Smokey Point . 
 Community Transit began restoring cut service in September 2014 , adding 13 percent of its former bus hours primarily to improve midday service . In June 2015 , CT restored its Sunday and holiday service as part of a 27 @,@ 000 @-@ hour expansion , representing 20 percent of the 2010 reduction , funded by recovering sales tax revenue and a 25 @-@ cent increase in fares the following month . The agency was given approval from the state legislature in July 2015 to increase sales taxes by an additional 0 @.@ 3 % , dependent on voter approval via a ballot measure during the November 2015 election that was eventually won , to fund a new Swift line as well as local service expansion . 
 = = = Regional projects with Sound Transit = = = 
 Community Transit and Everett Transit agreed to break away from SNOTRAN , which served as their planning and administrative body in addition to disbursing federal subsidies , after CT complained of a " lack of communication " between the three agencies . The county agency formally disbanded on December 31 , 1994 , replaced by the Joint Regional Policy Committee ( <unk> ) that formed four years prior to coordinate transit planning for the entire Puget Sound region . A regional transit agency was formed in 1993 under the <unk> , organizing a $ 6 @.@ 7 billion ( equivalent to $ 10 @.@ 4 billion in 2016 ) plan for regional transit that was put to a vote on March 14 , 1995 , failing to pass outside of Seattle , Mercer Island and Shoreline . The plan included a commuter rail line on the BNSF Scenic Subdivision between Everett , Mukilteo , Edmonds and King Street Station in Seattle , a light rail line from Lynnwood to Seattle following Interstate 5 , and express bus service to light rail stations . The following November , the smaller " Sound Move " plan was approved at a cost of $ 3 @.@ 9 billion ( equivalent to $ 5 @.@ 88 billion in 2016 ) , including commuter rail from Everett to Seattle and express buses on Interstate 5 from Everett and Lynnwood to Seattle and Bellevue . 
 The regional transit agency , renamed to Sound Transit the following year , began operating its Sound Transit Express buses under contract with Community Transit in September 1999 . The new express buses connected park and rides in southwestern Snohomish County , the only part of Community Transit 's service area within the Sound Transit taxing district , to Downtown Seattle , including the newly opened , 1 @,@ 000 @-@ stall Ash Way Park & Ride in northern Lynnwood . Sound Transit funded several capital projects to improve bus service on the Interstate 5 corridor , including direct access ramps from HOV lanes to Lynnwood and Ash Way park and rides that opened in 2004 and 2005 , respectively . In 2011 , the existing Mountlake Terrace park and ride was expanded with an 890 @-@ stall parking garage and bus platforms in the median of I @-@ 5 connected by a pedestrian bridge . 
 Commuter rail service to Snohomish County on the Sounder North Line began in December 2003 with a single round @-@ trip connecting Everett and Edmonds to King Street Station in Seattle during rush hour . Service was expanded to a second round @-@ trip in June 2005 and a third round @-@ trip in September 2007 , while an infill station opened at Mukilteo in May 2008 , also bringing additional service in the form of a fourth round @-@ trip the following September . 
 An expansion of the Link Light Rail system in the " Sound Transit 2 " package was approved in November 2008 , including 54 % of southwestern Snohomish County voters , funding the extension of light rail to Lynnwood . The 8 @.@ 5 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 13 @.@ 7 km ) light rail line will run along Interstate 5 from Northgate Transit Center in Seattle to Lynnwood Transit Center and is scheduled to begin construction in 2018 and open for service in 2023 . Sound Transit has also begun exploring a possible light rail extension to Everett via Paine Field , anticipated to be included in the " Sound Transit 3 " ballot measure in 2016 . 
 = = Administration = = 
 Community Transit is administered by a nine @-@ member board , composed of two members of the Snohomish County Council , two elected officials from PTBA cities with populations of 30 @,@ 000 or more , three elected officials from cities with between 10 @,@ 000 and 30 @,@ 000 , and two elected officials from cities with less than 10 @,@ 000 , that meets monthly at their headquarters in Everett . The board is led by a non @-@ voting chief executive officer , a position held by Emmett Heath since he was promoted from interim CEO in March 2015 . CT adopted an operating budget of $ 133 @.@ 2 million for 2015 ; 65 to 70 percent of revenue is provided by a 0 @.@ 9 percent sales tax within the PTBA , the maximum authorized for transit agencies under state law , while a combination of fares and federal subsidies comprise the remainder . The agency employs 579 full @-@ time equivalent persons , divided into eight departments . 
 CT is headquartered at their Merrill Creek Operating Base at 7000 <unk> Road in the Paine Field industrial area of South Everett , located northeast of the Boeing Everett Factory . The 87 @,@ 065 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 8 @,@ 088 @.@ 6 m2 ) Merrill Creek administrative building opened in 1997 and is the primary bus base for the agency 's fleet of buses and vans . Additional administrative buildings and fleet parking lots are located at the Kasch Park Operating Base south of the Boeing Freeway .

 Community Transit operates fixed bus routes throughout the 1 @,@ 308 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 3 @,@ 390 km2 ) Snohomish County PTBA , serving 47 percent of its 542 @,@ 000 people and 76 percent of its 254 @,@ 000 jobs . The 46 bus routes serve 1 @,@ 584 bus stops , of which 257 have a bus shelter — the rest consist of a standalone sign or a sign with a bench . The bus routes are divided into three types of service , numbered according to destination : frequent bus rapid transit on the unnumbered Swift , 24 local routes in the 100s for southern Snohomish County and 200s for northern and eastern Snohomish County , and 22 weekday peak @-@ only commuter express routes from park and rides to the Boeing Everett Factory numbered as the <unk> , Downtown Seattle in the 400s , and the University of Washington campus in the 800s . CT and their subcontractor First Transit also operate all @-@ day , all @-@ week Sound Transit Express service to Seattle and Bellevue on six routes numbered in the 500s . Typically , service changes occur in February and September , in response to ridership and requests from the community . 
 Commuter bus routes to Boeing in Everett , Downtown Seattle and the University District originate at one of the 24 Community Transit park and rides and transit centers located throughout Snohomish County , with a total capacity of 8 @,@ 500 automobiles and 172 bicycles . The largest facilities , primarily located in southwest Snohomish County , include weatherproof bicycle lockers in addition to automobile parking . The majority of park and rides are owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation and maintained by Community Transit and other service providers . 
 In addition to bus service , CT operates a vanpool program with a fleet of 366 vans originating from the Kasch Park operating base in Everett . The fleet comes in configurations with 7 , 12 , or 15 seats , with two special vans equipped with wheelchair lifts . Community Transit reports that there are 361 active <unk> using their service , providing 908 @,@ 488 rides in 2015 , the 12th largest vanpool program in the United States that year . CT leases vanpool lots , called " park and pool lots " , from local churches and other private parties at 15 locations with a total capacity of 482 parking stalls . 
 Dial @-@ a @-@ ride transportation ( DART ) service is also offered by Community Transit , contracted through Senior Services of Snohomish County since 1981 . DART paratransit is available for a fare of $ 2 for qualifying customers within 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) of local CT routes during regular operating hours . As of 2014 , CT has 4 @,@ 100 registered DART users that take an average of 700 trips per day . 
 = = = Fares = = = 
 Fares on Community Transit buses are priced into three groups : adult , youth , and reduced . Adult fare is charged for passengers between the ages of 19 and 64 , youth fare is charged for passengers between the ages of 6 and 18 , and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders . Up to two children under the age of 5 ride free with a chaperone paying full or reduced fare for themselves . Fares also change based on service level , with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive ; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County . The last fare increase occurred on July 1 , 2015 , raising the adult and DART fares by 25 cents . 
 The regional ORCA card was introduced as an integrated smart card for transit agencies in the Puget Sound region on April 20 , 2009 , allowing users to load monthly passes and value through an e @-@ purse web interface . The card also allowed free transfers within a two @-@ hour period between transit agencies of equal value , with the difference for higher fare subtracted from the e @-@ purse or prompting for cash . While initially available for no fee , effective March 1 , 2010 a $ 5 cost was added when ordering a standard adult or youth ORCA card . CT removed their paper transfers on January 1 , 2010 after the ORCA card made them obsolete . 
 Community Transit also offers monthly passes through local higher education institutions , including Edmonds Community College , the University of Washington , Cascadia College , and the Lynnwood Campus of Central Washington University . 
 Dial @-@ a @-@ ride transportation , a type of paratransit service operated by Community Transit , has a flat fare of $ 2 @.@ 25 without discounts or separate categories . ORCA cards are not accepted on DART , replaced by tickets and monthly passes for frequent users . 
 = = Fleet = = 
 As of January 2014 , CT maintains and operates a fleet of 696 vehicles from its operating bases at Kasch Park and Merrill Creek . The 227 @-@ bus fleet has been reduced from 291 vehicles in 2010 because of major service cuts in 2010 and 2012 , forcing Community Transit to downsize in order to comply with the spare ratio policies set by the Federal Transit Administration . The fleet is composed of 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) and 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) vehicles , as well as specialized 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) articulated buses and 42 @-@ foot ( 13 m ) double @-@ decker buses . Buses typically are powered by diesel engines , with the exception of the 15 hybrid diesel @-@ electric Swift articulated buses and 15 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) hybrid buses . 
 Since 1995 , all Community Transit buses are low @-@ floored and equipped with a hydraulic or pneumatic " kneeling " device in addition to wheelchair lifts for 6 @-@ wheeled motorized wheelchairs . CT buses have also feature two bicycle racks located in front of the windshield since 1996 ; Swift bus rapid transit buses have three bike racks located inside the vehicle for reduced dwell times . 
 In addition to its bus fleet , Community Transit maintains 412 vans for its vanpool program and 54 DART paratransit minibuses equipped with wheelchair lifts . Retired vanpool and DART vehicles are donated to local non @-@ profit organizations through the <unk> program , which has gifted 106 vans since its establishment in 2000 . 
 = = = Double Tall = = = 
 Community Transit has a fleet of double @-@ decker buses used on commuter routes from park and rides to Downtown Seattle , named the " Double Tall " in reference to the double tall cup size at Starbucks , a coffee chain founded and headquartered in Seattle . The Alexander Dennis <unk> was introduced during a one @-@ year pilot project in 2007 , on lease from Alexander Dennis for $ 15 @,@ 000 per month . The 42 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 13 m ) , 14 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 4 m ) <unk> seated 77 , with standing room for 20 additional passengers , replacing the capacity of the standard articulated buses used on the commuter routes in a smaller footprint . Prior to the end of the trial in 2008 , CT placed an order of 23 Enviro500s , scheduled to be delivered and put into service in 2010 ; the initial order was not fulfilled until 2011 , when manufacturing was moved to an <unk> plant in Riverside , California to meet federal Buy America Act requirements . A second order of 17 Enviro500s , to replace older articulated buses , was made in 2013 and went into service in late 2015 . 
 Sound Transit introduced five of its own double @-@ decker buses in 2015 for use on their Snohomish County routes under contract with Community Transit . Sound Transit plans to eventually replace its entire Snohomish County fleet with double @-@ deckers , beginning with 32 buses by 2021 . 
 The fleet of 45 double @-@ decker buses operated directly by Community Transit is , As of 2015 , the second @-@ largest double @-@ decker fleet of any public transit agency in the United States , behind RTC Transit of Las Vegas , Nevada and ahead of <unk> of Davis , California and Antelope Valley Transit Authority of Antelope Valley , California .

 = Simon Wormull = 
 Simon James Wormull ( born 1 December 1976 ) is an English former footballer who is head coach of Isthmian League club Three Bridges . 
 As a junior , Wormull played for Tottenham Hotspur in the final of the 1995 FA Youth Cup and in the Intertoto Cup . Although he made a few appearances in the lower divisions of the Football League for Brentford and Rushden & Diamonds , the majority of his playing career was spent in non @-@ league football in the south @-@ east of England . He was capped seven times for the National Game XI , the team that represents England at semi @-@ professional level . 
 After retirement as a player , Wormull joined the coaching staff of Isthmian League club Lewes , where he was first @-@ team manager from January 2012 to the end of the 2012 – 13 season . He spent a few months as manager of Crawley Down Gatwick before returning to Three Bridges first as academy head , then as first @-@ team coach . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Wormull was born in Crawley , West Sussex , and played for the under @-@ 15 team at local club Three Bridges before beginning his football career as a schoolboy with Brighton & Hove Albion . He joined Tottenham Hotspur while still a junior , and at the age of 15 became one of the youngest players ever to appear for their reserve team . In 1995 , he played in the final of the FA Youth Cup against Manchester United youth team , scoring the opening goal in the first leg , which Tottenham won 2 – 1 . By the time the second leg went to a losing penalty shootout , Wormull had been substituted by Stephen Clemence . The closest he came to first @-@ team football in six years at the club was in the Intertoto Cup , a competition in which Tottenham fielded extremely weak sides , including that which lost 8 – 0 to FC Cologne . 
 Released by Tottenham at the end of the 1996 – 97 season , Wormull joined Second Division club Brentford on a free transfer , marking his debut in the Football League by missing the best chance of the match . He fell out of favour , and following a trial in Brighton & Hove Albion 's reserves , was given a month 's contract by manager Brian Horton , who described the player as someone who " uses the ball well , ... gets forward and is quite aggressive " . Injury prevented him playing for the first team during that period , or during another month at the start of the 1998 – 99 season ; much to Horton 's displeasure , Wormull rejected the offer of a further month , preferring to drop down to the Conference with Dover Athletic . 
 = = = Dover Athletic = = = 
 He scored twice in 30 Conference games in his first season with Dover , and his performance earned him international selection , chosen for England 's National Game XI for the first time in March 1999 . He maintained the standard the following season ; Dover 's best player against rivals Rushden & Diamonds , he was eventually stretchered off with a damaged Achilles tendon after three opponents were booked for fouling him . Sidelined for a month due to injuries sustained in that match , Wormull returned to play 20 minutes as a substitute before joining Rushden for a fee of £ 50 @,@ 000 later that same week . BBC Sport 's 2000 – 01 Football Conference preview said that Dover would miss him , a view later echoed by then assistant manager Clive Walker , who described the 1999 – 2000 season as " a year when we had players like Simon Wormull , Joe Dunne and Dave Clarke in the team . In all honesty , we weren 't far away from having a side good enough to win the division . We needed perhaps two more players to compete at the top – but sadly we ended up selling Dunne and Wormull halfway through the season . " 
 = = = Rushden & Diamonds = = = 
 He helped Rushden to runners @-@ up spot in the Conference in 2000 , and retained his place in England 's semi @-@ professional side . In the 2000 – 01 season , his appearances were infrequent , and in December 2000 , Dover made an unsuccessful attempt to buy him back . He played his part in Rushden 's Conference title , and consequent promotion to the Football League . After five games for the club in Division Three , manager Brian Talbot sold Wormull together with striker Jean @-@ Michel Sigere to Conference club Stevenage Borough for " a five @-@ figure sum " . 
 = = = Stevenage Borough = = = 
 Wormull helped Stevenage to reach the final of the FA Trophy in 2002 , which they lost 2 – 0 to full @-@ time professional club Yeovil Town . While with the club he won his seventh international cap , and maintained his reputation as a good crosser of the ball who was willing to shoot ; in his first two seasons with the club he contributed more shots than any of his team @-@ mates , and in his second and third seasons he made most assists . Stevenage began to move towards full @-@ time status before the 2002 – 03 season . At the end of that season , Wormull submitted a transfer request , because he was struggling to balance work and football commitments . Manager Graham Westley rejected the request , but in April 2004 his contract was cancelled by mutual consent , citing the player 's injury record and his difficulties adjusting to the demands of full @-@ time football . 
 = = = Hornchurch and Crawley Town = = = 
 Home @-@ town club Crawley Town 's manager Francis Vines hoped to sign Wormull , describing him as a good all @-@ round player who " can play in the middle or wide right and passes the ball well , as well as being useful with set @-@ pieces . He is also good in the tackle " , capable of strengthening an already strong midfield . They were unable to match the offer – believed to be £ 800 a week – from Conference South club Hornchurch , dubbed the " Chelsea of the Conference " because they had a well @-@ paid full @-@ time professional squad despite playing only in the sixth tier of English football . A back injury restricted his Hornchurch appearances , and he had not played for several weeks when , in November 2004 , the owner 's business collapsed , the players ' pay cheques were stopped , and most of the squad left . 
 Wormull returned home to join Crawley , on much reduced wages , but he failed his medical examination ; the club initially offered him a short @-@ term deal while he proved his fitness . At the end of the 2004 – 05 season he agreed a two @-@ year contract . He turned down offers of full @-@ time football , preferring to stay near home and combine his playing role with running the club 's new youth coaching scheme in local schools . A succession of managerial changes following the club 's takeover resulted in Wormull acting as caretaker manager for four matches in November 2005 , a role in which he made a positive start . During this period he agreed a new contract , but the offer was later withdrawn , and he was given permission to speak to other clubs . Unwilling to leave the Sussex area , he decided to stay with Crawley , but when the club halved the players ' wages , thereby breaching their contracts and allowing them to leave on free transfers , Wormull chose to join Conference South club Lewes . 
 = = = Lewes = = = 
 In his first full season with Lewes , Wormull was used in a number of different positions , but in 2007 – 08 , he usually played in central midfield , and felt that the continuity helped his performance . He scored the winning goal against Sutton United in the third qualifying round of the FA Cup , and made an assist for one goal and was involved in the second in the fourth qualifying round , to take the club through to the first round proper for the second year running . Wormull contributed five goals from midfield towards his club winning the Conference South title , though an injured ankle meant he missed the last few weeks of the season . 
 Following the departure of manager Steve King , the vast majority of the title @-@ winning side left the club . Despite new Lewes manager Kevin <unk> 's view that " if I could have had only one player I could keep from last season , it would be Simon " being reflected in the club offering him better terms than did Eastbourne Borough , Wormull , together with team @-@ mate Jean @-@ Michel Sigere , joined their local rivals in June 2008 . 
 = = = Eastbourne Borough = = = 
 Wormull and Sigere made their debuts in the opening @-@ day defeat to former club Rushden & Diamonds , making Eastbourne the fifth club – following Rushden , Stevenage , Hornchurch and Lewes – where they played alongside each other . After just one season with the club , in which he scored six goals from 37 appearances in all competitions , Wormull 's contract was cancelled by mutual consent . He did leave with a winners ' medal , earned as an unused substitute in the Sussex Senior Cup final in May 2009 , in which Eastbourne beat a Brighton & Hove Albion reserve team 1 – 0 . 
 = = = Farnborough and after = = = 
 Wormull promptly signed a two @-@ year deal with Farnborough , where he linked up with Steve King , his former manager at Lewes , and , for the sixth time in his career , with Jean @-@ Michel Sigere , though only briefly , as Sigere was released a few days later . Wormull helped Farnborough win the 2009 – 10 Southern League title , playing 39 games in all competitions ( 20 in the league ) , before cancelling his contract by mutual consent at the end of that first season . He rejoined Lewes a few days later , staying with them until December , when he joined Sussex County League side Three Bridges , preferring for family reasons to play for a club nearer his home . According to Three Bridges ' manager , the club were " absolutely chuffed to pieces to have such a magnificent player playing for us " . Wormull tore knee ligaments in April 2011 , and retired from competitive football at the end of the season . 
 = = Coaching career = = 
 Wormull then returned to Lewes , to join Steve King 's management team in the role of under @-@ 18 team manager with support coaching involvement with the first team . When King was suspended by the club in January 2012 , Wormull was " asked to assist with First Team Management duties " . and the following week , after King 's departure , he was appointed caretaker manager until the end of the season . He registered as a player , and made his third debut for Lewes from the substitutes ' bench as his team lost 2 – 1 at home to Canvey Island in the Isthmian League Premier Division . In April , with Lewes on the verge of the play @-@ offs , Wormull 's appointment was made permanent . The club 's directors said he had " impressed everybody with his combination of professionalism , diligence and approachability " , and that " his new regime of training and insightful , value for money signings has transformed the team " . In his second season , Lewes narrowly avoided relegation . The board 's view was that " being involved in a relegation battle was extremely disappointing " , and an experience that was " particularly difficult " in context of the club 's hard work towards " creat [ ing ] a platform from which to start building again " , and Wormull was dismissed at the end of the season . He was " devastated " by the decision , believing he had " <unk> [ t ] a good foundation " for the future , despite being " decimated with injuries " and working to what he described as " a huge reduction in the budget " . 
 Wormull took over as manager of Isthmian League Division One South club Crawley Down Gatwick in June 2013 . Wormull led the team to the top of the table with five wins and a draw from their first six matches , a performance that earned him the Isthmian South Manager of the Month award for August . They had fallen to sixth by early November , when he resigned his post for what were described as " personal and family reasons " . 
 In February 2014 , Wormull returned to football as head of the youth academy at one of his former employers , fellow Isthmian South club Three Bridges . At the end of the season , he was appointed head first @-@ team coach , to work with manager Paul <unk> .

 = The Monster ( novella ) = 
 The Monster is an 1898 novella by American author Stephen Crane ( 1871 – 1900 ) . The story takes place in the small , fictional town of Whilomville , New York . An African @-@ American coachman named Henry Johnson , who is employed by the town 's physician , Dr. Trescott , becomes horribly disfigured after he saves Trescott 's son from a fire . When Henry is branded a " monster " by the town 's residents , Trescott vows to shelter and care for him , resulting in his family 's exclusion from the community . 
 The fictional town of Whilomville , which is used in 14 other Crane stories , was based on Port Jervis , New York , where Crane lived with his family for a few years during his youth . It is thought that he took inspiration from several local men who were similarly disfigured , although modern critics have made numerous connections between the story and the 1892 lynching in Port Jervis of an African @-@ American man named Robert Lewis . A study of prejudice , fear and isolation in a small town , the novella was first published in Harper 's Magazine in August 1898 . A year later it was included in The Monster and Other Stories — the last collection of Crane 's work to be published during his lifetime . 
 Written in a more exact and less dramatic style than two of his previous major works ( Maggie : A Girl of the Streets and The Red Badge of Courage ) , The Monster differs from the other Whilomville stories in its scope and length . Its themes include the paradoxical study of monstrosity and deformity , as well as race and tolerance . Both the novella and collection received mixed reviews from critics , although The Monster is now considered one of Crane 's best works . 
 = = Background and writing = = 
 Crane began writing The Monster in June 1897 while living in Oxted , England with his longtime partner Cora Taylor . Despite his previous success — The Red Badge of Courage had gone through 14 printings in the United States and six in England — Crane was running out of money . To survive financially , he worked at a feverish pitch , writing prolifically for both the English and the American markets . He later remarked that he wrote The Monster " under the spur of great need " , as he desperately required funds . In August of that year , Crane and Cora were injured in a carriage accident while visiting friend Harold Frederic and his mistress Kate Lyon in Homefield , Kenley ; after a week of recuperation , they followed the couple on vacation to Ireland , where Crane finished the story . 
 The Monster was Crane 's first story to feature the fictional town of Whilomville ; it would eventually serve as the setting of 14 stories , 13 of which would appear in the 1900 anthology Whilomville Stories . The town was based on Port Jervis , New York , where the author lived from the age of six to eleven . Although Crane and his mother relocated to Asbury Park , New Jersey , in 1880 , until 1896 he frequently stayed with his older brother and Port Jervis resident William Howe Crane . Crane admitted to his publishers that while he readily used Port Jervis as inspiration while writing The Monster , he was anxious to ensure that the residents of his previous hometown did not recognize themselves in the fictional Whilomville . While Crane biographer Thomas Beer claimed to trace the prototype of Henry Johnson to a Port Jervis teamster named Levi Hume , Crane 's niece , Edna Crane Sidbury , believed the character and his disfigurement were influenced by a local waste collector whose face was damaged by cancer . In Black Frankenstein : The Making of an American Metaphor , author Elizabeth Young theorized that Crane may also have been inspired by popular freak show attractions such as Zip the Pinhead , whose real name was William Henry Johnson , and Joseph Merrick , the Elephant Man . It is also possible that Crane found thematic inspiration in Henrik Ibsen 's An Enemy of the People ; although first published in 1882 , the play — about a physician who finds himself ostracized by his community — first became popular in the United States in the mid @-@ 1890s . 
 Modern critics have connected the novella 's themes of racial division to a violent episode in Port Jervis ' history . On June 2 , 1892 , an African @-@ American man named Robert Lewis was lynched for allegedly assaulting a local white woman . On his way to the Port Jervis jail , Lewis was set upon by a mob of several hundred men who dragged him through the town , beat him and hanged him from a tree . William Howe Crane lived within sight of where the lynching took place and was one of the few men , together with the chief of police , who attempted to intervene . Although Stephen Crane was not present , there were detailed accounts published in both the Port Jervis Gazette and the New York Tribune , and Crane contributed to the Tribune at the time . The Gazette marked the day of Lewis ' lynching as " one of the most disgraceful scenes that was ever enacted in Port Jervis " , and activist Ida B. Wells launched a campaign to investigate the murder as well as the widespread theory that Lewis was set up . Of the 1 @,@ 134 reported lynchings throughout the United States between 1882 and 1899 , Lewis was the only black man to be lynched in New York . 
 Crane initially sent his a manuscript of more than 21 @,@ 000 words to McClure 's , along with several other works including " The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky " , but it remained unpublished for nearly a year . After McClure 's eventual rejection , The Monster appeared in the August 1898 issue of Harper 's Magazine with illustrations by Peter Newell . A year later , it was published in the United States by Harper & Brothers Publishers in a collection titled The Monster and Other Stories , which included two other works by Crane , " The Blue Hotel " and " His New <unk> " . The first British edition , which added an additional four stories , was published in 1901 . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 After being admonished by his father , Dr. Ned Trescott , for damaging a peony while playing in his family 's yard , young Jimmie Trescott visits his family 's coachman , Henry Johnson . Henry , who is described as " a very handsome negro " , " known to be a light , a weight , and an eminence in the suburb of the town " , is friendly toward Jimmie . Later that evening Henry dresses smartly and saunters through town — inciting catcalls from friends and ridicule from the local white men — on his way to call on the young Bella Farragut , who is extremely taken with him . 
 That same evening , a large crowd gathers in the park to hear a band play . Suddenly , the nearby factory whistle blows to alert the townspeople of a fire in the second district of the town ; men gather hose @-@ carts and head toward the blaze that is quickly spreading throughout Dr. Trescott 's house . Mrs. Trescott is saved by a neighbor , but cannot locate Jimmie , who is trapped inside . Henry appears from the crowd and rushes into the house in search of the boy , finding him unharmed in his bedroom . Unable to retreat the way he came , Henry carries Jimmie , wrapped in a blanket , to the doctor 's laboratory and the hidden stairway that leads outside . He discovers the fire has blocked this way out as well and collapses beside Dr. Trescott 's desk . A row of nearby jars shatters from the heat , spilling molten chemicals upon Henry 's upturned face . 
 Dr. Trescott returns home to find his house ablaze ; after he is told by his hysterical wife that Jimmie is still inside , he rushes into the house by way of the laboratory 's hidden passageway . He finds Jimmie still wrapped in the blanket and carries him outside . Hearing that Henry is inside the house , Dr. Trescott attempts to re @-@ enter , but is held back . Another man goes into the house and returns with the badly burned " thing " that used to be Henry Johnson . The injured men and boy are taken to Judge Denning <unk> 's house across the street to be treated , but while it is thought that Dr. Trescott and Jimmie will survive their injuries , Henry is pronounced as good as dead ; he is mourned as a hero by the town . 
 Henry Johnson survives , however , under the watchful eye of Dr. Trescott , who treats the injured man out of gratitude for saving his son 's life . <unk> , a leading figure in town , urges Trescott to let Henry die , stating that he " will hereafter be a monster , a perfect monster , and probably with an affected brain . No man can observe you as I have observed you and not know that it was a matter of conscience with you , but I am afraid , my friend , that it is one of the blunders of virtue . " Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry , who has sustained disfiguring injuries to his face and psyche , to a local negro household , but Henry 's presence proves troubling for the family 's well @-@ being , and he is moved to another . One night Henry <unk> , visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake , including Bella Farragut , who he attempts to court as if no time has passed since they last met . Not welcome anywhere else , Henry is eventually moved to the carriage @-@ house in the newly built Trescott home . Despite Dr. Trescott 's protection , Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople , who avoid the <unk> as a result . Although previously Henry 's friend , Jimmie now mocks him , daring his friends to approach the disfigured man . Once the leading doctor in Whilomville , Trescott 's reputation suffers greatly , as does that of his wife , who no longer receives visitors . 
 = = Style = = 
 The story is told from the point of view of a selectively omniscient narrator who seemingly chooses whether or not to divulge plot points as they occur , causing " a pattern of expectation " on the part of the reader . Although the novella is separated into 24 chapters , some critics — among them Charles B. Ives , Thomas <unk> and Marston <unk> — believe these chapters are further divided into two parts : chapters 1 – 9 lead up to Henry 's injury , whereas chapters 10 – 24 map the town 's response . Critic David Halliburton wrote in his 1989 book The Color of the Sky : A Study of Stephen Crane that The Monster displayed a more " chastened " and exact style than Crane 's earlier works , which were often a mixture of clever bawdiness and epic dramatics — both of which are seen respectively in Maggie : A Girl of the Streets and The Red Badge of Courage . 
 Edwin H. Cady believed The Monster is the best indication of the writer Crane may have become had he lived longer , showcasing a style that is " technically proficient , controlled , and broadly insightful . " The Monster relies heavily on Crane 's signature use of imagery and symbolism . Frequent images and metaphors dealing with sight appear several times in the story , especially in regard to the townspeople 's lack of vision , both literally and morally . The townspeople are similarly depicted using imagery of either animals or machines , characterizing them as both bestial and mindless . Color imagery is also prevalent . For example , fire — both literal and symbolic — features prominently throughout the story . While critics as early as Edward Garnett in 1921 pointed to Crane 's heavy use of irony in The Monster , other critics such as Michael D. Warner question whether Crane intended the story to be read as ironic , or if this is the result of the author 's " oddly contradictory attitude toward his characters . " 
 In his introduction to 1921 's Men , Women and Boats , one of the first Crane anthologies , Vincent Starrett noted the difference in tone between The Monster and the 14 other tales that Crane set in the fictional Whilomville . He wrote , " The realism is painful ; one blushes for mankind . But while this story really belongs in the volume called Whilomville Stories , it is properly left out of that series . The Whilomville stories are pure comedy , and The Monster is a hideous tragedy . " Critic William M. Morgan noted the stories ' similar fascination with " pure animal spirits " and " meanings of boyhood " , but differentiated The Monster 's focus on " a larger , more mature , and modernizing community . " Paul Sorrentino also pointed to the style differences , noting the story 's focus on the adult characters rather than the children , as well as the overall length of the story ; at more than 21 @,@ 000 words , it dwarfs the other Whilomville tales . However , there is disagreement among critics as to whether The Monster should be considered a short story or a novella . Crane called it a " novelette " , and the Library of America edition refers to it as a novella . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The question of morality plays a large role in The Monster , especially in terms of compassion and tolerance . Several critics have pointed to the novella 's non @-@ absolute stance on these themes , mainly in regard to Dr. Trescott 's ethical dilemma in his devotion to Henry , a black man and his son 's savior . As author Patrick Dooley points out , " What is at stake in The Monster is that if Trescott is a moral man , Crane has rejected common @-@ sense morality . If Trescott 's actions are <unk> and saintly , however , he is to be applauded and admired , but the ordinary moral behavior of average people and the competence of everyday heroes will not have been expunged . " Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim also noted the duplicitous morality depicted by the town of Whilomville , which exhibits " prejudice , fear and isolation in an environment traditionally associated with <unk> and goodwill . " 
 Various critics have written about the story 's paradoxical themes of deformity and monstrosity . Not only does Henry Johnson suffer a literal and physical defacement that brands him a monster , but the <unk> ' suffer metaphorical loss of face when they are cast out by society . The trope of monstrosity takes on a second meaning when it becomes clear that the townspeople 's actions make them more monstrous than the man they shun for his deformity ; as professor and critic Lee Clark Mitchell asked in his essay , " Face , Race , and <unk> in Stephen Crane 's ' The Monster ' " , " Is ' the monster ' the disfigured black man or is it the town that comes to dis @-@ figure him ? " Similarly , Harold Bloom called The Monster an example of the " invasion myth " , made worse by the fact that the " monster " is born from within the townspeople 's collective mind . Henry @-@ the @-@ monster is therefore " generated by its fears of social instability , its prejudices about appearance ( including racism ) , and its all @-@ consuming passion for gossip and drama . " Trescott , the only man in town not to see Henry as an invader , also becomes ostracized by the frenzied small @-@ town mentality . 
 Race is a polarizing theme throughout the story . As William M. Morgan wrote , while the white characters are largely depicted as cold and humorless , and the black characters as warm and amusing , the town 's racial hierarchy is omnipresent . Slavery is referred to several times throughout the story , as critic Nan Goodman noted ; as a post @-@ Civil War work , The Monster revisits slavery 's legacy , as well as its effects on modern African Americans like Henry Johnson . At the beginning of the story , it is made clear that the white townspeople tolerate Henry because he " behaves himself " and " knows his place " as a black man . Later , when Henry struggles through the burning house to save Jimmie , it is said that " he was submitting , submitting because of his fathers , bending his mind in a most perfect slavery to this conflagration . " However , while his suffering is tantamount to the story , Henry Johnson is never really fleshed out as a character ; before the fire , he " strikes in quick succession the minstrel 's poses of an old @-@ time , happy @-@ go @-@ lucky Negro " , who charms children and women alike . Despite his heroism , Morgan stated , Henry does not stray far from a racial stereotype . Critics such as Lillian Gilkes and John R. Cooley have noted Crane 's lack of racial sensitivity while writing The Monster , although they note that the author was simply exhibiting " unconscious racism " in order to fulfill literary conventions of the late 19th century . In his 2002 essay , " <unk> of Virtue : The Problem of Race in Stephen Crane 's ' The Monster ' " , John <unk> sums up the critics ' tendency to either " ignore the evidence of Crane 's racism , to dismiss it as a cultural influence irrelevant to his larger purposes , or to reconfigure it within his irony in such a way as to enable the story and its author to achieve an unintended racial insight . " 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The Monster received mixed to positive reviews from critics . Before its publication , Crane 's friend Joseph Conrad wrote while responding to a partial draft : " the damned story has been haunting me .... I think it must be fine . " William Dean Howells , an early champion of Crane , proclaimed the novella to be " the greatest short story ever written by an American " . The Spectator concluded that The Monster alone would have cemented Crane 's literary reputation ; its reviewer wrote , " If Mr. Crane had never written anything else , he would have earned the right of remembrance by this story alone . " 
 The reviewer for The Critic dismissed it as " an unpleasant story .... There is humor in the telling , but it is humor of a rather grim character . " Julian Hawthorne , son of author Nathaniel Hawthorne , also ultimately disliked the novella , calling it " an outrage on art and humanity " . He did , however , point to the similarities between Crane 's " monster " and Victor Frankenstein 's creation in Mary Shelley 's most famous work , stating that Crane , like Shelley before him , successfully depicted an innocent outsider being tormented by townspeople who are themselves made monstrous by their irrational fears . Other critics have since echoed the comparison between Shelley 's character and Henry Johnson ; Elizabeth Young explained the parallels in that , similar to Frankenstein 's narrative — in which " a male body is hideously transformed in a scientist 's laboratory and brought back by the scientist from the dead — Johnson 's disfigurement takes place in a doctor 's laboratory , and it is Trescott that ultimately saves him . 
 The Monster and Other Stories was the last collection of Crane 's work to be published during his lifetime . In the mid @-@ 20th century , the novella received a resurgence of critical attention , especially in regard to studies of race relations in late 19th @-@ century New York . Critic Chester L. Wolford wrote that the story " reveals truths not socially accepted for almost another hundred years . The story is , indeed , an excoriation of social conditions for the blacks , but more important ... it is an excoriation of all communities , all societies , in all places and all times . " African @-@ American author Ralph Ellison called The Monster , alongside Mark Twain 's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , " one of the parents of the modern American novel " . In a 1999 article , critic James Nagel stated that " no other work of short fiction in the decade was more important thematically , and nothing until William Faulkner 's " The Bear " so enriched the genre of the United States . Screenwriter and director Albert Band adapted Crane 's novella for the 1959 film Face of Fire , starring Cameron Mitchell as Dr. Trescott and James Whitmore as Johnson . Unlike in the original story , Johnson was depicted as white , and his first name was changed from Henry to Monk . 
 = Syphilis = 
 Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum . The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents ( primary , secondary , latent , and tertiary ) . The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre ( a firm , painless , non @-@ itchy skin ulceration ) but there may be multiple sores . In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet occurs . There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina . In latent syphilis there are little to no symptoms which can last for years . In tertiary syphilis there are <unk> ( soft non @-@ cancerous growths ) , neurological , or heart symptoms . Syphilis has been known as " the great imitator " as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases . 
 Syphilis is most commonly spread through sexual activity . It may also be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth , resulting in congenital syphilis . Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum include <unk> ( subspecies <unk> ) , <unk> ( subspecies <unk> ) , and <unk> ( subspecies <unk> ) . Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests ; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy . The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested . 
 The risk of syphilis can be decreased by latex condom use or not having sex . Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics . The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a muscle . In those who have a severe penicillin allergy , doxycycline or tetracycline may be used . In those with neurosyphilis intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended . During treatment people may develop fever , headache , and muscle pains , a reaction known as Jarisch @-@ Herxheimer . 
 In 2013 syphilis infected about 315 @,@ 000 people . During 2010 it caused about 113 @,@ 000 deaths down from 202 @,@ 000 in 1990 . After decreasing dramatically with the availability of penicillin in the 1940s , rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries , often in combination with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . This is believed to be partly due to increased promiscuity , prostitution , decreasing use of condoms , and unsafe sexual practices among men who have sex with men . In 2015 , Cuba became the first country in the world to eliminate mother @-@ to @-@ child transmission of syphilis . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Syphilis can present in one of four different stages : primary , secondary , latent , and tertiary , and may also occur congenitally . It was referred to as " the great imitator " by Sir William Osler due to its varied presentations . 
 = = = Primary = = = 
 Primary syphilis is typically acquired by direct sexual contact with the infectious lesions of another person . Approximately 3 to 90 days after the initial exposure ( average 21 days ) a skin lesion , called a chancre , appears at the point of contact . This is classically ( 40 % of the time ) a single , firm , painless , non @-@ itchy skin ulceration with a clean base and sharp borders between 0 @.@ 3 and 3 @.@ 0 cm in size . The lesion may take on almost any form . In the classic form , it evolves from a <unk> to a <unk> and finally to an erosion or ulcer . Occasionally , multiple lesions may be present ( ~ 40 % ) , with multiple lesions more common when coinfected with HIV . Lesions may be painful or tender ( 30 % ) , and they may occur outside of the genitals ( 2 – 7 % ) . The most common location in women is the cervix ( 44 % ) , the penis in heterosexual men ( 99 % ) , and anally and rectally relatively commonly in men who have sex with men ( 34 % ) . <unk> node enlargement frequently ( 80 % ) occurs around the area of infection , occurring seven to 10 days after chancre formation . The lesion may persist for three to six weeks without treatment . 
 = = = Secondary = = = 
 Secondary syphilis occurs approximately four to ten weeks after the primary infection . While secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest , symptoms most commonly involve the skin , mucous membranes , and lymph nodes . There may be a symmetrical , reddish @-@ pink , non @-@ itchy rash on the trunk and extremities , including the palms and soles . The rash may become maculopapular or pustular . It may form flat , broad , whitish , wart @-@ like lesions known as <unk> <unk> on mucous membranes . All of these lesions harbor bacteria and are infectious . Other symptoms may include fever , sore throat , malaise , weight loss , hair loss , and headache . Rare manifestations include liver inflammation , kidney disease , joint inflammation , <unk> , inflammation of the optic nerve , uveitis , and interstitial keratitis . The acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks ; about 25 % of people may present with a recurrence of secondary symptoms . Many people who present with secondary syphilis ( 40 – 85 % of women , 20 – 65 % of men ) do not report previously having had the classic chancre of primary syphilis . 
 = = = Latent = = = 
 Latent syphilis is defined as having serologic proof of infection without symptoms of disease . It is further described as either early ( less than 1 year after secondary syphilis ) or late ( more than 1 year after secondary syphilis ) in the United States . The United Kingdom uses a cut @-@ off of two years for early and late latent syphilis . Early latent syphilis may have a relapse of symptoms . Late latent syphilis is asymptomatic , and not as contagious as early latent syphilis . 
 = = = Tertiary = = = 
 Tertiary syphilis may occur approximately 3 to 15 years after the initial infection , and may be divided into three different forms : <unk> syphilis ( 15 % ) , late neurosyphilis ( 6 @.@ 5 % ) , and cardiovascular syphilis ( 10 % ) . Without treatment , a third of infected people develop tertiary disease . People with tertiary syphilis are not infectious . 
 <unk> syphilis or late benign syphilis usually occurs 1 to 46 years after the initial infection , with an average of 15 years . This stage is characterized by the formation of chronic <unk> , which are soft , tumor @-@ like balls of inflammation which may vary considerably in size . They typically affect the skin , bone , and liver , but can occur anywhere . 
 Neurosyphilis refers to an infection involving the central nervous system . It may occur early , being either asymptomatic or in the form of syphilitic meningitis , or late as <unk> syphilis , general paresis , or <unk> dorsalis , which is associated with poor balance and lightning pains in the lower extremities . Late neurosyphilis typically occurs 4 to 25 years after the initial infection . <unk> syphilis typically presents with apathy and seizure , and general paresis with dementia and <unk> dorsalis . Also , there may be Argyll Robertson pupils , which are bilateral small pupils that constrict when the person focuses on near objects but do not constrict when exposed to bright light . 
 Cardiovascular syphilis usually occurs 10 – 30 years after the initial infection . The most common complication is syphilitic <unk> , which may result in aneurysm formation . 
 = = = Congenital = = = 
 Congenital syphilis is that which is transmitted during pregnancy or during birth . Two @-@ thirds of syphilitic infants are born without symptoms . Common symptoms that develop over the first couple of years of life include enlargement of the liver and spleen ( 70 % ) , rash ( 70 % ) , fever ( 40 % ) , neurosyphilis ( 20 % ) , and lung inflammation ( 20 % ) . If untreated , late congenital syphilis may occur in 40 % , including saddle nose deformation , <unk> sign , saber shin , or Clutton 's joints among others . 
 = = Cause = = 
 = = = Bacteriology = = = 
 Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum is a spiral @-@ shaped , Gram @-@ negative , highly mobile bacterium . Three other human diseases are caused by related Treponema pallidum , including <unk> ( subspecies <unk> ) , <unk> ( subspecies <unk> ) and <unk> ( subspecies <unk> ) . Unlike subtype pallidum , they do not cause neurological disease . Humans are the only known natural reservoir for subspecies pallidum . It is unable to survive without a host for more than a few days . This is due to its small genome ( 1 @.@ 14 <unk> ) failing to encode the metabolic pathways necessary to make most of its <unk> . It has a slow doubling time of greater than 30 hours . 
 = = = Transmission = = = 
 Syphilis is transmitted primarily by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her fetus ; the <unk> is able to pass through intact mucous membranes or compromised skin . It is thus transmissible by kissing near a lesion , as well as oral , vaginal , and anal sex . Approximately 30 to 60 % of those exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease . Its infectivity is exemplified by the fact that an individual inoculated with only 57 organisms has a 50 % chance of being infected . Most ( 60 % ) of new cases in the United States occur in men who have sex with men . It can be transmitted by blood products . It is tested for in many countries and thus the risk is low . The risk of transmission from sharing needles appears limited . 
 It is not generally possible to contract syphilis through toilet seats , daily activities , hot tubs , or sharing eating utensils or clothing . This is mainly because the bacteria die very quickly outside of the body , making transmission by objects extremely difficult . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Syphilis is difficult to diagnose clinically early in its presentation . Confirmation is either via blood tests or direct visual inspection using microscopy . Blood tests are more commonly used , as they are easier to perform . Diagnostic tests are unable to distinguish between the stages of the disease . 
 = = = Blood tests = = = 
 Blood tests are divided into <unk> and treponemal tests . <unk> tests are used initially , and include venereal disease research laboratory ( <unk> ) and rapid plasma <unk> tests . As these tests are occasionally false positives , confirmation is required with a treponemal test , such as treponemal pallidum particle agglutination ( <unk> ) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test ( FTA @-@ Abs ) . False positives on the <unk> tests can occur with some viral infections such as varicella ( chickenpox ) and measles , as well as with lymphoma , tuberculosis , malaria , endocarditis , connective tissue disease , and pregnancy . <unk> antibody tests usually become positive two to five weeks after the initial infection . Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of leukocytes ( predominately lymphocytes ) and high protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in the setting of a known syphilis infection . 
 = = = Direct testing = = = 
 Dark ground microscopy of serous fluid from a chancre may be used to make an immediate diagnosis . Hospitals do not always have equipment or experienced staff members , whereas testing must be done within 10 minutes of acquiring the sample . Sensitivity has been reported to be nearly 80 % , thus can only be used to confirm a diagnosis but not rule one out . Two other tests can be carried out on a sample from the chancre : direct fluorescent antibody testing and nucleic acid amplification tests . Direct fluorescent testing uses antibodies tagged with fluorescein , which attach to specific syphilis proteins , while nucleic acid amplification uses techniques , such as the polymerase chain reaction , to detect the presence of specific syphilis genes . These tests are not as time @-@ sensitive , as they do not require living bacteria to make the diagnosis . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 = = = Vaccine = = = 
 As of 2010 , there is no vaccine effective for prevention . Several vaccines based on treponemal proteins reduce lesion development in an animal model , and research is ongoing . 
 = = = Sex = = = 
 Abstinence from intimate physical contact with an infected person is effective at reducing the transmission of syphilis , as is the proper use of a latex condom . Condom use does not completely eliminate the risk . Thus , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a long @-@ term , mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner and the avoidance of substances such as alcohol and other drugs that increase risky sexual behavior . 
 = = = Congenital disease = = = 
 Congenital syphilis in the newborn can be prevented by screening mothers during early pregnancy and treating those who are infected . The United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) strongly recommends universal screening of all pregnant women , while the World Health Organization recommends all women be tested at their first antenatal visit and again in the third trimester . If they are positive , they recommend their partners also be treated . Congenital syphilis is still common in the developing world , as many women do not receive antenatal care at all , and the antenatal care others receive does not include screening , and it still occasionally occurs in the developed world , as those most likely to acquire syphilis ( through drug use , etc . ) are least likely to receive care during pregnancy . Several measures to increase access to testing appear effective at reducing rates of congenital syphilis in low- to middle @-@ income countries . Point @-@ of @-@ care testing to detect syphilis appeared to be good although more research is needed to assess its effectiveness and into improving outcomes in mothers and babies . 
 = = = Screening = = = 
 The CDC recommends that sexually active men who have sex with men be tested at least yearly . The USPSTF also recommends screening among those at high risk . 
 Syphilis is a notifiable disease in many countries , including Canada the European Union , and the United States . This means health care providers are required to notify public health authorities , which will then ideally provide partner notification to the person 's partners . Physicians may also encourage patients to send their partners to seek care . Several strategies have been found to improve follow @-@ up for STI testing including email and text messaging as reminders of appointments . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 = = = Early infections = = = 
 The first @-@ choice treatment for uncomplicated syphilis remains a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G. <unk> and tetracycline are alternative choices for those allergic to penicillin ; due to the risk of birth defects these are not recommended for pregnant women . Resistance to macrolides , <unk> , and clindamycin is often present . <unk> , a third @-@ generation <unk> antibiotic , may be as effective as penicillin @-@ based treatment . It is recommended that a treated person avoid sex until the sores are healed . 
 = = = Late infections = = = 
 For neurosyphilis , due to the poor penetration of penicillin G into the central nervous system , those affected are recommended to be given large doses of intravenous penicillin for a minimum of 10 days . If a person is allergic , ceftriaxone may be used or penicillin desensitization attempted . Other late presentations may be treated with once @-@ weekly intramuscular penicillin G for three weeks . If allergic , as in the case of early disease , doxycycline or tetracycline may be used , albeit for a longer duration . Treatment at this stage limits further progression but has only slight effect on damage which has already occurred . 
 = = = Jarisch @-@ Herxheimer reaction = = = 
 One of the potential side effects of treatment is the Jarisch @-@ Herxheimer reaction . It frequently starts within one hour and lasts for 24 hours , with symptoms of fever , muscle pains , headache , and a fast heart rate . It is caused by cytokines released by the immune system in response to lipoproteins released from rupturing syphilis bacteria . 
 = = = Pregnancy = = = 
 Penicillin is an effective treatment for syphilis in pregnancy but there is no agreement on which dose or way of giving it is most effective . More research is needed into how much antibiotic to give and when to give it . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 In 2013 syphilis infected about 315 @,@ 000 people . Syphilis is believed to have infected 12 million additional people in 1999 , with greater than 90 % of cases in the developing world . It affects between 700 @,@ 000 and 1 @.@ 6 million pregnancies a year , resulting in spontaneous abortions , stillbirths , and congenital syphilis . During 2010 it caused about 113 @,@ 000 deaths down from 202 @,@ 000 in 1990 . In sub @-@ Saharan Africa , syphilis contributes to approximately 20 % of perinatal deaths . Rates are proportionally higher among intravenous drug users , those who are infected with HIV , and men who have sex with men . In the United States , rates of syphilis as of 2007 were six times greater in men than women ; they were nearly equal in 1997 . African Americans accounted for almost half of all cases in 2010 . As of 2014 , syphilis infections continue to increase in the United States . 
 Syphilis was very common in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries . Flaubert found it universal among nineteenth @-@ century Egyptian prostitutes . In the developed world during the early 20th century , infections declined rapidly with the widespread use of antibiotics , until the 1980s and 1990s . Since 2000 , rates of syphilis have been increasing in the USA , Canada , the UK , Australia and Europe , primarily among men who have sex with men . Rates of syphilis among American women have remained stable during this time , and rates among UK women have increased , but at a rate less than that of men . Increased rates among heterosexuals have occurred in China and Russia since the 1990s . This has been attributed to unsafe sexual practices , such as sexual promiscuity , prostitution , and decreasing use of barrier protection . 
 Untreated , it has a mortality of 8 % to 58 % , with a greater death rate in males . The symptoms of syphilis have become less severe over the 19th and 20th centuries , in part due to widespread availability of effective treatment and partly due to decreasing virulence of the spirochaete . With early treatment , few complications result . Syphilis increases the risk of HIV transmission by two to five times , and <unk> is common ( 30 – 60 % in some urban centers ) . In 2015 Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother to child transmission of syphilis . 
 = = History = = 
 The exact origin of syphilis is disputed . Syphilis was indisputably present in the Americas before European contact . The dispute is over whether or not syphilis was also present elsewhere in the world at that time . One of the two primary hypotheses proposes that syphilis was carried from the Americas to Europe by the returning crewmen from Christopher Columbus 's voyage to the Americas . The other hypothesis says that syphilis existed in Europe previously , but went unrecognized until shortly after Columbus ' return . These are referred to as the Columbian and pre @-@ Columbian hypotheses , respectively . The Columbian hypothesis is best supported by the available evidence . The first written records of an outbreak of syphilis in Europe occurred in 1494 or 1495 in Naples , Italy , during a French invasion ( Italian War of 1494 – 98 ) . As it was claimed to have been spread by French troops , it was initially known as the " French disease " by the people of Naples . In 1530 , the pastoral name " syphilis " ( the name of a character ) was first used by the Italian physician and poet Girolamo <unk> as the title of his Latin poem in dactylic hexameter describing the ravages of the disease in Italy . It was also known historically as the " Great Pox " . 
 The causative organism , Treponema pallidum , was first identified by Fritz <unk> and Erich Hoffmann in 1905 . The first effective treatment ( Salvarsan ) was developed in 1910 by Paul Ehrlich , which was followed by trials of penicillin and confirmation of its effectiveness in 1943 . Before the discovery and use of antibiotics in the mid @-@ twentieth century , mercury and isolation were commonly used , with treatments often worse than the disease . 
 Many famous historical figures , including Franz Schubert , Arthur Schopenhauer , and Édouard Manet , are believed to have had the disease . Friedrich Nietzsche was long believed to have gone mad as a result of tertiary syphilis , but that diagnosis has recently come into question . 
 = = = Arts and literature = = = 
 The earliest known depiction of an individual with syphilis is Albrecht Dürer 's <unk> Man , a woodcut believed to represent a <unk> , a Northern European mercenary . The myth of the femme fatale or " poison women " of the 19th century is believed to be partly derived from the devastation of syphilis , with classic examples in literature including John Keats ' La Belle Dame sans Merci . 
 The artist Jan van der <unk> painted a scene of a wealthy man receiving treatment for syphilis with the tropical wood <unk> sometime around 1580 . The title of the work is " Preparation and Use of <unk> for Treating Syphilis " . That the artist chose to include this image in a series of works celebrating the New World indicates how important a treatment , however ineffective , for syphilis was to the European elite at that time . The richly colored and detailed work depicts four servants preparing the concoction while a physician looks on , hiding something behind his back while the hapless patient drinks . 
 = = = Tuskegee and Guatemala studies = = = 
 One of the most infamous United States cases of questionable medical ethics in the 20th century was the Tuskegee syphilis study . The study took place in Tuskegee , Alabama , and was supported by the U.S. Public Health Service ( <unk> ) in partnership with the Tuskegee Institute . The study began in 1932 , when syphilis was a widespread problem and there was no safe and effective treatment . The study was designed to measure the progression of untreated syphilis . By 1947 , penicillin had been shown to be an effective cure for early syphilis and was becoming widely used to treat the disease . Its use in later syphilis was still unclear . Study directors continued the study and did not offer the participants treatment with penicillin . This is debated , and some have found that penicillin was given to many of the subjects . 
 In the 1960s , Peter <unk> sent a letter to the CDC , who controlled the study , expressing concern about the ethics of letting hundreds of black men die of a disease that could be cured . The CDC asserted that it needed to continue the study until all of the men had died . In 1972 , Buxton went to the mainstream press , causing a public outcry . As a result , the program was terminated , a lawsuit brought those affected nine million dollars , and Congress created a commission empowered to write regulations to deter such abuses from occurring in the future . 
 On 16 May 1997 , thanks to the efforts of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee formed in 1994 , survivors of the study were invited to the White House to be present when President Bill Clinton apologized on behalf of the United States government for the study . 
 Syphilis experiments were also carried out in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948 . They were United States @-@ sponsored human experiments , conducted during the government of Juan José Arévalo with the cooperation of some Guatemalan health ministries and officials . Doctors infected soldiers , prisoners , and mental patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases , without the informed consent of the subjects , and then treated them with antibiotics . In October 2010 , the U.S. formally apologized to Guatemala for conducting these experiments .

 The Yale Union Laundry Building , also known as the Yale Laundry Building , the City Linen Supply Co . Building , Perfect Fit Manufacturing and simply Yale Union ( YU ) , in southeast Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon is a two @-@ story commercial structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Built largely of brick in 1908 and embellished with Italian Revival and Egyptian Revival decorations , it was added to the register in 2007 . Two @-@ story additions in 1927 and 1929 changed the original building into an L @-@ shaped structure that shares a party wall with a commercial building to the east . 
 Preservation of elements of Portland 's industrial laundry era and its relation to the women ’ s labor movement and the rise of the middle class in the United States are factors in the building 's listing on the National Register . Built and first operated by Charles F. Brown , an individual businessman , the building was bought in 1927 by Home Services Company , a power @-@ laundry consortium . American Linen Supply and then Perfect Fit Manufacturing , a maker of automotive fabrics , used the building after Home Services sold it in 1950 .

Italianate Renaissance influence is seen in the large arched windows on the ground floor and tall narrow windows on the second . The west facade is lined with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas . Other important features of the exterior include a large garage door along Belmont Street and a paved parking lot and water @-@ tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side . 
 The original building 's main floor has vaulted ceilings , large windows , brick walls , a flat roof , and wooden cross beams . The mezzanine consists of three rooms . The second floor has large windows and vaulted ceilings , restrooms , and a lunchroom . Stairs and elevators connect the levels , including the basement and its boiler room . A lobby and office in the southwest corner of the main floor can be entered from inside or via the original main door off Southeast 10th Avenue . 
 Following purchase in 2008 , renovations began to convert the building into a contemporary arts center . Architects designed gallery spaces , a bookstore and cafe , a 100 @-@ seat room , library and kitchen . Geothermal heating supplied by an aquifer underneath the building will contribute to the goal of LEED Platinum status . 
 = = History = = 
 The Yale Union Laundry Building was built to house a commercial laundry during an era , roughly 1900 to 1950 , in which many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home . Before the invention of the steam laundry machine in the mid @-@ 19th century , women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards , wooden tubs , and clothes lines . Steam @-@ driven washing machines and equipment for <unk> , ironing , and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible by the turn of the century . 
 In 1908 , Charles F. Brown , who entered the laundry business in the Midwest in 1892 , moved to Portland to build the Yale Laundry Building and to operate an industrial power laundry on its premises . The building 's basement contained boilers to heat wash water , and the main part of the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy washing machines . The first and second floor had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam . At the time of the building 's construction , Portland had 68 commercial laundries of varied types and sizes . By 1916 , the Yale Laundry , one of the larger laundries , employed 125 people , many of whom were women . 
 Federal and state laws regulating hours , wages , and working conditions changed markedly in the United States during the early 20th century . The state 's Industrial Welfare Commission , established in 1913 , ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week and that work days were not to exceed 9 hours . The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $ 8 @.@ 25 for women working in Portland 's laundries . By 1917 , the work day was reduced to an eight @-@ hour maximum . In 1920 , to lower costs related to regulations and the rise of organized labor , several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company . The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle @-@ class families . The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927 . 
 By 1931 , more than 80 percent of the services offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families . However , as the Great Depression continued , many people could no longer afford the services , and business declined . The decline continued after World War II , when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to a large fraction of the populace . As individual customers disappeared , factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing of diapers or linens . In 1950 , the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company . In 1959 , Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers , tire covers , and other automotive fabrics . Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006 .

 = Zapata rail = 
 The Zapata rail ( Cyanolimnas <unk> ) is a medium @-@ sized , dark @-@ coloured rail , the only member of the monotypic genus Cyanolimnas . It has brown upperparts , greyish @-@ blue underparts , a red @-@ based yellow bill , white undertail coverts , and red eyes and legs . Its short wings render it almost flightless . It is endemic to the wetlands of the Zapata Peninsula in southern Cuba , where its only known nest was found in sawgrass tussocks . Little is known of its diet or reproductive behaviour , and its described calls may belong to a different species . 
 The Zapata rail was discovered by Spanish zoologist Fermín <unk> Cervera in March 1927 in the Zapata Swamp near Santo Tomás , in the southern Matanzas Province of Cuba . The swamp holds one other bird found nowhere else , the Zapata wren , and also gives its name to the Zapata sparrow . Due to ongoing habitat loss in its limited range , its small population size , and predation by introduced mammals and catfish , the Zapata rail is evaluated as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of threatened species . Tourism and climate change may pose threats in the future . 
 = = Discovery and taxonomy = = 
 The Zapata rail was formally described by American herpetologist Thomas Barbour and his compatriot , ornithologist James Lee Peters , in 1927 . They considered it distinctive enough to merit its own genus , Cyanolimnas . The genus name derives from Ancient Greek <unk> " dark blue " and Modern Latin <unk> " rail or crake " ; the specific name <unk> honours the rail 's discoverer , Fermín <unk> Cervera , a Spanish soldier who had stayed on after the Spanish – American War and became a professional naturalist . 
 Barbour had been accompanied by the Spaniard on his previous visits to Cuba , and on hearing of the strange birds to be found in the Zapata area , he sent Cervera on a series of trips into the region . Cervera eventually found the rail near the very small settlement which is commemorated in the Spanish name for the rail , " <unk> de Santo Tomás " . Cervera also discovered the Zapata wren and the Zapata sparrow , and his name is commemorated by the new ecological centre in the Ciénaga de Zapata National Park . 
 The rail family contains more than 150 species divided into at least 50 genera , the exact number depending on the authority . The Zapata rail is the only member of the genus Cyanolimnas , and is considered to be intermediate between two other New World genera , <unk> and <unk> . All six species in the three genera are long @-@ billed , five have drab plumage , and all but one have a red spot at the bill base . They are believed to be descended from Amaurornis @-@ like ancestral stock . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Zapata rail is a medium @-@ sized , dark rail , approximately 29 cm ( 11 @.@ 4 in ) long . The upperparts are olive @-@ brown and the forehead , head sides and underparts are slate @-@ grey , with some white barring on the lower belly . The flanks are grey @-@ brown and the undertail is white . The iris , legs and feet are red , and the bill is yellow with a red base . The tail feathers are only sparsely barbed , and the wings are very short and rounded . The sexes are similar in appearance , but immature birds are duller and have olive feet and bill ; the chicks , as with all rails , are covered with blackish down . The Zapata rail 's call is described as a bouncing cutucutu @-@ cutucutu @-@ cutucutu similar to that of the bare @-@ legged owl , and a loud limpkin @-@ like <unk> <unk> . However , these calls may actually be those of the spotted rail . 
 There are no similar species in Cuba ; the sympatric spotted rail is much the same size , but is heavily spotted and barred with white . The Zapata rail 's plumage is intermediate between those of Colombian crake and plumbeous rail , but these are mainland birds of Central and South America . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Zapata rail is a Cuban endemic restricted to the northern part of the 4500 km2 ( 1740 mi2 ) Zapata Swamp , which is also the only location for the Zapata wren , and the nominate subspecies of the Zapata sparrow . The favoured habitat of the Zapata rail is flooded vegetation , 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 0 m ( 60 – 80 in ) tall , consisting of tangled , bush @-@ covered swamp and low trees , and preferably near higher ground . Typical plants of the swamp are wax myrtle , the willow Salix longipes , the sawgrass Cladium jamaicensis , and the narrow leaf cattail . 
 The rail was once more widespread , with fossil bones found at Havana , Pinar del Río and the Isla de la Juventud . Barbour did not believe that the rail , Zapata sparrow and Zapata wren were relics in the sense that they once ranged widely over Cuba ( as did , for example , the dwarf hutia and the Cuban crocodile ) , since the birds are so highly modified for swamp conditions . He considered that conditions similar to those found today may once have extended over the large submerged area now represented by the shallow banks , with scattered mangrove keys , which stretch towards the Isla de la Juventud and perhaps eastward along the southern Cuban coast . The birds fossilized at Isla de la Juventud are smaller than the single extant specimen , but the paucity of available material makes it impossible to establish whether the populations were genuinely different . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The Zapata rail usually breeds in Cladium jamaicensis sawgrass , building the nest above water @-@ level on a raised tussock . Breeding occurs around September , and possibly also in December and January . American ornithologist James Bond found a nest containing three white eggs 60 cm ( 2 ft ) above water level in sawgrass , but little else is known of the breeding biology . Rails are usually monogamous , and all have precocial chicks which are fed and guarded by the adults . 
 The animal prefers to feed in sawgrass . The diet is not recorded , but most marsh rails are omnivorous , feeding on invertebrates and plant material . The rails may disperse in the rainy season , returning to permanently flooded areas in the dry months . 
 Like other rails , this species is difficult to observe as it moves through the sawgrass , and may crouch to avoid detection , but is not usually particularly wary . When disturbed , it may run a short distance and then stop with its tail raised and the conspicuous white undertail showing . Despite its short wings , the Zapata rail may not be completely flightless . On morphological grounds it would be classed as a flightless species , since the pectoral girdle and wing are as reduced as in other species of rails that are considered to be flightless , but Bond reported that he saw one flutter about ten feet across a canal . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 Island species of rails are particularly vulnerable to population loss since they frequently and rapidly evolve to become flightless or very weak fliers , and are very susceptible to introduced predators . Fifteen species have become extinct since 1600 , and more than 30 are endangered . 
 The Zapata rail appears to have been easily found in the Santo Tomás area until 1931 , but there were no further records until the 1970s when birds were found 65 km ( 40 mi ) away at Laguna del Tesoro . The few records in subsequent years suggest that numbers remain low , although after no official sightings for two decades , a 1998 survey found the birds at two new locations in the Zapata Swamp . Ten rails were detected at Peralta , and seven at Hato de <unk> . On the basis of this sample it was estimated that 70 – 90 rails were present in the 230 hectares ( 570 acres ) between the two sites . 
 The Zapata rail is restricted to a single area , with an extent of about 1 @,@ 000 km2 ( 400 mi2 ) , and its small population , estimated on the basis of recent surveys and local assessments of population densities at between 250 – 1 @,@ 000 individuals , is assessed as decreasing . In the past , grass @-@ cutting for roof thatch was a cause of extensive loss of breeding habitat , and habitat loss through dry @-@ season burning of the vegetation continues . Predation by introduced small Asian mongooses and rats is a problem and , more recently , introduced African sharptooth catfish ( Clarias <unk> ) have been identified as major predators of rail chicks . 
 The Zapata rail was classified as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List until 2011 , when its status was uplisted to critically endangered . This had already been suggested since , given the lack of knowledge about its calls , the rail 's population may be lower than currently estimated . 
 Two remaining sites are in protected areas : the Corral de Santo Tomás Faunal Refuge , and the Laguna del Tesoro nature tourism area . Surveys have recently been conducted throughout the species ' range and proposed conservation measures include the control of dry season burning . 
 = = = Future threats = = = 
 There are plans to encourage more tourists to visit the Zapata area , particularly from Europe , and if the United States allows its citizens to visit Cuba in the future this could further increase the effects of ecotourism . This might have a dangerous impact on the wetland , but Cuba 's Tourism Minister , Manuel Marrero , and Pablo Bouza , the director of the Ciénaga de Zapata National Park , both said that the increase in tourism would be sustainable . 
 In the longer term , the Ramsar @-@ listed swamp itself may be threatened . Rising sea levels due to global warming could contaminate the wetland with saltwater , damaging the plants and fauna , and by 2100 the area of Ciénaga de Zapata would be reduced by one @-@ fifth . Higher ocean temperatures resulting from climate change could also lead to stronger hurricanes and drought . Bouza warned that the fallen vegetation left by hurricanes could act as fuel for further damaging fires once it had dried out .

 Mount Osmond is a small suburb of 2 @,@ 497 people in the South Australian capital city of Adelaide . It is part of the City of Burnside local government area and located in the foothills of the Adelaide Hills , five kilometres south east of the city centre . The suburb is high on the hill of the same name , which is the last hill on the right when approaching Adelaide down the South Eastern Freeway before the road levels out onto the Adelaide Plains . It is bounded to the north by the suburb of Beaumont , to the north @-@ east by Burnside , to the east by Waterfall Gully , to the south by Leawood Gardens / Eagle On The Hill , to the south @-@ west by <unk> , to the west by Glen Osmond and to the north @-@ west by St Georges . 
 The suburb is at a high elevation in the Mount Lofty Ranges , and provides views over Adelaide as well as containing a renowned golf course and country club . Mining operations in the 19th century gave the area notoriety , but it has since developed slowly into a small , quiet and secluded suburb .

 Mount Osmond is within the traditional lands of the Kaurna people , and forms part of the Mount Lofty Ranges and is therefore part of the Dreamtime story of the ancestor @-@ creator Nganno . According to the legend , Nganno was wounded in a battle and laid down to die , forming the Mount Lofty Ranges . 
 = = = European settlement = = = 
 When Adelaide was first planned and mapped out by Col. William Light , Mount Osmond received the three allotments 1070 , 1277 and 1278 . While much of Adelaide was relatively quickly bought ( but not necessarily settled ) Mount Osmond did not enjoy any early buyers . The first reported activity in the area was after the mining rush of Glen Osmond due to the Wheal Watkins and Wheal Gawler mines . Lot 1277 yielded a mine in Slaughterhouse Gully but it was worked only briefly . Subsequent finds of bluestone proved fruitful and the mineral was extracted until 1900 , when mining ended and the last of the mines were either filled in or cordoned off . 
 Developers eventually bought the lots that composed Mount Osmond but once again interest in the suburb was minor . Attempts to bring in settlers culminated in the construction of Mount Osmond Road in 1882 . It wound around the hills from where it began as an offshoot of Mount Barker Road in the South . Developers broke down the three large lots into roughly two hundred 1 @-@ acre ( 4 @,@ 000 m2 ) ones in the hope of sales . A few lots were sold to quarrymen and gardeners around Mount Barker Road , but the vast remainder was leased to <unk> as pasture for their livestock . Much of Mount Osmond , along with a large portion of the surrounding area , was bought in 1907 by Ernest C. Sanders . His family made great use of the land , with his sons building houses on the vast property while raising sheep and growing hay . Considerable time was spent by the Sanders family in naming and mapping the area . 
 The Sanders family eventually decided to sell much of their portion of Mount Osmond , and around 1922 – 23 it was put on the market . Like earlier attempts at sales on Mount Osmond , little interest was received and none was sold until 1925 . The land was developed into a golf course and Country Club with the assistance of the Burnside Council and its engineers . Credit to the novel idea went to <unk> Melbourne , Burnside 's chief engineer at the time – who found support among numerous Burnside Councillors . The golf course and country club were developed on the highest part of the mount , on 85 acres ( 34 ha ) of former Sanders estate . The remaining land was sold by the country club to buyers with strict rules on the development and maintenance of the properties – specific rules applying to aesthetic features , particularly gardens , are of note . Even with a golf course and country club in the vicinity , as well as electricity and a water supply from Waterfall Gully 's first creek the eighteen marketed lots once again sold poorly . 
 One of the last large land purchases was that of Ross Thiem in the 1940s . A club member , C.W. Lloyd , sold 200 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) around the golf course , which was again used as pasture by Thiem , who ran sheep on the property – and was the last to do so . The then Highways Department also acquired land in 1951 , buying 200 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) of land above Beaumont for future transport planning . Thiem 's land was eventually sold in the 1950s , to the Rossdale Property Co . Their subsequent attempts at selling the land were just as fruitless as those before , and once again the property changed hands to the Mount Osmond Heights Pty Ltd . The land was newly subdivided , and it was in the late 1960s that finally much of Mount Osmond was sold to residential buyers . Fifty @-@ two out of the 116 new sites had been sold by 12 October 1968 at an average of $ 3 @,@ 500 , according to the Adelaide daily The Advertiser . Since the land sales of that era , Mount Osmond has developed slowly because of the scarcity of land and the housing and development restrictions of the Hills Face Zone . Now the suburb is home to large , extravagant , tree @-@ filled houses and properties . With the upgrade of Mount Barker Road to become part of the South Eastern Freeway from 1997 , Mount Osmond received its own freeway interchange as part of the development . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Mount Osmond is composed of the Mount itself and a ridge ( Long Ridge ) stretching out to the south @-@ east between the valley of the South Eastern Freeway and that of Waterfall Gully . Much of the suburb is more than 300 metres above sea level , with the Mount Osmond peak itself ( located in the Golf Course grounds near the club house ) at 384 metres . Between the north @-@ east and north @-@ west are slopes leading down to the suburbs of Beaumont , Glen Osmond and Waterfall Gully , most of which is owned as public land by various government departments – either as parks , tracks or vacant land for possible future use . A somewhat " ring " of reserves exist on the slopes anti @-@ clockwise from the Old Bullock Track to Mount Osmond Road near the freeway interchange . The South Australian Department of Environment , Water and Natural Resources is responsible for maintaining the Mount Osmond Reserve , which is accessible via Dashwood Gully Reserve and Waterfall Gully Road . 
 The Old Bullock / Long Ridge track runs along Long Ridge towards Eagle on the Hill . Much of the housing and residential properties are on the North @-@ West side of the Mount , as to enable views over Adelaide . A few small settlements and paddocks with livestock ( sheep , goats and deer ) are still present on the slopes between the South Eastern Freeway and the Long Ridge Track . 
 While the suburb still contains a notable amount of native vegetation , and has not been exposed to invasive introduced species like other areas have , much of it was originally cleared for grazing and has yet to grow back to the same extent . Before European Settlement Grey Box , SA Blue Gum , Sheoak , Manna Gum and River Red Gum trees were native to and grew in the area , particularly on the slopes leading down to the Adelaide Plains . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Due to the suburb 's relative isolation and hilly geography , it contains very few roads and does not conform to Adelaide 's typical grid pattern – despite the suburb 's age . The earliest road to be built was Mount Osmond Road , and done so by early developers in 1882 to make the suburb more attractive to prospective buyers . Mount Osmond Road remains one of two sealed roads which can today access Mount Osmond and is located to the south of the suburb . It begins as the first interchange on the South Eastern Freeway ( formerly Mount Barker Road ) and then winds around the Mount to the top of the mount and around the golf course . The other sealed road that provides access to Mount Osmond is Hayward Drive , which starts in Beaumont and then winds around the hills to meet the rest of the suburb 's road network . 
 Numerous fire and walking tracks , among them the Old Bullock Track and the Pioneer Women 's Heritage Trail , also access Mount Osmond from Waterfall Gully , Eagle On The Hill , Beaumont and Glen Osmond . Public transport is provided by the Adelaide Metro , but no buses run through Mount Osmond itself . Stops can be found in neighbouring suburbs . The bikeway adjacent to the South Eastern Freeway winds past at the foot of Mount Osmond and can be accessed through the interchange .

 In the 2001 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing , the population of the Mount Osmond census area ( which includes the suburbs of Glen Osmond , Leawood Gardens and Waterfall Gully ) was 2 @,@ 497 people , in an area of 6 @.@ 08 square kilometres . Females outnumbered males 54 @.@ 2 % to 45 @.@ 8 % , and some 21 @.@ 4 % of the population was born overseas ( see chart for a breakdown ) . There was only a slight change in the 2006 census , with the population increasing by 25 to 2 @,@ 522 . Mount Osmond itself had a population of 612 during the 2006 census . 
 The eight strongest religious affiliations in the area ( based on the 2006 census figures ) were ( in descending order ) : Anglican , Catholic , Uniting , Lutheran , Orthodox Christian , Buddhist , Presbyterian , Church of Christ and Baptist ( a combination of other Christian faiths came in somewhere between Presbyterians and the Church of Christ , with 31 adherents ) . Also of note is the high occurrence of religious affiliation ( 67 @.@ 3 % ) in the region in comparison to the Adelaide ( and national ) average . Christian belief ( 64 @.@ 4 % ) is most prominent , with little growth in other religions . 
 Residents in these four suburbs are more affluent than the Adelaide average , with a high occurrence of incomes over A $ 1000 per week , which is also above the average for the City of Burnside . A majority of workers are employed in professional or white collar fields . 
 The census area that incorporates Mount Osmond has a larger proportion of those in both the younger ( 0 – 17 ) and older ( 60 + ) age ranges than in the City of Burnside as a whole , and there have been no " numerically significant " changes in the age distribution between the 2001 and 2006 censuses . Similarly , family numbers are also stable , with almost no change between 2001 and 2006 .

 Mount Osmond contains a number of historical attractions ; notably in the former mines and mining infrastructure that remains on the hillside as a reminder of its past . The mines continue up throughout the hills from Glen Osmond . While Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins are former open @-@ cut mines ( located in Glen Osmond ) , Mount Osmond contains more <unk> which are up to sixty metres deep . 
 Mount Osmond Golf Course is located on the very top of the suburb , and includes its peak .

The English @-@ Manor style <unk> offer restaurant quality meals , coffee and also cater for functions and special <unk> and is open to members and public visitors . 
 Walking trails are abundant . While a historical walk through the mines can be taken from Beaumont or Glen Osmond , longer walks provide access to numerous attractions including Waterfall Gully 's falls , the Cleland Wildlife Park and the Adelaide Hills town of Crafers . Walking the Long Ridge track , between the valley of the South Eastern Freeway and Waterfall Gully provides spectacular views of Adelaide .

 = = Politics = = 
 Mount Osmond is part of the state electoral district of Bragg , which has been held since 2002 by Liberal MP Vickie Chapman . In federal politics , the suburb is part of the division of Sturt , and has been represented by Christopher Pyne since 1993 . The results shown are from the closest polling station to Mount Osmond — which is located outside of the suburb — at St Saviour 's Church Hall on <unk> Road in Glen Osmond . Both electorates have traditionally gone to the Liberal Party , and Bragg in particular is regarded as a very safe Liberal seat . However , in the 2007 federal election , a strong swing towards the Labor Party and their candidate , Mia <unk> , resulted in the electorate transforming from a " safe [ federal ] Liberal seat into a marginal one " . 
 In local government , Mount Osmond is part of the ward of Beaumont within the City of Burnside , and the current Mayor for the district is Wendy Greiner . Beaumont is currently represented by councilors Andrew Hillier and Davina Quirke .

Found in Europe , Northern Eurasia , and North America , it is known from temperate , boreal , and alpine or arctic habitats . It is a saprobic species that grows in clusters on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms . The fruit bodies are small , with whitish convex to flattened caps up to 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 43 in ) in diameter , narrow white gills , and slender whitish stems 8 – 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 0 in ) long and up to 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 in ) thick . C. cirrhata can be distinguished from the other two members of Collybia by the absence of a sclerotium at the base of the stem . The mushroom , although not poisonous , is considered inedible because of its insubstantial size .

 The species first appeared in the scientific literature in 1786 as Agaricus amanitae by August Johann Georg Karl Batsch ; Agaricus amanitae subsp. cirrhatus , proposed by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1800 , is considered synonymous . A later combination based on this name , Collybia amanitae , was published by Hanns Kreisel in 1987 . However , Kreisel noted the combination to be " <unk> . " , indicating that he did not believe the name to be validly published , according to article 34 @.@ 1 of the rules for botanical nomenclature , which states : " A name is not validly published ... when it is not accepted by the author in the original publication . " 
 The first correct name was published in 1803 by Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher , who called the species Agaricus cirrhatus . French mycologist Lucien Quélet transferred it to Collybia in 1879 , resulting in the binomial by which it is currently known . The species had also been transferred to Microcollybia by Georges Métrod in 1952 and again by Lennox in 1979 ( because Métrod 's transfer was considered a nomen nudum , and thus invalid according to nomenclatural rules ) ; the genus Microcollybia has since been wrapped into Collybia . 
 Molecular phylogenetics have shown that C. cirrhata forms a monophyletic clade with the remaining two species of Collybia . Because C. cirrhata is the only one of the three Collybia species lacking sclerotia , it has been suggested that this character trait is an <unk> — that is , unique to a single , terminal species within a clade . 
 The specific epithet is derived from the Latin <unk> , meaning " curled " . Charles Horton Peck called it the " fringed @-@ rooted Collybia " . In the United Kingdom , it is commonly known as the " piggyback shanklet " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is initially convex when young , later becoming convex to flattened or slightly depressed in the center , reaching a diameter of 3 – 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 – 0 @.@ 43 in ) . The cap margin starts out rolled or curved inward , but straightens out as it matures . The cap surface ranges from dry to moist , smooth to covered with fine whitish hairs , and is mostly even with translucent radial grooves at the margin . It is <unk> ( changing color somewhat depending on hydration ) , becoming a grayish @-@ orange when watery or old , and usually is white with a very faint pinkish flush when fresh . The flesh is whitish , quite thin , and has no distinctive taste or odor . The gills are adnate to slightly arcuate ( curved into the shape of a bow ) with a tooth ( meaning that the gills curve up to join the stem but then , very close to the stem , the gill edge curves down again ) . There are between 12 and 20 gills that extend completely from the cap edge to the stem , and three to five tiers of lamellulae ( shorter gills that do not extend completely from the cap edge to the stem ) . The gills are thin , narrow to moderately broad , and white to pinkish @-@ buff . The gill edges are even , and the same color as the gill faces . 
 The stem is 8 – 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 0 in ) long and up to 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 in ) thick , equal in width throughout to slightly enlarged downward , flexible and filamentous but not fragile . The stem surface is dry , whitish to grayish @-@ orange , sometimes with tiny hairs on the upper portion that become coarser near the base . The stem base often has rhizomorph @-@ like strands or copious whitish mycelia . The stem , unlike the other two species of Collybia , do not originate from a sclerotium . The stem becomes hollow as it matures . Although it is not considered poisonous , C. cirrhata is too small and insubstantial to be considered edible .

 In deposit , the spores appear white . Individual spores are ellipsoid to tear @-@ shaped in profile , obovoid to ellipsoid or roughly cylindric in face or back view , with dimensions of 4 @.@ 8 – 6 @.@ 4 by 2 – 2 @.@ 8 ( sometimes up to 3 @.@ 5 ) µm . They are smooth , inamyloid , and acyanophilous ( unreactive to staining with Melzer 's reagent and methyl blue , respectively ) . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells of the hymenium ) are roughly club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 17 @.@ 5 – 21 by 4 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 6 µm . The gills do not have cystidia . The gill tissue is made of hyphae that are interwoven to roughly parallel , and inamyloid . The hyphae are 2 @.@ 8 – 8 @.@ 4 µm in diameter and smooth . The cap tissue is made of interwoven hyphae beneath the center of the cap , but radially oriented over the gills ; it too is inamyloid . These hyphae are 3 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 4 µm in diameter , smooth , but have irregularly thickened walls . The cap cuticle is an ixocutis — a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface . The hyphae comprising this layer are 2 @.@ 8 – 6 @.@ 4 µm in diameter , smooth , and thin @-@ walled . They are covered with scattered , short pouch @-@ like outgrowths . The cuticle of the stem is a layer of parallel , vertically oriented hyphae ; the hyphae measure 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 2 µm , and are smooth , slightly thick @-@ walled , and pale yellowish @-@ brown in alkaline solution . They give rise to a covering of tangled and branched caulocystidia ( cystidia on the stem ) that have multiple septa . The caulocystidia are 2 @.@ 8 – 4 @.@ 8 µm in diameter , smooth , thin walled , and shaped like contorted cylinders . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues .

 Collybia cirrhata is most likely to be confused with the remaining members of Collybia , which have a similar external appearance . C. tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish @-@ brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds , while C. cookei has wrinkled , often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange . Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus , but these species only grow on pine cones . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Like all species remaining in the genus Collybia , C. cirrhata is saprobic , and is typically found growing on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms ; occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms , although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue — possibly from a previous season — has decayed to such an extent that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate . Known hosts include Lactarius , Russula , Meripilus giganteus , and Bovista <unk> . 
 Collybia cirrhata is known from temperate , boreal , and alpine or arctic habitats . The fungus is widespread in Europe , including Bulgaria , Denmark , Germany , Greece , Latvia , Scandinavia , Slovakia , Switzerland , Turkey , and the United Kingdom . The mushroom is also common in northern montane regions of North America . In Asia , the fungus has been reported in Korea , and in Hokkaido , northern Japan . It is also known from Greenland . A 2009 publication suggested that based on the known evidence , the species ' distribution may be circumboreal .

During a feud between Goldust and Triple H over the Intercontinental Championship , on February 16 , 1997 at In Your House 13 : Final Four , Marlena was choked by Chyna , who debuted as a plant from a ringside seat and later became the bodyguard for Triple H. Later , Brian Pillman feuded with Goldust over Marlena . As part of the angle , Pillman won Marlena in a match and sent Goldust a picture of her handcuffed in a bed . Pillman , however , died in the middle of the storyline . Originally , the plan was to have the rivalry culminate in an on @-@ air wedding where Marlena would leave Goldust for Pillman .

 In late 1999 , Runnels arranged the Terri Invitational Tournament , a best @-@ of @-@ five series , between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz , with the winner receiving her managerial services and the sum of $ 100 @,@ 000 . The Hardy Boyz won the tournament , which culminated in a ladder match at No Mercy ( with the prize money suspended above the ring in a bag ) . Runnels spent the next few months as their manager until she was injured when Bubba Ray Dudley powerbombed her through a table . She returned on February 27 at No Way Out and cost the Hardy Boyz a match . She then became the manager of Edge and Christian , and the storyline originally called for her to come between the duo , resulting in them becoming singles wrestlers with Runnels managing Christian . The storyline , however , was rewritten , and on an episode of SmackDown ! , Edge and Christian — who would now continue wrestling as a tag team — revealed they no longer wanted Runnels 's services . She , therefore , slapped Edge , who responded by spearing her . 
 Runnels began a rivalry with The Kat , and at WrestleMania 2000 , Runnels ( accompanied by The Fabulous Moolah ) defeated The Kat ( with Mae Young ) in a catfight . Val Venis was the Special Guest Referee , but was distracted when Young kissed him in response to Venis making out with both Runnels and The Kat . This distraction allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring , and when Venis saw her out of the ring , he declared Runnels the winner . Post @-@ match , The Kat attacked Runnels by stripping her black body suit off to expose her nude colored thong . The rivalry continued in an arm wrestling match at <unk> . They later participated in a " Stink Face match " at SummerSlam , which The Kat won by first performing the move on Runnels . 
 Runnels later became the onscreen girlfriend and manager of Perry Saturn , who was a member of The Radicalz alliance . She accompanied Saturn to the ring at Fully Loaded in July 2000 , where Saturn defeated Eddie Guerrero for the European Championship . Saturn , Runnels , and Radicalz member Dean Malenko also had a series of matches with Team Xtreme ( The Hardy Boyz and Lita ) . The on @-@ screen partnership lasted until Saturn , who had hit his head during a match , opted to continue seeing " <unk> " ( a mop he believed was alive ) instead of Runnels . As a result , she then became the manager of Raven , a member of The Alliance , who stole Saturn 's mop and fed it into a woodchipper .

 = Muhammad Ali Jinnah = 
 Muhammad Ali Jinnah ( Urdu : محمد علی <unk> ALA @-@ LC : Muḥammad ʿAlī <unk> , born <unk> Jinnahbhai ; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948 ) was a lawyer , politician , and the founder of Pakistan . Jinnah served as leader of the All @-@ India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan 's creation on 14 August 1947 , and then as Pakistan 's first Governor @-@ General until his death . He is revered in Pakistan as Quaid @-@ i @-@ Azam ( Urdu : <unk> <unk> ; Great Leader ) and Baba @-@ i @-@ <unk> ( Urdu : <unk> <unk> ; Father of the Nation ) . His birthday is observed as a national holiday . 
 Born in Karachi and trained as a barrister at Lincoln 's Inn in London , Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century . In these early years of his political career , Jinnah advocated Hindu – Muslim unity , helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All @-@ India Muslim League , in which Jinnah had also become prominent . Jinnah became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League , and proposed a fourteen @-@ point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims . In 1920 , however , Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha , or non @-@ violent resistance , advocated by Mohandas Gandhi . 
 By 1940 , Jinnah had come to believe that Indian Muslims should have their own state . In that year , the Muslim League , led by Jinnah , passed the Lahore Resolution , demanding a separate nation . During the Second World War , the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned , and in the elections held shortly after the war , it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims . Ultimately , the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power @-@ sharing formula for a united India , leading all parties to agree to separate independence of a predominantly Hindu India , and for a Muslim @-@ majority state , to be called Pakistan . 
 As the first Governor @-@ General of Pakistan , Jinnah worked to establish the new nation 's government and policies , and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after independence , personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps . Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948 , just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom . He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan . According to his biographer , Stanley Wolpert , he remains Pakistan 's greatest leader .
