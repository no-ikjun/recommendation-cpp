 Adam Craig Gilchrist , AM ( / <unk> / ; born 14 November 1971 ) , nicknamed " Gilly " or " <unk> " , is a former Australian cricketer and one of the most explosive batsmen in world cricket . He was the captain of Australia , and Middlesex . He is an attacking left @-@ handed batsman and record @-@ breaking wicket @-@ keeper , who redefined the role for the Australia national cricket team through his aggressive batting . He is widely regarded as the greatest wicket @-@ keeper – batsman in the history of the game . He held the world record for the most dismissals by a wicket @-@ keeper in One Day International ( ODI ) cricket until it was surpassed by Kumar Sangakkara in 2015 and the most by an Australian in Test cricket . His strike rate is amongst the highest in the history of both ODI and Test cricket ; his century against England at Perth in December 2006 is the fourth @-@ fastest century in all Test cricket . He is the first player to have hit 100 sixes in Test cricket . His 17 Test and 16 ODI centuries are the second most by a wicket @-@ keeper , only after Kumar Sangakkara . He holds the unique record of scoring at least 50 runs in successive World Cup finals ( in 1999 , 2003 and 2007 ) . His swashbuckling 149 off 104 balls against Sri Lanka in the 2007 World Cup final is rated one of the greatest World Cup innings of all time . He is one of only three players to have won three titles . Adam Gilchrist is also the first player to reach 1000 runs in the Indian Premier League . Gilchrist is renowned for walking when he considers himself to be out , sometimes contrary to the decision of the umpire . He made his first @-@ class debut in 1992 , his first One @-@ Day International appearance in 1996 in India and his Test debut in 1999 . During his career , he played for Australia in 96 Test matches and over 270 One @-@ day internationals .

 Adam Gilchrist was born in 1971 at Bellingen Hospital , in Bellingen , New South Wales , the youngest of four children . He and his family lived in Dorrigo , Junee and then Deniliquin where , playing for his school , Deniliquin South Public School , he won the Brian Taber Shield ( named after New South Wales cricketer Brian Taber ) . At the age of 13 , his parents , Stan and June , moved the family to Lismore where Gilchrist captained the Kadina High School cricket team . Gilchrist was selected for the state under @-@ 17 team , and in 1989 he was offered a scholarship by London @-@ based Richmond Cricket Club , a scheme he now supports himself . During his year at Richmond , he also played junior cricket for Old <unk> Cricket Club 's under 17 team , with whom he won the Middlesex League and Cup double . He moved to Sydney and joined the Gordon Club in Sydney Grade Cricket , later moving to Northern Districts . 
 Gilchrist is married to his high school sweetheart Melinda ( Mel ) Gilchrist ( née Sharpe ) , a dietitian , and they have three sons , Harrison , Archie and Ted , and a daughter , Annie Jean . His family came under the spotlight in the months leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup as Archie 's impending birth threatened his presence in the squad ; Archie was born in February and Gilchrist was able to take part in the tournament .

 In 1991 , Gilchrist was selected for the Australia Young Cricketers , a national youth team that toured England and played in youth ODIs and Tests . Gilchrist scored a century and a fifty in the three Tests . Upon his return to Australia late in the year , Gilchrist was accepted into the Australian Cricket Academy . Over the next year , Gilchrist represented the ACA as they played matches against the Second XI of Australia 's state teams , and toured South Africa to play provincial youth teams . 
 Upon returning to Australia , Gilchrist scored two centuries in four matches for the state Colts and Second XI teams , and was rewarded with selection to make his first @-@ class debut for New South Wales during the 1992 – 93 season , although he played purely as a batsman , due to the presence of incumbent wicketkeeper Phil Emery . In his first season , the side won the Sheffield Shield , Gilchrist scoring an unbeaten 20 in the second innings to secure an easy win over Queensland in the final . Gilchrist made 274 runs at an average of 30 @.@ 44 in his debut season , a score of 75 being his only effort beyond fifty . He also made his debut in Mercantile Mutual limited overs competition . He struggled to keep his place in the side , playing only three first @-@ class matches in the following season . He scored on 43 runs at 8 @.@ 60 ; New South Wales won both competitions , but Gilchrist was overlooked for both finals and did not play a single limited overs match . 
 Due to a lack of opportunities in the dominant New South Wales outfit , Gilchrist joined Western Australia at the start of the 1994 – 95 , where he had to compete with former Test player Tim <unk> for the wicket @-@ keeper 's berth . Gilchrist had no guarantee of selection . However , he made a century in a pre @-@ season trial match and seized <unk> 's place . The local fans were initially hostile to the move , but Gilchrist won them over . He made 55 first @-@ class dismissals in his first season , the most by any wicketkeeper in Australian domestic cricket in 1994 – 95 . However , he struggled with the bat , scoring 398 runs at 26 @.@ 53 with seven single figure scores , although he recorded his maiden first @-@ class century in the latter stages of the season , with 126 against South Australia . Gilchrist was rewarded with selection in the Young Australia team that toured England in 1995 and played matches against the English counties . Gilchrist starred with bat , scoring 490 runs at 70 @.@ 00 with two centuries . His second season based in Perth saw him top of the dismissals again , with 58 catches and four stumpings , but , significantly , 835 runs at an impressive batting average of 50 @.@ 52 . The Warriors made it to the final of the Sheffield Shield , at the Adelaide Oval , where Gilchrist scored 189 not out in the first innings , from only 187 balls , including five sixes . The innings brought Gilchrist national prominence . The match ended in a thrilling draw as South Australia 's last @-@ wicket pair held on to fend off the visitors . The hosts thus took the title , having scored more points in the qualifying matches . Gilchrist also scored an unbeaten 76 to help Western Australia secure a narrow three @-@ wicket victory over New South Wales in the penultimate limited overs match of the season , which saw them into the final against Queensland , which was lost . Gilchrist 's form saw him selected for Australia A , a team comprising players close to national selection . At the start of the 1996 – 97 season , sections of the media advocated that he replace Ian Healy as the national wicket @-@ keeper , but Healy struck 161 in the First Test and maintained his position . Gilchrist continued to perform strongly on the domestic circuit he topped the dismissals count once again , with 62 , along with a batting average of just under 40 , although he failed to post a century . Team success came in the Mercantile Mutual Cup , where the Warriors won by eight wickets against Queensland in the March 1997 final ; Gilchrist was not required to bat . 
 The 1997 – 98 season ended with Gilchrist top of the dismissals chart for the fourth season in a row with an improved batting average of 47 @.@ 66 , despite playing in only six of the ten qualifying Shield matches due to his becoming a regular member of the national limited overs team . Gilchrist registered his maiden – first @-@ class double century with an unbeaten 203 against South Australia early in the season , before returning late in the season after his international commitments were over . He added 109 against Victoria , and played in the Sheffield Shield final victory over Tasmania , although he scored only eight . There was disappointment for the team in the Mercantile Mutual Cup , losing the semi @-@ final to Queensland . The following season saw Gilchrist 's domestic appearances diminish due to his international commitments : he made only a single appearance in the Mercantile Mutual Cup , but still managed to help Western Australia defend the Sheffield Shield , scoring a century in the qualifying rounds . 
 Gilchrist 's regular selection for Australia has meant that he is rarely available for domestic selection . He became the Test wicket @-@ keeper in late @-@ 1999 , and between 1999 and 2005 , he made only seven first @-@ class appearances for his state . He did not play in the 2005 – 06 Pura Cup and only appeared three times in the limited @-@ overs ING Cup .

 Gilchrist was called up for the Australian One Day International ( ODI ) team in 1996 , his debut coming against South Africa at Faridabad on 25 October 1996 as the 129th Australian ODI cap , after an injury to incumbent Ian Healy . While not particularly impressive with the bat on his debut , scoring 18 before being bowled by Allan Donald , Gilchrist took his first catch as an international wicketkeeper , <unk> Cronje departing for a golden duck from the bowling of Paul Reiffel . He was run out for a duck in his only other ODI on the tour . Healy resumed his place during the 1996 – 97 season . Gilchrist replaced Healy for the first two ODIs in the 1997 Australian tour of South Africa , after Healy was suspended for dissent . When Healy returned Gilchrist maintained his position in the team as a specialist batsman after Mark Waugh sustained a hand injury . It was during this series that Gilchrist made his first ODI half @-@ century , with an innings of 77 in Durban . He totalled 127 runs at 31 @.@ 75 for the series . Gilchrist went on to play in the Texaco Trophy later in 1997 in the 3 – 0 series loss against England , scoring 53 and 33 in two innings . 
 At the start of the 1997 – 98 Australian season , Healy and captain Mark Taylor were omitted from the ODI squad as the Australian selectors opted for Gilchrist and Michael di <unk> . Gilchrist 's elevation was made possible by a change in policy by selectors , who announced that selection for ODI and Test teams would be separate , with Test and ODI specialists selected accordingly , while Healy remained the preferred Test wicket @-@ keeper . This came after Australia failed to qualify for the previous season 's ODI triangular series final for the first time in 17 years . The new team was initially unconvincing , losing all four round robin matches against South Africa in the 1997 – 98 Carlton & United Series , with multiple players filling Taylor 's role as Mark Waugh 's opening partner without success . Gilchrist also struggled batting in the lower order at number seven , the conventional wicket @-@ keeper 's batting position , scoring 148 runs at 24 @.@ 66 in the eight qualifying matches . In the first final against South Africa at the Melbourne Cricket Ground Gilchrist was selected as Waugh 's opening partner . In a particularly poor start to the new combination , Waugh was run out after a mix @-@ up with Gilchrist . However , in the second final , Gilchrist struck his maiden ODI century , spearheading Australia 's successful run chase at the Sydney Cricket Ground , securing his position as an opening batsman . Australia won the third final to claim the title . 
 Touring New Zealand in February 1998 , Gilchrist topped that Australia averages with 200 runs at 50 @.@ 00 , including a match @-@ winning 118 in the first match . He also effected his first ODI stumping , the wicket of Nathan Astle in the Second ODI in Wellington . Australia then played two triangular tournaments in Asia . Gilchrist struggled in India , scoring 86 runs at 17 @.@ 20 . He went on to play in the Coca Cola Cup in Sharjah in April 1998 , a triangular tournament between Australia , India and New Zealand . Australia finished runners @-@ up in the tournament , with Gilchrist taking nine dismissals as wicketkeeper and averaging 37 @.@ 13 with the bat . 
 Gilchrist won a silver medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur , the only time cricket has been in the Commonwealth Games . The matches did not have ODI status , and after winning their first four fixtures , Australia lost the final to South Africa , Gilchrist making 15 . He then scored 103 and ended with 190 runs at 63 @.@ 33 as Australia took a rare 3 – 0 whitewash on Pakistani soil . 
 Gilchrist was in fine form ahead of the 1999 Cricket World Cup with a productive individual performance in the Carlton & United Series in January and February 1999 against Sri Lanka and England . He finished with 525 runs at a batting average of 43 @.@ 75 with two centuries — both against Sri Lanka — and a fifty , and a total of 27 dismissals in 12 matches . His 131 helped Australia set a successful run @-@ chase at the SCG , and he followed this with 154 at the MCG . The 1999 tour of the West Indies was Australia 's last campaign before the World Cup and continued to prove Gilchrist 's ability as a wicketkeeper @-@ batsman . Gilchrist , with a batting average of 28 @.@ 71 and a strike rate of nearly 90 @.@ 00 , and seven fielding dismissals in a seven @-@ match series which ended 3 – 3 with one tie . 
 = = = First World Cup success = = = 
 Gilchrist played in every match of Australia 's successful World Cup campaign , but struggled at first , with scores of 6 , 14 and 0 in the first three matches against Scotland , New Zealand and Pakistan . Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final . Gilchrist 's quick @-@ fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament , which was secured with a win over the West Indies , although Gilchrist made only 21 . Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase , scoring 31 , 10 and 5 against India , Zimbabwe and South Africa . Australia won all three matches , the last in the final over , to scrape into the semifinals . Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa , but completed the final act of the match . With the scores tied , South Africa were going for the winning run when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald ; the match was tied , and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa . Gilchrist 's 54 in the final helped secure Australia 's first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan . It was a happy ending for Gilchrist , who had struggled through the tournament , with 237 runs at 21 @.@ 54 . 
 Success at the World Cup was followed by a defeat by Sri Lanka in the final of the Aiwa Cup in August 1999 , . Gilchrist was the most successful batsman and wicket @-@ keeper of the tournament , with 231 runs at 46 @.@ 20 . While the Test players battled against Sri Lanka , Gilchrist led Australia A in a limited overs series against India A in Los Angeles . He then scored 60 runs at 20 @.@ 00 as the Australians completed a 3 – 0 whitewash of Zimbabwe in October . 
 = = = Test debut = = = 
 Gilchrist made his Test match debut in the First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 becoming the <unk> Australian Test cricketer . He replaced Healy , who was dropped after a run of poor form , despite the incumbent 's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game in front of his home crowd . Gilchrist 's entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia 's fortunes . Up to this point , they had played eight Tests in 1999 , winning and losing three . 
 Gilchrist 's icy reception at the Gabba did not faze him ; he took five catches , stumped Azhar Mahmood off Shane Warne 's bowling and scored a rapid 81 , mostly in partnership with ODI partner Waugh , in a match that Australia won comfortably by ten wickets . In his second Test match he made an unbeaten 149 to help guide Australia to victory in a game that looked well beyond their reach . Australia were struggling at 5 / 126 in pursuit of 369 for victory as he joined his Western Australian team @-@ mate , Justin Langer , but the pair put on a record @-@ breaking partnership of 238 to seal an Australian win . Gilchrist continued his strong run throughout his debut Test season , and ended the summer with 485 runs at 69 @.@ 28 in six matches , three each against Pakistan and India , adding two fifties against the latter . 
 Gilchrist was moderately successful in the following ODIs , the Carlton & United Series ; Australia defeated Pakistan 2 – 0 in a best @-@ of @-@ three final . Gilchrist scored 272 runs at 27 @.@ 20 ; his best effort was 92 in a 152 @-@ run victory over India on Australia Day . Gilchrist then scored 251 runs at 41 @.@ 66 in the ODIs during a tour of New Zealand . The highlight was a 128 in Christchurch that propelled Australia to a score of 6 / 349 . Gilchrist was named man of the match in two of the games . 
 In the Third Test against New Zealand in 2000 , Gilchrist recorded the third best Test performance ever by a wicketkeeper , and the best by an Australian , taking ten catches in the match . Although Gilchrist 's batting was modest , yielding 144 runs at 36 @.@ 00 , Australia took a 3 – 0 clean sweep . In two home and away ODI series against South Africa , Gilchrist had a quiet time , scoring 170 runs at 26 @.@ 66 . South Africa won three of the six matches , with one tie . 
 Later that year , he was handed the vice @-@ captaincy of the Australian team in place of Shane Warne , who had been plagued by a number of off @-@ the @-@ field controversies , including an altercation with some teenage boys , and a sex scandal with a British nurse . 
 The 2000 – 01 season saw a West Indian touring party and Gilchrist warmed up with consecutive first @-@ class centuries for Western Australia . Captaining his Test team for the first time in place of the injured Steve Waugh in the Third Test in Adelaide . Gilchrist scored only 9 and 10 not out , but a ten @-@ wicket haul from Colin Miller resulted in a hard @-@ fought five @-@ wicket victory for Australia . Gilchrist described the match as " the proudest moment of my career " . Waugh resumed the captaincy on his return to the team for the Fourth and Fifth Tests , with the series finishing in a 5 – 0 whitewash . Gilchrist scored 241 runs at 48 @.@ 20 with two fifties . In the ensuing ODI tournament , Gilchrist scored 326 runs at 36 @.@ 22 with a top @-@ score of 98 as the Australians won all ten matches . 
 Up to this point , Gilchrist had played in 14 Tests , all in Australasia , and all of which had been won . Australia 's run of 15 consecutive Test wins faced a steep challenge on the tour of India , where they had not won a Test series since 1969 – 70 . 
 Australia 's streak looked in danger during the First Test in Mumbai when they fell to 5 / 99 in reply to India 's 171 when Gilchrist came to the crease . He counterattacked savagely , scoring 122 in just 112 balls , and featuring in a 197 @-@ run partnership with Matthew Hayden in only 32 overs . This swung the momentum back to Australia , who reached 349 . Gilchrist took six catches and was named Man of the Match in a ten wicket victory , extending the world record run to 16 . 
 Gilchrist 's form dipped momentarily , with a rare king pair ( two golden ducks in the same match ) in the Second Test in Kolkata and just two runs in his two innings in Chennai . He was out LBW four consecutive times in the last two Tests , three of these to Harbhajan Singh , who took 32 wickets in the series to end Australia 's run by inflicting a 2 – 1 series loss . His one @-@ day form remained strong , with 172 runs at 43 @.@ 00 in the ODI series in India , as Australia bounced back to win the series 3 – 2 . During this series he captained the ODI team for the first time , winning all three of the matches under his captaincy . 
 = = = 2001 Ashes = = = 
 Gilchrist played a pivotal role in the 2001 Ashes series which Australia won 4 – 1 , with 340 runs at a batting average of 68 @.@ 00 and 26 dismissals in the five match series . 
 Gilchrist warmed up by putting his ODI struggles on English soil in 1999 behind him , scoring 248 runs at 49 @.@ 60 in the triangular tournament preceding the Tests , scoring an unbeaten 76 in the final win over Pakistan . 
 Gilchrist put the disappointment of India behind him in the First Test at Edgbaston , scoring 152 from only 143 balls . The allowed Australia to reach 576 in only 545 minutes , and set up an innings victory that set the tone for the series . Gilchrist then added 90 in the eight @-@ wicket win in the Second Test at Lord 's , before turning the tide in the Third Test at Trent Bridge . Australia slumped to 7 / 105 in reply to the hosts ' 185 , but Gilchrist 's 54 took the tourists to 190 before a seven @-@ wicket win resulted in the retention of the Ashes . 
 Gilchrist captained the team in the Fourth Test at Headingley after an injury to Steve Waugh . After persistent rain interruptions , Gilchrist declared with Australia four down at tea on the fourth day , leaving England with a target of 315 , which , despite losing two early wickets , they reached with six wickets to spare , ( Mark Butcher scoring an unbeaten 173 , including 24 boundaries ) . Gilchrist failed to pass 25 in the last two Tests , but it had been a productive season ; he scored centuries in both of Australia 's county matches . 
 Two home series followed in the 2001 – 02 season , a fully drawn ( 0 – 0 ) three match series against New Zealand and a whitewash over South Africa 3 – 0 . Gilchrist scored 118 in the First Test against New Zealand and an unbeaten 83 in the Third Test in Perth as the Australians held on for a draw with three wickets intact . However , Gilchrist did little in the triumph over South Africa , failing to pass 35 . He ended the summer Tests with 353 runs at 50 @.@ 42 . 
 In the ensuing ODIs , Gilchrist scored only 97 runs at 16 @.@ 16 . The Australian selectors sought to accommodate Hayden , who had been successful as a Test opener , into the ODI team by rotating him with Gilchrist and Waugh , but this appeared to unsettle the team . With a newly fragile top @-@ order , Australia failed to qualify for the finals , and the Waugh brothers were dropped from the team , ending Gilchrist 's four @-@ year partnership with Mark . Ricky Ponting was promoted to the captaincy ahead of vice captain Gilchrist . 
 The Australians then toured South Africa the next month and it was during the First Test in Johannesburg that Gilchrist broke the record for the fastest double century in Tests on 23 February , requiring 212 balls for the feat . This was eight balls quicker than Ian Botham 's innings against India at The Oval in 1982 . He ended unbeaten on 204 , having featured in a partnership of 317 with Damien Martyn at a run rate of 5 @.@ 5 . South Africa were demoralised and lost by an innings after being forced to follow on . The record lasted only one month , however , with New Zealand 's Nathan Astle taking 59 balls less to reach the milestone during an innings in March 2002 . 
 In the Second Test at Cape Town , Gilchrist struck 138 from 108 balls to set up a first innings lead and eventual four @-@ wicket win . He then top @-@ scored with 91 in the Third Test , and although Australia lost the match , Gilchrist ended the series with an astonishing 473 at 157 @.@ 66 from just 474 balls , in addition to 14 dismissals . 
 Gilchrist captained the ODI team , once again for a single match , against Kenya in Nairobi during the PSO Tri @-@ Nation Tournament . Despite Australia 's unbeaten run in the competition , the final , against Pakistan was abandoned due to rain , so the teams shared the trophy . During the six middle months of 2002 , Gilchrist played in 18 ODIs , scoring 562 runs at 31 @.@ 22 , including a century , recovering from his slump . 
 After scoring 122 runs at 40 @.@ 66 in the 3 – 0 Test series clean sweep over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , Gilchrist went on to help the Australians retain The Ashes 4 – 1 in 2002 – 03 , playing in all five matches of the series , finishing with 330 runs at 55 @.@ 50 and taking 25 dismissals as wicket @-@ keeper . After scoring fifties in the first two Tests , Gilchrist scored a counter @-@ attacking 133 from 121 balls in the Fifth Test at the SCG , but was unable to prevent Australia 's only loss of the series . 
 From the time of his debut up to the 2003 World Cup , Gilchrist 's played in 40 Tests in series . With the exception of the 2001 tour of India , when he averaged 24 @.@ 80 ( he made 124 runs in the series ; 122 of them came in one innings ) , his performances with the bat were such that he was described at the time as the " finest batsman @-@ wicketkeeper to have graced the game " . At one point in March 2002 , Gilchrist 's Test average was over 60 ; the second @-@ highest for any established player in Test history , and he topped the ICC Test batting rankings in May 2002 . 
 Gilchrist warmed up for the World Cup in South Africa by scoring 310 runs at 44 @.@ 28 in the triangular tournament in Australia against England and Sri Lanka . His performances over the past year were recognised with the Allan Border Medal . 
 = = = 2003 World Cup = = = 
 Gilchrist played in all but one of the matches in Australia 's successful defence of their World Cup title ; he was rested for the group match against the Netherlands . He finished the tournament with 408 runs at an average of 40 @.@ 80 at a strike rate of 105 . He scored four half @-@ centuries , and was run out against Sri Lanka in the Super Six stage just a single run short of a century . In the semi @-@ final , he scored 22 before being caught off an inside @-@ edge onto pad off the bowling of <unk> de Silva . The umpire gave no reaction , however Gilchrist walked off the pitch after a moment 's pause . In 2009 it was described as an " astonishing moment " drawing criticism from England 's Angus Fraser , who " objected to him being canonised simply for not cheating " , and from others who " thought that he walked almost by accident ; that having played his shot he overbalanced in the direction of the pavilion . " His actions nevertheless drew praise from the majority . In the final , India elected to field first and Gilchrist hammered 57 from 48 balls , featuring in a century opening stand with Hayden to seize the initiative . This laid the foundation for Australia 's 2 / 359 and a crushing 125 @-@ run win , ending an unbeaten campaign . Gilchrist was also the competition 's most successful wicketkeeper , making 21 dismissals . 
 Success in the World Cup was followed up by a tour of the West Indies where Gilchrist was part of a side that won both the ODI and Test series . He scored 282 runs at 70 @.@ 50 with one century in the four Tests , and 212 runs at 35 @.@ 33 in the ODIs . The Australians then defeated a touring Bangladeshi cricket team in short series in both forms of the game . Gilchrist was only sporadically required with the bat . 
 = = = Decline and revival = = = 
 After scoring his first Test century at his home ground in Perth , an unbeaten 113 against Zimbabwe , Gilchrist 's Test form dipped again during the 2003 – 04 season , with only 120 runs coming in the next 10 innings , during the home series against India ( drawn 1 – 1 ) and the away series in Sri Lanka ( won 3 – 0 ) . However , he returned to form in the Second Test Kandy , scoring a quickfire 144 in the second innings to set up a 27 @-@ run win after Australia conceded a 91 @-@ run first innings lead . 
 However , he maintained high standards in ODIs during this period , including 111 against India in Bangalore , 172 against Zimbabwe , just one run short of Mark Waugh 's Australian record , and two further half @-@ centuries in the VB Series in Australia . His success in One @-@ day cricket was underlined by his rise to the top of the ICC ODI batting rankings in February 2004 . However , he was unable to maintain this form on the 2004 tours of Sri Lanka , Zimbabwe and the Champions Trophy in England , accumulating 253 runs at 28 @.@ 11 in 11 innings . 
 Gilchrist then scored 115 runs at 28 @.@ 75 in two Tests at home to Sri Lanka in mid @-@ 2004 , and captained in the First Test win in Darwin with Ponting absent . Australia won the series 1 – 0 . 
 A 104 in the First Test against India in October 2004 proved to be a false renaissance ; he scored only 104 runs in the remaining seven innings on the Indian tour and 139 runs in eight ODI innings towards the end of the 2004 – 05 season , which formed the lowest average period of Gilchrist 's career until 2007 . He took the captaincy of the Test team once again , in place of the injured Ricky Ponting , and led the Australian side to an historic 2 – 1 series victory in India , a feat last achieved in 1969 . Ponting recovered to lead the team in the Fourth Test , Australia 's only loss . 
 Gilchrist returned to form when New Zealand toured Australia at the start of southern hemisphere season . He scored 126 and 50 in the 2 – 0 Test series clean sweep and scored fifties in both ODIs . He then scored 230 runs at 76 @.@ 66 in three Tests against Pakistan , including a rapid 113 in the Third Test at the SCG as Australia won all five Tests during the summer . He made it three successive Test centuries with 121 and 162 in the first two Tests on the tour of New Zealand , before ending with an unbeaten 60 in the Third Test ; he totalled 343 runs at 114 @.@ 33 for the series . His ODI form in the early part of 2005 remained moderate , with 308 runs at 28 @.@ 00 during the southern summer . 
 Gilchrist was in strong form ahead of the Tests , scoring 393 runs at 49 @.@ 13 in the ODIs in England . The highlight was the 121 not out in the final game of the one @-@ day NatWest Series , Gilchrist being awarded the man @-@ of @-@ the @-@ match award . However , he performed poorly in the five Tests , with 204 runs at 25 @.@ 50 . Just as in India in 2001 , Australia lost 2 – 1 , and Gilchrist fell four times to man of the series Andrew Flintoff . 
 Australia and Gilchrist returned to form after the Ashes in the series against the ICC World XI . Gilchrist scored 45 , 103 and 32 as Australia swept the ODIs 3 – 0 , and top @-@ scored with 94 in the first innings of the one @-@ off Test , which Australia won . However , this did not transfer into the regular international matches . In six home Tests against the West Indies and South Africa in 2005 – 06 , Gilchrist managed only 190 runs at 23 @.@ 75 , but Australia was unhindered , winning 3 – 0 and 2 – 0 respectively . 
 His one @-@ day form also began to suffer , scoring only 11 runs in three ODIs in New Zealand and 13 in the first two matches of the VB Series . He was rested for two games and returned to form against Sri Lanka on 29 January 2006 on his home ground , the WACA , hitting 116 runs off 105 balls to lead Australia to victory . He continued in this vein with the fastest ever century by an Australian in just 67 balls against Sri Lanka at the Gabba , ending with 122 as Australia won the deciding third final by nine wickets . After a slow start , he ended the series with 432 runs at 48 @.@ 00 . 
 The purple patch ended on the tour of South Africa and then Bangladesh . He scored 206 runs at 29 @.@ 42 in five Tests and 248 runs at 35 @.@ 42 in eight ODIs , inflated by a 144 in the First Test against Bangladesh . Despite this , Australia won all five Tests . Gilchrist scored 130 runs at 26 @.@ 00 , including a 92 against the West Indies as Australia won the 2006 Champions Trophy in India . 
 On 16 December 2006 , during the Third Ashes Test at the WACA , Gilchrist scored a century in 57 balls , including twelve fours and four sixes , the second fastest recorded Test century . At 97 runs from 54 balls , Gilchrist needed three runs from the next delivery to better Viv Richards ' record set in 1986 . The ball delivered by Matthew Hoggard was wide and Gilchrist was unable to score from it . He later claimed that the " batting pyrotechnics " had been the result of a miscommunication with the Australian captain Ricky Ponting ; Gilchrist had actually been told not to score quick runs with a view to declaring the innings . 
 He ended the 2006 – 07 Ashes with a century and two fifties , totalling 229 runs at 45 @.@ 80 at a strike rate of over 100 as Australia regained the Ashes with a 5 – 0 whitewash . It was an inconsistent series ; aside from three scores mentioned , Gilchrist failed to pass one in his other three innings . Between Ashes series , Gilchrist had averaged only 25 with one Test century . 
 However , both he and Australia suffered a surprising string of poor results in the 2006 @-@ 07 Commonwealth Bank Series , Gilchrist managing an average of only 22 @.@ 20 during the tournament . Australia won seven of their eight qualifying matches , but England won with two finals victories over the Australians . Gilchrist scored 60 and 61 in the first two matches but did not pass 30 thereafter . He was then rested for Australia 's winless three @-@ match ODI tour of New Zealand , before his selection for the 2007 Cricket World Cup . Having previously indicated that it was highly likely that he would retire after the 2007 World Cup , he then stated a desire to play on <unk> . 
 = = = 2007 World Cup = = = 
 Gilchrist and Australia started their 2007 World Cup campaign by winning all three of their matches in Group A , against Scotland , the Netherlands and South Africa . Australia won all six of their matches in the Super8 stage with little difficulty — the margins of victory were exceeded 80 runs or six wickets in every instance . They topped the table and thus qualifying for a semi @-@ final rematch against fourth @-@ placed South Africa . Gilchrist opened the Australian batting in each match , taking a pinch @-@ hitting role in the opening powerplays . Initially successful in the group matches , scoring 46 , 57 and 42 , he failed in the first Super8 match against West Indies ( 7 ) , but bounced back to score a second half @-@ century ( 59 not out ) in a ten @-@ wicket victory against Bangladesh in a match drastically shortened due to rain . After a run of middling scores , he failed again in the final Super8 match against New Zealand . 
 As a batsman , Gilchrist was dismissed for a single run in the semi @-@ final against South Africa , despite which Australia won by seven wickets . As wicket @-@ keeper , however , he took four catches , equalling the most dismissals in one match in the tournament and bringing his total for the tournament to 14 , second behind Sri Lanka 's Kumar Sangakkara . 
 Gilchrist opened the batting against Sri Lanka in the final . This was Gilchrist 's third successive World Cup final , and the third time he scored at least a 50 runs in World Cup finals and he went on to make his only ever century in a world cup match . Gilchrist went on to score 149 runs off 104 balls with thirteen fours and eight sixes , the highest individual score in a World Cup final , eclipsing his captain Ricky Ponting 's score of 140 in the 2003 final . Australia won and he was named the man of the match . Subsequently there has been some controversy over Gilchrist 's use of a squash ball inside his glove during this innings . The MCC stated that Gilchrist had not acted against the laws or the spirit of the game , since there is no restriction against the external or internal form of batting gloves . 
 In September 2007 , Gilchrist played in the inaugural World Twenty20 . He scored 169 runs at 33 @.@ 80 as Australia were knocked out by India in the semifinals . Gilchrist then scored 208 runs at 34 @.@ 66 as Australia took an away ODI series against India 4 – 2 . In November , Gilchrist 's peers voted him the greatest Australian ODI cricketer ever , for which he was awarded an honour at an ACA function before Australia 's second Test against Sri Lanka . He was only required to bat once in the Tests , and made 67 not out as Australia swept Sri Lanka aside 2 – 0 . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 On 26 January 2008 during the 4th and final Test of the 2007 – 08 series against India , Gilchrist announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the season . A back injury kept Ricky Ponting off the field for sections of the Indian 's second innings , resulting in Gilchrist captaining the team for the part of final two days of his Test cricket career . India batted out the match for a draw , so Gilchrist 's 14 in the first innings was his final Test innings ; he took his 379th and final catch when Virender Sehwag was caught behind . Gilchrist had scored only 150 runs at 21 @.@ 42 in his final Test series . 
 John Buchanan , who coached Australia during most of Gilchrist 's international career , predicted that Gilchrist 's retirement would have more impact than the previous year 's retirements of Damien Martyn , Glenn McGrath , Shane Warne and Justin Langer and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd asked Gilchrist to reconsider . Gilchrist later revealed that he chose to retire after dropping VVS Laxman during the first innings , and realising that he had lost his " competitive edge . " He played out the summer 's ODI series , before ending in disappointment when India beat Australia 2 – 0 in the 2007 @-@ 08 Commonwealth Bank Series finals . Gilchrist managed only seven and two in the finals . His highlight of the series was his scoring 118 and being named Man of the Match in his final match at his adopted home in Perth on 15 February 2008 , against Sri Lanka . He ended his final series with 322 runs at 32 @.@ 20 . 
 = = = Indian Premier League = = = 
 Gilchrist was contracted by the Hyderabad @-@ based Deccan Chargers in the inaugural season 's player auction for US $ 700 @,@ 000 . In Deccan 's fourth match of the inaugural 2008 season , Gilchrist hammered the second fastest hundred in the IPL , off just 42 balls , as Deccan recorded their first win , against Mumbai . Gilchrist led the Deccan Chargers in the second half of the IPL in the absence of regular captain VVS Laxman , who was ruled out for the rest of the tournament due to injury . Deccan came last , winning only two of 14 matches . 
 In the second season , Gilchrist was installed as captain in place of Laxman by new coach and former Australian teammate Darren Lehmann . The team started well and won their first four matches but stumbled and won only three of their remaining ten qualifying matches . They qualified fourth into the semifinals and Gilchrist led the team to the final by striking 85 off just 35 balls against the Delhi Daredevils . Although made a duck in the final against the Royal Challengers Bangalore , Deccan won by six runs to take the title . Gilchrist was named the Player of The Tournament . 
 In the fourth season , Gilchrist was contracted by Kings XI Punjab for US $ 900 @,@ 000 . He was chosen the captain for the team as Kumar Sangakkara ( former captain of Punjab ) had moved to Deccan Chargers . In March 2012 he was named " player @-@ coach " , replacing his friend and former Australia teammate Michael Bevan , whose contract as head coach was not renewed . Gilchrist had speculated on retiring from the IPL at the end of the 2012 season , after Kings XI Punjab failed to make it to the play @-@ offs . 
 In the sixth season , Gilchrist made a comeback for his final IPL stint . He stated the reason as being the Kings XI management 's decision to renew his contract for another season . An interesting change in the team staff was the induction of Darren Lehmann as the new Kings XI coach . This brought together the duo of Gilchrist and Lehmann who had guided their previous franchise , the Deccan Chargers to its 2009 IPL victory . Some good performances by the players led the Kings XI Punjab team eyeing for the fourth spot in the play @-@ offs and a possible maiden win under Gilchrist 's leadership . They were knocked out very late in the tournament . In his final game at IPL , Gilchrist decided to bowl the last over of the match against the Mumbai Indians , where he got the wicket of Harbhajan Singh of his first ball , securing <unk> 's victory in the match . In a recent press conference , Gilchrist has confirmed that this will be his final IPL season and that he was looking forward to a fresh start in the inaugural Caribbean Premier League in July 2013 . 
 = = = Middlesex = = = 
 He signed a short @-@ term contract in November 2009 to play English Twenty20 cricket for Middlesex between 3 and 24 June 2010 . He was appointed interim captain on 11 June upon the sudden resignation of Shaun Udal . In addition to the seven Twenty20 fixtures , he is also captaining the county versus the touring Australians in a fifty @-@ over friendly . 
 In addition to this he will be taking part in the major sporting events Titans of Cricket in October 2011 – an evening of exciting challenges for famous sportsmen , touring across the UK in Manchester and Birmingham , with the grand finale in London 's O2 
 In July 2014 , he played for the Rest of the World side in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord 's . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Gilchrist 's attacking batting has been a key part of Australia 's one @-@ day success , as he usually opened the batting . He was a part of the successful 1999 , 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns . Gilchrist 's Test batting average in the upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket @-@ keeper . He is currently 45th on the all – time list of highest batting averages . He maintains a Test strike @-@ rate of 82 runs per hundred balls , the highest since balls were recorded in full . His combination of attack and consistency create one of the most dynamic world cricketers ever , playing shots to all areas of the field with uncommon timing . He second on the all @-@ time list of most sixes in Tests at 100 with only Brendon McCullum ahead of him with 107 . Gilchrist 's skills as a wicket @-@ keeper are sometimes questioned ; some people would claim that he is the best keeper in Australia while Victorian wicket @-@ keeper Darren Berry was regarded by many as the best Australian wicket @-@ keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s . 
 In this role , Gilchrist is perhaps disadvantaged by his relatively tall stature for a pure wicket @-@ keeper . However , while perhaps not as elegant as some , he has successfully kept wicket for spin bowler Shane Warne and fast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee for most of his international career . His partnerships with McGrath and Lee are second and fourth respectively in both test and ODI history for the number of wickets taken . With Alec Stewart and Mark Boucher , he shares the record for most catches ( 6 ) by a wicketkeeper in a ODI match , however he has now achieved this feat five times , the most recent versus India in 2008 CB Series . The match in 2007 was also the second time he took six dismissals and scored a half century in the same ODI ; he remains the only player to do so even once . At Old Trafford in August 2005 , he passed Alec Stewart 's world record of 4 @,@ 540 runs as a Test wicketkeeper , Statistically , he is currently the most successful ODI wicket @-@ keeper in history ; with 417 catches and 55 stumpings , a total of 472 dismissals , his closest rival , Mark Boucher , is more than 80 dismissals behind . 
 = = Walking and discipline = = 
 Cricket has for many years debated whether batsmen should " walk " , that is to agree that they have been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for ( or contrary to ) an umpire 's decision . Gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high @-@ profile match , the 2003 World Cup semi @-@ final against Sri Lanka , after the umpire ruled him to be not out . He has since proclaimed himself to be " a walker " , or a batsman who will consistently walk , and has done so on numerous occasions . On one occasion against Bangladesh , Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball . Without such contact , he could not have been caught out . 
 Gilchrist 's actions have sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires . Ricky Ponting has declared on several occasions that he is not a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not . While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers , lower @-@ order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael <unk> both walked during Test matches in India in 2004 . In 2004 , New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a " walking crusade " when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane . After the appeal was turned down by the umpire , who did not hear the edge , Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge , and McMillan 's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone : " ... not everyone is walking , Gilly ... not everyone has to walk , mate ... " . The taunt was effective , however , as McMillan , perhaps distracted , missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket . Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had " zero support in the team " for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable . He added that he " felt isolated " and " silently accused of betraying the team . <unk> I was made to feel selfish , as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image , thereby making everyone else look dishonest . " 
 Gilchrist has been noted for his emotional outbursts on the cricket field , and has been fined multiple times for dissent against umpiring decisions . In January 2006 , he was fined 40 % of his match fee in an ODI against South Africa . In another instance , in early 2004 in Sri Lanka , Gilchrist audibly argued with umpire Peter Manuel after batting partner Andrew Symonds was given out . After the argument concluded , Manuel consulted umpiring partner Billy Bowden and reversed his decision , recalling Symonds to the crease . Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for publicly questioning the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan 's bowling action in 2002 , as his comments were found to be in breach of the clause in the player code of conduct relating to " detrimental public comment " . 
 During the 2003 World Cup , Gilchrist accused Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif of making a racist remark towards him while the latter was batting in their group match . Latif who was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd , threatened to sue Gilchrist for this claim . 
 = = Charity , media , business career and political work = = 
 Outside cricket , Gilchrist is an ambassador for the charity World Vision in India , a country in which he is popular due to his cricketing achievements , and sponsors a boy whose father has died . He was approached in early 2005 by the US baseball franchise , the Boston Red Sox , with a view to him playing for them when his cricket career ended . However , he was selected for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and announced his retirement from Test and One @-@ Day cricket in early 2008 . 
 In March 2008 , Gilchrist joined the Nine Network . Gilchrist has appeared as one of a panel of revolving co @-@ hosts for the revived Wide World of Sports Weekend Edition . He made his debut on the program in March 2008 , and <unk> on Nine 's cricket coverage during the Australian summer . In 2013 Gilchrist joined Ricky Ponting and various other names in cricket to commentate for Channel Ten in the third series of the Big Bash League . 
 As Amway Australia Ambassador , Gilchrist has played a role in many of their charity events . In August 2010 , he presented the Freedom Wheels program , an initiative to provide modified bikes to kids with disabilities , a cheque for $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 Gilchrist has been the chair of the National Australia Day Council since 2008 . In 2008 , Gilchrist supported debate on whether Australia Day should be moved to a new date because the current date marks European settlement and is offensive to many Aboriginal Australians . Gilchrist is considered to have left @-@ wing views ; Australian captain Ricky Ponting commented in his annual Captain 's Diary that his deputy had a penchant for reading Karl Marx while on tour . 
 Gilchrist has had a number of company directorships outside of cricket . His appointment to the board of <unk> listed sandalwood company TFS Corporation , committee member of Commonwealth Business Forum in Perth and director of <unk> . The appointment to TFS Corporation was not without controversy when as a board member of TFS he was named as a plaintiff suing his own TFS shareholders for defamation 
 = = Autobiography = = 
 Gilchrist 's autobiography True Colours , published in 2008 , was the subject of much controversy . Gilchrist questioned the integrity of leading Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar in relation to the evidence he presented in the <unk> dispute , which was about allegations of racism against Harbhajan Singh . The autobiography said that Tendulkar told the first hearing that he could not hear what Harbhajan said to Andrew Symonds ; Gilchrist said he was " certain he [ Tendulkar ] was telling the truth " because he was " a fair way away " . Gilchrist then questioned why Tendulkar then agreed with Harbhajan 's claim at the second hearing that the exchange was an obscenity , and concluded that the process was " a joke " . He also raised questions over Tendulkar 's sportsmanship and said he was " hard to find for a changing @-@ room handshake after we have beaten India " . 
 There was a backlash in India , which forced Gilchrist to clarify his position . Gilchrist later insisted that he did not accuse Tendulkar of lying in his testimony . He also denied calling the Indian a " bad sport " in regards to the handshake issue . Tendulkar responded by saying that " those remarks came from someone who doesn 't know me enough . I think he made loose statements ... I reminded him that I was the first person to shake hands after the Sydney defeat . " The autobiography also blamed the ICC for allowing Sri Lankan cricketer Muralitharan to bowl ; Gilchrist believes that ICC changed the throwing law to legitimise a bowling action that he regards as illegitimate . The law change was described as " a load of horse crap . That 's rubbish . " Gilchrist claimed that Muralitharan threw the ball and alleged that the ICC protected him because Sri Lankan cricket authorities portrayed any criticism of the bowler 's legitimacy as racism and a witchhunt conducted by whites . In response to these comments , former Sri Lankan captain Marvan Atapattu said that by questioning the credentials of players like Muralitharan and Tendulkar , Gilchrist had done no good to his own reputation .

 = Carom billiards = 
 Carom billiards , sometimes called carambole billiards or simply carambole ( and in some cases used as a synonym for the game of straight rail from which many carom games derive ) , is the overarching title of a family of billiards games generally played on cloth @-@ covered , 1 @.@ 5 @-@ by @-@ 3 @.@ 0 @-@ metre ( 5 by 10 ft ) <unk> tables , which often feature heated slate beds . In its simplest form , the object of the game is to score points or " counts " by caroming one 's own cue ball off both the opponent 's cue ball and the object ball ( s ) on a single shot . The invention as well as the exact date of origin of carom billiards is somewhat obscure but is thought to be traceable to 18th @-@ century France . 
 There is a large array of carom billiards disciplines . Some of the more prevalent today and historically are ( chronologically by apparent date of development ) : straight rail , cushion caroms , balkline , three @-@ cushion billiards and artistic billiards . There are many other carom billiards games , predominantly intermediary or offshoot games combining elements of those already listed , such as the champion 's game , an intermediary game between straight rail and balkline , as well as games which are hybrids of carom billiards and pocket billiards , such as English billiards played on a snooker table and its descendant games , American four @-@ ball billiards , and cowboy pool . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word carom , which simply means any strike and rebound , was in use in reference to billiards by at least 1779 , sometimes spelled " carrom " . Sources differ on the origin . It has been pegged variously as a shortening of the Spanish and Portuguese word carambola , or the French word carambole , which are used to describe the red object ball . Some <unk> have suggested that carambola , in turn , was derived from a yellow @-@ to @-@ orange , tropical Asian fruit also known in Portuguese as a carambola ( which was a corruption of the original name of the fruit , <unk> in the Marathi language of India ) , also known as star fruit . But this may simply be folk etymology , as the fruit bears no resemblance to a billiard ball , and there is no direct evidence for such a derivation . 
 In modern French , the word <unk> means ' successive collision ' , currently used mainly in reference to carom or cannon shots in billiards , and to multiple @-@ vehicle car crashes ) . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 = = = Cloth = = = 
 Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century . The predecessor company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth , Iwan Simonis , was formed in 1453 . Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of baize that is dyed green , and is made from 100 % worsted wool , which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance across the table bed . The green color of cloth was originally chosen to emulate the look of grass , and has been so colored since the 16th century . However , as in green <unk> , the color also serves a useful function : Humans have a higher light sensitivity to green than to any other color , so green cloth permits play for longer periods of time without eye strain . 
 = = = Balls = = = 
 Modern billiard balls are made from highly resilient plastics with a typical diameter of 61 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 42 in ) . They are significantly larger and heavier than their pocket billiards counterparts , ranging between 205 and 220 grams ( 7 @.@ 2 and 7 @.@ 8 oz ) with a typical weight of 210 g ( 7 @.@ 5 oz ) . While UMB , the International Olympic Committee @-@ recognized world carom billiards authority , technically permits balls as small as 61 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) , no major manufacturer produces such balls any longer , and the de facto standard is 61 @.@ 5 mm ( 2 @.@ 42 in ) . The three standard balls in most carom billiards games consist of a completely white cue ball , a second cue ball with typically a red or black dot on it ( to aid in differentiation between the two cue balls ) , and a third , red ball . In some sets of balls , however , the second cue ball is solid yellow . Both types of ball sets are permitted in tournament play . 
 Billiard balls have been made from many different materials throughout the history of the game , including clay , wood , ivory , plastics ( including celluloid , Bakelite , <unk> , and phenolic resin , polyester and acrylic ) and even steel . The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid @-@ 20th century was ivory . The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters . It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $ 10 @,@ 000 for a substitute material . The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls , invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868 , but the material was volatile and highly inflammable , sometimes exploding during manufacture . 
 = = = Cues = = = 
 Carom billiard cues have specialized refinements making them different from the typical pool cue with which many people are more familiar . Such cues tend to be shorter and lighter overall , with a shorter ferrule , a thicker butt and joint , a wooden joint pin ( in high @-@ end examples ) and collarless wood @-@ to @-@ wood joint ( for a one @-@ piece cue " feel " ) , a fast , conical taper , and a smaller tip diameter as compared with pool cues . Typical cues are 140 – 140 cm ( 54 – 56 in ) in length and 470 – 520 g ( 16 @.@ 5 – 18 @.@ 5 oz ) in weight — lighter for straight rail , heavier for three @-@ cushion — with a tip 11 – 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 43 – 0 @.@ 47 in ) in diameter . The specialization makes the cue significantly stiffer , which aids in handling the larger and heavier billiard balls as compared with pool cues . It also acts to reduce deflection ( sometimes called " squirt " ) , which may be defined as displacement of the cue ball 's path away from the parallel line formed by the cue stick 's direction of travel . It is a factor that occurs every time english ( side ) is employed , and its effects are magnified by speed . In some carom games , deflection plays a large role because many shots require extremes of english , coupled with great speed ; this is a combination typically minimized as much as possible , by contrast , in pool . The wood used in carom cues can vary widely , and most quality carom cues are handmade . 
 = = = Heated slate = = = 
 The slate bed of a billiard table is often heated to about 5 ° C ( 9 ° F ) above room temperature , which helps to keep moisture out of the cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner , and generally makes a table play faster . A heated table is required under international carom rules and is an especially important requirement for the games of three @-@ cushion billiards and artistic billiards . Heating table beds is an old practice . Queen Victoria ( lived 1819 – 1901 ) had a billiard table that was heated using zinc tubes , although the aim at that time was chiefly to keep the then @-@ used ivory balls from warping . The first use of electric heating was for an 18 @.@ 2 balkline tournament held in December 1927 between Welker Cochran and Jacob Schaefer , Jr . The New York Times announced it with fanfare : " For the first time in the history of world 's championship balkline billiards a heated table will be used ... "

 = = = Straight rail = = = 
 Straight rail , sometimes referred to as carom billiards , straight billiards , the three @-@ ball game , the carambole game , and the free game in Europe , is thought to date to the 18th century , although no exact time of origin is known . It was known as French caroms , French billiards or the French game in early times , taking those bygone names from the French who popularized it . The object of straight rail is simple : one point , called a " count " , is scored each time a player 's cue ball makes contact with both object balls ( the second cue ball and the third ball ) on a single stroke . A win is achieved by reaching an agreed upon number of counts . 
 At straight rail 's inception there was no restriction on the manner of scoring . However , the technique of <unk> , or freezing two balls into the corner where the rails meet — the crotch — vastly increasing counts , resulted in an 1862 rule which allowed only three counts before at least one ball had to be driven away . Techniques continued to develop which increased counts greatly despite the <unk> prohibition , especially the development of a variety of " nurse " techniques . The most important of these , the rail nurse , involves the progressive nudging of the object balls down a rail , ideally moving them just a few centimeters on each count , keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same configuration such that the nurse can be replicated again and again . 
 Straight rail is still popular in Europe , where it is considered a fine practice game for both balkline and three @-@ cushion billiards . Additionally , Europe hosts professional competitions known as <unk> after the ancient Greek Olympic competitions , in which straight rail is featured as one of five billiards disciplines at which players compete , the other four being 47 @.@ 1 balkline , cushion caroms , 71 @.@ 2 balkline and three @-@ cushion billiards . 
 Straight rail was played professionally in the US from 1873 to 1879 , but is uncommon there today . 
 = = = The champion 's game = = = 
 The new game appearing in 1879 , called the champion 's game or limited @-@ rail , is considered an intermediary game between straight rail and balkline and was designed with the specific intent of frustrating the rail nurse . The game employed diagonal lines — balklines — at the table 's corners to regions where counts were restricted , thus " cutting off four triangular spaces in the four corners , [ taking ] away 711 mm ( 28 in ) of the ' nursing ' surface of the end rails and 1 @,@ 422 mm ( 56 in ) on the long rails . " Ultimately , however , despite its divergence from straight rail , the champion 's game simply expanded the dimensions of the balk space defined under the existing crotch prohibition which was not sufficient to stop nursing .

 Balkline succeeded the champion 's game , adding more rules to curb nursing techniques . There are many variation of balkline but all divide the table into marked regions called balk spaces . Such balk spaces define areas of the table surface in which a player may only score up to a threshold number of points while the object balls are within that region . 
 In the balkline games , rather than drawing balklines a few inches from the corners , the entire table is divided into rectangular balk spaces , by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and <unk> across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail . This divides the table into eight rectangular <unk> . Additionally , rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail , called anchor spaces , which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline , no count limit was in place . 
 For the most part , the differences between one balkline game to another is defined by two measures : 1 ) the spacing of the balklines , and 2 ) the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave the region . Generally , balkline games , and their particular restrictions , are given numerical names indicating both of these characteristics ; the first number indicated either inches or centimeters depending on the game , and the second , after a dot , indicates the count restriction in balk spaces , which is always either one or two . For example , in 18 @.@ 2 balkline , one of the more prominent balkline games and of U.S. origin , the name indicates that balklines are drawn 18 inches distant from each rail , and only two counts are allowed ( before the first short , we call " entrée " and for the second short " <unk> " ) in a balk space before a ball must leave ( in 18 @.@ 1 , we call directly the first short " <unk> " ) . By contrast , in 71 @.@ 2 balkline , of French invention , lines are drawn 71 centimeters distant from each rail , also with a two count restriction for balk spaces . 
 Over its history balkline has had many variations including 8 @.@ 2 , 10 @.@ 2 , 12 @.@ 2 , 13 @.@ 2 , 12 ½ .2 , 14 @.@ 1 , 14 @.@ 2 , 18 @.@ 1 , 18 @.@ 2 , 28 @.@ 2 , 38 @.@ 2 , 39 @.@ 2 , 42 @.@ 2 , 45 @.@ 1 , 45 @.@ 2 , 47 @.@ 1 , 47 @.@ 2 , 57 @.@ 2 and 71 @.@ 2 balkline . In its various incarnations , balkline was the predominate carom discipline from 1883 to the 1930s when it was overtaken by three @-@ cushion billiards ( and pocket billiards ) . Balkline is popular in Europe and the Far East . 
 = = = Cushion caroms = = = 
 Cushion caroms , sometimes called by its original name , the indirect game , is traceable to 1820 's Britain and is a descendant of the doublet game dating to at least 1807 . The game is sometimes referred to as one @-@ cushion or one @-@ cushion billiards , which is the direct translation of its name into English from various other languages such as Spanish ( " una banda " ) and German ( " <unk> " ) . 
 The object of the game is to score cushion caroms , meaning a carom off of both object balls with at least one rail being struck before the hit on the second object ball . <unk> caroms was defunct for a number of years , but was revived in the late 1860s as another alternative to straight rail , for the same reasons that balkline developed , i.e. , as an alternative to the tedium engendered by the use of the " rail nurse " ( see above ) . Cushion caroms is still popular in Europe . 
 = = = Three @-@ cushion billiards = = = 
 In three @-@ cushion billiards , sometimes called three @-@ cushion carom , or carambole , the object is to carom off both object balls with at least three rail cushions being contacted before the contact of the cue ball with the second object ball . Three @-@ cushion is a very difficult game . Averaging one point per inning is professional @-@ level play , and averaging 1 @.@ 5 to 2 is world @-@ class play . An average of one means that for every turn at the table , a player makes 1 point and misses once , thus making a point on 50 % of his or her shots . 
 The origin of the game is not entirely known . It is undisputed that one Wayman Crow McCreery of St. Louis , Missouri popularized the game in the 1870s . At least one publication categorically states he invented the game as well . The first three @-@ cushion billiards tournament took place January 14 – 31 , 1878 in St. Louis , with McCreery a participant and New Yorker Leon Magnus the winner . The high run for the tournament was just 6 points , and the high average a 0 @.@ 75 . The game was infrequently played , with many top carom players of the era voicing their dislike of it , until after the 1907 introduction of the Lambert Trophy . By 1924 , three @-@ cushion had become so popular that two giants in other billiard disciplines agreed to take up the game especially for a challenge match . On September 22 , 1924 , Willie Hoppe , the world 's balkline champion ( who later took up three @-@ cushion with a passion ) , and Ralph Greenleaf , the world 's straight pool title holder , played a well advertised , multi @-@ day , match to 600 points . Hoppe was the eventual winner with a final score in of 600 – 527 . 
 Three @-@ cushion billiards retains great popularity in parts of Europe , Asia , and Latin America , and is the most popular carom billiards game played in the US today , where pool is far more widespread . The principal governing body of the sport is the Union Mondiale de Billard ( UMB ) . It had been staging world three @-@ cushion championships since the late 1920s . The International Olympic Committee @-@ recognized World Pool @-@ Billiard Association ( WPA ) cooperates with the UMB to keep their rulesets synchronized . 
 = = = Artistic billiards = = = 
 In artistic billiards , sometimes called fantasy billiards or ( in French ) fantaisie classique , players compete at performing 76 preset shots of varying difficulty . Each set shot has a maximum point value assigned for perfect execution , ranging from a 4 @-@ point minimum for lowest level difficulty shots , and climbing to an 11 @-@ point maximum for shots deemed highest in difficulty level . There is a total of 500 points available to a player . The governing body of the sport is the Confédération Internationale de Billard <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 Each shot in an artistic billiards match is played from a well @-@ defined position ( in some venues within an exacting two millimeter tolerance ) , and each shot must unfold in an established manner . Players are allowed three attempts at each shot . In general , the shots making up the game — even 4 @-@ point shots — require a high degree of skill , devoted practice and specialized knowledge to perform . 
 World title competition first started in 1986 and required the use of ivory balls . However , this requirement was dropped in 1990 . The highest score ever achieved in world competition was 374 , by the Frenchman Jean <unk> in 1992 , while the highest score in competition overall is 427 set by Belgian Walter Bax on March 12 , 2006 at a competition held in Deurne , Belgium , beating his own previous record of 425 . The game is played predominantly in western Europe , especially in France , Belgium and the Netherlands .

 The 2012 Sheraton Hawaii Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game held on December 24 , 2012 at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu , Hawaii in the United States . The eleventh edition of the Hawaii Bowl began at 3 : 00 p.m. <unk> and aired on ESPN . It featured the SMU Mustangs from Conference USA against the Mountain West Conference co @-@ champion Fresno State Bulldogs , and was the final game of the 2012 NCAA Division I FBS football season for both teams . The Mustangs accepted their invitation after earning a 6 @-@ 6 record in the regular season , while the Bulldogs accepted their invitation after a 9 @-@ 3 regular season record . 
 The pre @-@ game buildup focused primarily on the strong rushing attacks of both teams as well as the overall sound offense of Fresno State . Most analysts predicted a resounding victory by Fresno State . The point spread favored Fresno State as 12 @-@ point favorites over the Mustangs . Contrary to predictions , SMU won the game by a score of 43 @-@ 10 , largely thanks to the play of defensive end Margus Hunt , who forced two fumbles and totaled three sacks ( including one safety ) as well as two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns . Consequently , Hunt and Fresno State 's Davante Adams , who totaled 13 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown , were named the game 's co @-@ Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) .

 Conference USA has had its tie @-@ in to the Hawaii Bowl ever since the game 's establishment in 2002 . The Mountain West Conference started its affiliation with the game when the hometown Hawaii Warriors moved to said conference ( previously , Hawaii , and said tie @-@ in , belonged to the Western Athletic Conference ) . In fact , Hawaii has an automatic bid to the bowl game should it be eligible ; however , because of its 3 @-@ 9 record in 2012 , it was not bowl @-@ eligible , leaving the spot to the fifth bowl @-@ eligible Mountain West team . The 2012 Hawaii Bowl was the seventh meeting between Fresno State and SMU , the last one coming in 2004 . 
 This was the Mustangs ' second Hawaii Bowl , following the 2009 game where they defeated the Nevada Wolf Pack by a score of 45 @-@ 10 ( SMU 's first bowl bid since playing in Hawaii in the 1984 Aloha Bowl , and their first since the program was relaunched in 1989 after being shut down for two years due to massive NCAA rules violations ) . It also was the Mustangs ' final game as a member of Conference USA before they moved to the Big East Conference in 2013 .

 One of the keys to the game , according to ESPN.com blogger Matt Fortuna , was to stop the run . Both teams had 1 @,@ 000 + yard rushers ( Zach Line for SMU , Robbie Rouse for Fresno State ) , but SMU 's rush defense ( 24th in FBS ) was better than Fresno State 's ( 73rd in FBS ) . Many analysts predicted that Fresno State would emerge victorious , some going as far as to predict a blowout , but said that for SMU to emerge victorious , they would have to win the field position battle as well as create turnovers .

 In their first season in the Mountain West , the Bulldogs became co @-@ champions with a 7 @-@ 1 conference record . This was the Bulldogs ' first appearance in the Hawaii Bowl . Coming into the 2012 season , Bulldogs ' coach Tim <unk> said that his team would challenge for a Mountain West Conference title . After making good on that promise , the Bulldogs attempted to achieve their first bowl victory since the 2007 Humanitarian Bowl . A victory in the Hawaii Bowl would have given Fresno State a 10 @-@ win season for the first time since 2001 , when quarterback Derek Carr 's older brother David was the Bulldogs ' quarterback . 
 = = = = Offense = = = = 
 Fresno State was led offensively by their quarterback , junior Derek Carr , who finished 14th in the country in quarterback rating ( 155 @.@ 9 ) , 8th in passing yards ( 4 @,@ 104 ) , and tied for 3rd in touchdowns ( 37 ) . Carr was named the Mountain West Conference Player of the Year and announced before the game that he would return to Fresno State to play his senior season . The Bulldogs were riding a five @-@ game winning streak coming into the game ; the fewest points they scored during any game of that streak was 42 . The Bulldogs ' rushing attack was led by 5 @-@ foot , 7 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 70 m ) 190 @-@ pound ( 86 kg ) senior running back Robbie Rouse , who rushed for 1490 yards , which ranked 14th in the country . Rouse , who rushed for over 100 yards in nine games during the regular season , was also Fresno State 's second @-@ leading receiver ( in terms of receptions ) , catching the ball 63 times for 435 yards . Carr 's top target in the passing game was redshirt freshman wideout Davante Adams , who had broken several school records during his freshman year including becoming just the seventh freshman in school history to record over 100 yards receiving in a single game and setting the single @-@ game school record for a freshman by recording 12 receptions against Oregon . In total , Adams amassed 102 catches for 1312 yards and 14 touchdowns , all of which led the team . His efforts earned him a spot on Phil Steele 's fourth @-@ team All @-@ America squad and accolades as the Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year . Fresno State 's starter at tight end was senior Marcel Jensen , who totaled 20 receptions for 339 yards and 4 touchdowns , all of which were career highs .

 SMU struck first in the second quarter via a 17 @-@ yard rush from Gilbert , their quarterback , to put the Bulldogs up 7 @-@ 0 . Fresno State 's ensuing drive started with a first down , but ended when quarterback Derek Carr was sacked by SMU defender Margus Hunt ; Hunt forced a fumble that was recovered by the Mustangs at the Fresno State 16 @-@ yard line . SMU gained only three yards on their drive , but due to their excellent field position , kicker Chase Hover was able to convert a 30 @-@ yard field goal making it 10 @-@ 0 . 
 Fresno State 's offensive woes continued on their next drive . On second down , Carr was sacked for a loss of 18 yards to the 6 @-@ yard line .

The drive stalled from there , however , after a six @-@ yard loss on a pass play , a false start penalty , a pass completed for no gain , and an incomplete pass . After a 42 @-@ yard punt that was returned for 4 yards , SMU was set up at their 14 @-@ yard line . The ensuing drive for SMU showed promise after they got into Bulldog territory , but an interception by Sean Alston returned for 50 yards to the SMU 15 ended any chance of scoring for the Mustangs . Fresno State finally put points on the board after setting up in the red zone ; Carr threw a 6 @-@ yard pass to Adams making the score 22 @-@ 7 after Quentin Breshears tacked on the point after . On the ensuing drive , SMU ran 7 plays for 75 yards in 3 : 20 in a drive that culminated with a 21 @-@ yard touchdown pass from Gilbert to Darius Johnson ; the drive included a 27 @-@ yard rush by Zach Line as well as a 19 @-@ yard pass from Gilbert to Der <unk> Thompson .

 SM U @-@ 21 was a U @-@ boat built for the Imperial German Navy shortly before World War I. The third of four Type U @-@ 19 @-@ class submarines , these were the first U @-@ boats in German service to be equipped with diesel engines . U @-@ 21 was built between 1910 and October 1913 at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Danzig . She was armed with four torpedo tubes and a single deck gun , though a second was added during her career . 
 In September 1914 , U @-@ 21 became the first submarine to sink a ship with a self @-@ propelled torpedo when she destroyed the cruiser HMS Pathfinder off the Firth of Forth . She also sank several transports in the English Channel and the Irish Sea later in the year , all in accordance with the cruiser rules then in effect . In early 1915 , U @-@ 21 was transferred to the Mediterranean Sea to support the Ottoman Empire against the Anglo @-@ French attacks during the Gallipoli Campaign . Shortly after her arrival , she sank the British battleships HMS Triumph and HMS Majestic while they were bombarding Ottoman positions at Gallipoli . Further successes followed in the Mediterranean in 1916 , including the sinking of the French armored cruiser Amiral Charner in February . 
 Throughout 1916 , U @-@ 21 served in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy as U @-@ 36 , since Germany was not yet at war with Italy and thus could not legally attack Italian warships under the German flag . She returned to Germany in March 1917 to join the unrestricted commerce war against British maritime trade . In 1918 , she was withdrawn from front line service and was employed as a training submarine for new crews . She survived the war and sank while under tow by a British warship in 1919 . 
 = = Design = = 
 U @-@ 21 was 64 @.@ 15 meters ( 210 @.@ 5 ft ) long overall with a beam of 6 @.@ 10 m ( 20 @.@ 0 ft ) and a height of 8 @.@ 10 m ( 26 @.@ 6 ft ) . She displaced 650 metric tons ( 640 long tons ; 720 short tons ) surfaced and 837 t ( 824 long tons ; 923 short tons ) submerged . The boat 's propulsion system consisted of a pair of 8 @-@ cylinder 2 @-@ stroke diesel engines manufactured by MAN SE for use on the surface and two electric double motor @-@ dynamos built by AEG for use while submerged . U @-@ 21 and her sister boats were the first German submarines to be equipped with diesel engines . The electric motors were powered by a bank of two 110 @-@ cell batteries . U @-@ 21 could cruise at a top speed of 15 @.@ 4 knots ( 28 @.@ 5 km / h ; 17 @.@ 7 mph ) on the surface and 9 @.@ 5 knots ( 17 @.@ 6 km / h ; 10 @.@ 9 mph ) submerged . Steering was controlled by a pair of hydroplanes forward and another pair aft , and a single rudder . 
 U @-@ 21 was armed with four 50 @-@ centimeter ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes , which were supplied with a total of six torpedoes . One pair was located in the bow and the other was in the stern . She was initially fitted with a machine gun for use on the surface , but by the end of 1914 this was replaced with a 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 30 gun . In 1916 , a second 8 @.@ 8 cm gun was added . U @-@ 21 had a crew of four officers and twenty @-@ five enlisted sailors .

 U @-@ 21 was built at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Danzig ( now Gdańsk , Poland ) . She was laid down in 1910 and launched on 8 February 1913 . After fitting @-@ out work was completed , she was commissioned into the fleet on 22 October 1913 . 
 = = = North Sea operations = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , U @-@ 21 was based at the island of Heligoland in the German Bight , commanded by Kapitänleutnant ( Captain Lieutenant ) Otto Hersing . In early August , Hersing took U @-@ 21 on a patrol into the Dover Straits but he found no British vessels . On 14 August U @-@ 21 went on a second patrol , this time in company with her sister boats U @-@ 19 and U @-@ 22 , to the northern North Sea between Norway and Scotland . The patrol was an attempt to locate the British blockade line and gather intelligence , but they spotted only a single cruiser and a destroyer off the Norwegian coast . Hersing attempted to enter the Firth of Forth — a major Royal Navy fleet base — later in the month but was unsuccessful . 
 On 5 September 1914 , U @-@ 21 encountered the British scout cruiser HMS Pathfinder off the Isle of May . Hersing had surfaced his U @-@ boat to recharge his batteries when a lookout spotted smoke from Pathfinder 's funnels on the horizon . U @-@ 21 submerged to make an attack , but Pathfinder turned away on her patrol line ; U @-@ 21 could not hope to keep up with the cruiser while submerged , so Hersing broke off the chase and resumed recharging his batteries . Shortly thereafter , Pathfinder reversed course again and headed back toward U @-@ 21 . Hersing maneuvered into an attack position and fired a single torpedo , which hit Pathfinder just aft of her conning tower . The torpedo detonated one of the cruiser 's magazines , which destroyed the ship in a large explosion . The British were able to lower only a single lifeboat before Pathfinder sank . Other survivors were found clinging to wreckage by torpedo boats that rushed to the scene . Pathfinder was the first warship to be sunk by a modern submarine . A total of 261 sailors were killed in the attack . 
 U @-@ 21 caught the French steamer SS Malachite on 14 November ; after forcing the ship to stop and examining her cargo manifest , Hersing ordered the crew to abandon ship before he sank Malachite with his deck gun . U @-@ 21 's next success came three days later with the British collier SS Primo , which he also sank in accordance with the cruiser rules that governed commerce raiding . These two ships were the first vessels to be sunk in the restricted German submarine offensive against British and French merchant shipping . 
 On 22 January , Hersing took his U @-@ boat through the Dover Barrage in the Channel before turning into the Irish Sea . He shelled the airfield on Walney Island , though a coastal battery quickly forced him to withdraw . The next day , U @-@ 21 stopped the collier SS Ben Cruachan ; after evacuating her crew , the Germans sank her with scuttling charges . Later that day , U @-@ 21 stopped and sank the steamers SS Linda Blanche and SS <unk> . In both cases , Hersing adhered to the prize rules , including flagging down a passing trawler to pick up the ships ' crews . After these successes , U @-@ 21 withdrew from the area to avoid the British patrols that would arrive in the aftermath of the sinkings . After passing back through the Dover Barrage , U @-@ 21 cruised back to Wilhelmshaven . 
 = = = In the Mediterranean 1915 – 17 = = = 
 In April 1915 , U @-@ 21 was transferred to the Mediterranean Sea to support Germany 's ally , Turkey . She left Kiel on 25 April , and the first leg of the voyage , from Germany to Austria @-@ Hungary , took eighteen days . Hersing took his submarine north around Scotland to avoid the Dover patrols , and rendezvoused with the supply ship SS <unk> off Cape Finisterre to refuel . Unfortunately for the Germans , <unk> carried poor quality crude oil that could not be burned in the boat 's diesel engines ; U @-@ 21 had less than half of her fuel supply remaining , and was only halfway on the voyage to Austria @-@ Hungary . Hersing was forced to run his U @-@ boat on the surface to conserve fuel , which increased the risk of detection by Allied forces . While en route the Germans managed to escape from patrolling British and French torpedo boats and transport ships that might have reported their location . 
 U @-@ 21 finally arrived in Cattaro on 13 May , with only 1 @.@ 8 t ( 1 @.@ 8 long tons ; 2 @.@ 0 short tons ) of fuel left in her tanks — she had left Germany with 56 t ( 55 long tons ; 62 short tons ) . She spent a week at the Austro @-@ Hungarian submarine bases at Pola and Cattaro in mid @-@ May , where she was visited by Georg von Trapp , an Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boat commander . Several other German submarines joined U @-@ 21 in the following months , after calls for assistance from the Ottoman ground forces on the Gallipoli peninsula , who were taking heavy casualties from the bombardments from Allied warships . These U @-@ boats included U @-@ 33 , U @-@ 34 , U @-@ 35 , and U @-@ 39 . 
 U @-@ 21 arrived in her operational area off Gallipoli on 25 May ; that day , she encountered the British pre @-@ dreadnought battleship HMS Triumph . Hersing brought his U @-@ boat to within 300 yards ( 270 m ) of his target and fired a single torpedo , which hit Triumph . U @-@ 21 then dived under the sinking battleship to escape the destroyers hunting her . Hersing then took his boat to the sea floor to wait for the Allied forces to abandon the chase . After twenty @-@ eight hours on the sea floor , U @-@ 21 surfaced to recharge her batteries and bring in fresh air . On 27 May , Hersing attacked and sank his second battleship , HMS Majestic . This time , the British had attempted to protect her with torpedo nets and several small ships , but Hersing was able to aim a torpedo through the defenses . Majestic sank in the span of four minutes . These two successes brought significant dividends : all Allied capital ships were withdrawn to protected anchorages and were thus unable to bombard Ottoman positions on the peninsula . For these two successes , the crew of U @-@ 21 was awarded the Iron Cross by Kaiser Wilhelm II , while Hersing himself received the Pour le Mérite , Germany 's highest award for valor . 
 After sinking Majestic , Hersing took his submarine to refuel at a Turkish port before attempting the dangerous route through the Dardanelles to Constantinople . While transiting the straits , U @-@ 21 was nearly pulled into a whirlpool but the Germans managed to escape . After arriving in the Ottoman capital , the crew were given a large welcoming ceremony attended by Enver Pasha . U @-@ 21 required significant maintenance , and so the crew was given a month of shore leave while the repairs were carried out . Once the repair work was finished , U @-@ 21 sortied through the Dardanelles for another patrol . Hersing spotted the Allied munitions ship Carthage , which he sank with a single torpedo . Later on the patrol , a lookout on an Allied trawler spotted U @-@ 21 's periscope ; the Germans had to crash dive to escape from being rammed , but doing so brought them into a minefield . One mine exploded off the U @-@ boat 's stern but it caused no significant damage , and U @-@ 21 was able to withdraw to Constantinople . 
 U @-@ 21 thereafter moved to the Black Sea where she and UB @-@ 14 served as the nucleus of the newly formed Black Sea Flotilla . In September , U @-@ 21 undertook another patrol in the eastern Mediterranean . In the meantime , the Allies had finally managed to establish a complete blockade of the Dardanelles with mines and nets to prevent submarines from operating out of Constantinople . Unable to return to Constantinople , Hersing instead took his U @-@ boat back to Cattaro . Germany would not be in a formal state of war with Italy until August 1916 . As a result , German U @-@ boats could not legally attack Italian ships , despite the fact that Italy was at war with Austria @-@ Hungary . To circumvent this restriction , German submarines operating in the Mediterranean were commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , though their German crews remained aboard . Following her arrival in Cattaro , U @-@ 21 was commissioned as the Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ 36 . She served under this name until Italy declared war on Germany on 27 August 1916 . 
 In the meantime , U @-@ 36 began to have further successes against Allied maritime trade . On 1 February 1916 , she sank the British steamer SS Belle of France . A week later , U @-@ 36 torpedoed and sank the French armored cruiser Amiral Charner off the Syrian coast . The cruiser sank quickly with heavy loss of life ; 427 men went down with their ship . In the spring of 1916 , while patrolling off Sicily , U @-@ 36 encountered an Allied Q @-@ ship , an auxiliary cruiser disguised as an unarmed merchant ship . U @-@ 36 fired a shot across the Q @-@ ship 's bow , but it refused to stop and returned fire with a small deck gun . Hersing decided to close and sink the ship , which then revealed her heavy armament . Wounded by shell splinters , Hersing withdrew his submarine under cover of a smoke screen before submerging . 
 On 30 April , Hersing sank the British steamer City of Lucknow . He sank three small , Italian sailing vessels off Corsica between 26 and 28 October , and on 31 October U @-@ 21 sent the 5 @,@ 800 t ( 5 @,@ 700 @-@ long @-@ ton ) steamship <unk> to the bottom . Over the next three days , another four Italian ships — the steamships Bernardo Canale and Torero and two small sailing vessels — were sunk off Sicily . On 23 December , U @-@ 21 torpedoed the British steamer SS <unk> east of Crete , but the ship managed to reach Alexandria . 
 = = = Return to the North Sea = = = 
 In early 1917 , U @-@ 21 was recalled to Germany to join the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign being waged against Britain . While en route , she stopped and sank a pair of British sailing vessels off Oporto on 16 February and another pair of Portuguese sailing ships the next day . On 20 February , U @-@ 21 sank the French steamer Cacique in the Bay of Biscay . Two days later in the Western Approaches , she finished off the Dutch steamer Bandoeng , which had been damaged by the submarine UC @-@ 5 on 15 February . Seven more ships followed Bandoeng that day . They included six more Dutch steamers — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> — and the Norwegian steamer <unk> . On another patrol in late April , Hersing caught four more ships : the Norwegian <unk> and Theodore William on 22 April and <unk> on 29 April , along with the Russian Borrowdale on 30 April . Another Russian vessel , Lindisfarne , followed on 3 May . The British steamers <unk> and Killarney were sunk on 6 and 8 May , respectively . The Swedish Baltic , which proved to be Hersing 's last victory , was sunk on 27 June . 
 Hersing attacked a convoy of fifteen merchant ships escorted by fourteen destroyers in August south @-@ west of Ireland . He took U @-@ 21 between two of the escorting destroyers and briefly used his periscope to gauge the speed and course of the transports before firing two torpedoes and diving . Hersing reported both torpedoes hit and the destroyers immediately rushed to begin their depth charge attacks . After a five @-@ hour hunt , the destroyers withdrew to rejoin the convoy . The experience led Hersing to change tactics in future attacks on escorted convoys ; instead of attacking the ships from as far away as possible , he chose to fire his torpedoes at closer range and then dive under the transport ships , where the destroyers would be unable to launch their depth charges for fear of damaging the transports . As of 1918 , she was assigned to the III U @-@ boat Flotilla . Later in 1918 , the submarine was used as a training boat for new crews . She survived the war , but on 22 February 1919 , she accidentally sank in the North Sea while under tow to Britain , where she would be formally surrendered . 
 In the course of her commerce raiding , U @-@ 21 sank forty ships for a combined 113 @,@ 580 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and damaged two more for a total of 8 @,@ 918 gross register tons ( GRT ) . The ships sunk included two battleships and two cruisers .

In the episode , Comic Book Guy creates a new superhero called Everyman who takes powers from other superheroes . Homer is cast as the lead in the film adaptation . To get Homer into shape , the movie studio hires a celebrity fitness trainer , Lyle McCarthy , to help him . Homer gets into great shape and is really excited , but when McCarthy leaves to train another client , he starts over @-@ eating again and ultimately this leads to the film 's failure . 
 The episode was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg , who are " obsessed " fans of the show , and directed by Lance Kramer . " Homer The Whopper " was intended to be a commentary on how Hollywood treats superhero films . Rogen also guest stars in the episode as the character Lyle McCarthy , making him the second guest star to both write an episode and appear in it ; Ricky Gervais was the first . " Homer the Whopper " has received mixed reviews from television critics and acquired a Nielsen rating of 4 @.@ 3 in its original broadcast .

 Bart and Milhouse convince Comic Book Guy to publish a comic book he wrote titled Everyman , in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic books he touches . The comic becomes an instant hit , and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie . Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie , but only if he can pick the star . When Comic Book Guy sees Homer , he considers Homer perfect for the role , as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle @-@ aged fat man . But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role , so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape . After a month , Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production . 
 Soon afterward , however , McCarthy leaves Homer for another client . Without McCarthy to keep him in shape , Homer starts eating again and gains all the weight back . Homer can no longer fit into his costume or even his trailer , and the movie begins to go over budget . The studio executives and Comic Book Guy worry that the film will not be successful . The final version of the movie features scenes with the fat Homer and the physically fit Homer merged , upsetting and confusing the audience . After the premiere of the film , McCarthy returns and offers to get Homer into shape again , which Homer accepts . The studio executives offer to let Comic Book Guy direct the sequel , on the condition that Comic Book Guy lie to the fans and say he liked the film . Though pleased by the offer , Comic Book Guy rejects it and openly criticizes the movie online , and thus it becomes a box office failure and Everyman is never adapted again .

 Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg , writers of the film Superbad , are " obsessed " fans of The Simpsons . After learning that The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks was a fan of Superbad , they decided to ask the producers of the show if they could write an episode . In 2006 , Ricky Gervais , co @-@ creator of The Office , received credit for writing the season 17 episode " Homer Simpson , This Is Your Wife " . Rogen and Goldberg " thought if [ Gervais ] got to write one , maybe [ they ] could try . " They were invited to The Simpsons writers room , where they pitched several episode ideas . One was accepted , and they wrote an outline with the help of some feedback from the regular writers . 
 Rogen commented that he and Goldberg wanted to show with the episode how Hollywood generally ruins superhero films . He said that " the whole joke is that Homer is cast to play a guy who 's an everyman and they try to make him into this physically fit guy . " Rogen also noted that the plot mirrors the situation he was in while working on the film The Green Hornet , when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role . Show runner Al Jean commented that the writers tried not to repeat the comic book film theme from the " Radioactive Man " episode . Instead they decided to parody the fact that almost every comic book has been turned into a film . Jean commented that that scene in the episode in which the studio executives " are trying to think up an idea that hasn 't been done really is what they are doing these days [ in real life ] . " 
 The table read took place in August 2008 , and production on the episode began soon after that . Rogen later said that " we sat down for a read @-@ through and three hours later I 'm in a studio improv @-@ ing with Homer Simpson , it was the single greatest day of my life . " Rogen also guest stars in the episode as the character Lyle McCarthy , making him the second guest star to both write an episode and appear in it ; Gervais also appeared in the episode he wrote .

 Since airing , " Homer The Whopper " has received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . Steve Fritz of Newsarama called the episode " amazing " and commented that the " overall comic book theme was perfect . " Reviewers for TV Guide cited Matt Groening 's cameo , the dinner table scene , Homer trying to lose weight at the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart , and the opening scene where Bart questions Comic Book Guy about Spider @-@ Man as the highlights of the episode . 
 Robert Canning of IGN was positive about " Homer The Whopper " , giving it an 8 @.@ 6 / 10 rating . He commented that the first act of the episode was the strongest , while the others were weaker . Canning believed the reason for this was that the viewers have already seen Homer " struggle with his weight countless times , and Rogen 's trainer , though funny much of the time , will likely never be remembered as a classic guest role . " He added , however , that Rogen and Goldberg are able to find " a few new angles with the weight jokes , so it 's not a complete loss . " Overall , Canning thought " Homer The Whopper " was a good start to the twenty @-@ first season , and although the plot may not be very original , the writers added " freshness to the proceedings . " The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff did not think the script was as good as Gervais ' , but commented that Rogen and Goldberg " managed to make a mostly amusing season premiere . " He added that he thought the Hollywood satirizing featured in this episode had been overused on the show , but " the specificity of what the [ episode ] was making fun of — trainers who help stars slim down ( in this case , helping Homer slim down ) — went a long way toward making the episode palatable . " VanDerWerff concluded that while the episode " didn ’ t try anything new [ ... ] , [ he ] had fun with it all the same . " 
 = Overhill Cherokee = 
 Overhill Cherokee was the term for the Cherokee people located in their historic settlements in what is now the U.S. state of Tennessee in the Southeastern United States , on the west side of the Appalachian Mountains . This name was used by 18th @-@ century European traders and explorers from British colonies along the Atlantic coast , as they had to cross the mountains to reach these settlements . 
 Situated along the lower Little Tennessee , lower Tellico , and lower Hiwassee rivers , the Overhill towns rose to prominence within the Cherokee Nation in the early 18th century , when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists . In the early part of the century , the Overhill towns ' remote location at the far end of the Trading Path meant they were reached only by those traders and explorers adventurous enough to make the difficult journey to the interior over the mountain range . By the middle of the century , the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries , as the two powers struggled for the control of the continent and the lucrative fur trade . 
 During and following the American Revolutionary War , in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , the westward thrust of Euro @-@ American settlement led to the decline of the Overhill towns . The Cherokee were forced to cede most of their lands in this area through a series of unfavorable treaties with the United States , and they migrated to the south and west away from settler pressure for a time . 
 The Overhill town of Chota , in present @-@ day Monroe County , Tennessee , was recognized as the de facto capital of the entire Cherokee Nation for most of the 18th century , when it was the major settlement . The town of Tanasi became the namesake for the state of Tennessee . Many prominent Cherokee leaders , including Attakullakulla , Oconastota , Nancy Ward , and Sequoyah , were born and raised in Overhill towns . 
 In the 1970s , most of the former Overhill sites were submerged by the impoundment of the Little Tennessee River in a Tennessee Valley Authority project . But , archaeologists conducted extensive excavations prior to this , during which they identified most of the Overhill towns and extracted thousands of artifacts , helping them develop volumes of invaluable information regarding the region 's Cherokee and pre @-@ Cherokee inhabitants . Different cultures of indigenous peoples had lived along the river for 12 @,@ 000 years . 
 = = Geographic area = = 
 The Overhill settlements were concentrated around three rivers at the base of the Great Smoky Mountains and the Unicoi Mountains , in what are now Monroe and Polk counties in Tennessee . The northernmost of these three rivers , the Little Tennessee , was the locus for a string of prominent Overhill settlements situated between modern @-@ day Vonore and Calderwood Dam . Other important settlements were situated along the Hiwassee River south of modern <unk> and along the Tellico River in modern Tellico Plains . 
 Although Native Americans used most of the Tennessee side of the Great Smoky Mountains primarily as a hunting ground , early Euro @-@ American explorers recalled abandoned villages and temporary hunting camps scattered around the region . These were often found in the game @-@ rich coves of the northern part of the range and near the junctions of major streams .

 The Trading Path ( later called the Unicoi Turnpike ) connected the Overhill towns with the Middle settlements in North Carolina , the Lower towns in South Carolina , and extended to Charleston , South Carolina . 
 The Warriors ' Path connected Hiwassee Old Town , Great Tellico , and Chota , which were the main villages along the three rivers in the Overhill country . 
 A branch of the <unk> and Southeastern Trail connected the Overhill towns along the Upper Little Tennessee with the <unk> towns in North Carolina via <unk> Cove , Cades Cove and <unk> Gap ( near Gregory Bald ) . 
 The War Trace ran from the Upper Cherokee area , through southeast Kentucky , along Mason 's Creek or Mace 's Creek , and present @-@ day Viper , Kentucky , passing through the Overhill towns and reaching the Georgia Cherokee towns . It also had connections to the Warrior 's Path and the Cumberland Gap , Tennessee , area , and the Cherokee villages of Sullen Possum and Wildcat . 
 = = History = = 
 Early Euro @-@ American explorers in Southern Appalachia noted that the Cherokee were concentrated around three general regions . The " Lower Towns " were centered on the town of <unk> in the hills of South Carolina and northeastern Georgia . The " Middle Towns " were centered on <unk> and <unk> amidst the Great Balsam Mountains and eastern Unicoi Mountains in western North Carolina . The Overhill Cherokee lived in settlements located between the Appalachian Mountains and the Tennessee Valley in what is now Tennessee . The Overhill capital , or " mother town , " shifted between Great Tellico , Tanasi , and Chota . 
 The Overhill settlements were established sometime between the late 16th century and the late 17th century , although scholars disagree as to a more exact timeframe . The major towns were well settled by the time the first Euro @-@ American explorers arrived in the late 17th century . The Overhill Cherokee were recognized as speaking a dialect distinctive from that found in the Middle and Lower towns , although all the people identified as Cherokee . 
 = = = Early accounts = = = 
 For most of the 17th century , the British colonies on the Atlantic coast dealt with the Cherokee via representatives of other tribes acting as middlemen . As the fur trade expanded in importance with rising demand in European markets , traders and trappers went to the Overhill settlements for direct contact with the Cherokee and other western tribes . In 1673 , Virginia merchants sent agents James Needham and Gabriel Arthur on a trip west of the Appalachians , hoping to open a direct trade route . While Needham was killed on the return trip , Arthur stayed behind . He later claimed to have accompanied the natives ( possibly the Cherokee ) on raids of Spanish settlements in Florida . 
 In 1725 , South Carolina sent Col. George Chicken on a diplomatic mission to the Overhill towns to address the issue of unlicensed traders , who were underselling merchants conducting business legally . Chicken arrived in Great Tellico in July . He described the village as " compact and thick settled ; " the town and tribe had long competed in the region with the Creek tribe . Chicken followed the Warriors ' Path north to the Little Tennessee River , where he met the " Head Warrior " of Tanasi and the chiefs of Citico and Tallassee . 
 = = = Alexander Cuming , 1730 = = = 
 Sir Alexander Cuming ( c . 1690 – 1775 ) arrived in Charleston , South Carolina in December 1729 . Although he lacked official diplomatic credentials , Cuming managed to convince several <unk> that he was an agent of King George II of Great Britain on a mission to gain the loyalty of the Cherokee . Cuming set out for the Overhill town of Tanasi in March 1730 , his stated goal being to gain the fabled " Crown of <unk> . " 
 Cuming moved quickly along the Trading Path , interacting briefly with Lower and Middle chiefs . In just under a month , Cuming had crossed the Unicoi Mountains into the Overhill country , a dangerous place at the time due to the Cherokees ' ongoing war with the Creeks . 
 Years later colonial trader <unk> Grant , who lived in Great Tellico and briefly accompanied Cuming during his tour , described the latter 's techniques . In each town , Cuming arranged a meeting with local Cherokee leaders . He arrived fully armed at the meeting at the town council house , in defiance of custom . There he made a prepared speech saying that he was a private citizen wishing only to see their country , and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him , he would take them . He asked them to join his party in a toast to the health of King George II , and to kneel in allegiance . He told his guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused . 
 During his stay in Great Tellico , Cuming was impressed by the display of its chief Moytoy . He described the encounter in his journal ( referring to his party in third person ) : 
 They arrived at great <unk> in the Afternoon , saw the petrifying Cave , a great many Enemies <unk> brought in and put upon Poles at the Warriors Doors , made a Friend of the great Moytoy , and Jacob the Conjurer . 
 Cuming learned that Moytoy was trying to gain control of the entire Cherokee people , who were highly decentralized , with power associated with regional settlements . Cuming agreed to help Moytoy if the chief would help him get the Crown of Tanasi . On March 30 , 1730 , Cuming followed the Warriors ' Path from Great Tellico to Tanasi , which he found " pleasantly situated " along the Little Tennessee . Cuming met with the Tanasi Warrior , whom he understood to be the de facto leader of the Overhill at the time . After gaining the Tanasi Warrior 's allegiance , Cuming returned to Great Tellico . He accompanied Moytoy back across the Unicoi Mountains to <unk> , and helped the chief be crowned as " Emperor of the Cherokee . " 
 Cuming returned to England on June 5 , 1730 , accompanied by several Cherokee and carrying a possum @-@ hair headdress , which he referred to as the " Crown of <unk> . " Although he had planned to present the party and crown to King George II , a delegation from Charleston arrived claiming Cuming had defrauded them . While Cuming 's schemes led to his own downfall , his visit to the Overhill towns helped to solidify an alliance between the Cherokee and the English .

 Around 1736 , Christian Priber , a German utopian idealist , reached Great Tellico . Although initially working as a French agent , Priber quickly abandoned his mission . He adopted Cherokee customs , learned the language , and quickly gained the tribe 's trust . 
 Priber attempted to organize Cherokee society in accordance with early 18th @-@ century European idealism . He promoted the idea that all things should be held in common , including wives and children . Claiming the English were fraudulent and greedy , he suggested moving the Cherokee capital to modern @-@ day Alabama , where it would be closer to the French colonial territory of La Louisiane . The English tried to arrest Priber in 1739 , but were prevented by the Cherokee . He was finally captured by the Creek people in 1743 and turned over to South Carolina authorities .

 At the outbreak of the Seven Years ' War ( or the French and Indian War as it was known in North America ) , the Cherokee aligned with the British . The Overhill towns agreed to provide military support , but asked that a fort be built to protect the area 's women and children while the warriors were away . In 1756 , the colonies dispatched Captain Raymond <unk> and engineer John <unk> to the area with several wagon loads of supplies for the construction of a fort along the Little Tennessee River . The fort , named after John Campbell , 4th Earl of Loudoun , stood at the junction of the Little Tennessee and the Tellico rivers . The Cherokee village of Tuskegee developed in its vicinity . 
 Shortly after the fort 's construction , relations between the English and the Cherokee soured . Several Cherokee returning home from battle were killed by settlers , and an increase in horse thefts created tension in Virginia . After a contingent of Cherokee chiefs were detained at Fort Prince George in late 1759 , the Cherokee , under Chief Standing Turkey , laid siege to Fort Loudoun . The fort 's garrison held out until August 1760 , when a lack of provisions forced them to surrender . 
 = = = Timberlake Expedition , 1761 = = = 
 The British colonies responded swiftly to the fall of Fort Loudoun . South Carolina sent Colonel James Grant against the Lower Towns , Virginia dispatched Colonel William Byrd to attack the Middle Towns in western North Carolina , and Colonel Adam Stephen detached from Byrd 's regiment and marched to Long Island on the Holston ( near modern @-@ day Kingsport , Tennessee ) with plans to attack the Overhill Towns . The Cherokee immediately sued for peace , which was granted . To help solidify the peace , Colonel Stephen dispatched Lieutenant Henry Timberlake and Sergeant Thomas Sumter to accompany a Cherokee delegation on a tour of the Overhill towns . 
 After a five @-@ day journey down the Holston , French Broad , and Little Tennessee rivers , Timberlake arrived in the Overhill town of Tomotley . There he was greeted by Ostenaco and witnessed a ceremonial return of a Cherokee war party . After smoking a peace pipe with Ostenaco , Timberlake proceeded southward to Chota , where he was met by some 400 Cherokee . Timberlake smoked a peace pipe with several tribal leaders , and recorded the layout and design of the town 's large council @-@ house . 
 The following day , Timberlake arrived in the town of Citico , where the residents greeted him with a long dance . After smoking a peace pipe with the town leader <unk> , Timberlake proceeded southward to Chilhowee , where he gained similar assurances of peace . He returned via the trail to Long Island on the Holston . Timberlake 's journals , published in the 1760s , contain detailed descriptions of Cherokee <unk> , residences , canoes , and other facets of everyday Cherokee life ; these were invaluable to historians . 
 = = = American Revolution = = = 
 At the close of the Seven Years ' War , Euro @-@ American settlers began trickling into east Tennessee from the eastern colonies . In 1772 , several pioneers negotiated a lease for Cherokee lands in northeast Tennessee and formed the Watauga Settlement . In spite of the agreement , tensions between the pioneers and the Cherokee rose steadily . By the outbreak of the American Revolution , the Cherokee were allied with the British against the rebellious American colonies , hoping to push the encroaching settlers out of their territory . 
 In 1776 , the Cherokee initiated a plan to drive the settlers out of the Washington District , North Carolina and invade Virginia . Virginia merchant , Isaac Thomas — later a co @-@ founder of <unk> — was warned of the invasion by Nancy Ward , a Cherokee Beloved Woman . Thomas passed on the warning to the settlers , who prepared their defenses . The first prong of the attack , led by Dragging Canoe , was defeated by colonists at Heaton 's Station . The second prong , led by Abraham of Chilhowee , was routed at Fort Watauga . In response to these attacks , several thousand militia led by William Christian invaded the Overhill towns and burned Tuskegee and Citico . The Cherokee made peace shortly thereafter , under the Treaty of De Witt 's Corner . Chiefs Dragging Canoe and Ostenaco refused to sign another treaty , and fled south with their followers to continue the armed struggle , in what became known as the Cherokee – American wars . 
 In 1780 , while the North Carolina militia from the Washington District , often referred to as the " <unk> militia " , were away at the Battle of Kings Mountain , the Cherokee launched sporadic raids against the settlers here . Upon returning , Colonel John Sevier , who had gained fame as a co @-@ commander at Kings Mountain , was dispatched , along with several thousand militia , to the south on a punitive expedition to the Overhill towns . After defeating the Cherokee in a fierce battle at Boyd 's Creek ( in modern @-@ day Sevier County ) , Sevier proceeded southward . He destroyed most of the remaining , lightly defended villages , including the capital of Chota .

 After the Cherokee defeats at Heaton 's Station and Fort Watauga in 1776 , most Cherokee chiefs , including Attakullakulla and Oconastota , signed the Treaty of De Witt 's Corner . Dragging Canoe and Ostenaco refused to recognize this treaty , claiming the settlers were unlikely to abide by the treaty 's terms . Along with several renegade tribesmen from across the Cherokee tribes , they moved south to Chickamauga Creek , in the vicinity of what is now Chattanooga , and set up a series of villages . 
 Settlers called them the " Chickamauga Cherokee " after their location and to distinguish them from the greater Cherokee tribe . The Chickamauga ( or " Lower Cherokee " as they were also sometimes called ) proceeded to carry on an unconventional war against the encroaching Euro @-@ American settlers , ambushing small patrols and attacking small settlements . After Oconastota 's death in the early 1780s , Chief Old Tassel was recognized as the leader of the Overhill Cherokee . He sought more distance from the Chickamauga . After an expedition by Sevier destroyed the Chickamauga towns in 1782 , Dragging Canoe moved the <unk> southwest to modern @-@ day Marion County , Tennessee , where he continued his struggle . 
 The end of the Revolutionary War released more energy for postwar settlement from the eastern states , and the Cherokee had to contend with new migrants in their territories . In 1788 , a renegade band of Cherokees massacred much of the family of John Kirk on Nine Mile Creek ( in modern Blount County , Tennessee ) , enraging the already uneasy settlers . Sevier rallied the militia at Hunter 's Station ( near <unk> ) and marched across Chilhowee Mountain to the Little Tennessee River . After capturing and burning Tallassee , Sevier entered Chilhowee and placed Abraham of Chilhowee and Old Tassel under arrest , while negotiating a truce . One of Kirk 's surviving sons got to the chiefs and tomahawked both of them to death . The killing of chiefs under a flag of truce was considered a grave insult by the Cherokee , and this event revived the dwindling power of the <unk> for warfare . 
 After the massacre at Chilhowee , John Watts ( Old Tassel 's son ) and <unk> ( Old Tassel 's brother ) aligned with Dragging Canoe ; together they carried on a protracted series of attacks against the settlers . Sevier again marched south , capturing and burning several villages before being forced to turn back . Although Dragging Canoe died in 1792 , John Watt and <unk> continued to make sporadic attacks against Euro @-@ American settlements . Such raids gradually shifted and were conducted against settlements in the Cumberland region . 
 = = = Tellico Agency = = = 
 After the assassination of Old Tassel in 1788 , Chief Hanging Maw was recognized as the leader of the Overhill towns . With violence spiraling out of control , Hanging Maw petitioned the territorial governor , William Blount , for a fort to protect the peaceful Overhill villages from vengeful settlers . In 1794 , Hanging Maw donated land at the junction of Nine Mile Creek and the Little Tennessee River to the U.S. government for the construction of the Tellico Blockhouse . 
 Along with a small garrison of federal soldiers , the Tellico Blockhouse was the headquarters of the Tellico Agent , William <unk> , he official liaison between the U.S. and the Cherokee . On November 8 , 1794 , Blount met Hanging Maw ( representing the Overhill Cherokee ) and John Watt ( representing the Lower Cherokee ) to sign a treaty ending the Cherokee – American wars . Over the next ten years , the US made several other treaties with the Cherokee , persuading Cherokee leaders to cede large portions of land in East and Middle Tennessee , including the Overhill towns along the Little Tennessee , in an attempt to gain peace . With the cession of Overhill lands , the Cherokee Nation 's center of power shifted south to New Echota in Georgia . Settlers migrating throughout the Southeast kept up pressure to gain Cherokee lands . 
 = = Overhill sites today = = 
 In 1967 , the Tennessee Valley Authority began construction on Tellico Dam just above the mouth of the Little Tennessee . The impoundment created Tellico Lake and effectively flooded all of the original known Overhill sites along the Little Tennessee River . Before the flooding , the University of Tennessee conducted extensive archaeological excavations , identifying Chota 's townhouse and the grave of Oconastota . The site of Chota 's townhouse was covered with fill , raising it above water levels . A monument with eight pillars — one for the Cherokee Nation and each of its seven clans — was placed at the site along with the reinterred grave of Oconastota . Nearby , a small monument was erected marking the site of Tanasi , and recalling it as the root of the state 's name . Both sites are managed by the Eastern Band of the Cherokee . 
 Further upstream , Chilhowee Dam was named after the now @-@ submerged site of Chilhowee . Tennessee Reservoir Development Agency ( <unk> ) boat ramps have been named after the submerged former sites of Toqua and Tallassee . Abrams Creek , which traverses Cades Cove and empties into the Little Tennessee , is named after chief Abraham of Chilhowee . 
 In the 20th century , Fort Loudon was reconstructed by state teams , as well as a replica of a 17th @-@ century village dwelling of Tuskegee ; these are located within the Fort Loudoun State Park . The state park also manages the Tellico Blockhouse site , the foundations of which have been identified and marked . The Sequoyah Birthplace Museum , near Fort Loudoun in Vonore , is dedicated to the creator of the Cherokee alphabet . The Unicoi Trail , a cross @-@ country hiking trail , now connects the Sequoyah Museum with Murphy , North Carolina , roughly following the ancient Trading Path . The Frank H. McClung Museum at the University of Tennessee contains hundreds of Cherokee artifacts obtained from various excavations which the university has conducted in the Tennessee Valley over the past century .

 = Least weasel = 
 The least weasel ( Mustela nivalis ) , or simply weasel in the UK , is the smallest member of the genus Mustela and of the family Mustelidae ( as well as the smallest of the Carnivora ) , native to Eurasia , North America and North Africa , though it has been introduced to New Zealand , Australia , Malta , Crete , Bermuda , Madeira Island , the Azores , the Canary Islands , Sao Tome , the Falkland Islands , Argentina and Chile . It is classed as being of least concern by the IUCN , due to its wide distribution and presumed large population . 
 Least weasels from various parts of its range vary greatly in size . The body is slender and elongated and the legs and tail are relatively short . The colour varies geographically , as does the pelage type and length of tail . The dorsal surface , flanks , limbs and tail of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white . The line delineating the boundary between the two colours is usually straight . At high altitudes and in the northern part of its range , the coat becomes pure white in winter . Eighteen subspecies are recognised . 
 Small rodents form the largest part of the least weasel 's diet , but it also kills and eats rabbits and other mammals , and occasionally birds , birds ' eggs , fish and frogs . Males mark their territories with olfactory signals and have exclusive home ranges which may intersect with or include several female ranges . Least weasels use pre @-@ existing holes to sleep , store food and raise their young . Breeding takes place in the spring and summer , and there is a single litter of about six kits which are reared exclusively by the female . Due to its small size , fierce nature and cunning behaviour , the least weasel plays an important part in the mythology and legend of various cultures . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The least weasel was given its scientific name Mustela nivalis by Carl Linnaeus in his 12th edition of Systema Naturae in 1766 . The type locality was <unk> in Sweden . As an animal with a very wide distribution , the morphology of the least weasel varies geographically . The species was reviewed by Reichstein in 1957 and again by van <unk> de Jong in 1992 and Reig in 1997 . Youngman ( 1982 ) placed it in the subgenus Mustela while <unk> ( 1999 ) considered it should be included in the subgenus Gale . Based on skull characteristics , Reig ( 1997 ) proposed that the taxon should be split into four species , M. <unk> , M. rixosa , M. vulgaris and M. eskimo . <unk> and <unk> ( 2000 ) disagreed , recognising only M. <unk> as a separate species . 
 Within the genus Mustela , the least weasel is a relatively unspecialised form , as evidenced by its pedomorphic skull , which occurs even in large subspecies . Its direct ancestor was Mustela <unk> , which lived in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene and Villafranchian . M. <unk> itself was probably preceded by M. <unk> of the Pliocene . The modern species probably arose during the Late Pleistocene . The least weasel is the product of a process begun 5 – 7 million years ago , when northern forests were replaced by open grassland , thus prompting an explosive evolution of small , burrowing rodents . The weasel 's ancestors were larger than the current form , and underwent a reduction in size to exploit the new food source . The least weasel <unk> during the Ice Age , as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow , as well as hunt in burrows . It probably crossed to North America through the Bering land bridge 200 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 The least weasel has a high geographic variation , a fact which has historically led to numerous disagreements among biologists studying its systematics . Least weasel subspecies are divided into 3 categories : 
 The pygmaea – rixosa group ( small weasels ) : Tiny weasels with short tails , pedomorphic skulls , and pelts that turn pure white in winter . They inhabit northern European Russia , Siberia , the Russian Far East , Finland , northern Scandinavian Peninsula , Mongolia , northeastern China , Japan and North America . 
 The <unk> group ( large weasels ) : Very large weasels with large skulls , relatively long tails and lighter coloured pelts . Locally , they either do not turn white or only partially change colour in winter . They inhabit Transcaucasia , from western Kazakhstan to <unk> and in the flat deserts of Middle Asia . They are also found in Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia . 
 The nivalis group ( average weasels ) : Medium @-@ sized weasels , with tails of moderate length , representing a transitional form between the former two groups . They inhabit the middle and southern regions of European Russia , Crimea , <unk> , western Kazakhstan , southern and middle Urals and montane parts of Middle Asia , save for <unk> Dag . 
 As of 2005 , 18 subspecies are recognised . 
 = = Description = = 
 The least weasel has a thin , greatly elongated and extremely flexible body with a small , yet elongated , blunt @-@ muzzled head which is no thicker than the neck . The eyes are large , bulging and dark coloured . The legs and tail are relatively short , the latter constituting less than half the body length . The feet are armed with sharp , dark @-@ coloured claws , and the soles are heavily haired . The skull , especially that of the small rixosa group , has an infantile appearance when compared with that of other members of the genus Mustela ( in particular , the stoat and <unk> ) . This is expressed in the relatively large size of the cranium and shortened facial region . The skull is , overall , similar to that of the stoat , but smaller , though the skulls of large male weasels tend to overlap in size with those of small female stoats . There are usually four pairs of nipples but these are only visible in females . The baculum is short , 16 to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) , with a thick , straight shaft . Fat is deposited along the spine , kidneys , gut <unk> and around the limbs . The least weasel has muscular anal glands under the tail , which measure 7 by 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 by 0 @.@ 2 in ) , and contain sulphurous volatiles , including <unk> and <unk> . The smell and chemical composition of these chemicals are distinct from those of the stoat . The least weasel moves by jumping , the distance between the tracks of the fore and hind limbs being 18 to 35 cm ( 7 to 14 in ) . 
 Dimensions vary geographically , to an extent rarely found among other mammals . Least weasels of the vulgaris group , for example , may outweigh the smaller races by almost four times . In some large subspecies , the male may be 1 @.@ 5 times longer than the female . Variations in tail length are also variable , constituting from 13 – 30 % of the length of the body . Average body length in males is 130 to 260 mm ( 5 to 10 in ) , while females average 114 to 204 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 to 8 @.@ 0 in ) . The tail measures 12 to 87 mm ( 0 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 4 in ) in males and 17 to 60 mm ( 0 @.@ 7 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) in females . Males weigh 36 to 250 g ( 1 @.@ 3 to 8 @.@ 8 oz ) , while females weigh 29 to 117 g ( 1 @.@ 0 to 4 @.@ 1 oz ) . 
 The winter fur is dense , but short and closely fitting . In northern subspecies , the fur is soft and silky , but coarse in southern forms . The summer fur is very short , sparser and rougher . The upper parts in the summer fur are dark , but vary geographically from dark @-@ tawny or dark @-@ chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy . The lower parts , including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs , are white . There is often a brown spot at the corner of the mouth . The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line . The tail is brown , and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never black . In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes , the least weasel changes colour in the winter , the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 = = = Reproduction and development = = = 
 The least weasel mates in April – July and there is a <unk> to 37 @-@ day gestation period . In the Northern Hemisphere , the average litter size consists of 6 kits and these reach sexual maturity in 3 to 4 months . Males may mate during their first year of life , though this is usually unsuccessful . They are fecund in February – October , though the early stages of spermatogenesis do occur throughout the winter months . <unk> in females lasts from September until February . 
 The female raises its kits without help from the male . They are 1 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 g ( 0 @.@ 05 to 0 @.@ 16 oz ) in weight at birth . Newborn kits are born pink , naked , blind and deaf , but gain a white coat of downy fur at the age of 4 days . At 10 days , the margin between the dark upper parts and light under parts becomes visible . The milk teeth erupt at 2 to 3 weeks of age , at which point the young start to eat solid food , though lactation can last 12 weeks . The eyes and ears open at 3 to 4 weeks of age , and by 8 weeks , killing behaviour is developed . The family breaks up after 9 to 12 weeks . There is a single litter each year and least weasels can live for 7 or 8 years . 
 = = = Territorial and social behaviours = = = 
 The least weasel has a typical mustelid territorial pattern , consisting of exclusive male ranges encompassing multiple female ranges . The population density of each territory depends greatly on food supply and reproductive success , thus the social structure and population density of any given territory is unstable and flexible . Like the stoat , the male least weasel extends its range during spring or during food shortages . Its scent marking behaviour is similar to that of the stoat ; it uses faeces , urine and anal and dermal gland secretions , the latter two of which are deposited by anal dragging and body rubbing . The least weasel does not dig its own den , but nests in the abandoned burrow of another species such as a mole or rat . The burrow entrance measures about 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) across and leads to the nest chamber located up to 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) below ground . The nest chamber ( which is used for sleeping , rearing kits and storing food ) measures 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter , and is lined with straw and the skins of the weasel 's prey . 
 The least weasel has four basic vocalisations ; a guttural hiss emitted when alarmed , which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked . When defensive , it emits a shrill wail or squeal . During encounters between males and females or between a mother and kits , the least weasel emits a high @-@ pitched trilling . The least weasel 's way of expressing aggression is similar to that of the stoat . Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters , while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The least weasel feeds predominantly on mouse @-@ like rodents , including mice , hamsters , gerbils and others . It usually does not attack adult hamsters and rats . Frogs , fish , small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten . It can deal with adult pikas and gerbils , but usually cannot overcome brown rats and <unk> . Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves , such as capercaillie , hazel hen and hares . In England , a favoured prey item is the field vole ( Microtus <unk> ) . These have fluctuations in population size , and in years of abundance may form up to 54 % of the weasel 's diet . In years of scarcity , birds form a greater proportion of the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed . 
 Despite its small size , the least weasel is a fierce hunter , capable of killing a rabbit five to ten times its own weight . Although they are commonly taken , the rabbits are usually young specimens , and become an important food source during the spring , when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful . Male least weasels take a higher proportion of rabbits than females , as well as an overall greater variety of prey . This is linked to the fact that being larger , and having vaster territorial ranges than females , males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey . 
 The least weasel forages undercover , to avoid being seen by foxes and birds of prey . It is adapted for pursuing its prey down tunnels , though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open . The least weasel kills small prey , such as voles , with a bite to the occipital region of the skull or the neck , dislocating the cervical vertebrae . Large prey typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock . When food is abundant , only a small portion of the prey is eaten , usually the brain . The average daily food intake is 35 g ( 1 oz ) , which is equivalent to 30 – 35 % of the animal 's body weight . 
 = = = Predators and competitors = = = 
 The least weasel is small enough to be preyed upon by a range of other predators . Least weasel remains have been found in the excrement of red foxes , sables , steppe and forest polecat , stoats , eagle owls and buzzards . The owls most efficient at capturing least weasels are barn , barred , and great horned owls . Other birds of prey threatening to the least weasel include broad @-@ winged and rough @-@ legged buzzards . Some snake species may prey on the least weasel , including the black rat snake and copperhead . Aside from its smaller size , the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail . 
 In areas where the least weasel is sympatric with the stoat , the two species compete with each other for rodent prey . The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas , feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes . It actively avoids encounters with stoats , though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats , perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes . 
 = = = Diseases and parasites = = = 
 Ectoparasites known to infest weasels include the louse Trichodectes <unk> and the mites Demodex and <unk> <unk> . The species may catch fleas from the nests and burrows of its prey . Flea species known to infest weasels include <unk> <unk> and <unk> m. minor , which they get from moles , P. s. soricis , which they get from shrews , <unk> fasciatus , which they get from rodents and Dasypsyllus gallinulae which they get from birds . 
 <unk> known to infest weasels include the trematode Alaria , the nematodes Capillaria , <unk> and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia . Least weasels are commonly infected with the nematode <unk> <unk> , adults of which are found in the nasal sinuses and can damage the skull . There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested animals . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The least weasel has a circumboreal , Holarctic distribution , encompassing much of Europe and North Africa , Asia and parts of northern North America , where it occurs mainly in places where the stoat is not found , though it has been introduced in New Zealand , Malta , Crete , the <unk> Islands and also Sao Tome off west Africa . It is found throughout Europe and on many islands , including the Azores , Britain ( but not Ireland ) , and all major Mediterranean islands . It also occurs on Honshu and Hokkaido islands in Japan and on <unk> , <unk> , and Sakhalin Islands in Russia . 
 The least weasel occupies a similar type of habitat as the stoat but it less often frequents wet places . It can be found in fields , open woodland , bushy or rocky areas , parks and gardens , and at altitudes of up to about 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The least weasel has a very wide circumboreal range and a large total population and is therefore listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of " least concern " . Its chosen habitat is in areas of coarse vegetation and in some regions its numbers may be decreasing because of changes in agricultural practices , but altogether its population trend is thought to be steady . It is relatively common in Eurasia but less abundant in North America and is thought to be rare in the southeastern United States . It is subject to considerable variations in numbers in areas where its main rodent prey is liable to large population fluctuations . In years of rodent population booms , the least weasel numbers may rise by up to ten @-@ fold , only to slump again as prey becomes scarce again in the following years . 
 = = In folklore and mythology = = 
 The Ancient Macedonians believed that to see a least weasel was a good omen . In some districts of Macedon , women who suffered from headaches after having washed their heads in water drawn overnight would assume that a weasel had previously used the water as a mirror , but they would refrain from mentioning the animal 's name for fear that it would destroy their clothes . Similarly , a popular superstition in southern Greece had it that the least weasel had previously been a bride , who was transformed into a bitter animal which would destroy the wedding dresses of other brides out of jealousy . According to Pliny the Elder , the least weasel is the only animal capable of killing the basilisk ; 
 To this dreadful monster the <unk> of the weasel is fatal , a thing that has been tried with success , for kings have often desired to see its body when killed ; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote . The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk , which is easily known from the soil around it being infected . The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour , but dies itself in this struggle of nature against its own self . 
 The Chippewa believed that the least weasel could kill the dreaded wendigo giant by rushing up its anus . In Inuit mythology , the least weasel is credited with both great wisdom and courage , and whenever a mythical Inuit hero wished to accomplish a valorous task , he would generally change himself into a least weasel . According to Matthew Hopkins , a witch hunter general during the English Civil War , least weasels were the familiars of witches . 
 = Aseroe coccinea = 
 Aseroe coccinea is a species of stinkhorn fungus in the genus Aseroe . First reported in Japan in 1989 , it was not formally validated as a species until 2007 , the delay related to a publication error . The receptacle , or fruit body , begins as a partially buried whitish egg @-@ shaped structure , which bursts open as a hollow white stipe with reddish arms , then erupts and grows to a height of up to 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) . It matures into a star @-@ shaped structure with seven to nine thin reddish tubular " arms " up to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) long radiating from the central area . The top of the receptacle is covered with dark olive @-@ brown spore @-@ slime , or gleba . A. coccinea can be distinguished from the more common species A. rubra by differences in the color of the receptacle , and in the structure of the arms . The edibility of the fungus has not been reported . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The fungus was first described provisionally ( denoted by ad interim ) as Aseroe coccinea by the Japanese mycologists Yoshimi and Tsuguo Hongo in a 1989 publication with a Japanese description , based on a specimen collected on September 29 , 1985 in Utsunomiya , Tochigi Prefecture , Japan . The name , however , was not published validly ( nomen <unk> ) , according to Article 36 @.@ 1 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature , which requires that " in order to be validly published , a name of a new taxon ( algal and all fossil taxa excepted ) must ... be accompanied by a Latin description or diagnosis or by a reference to a previously and effectively published Latin description or diagnosis " . Taiga <unk> reexamined the type specimen and validated the species in a 2007 Mycoscience publication . The holotype specimen is kept at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo . 
 The specific epithet coccinea is derived from the Latin word coccineus , and means " bright red " . The mushroom 's Japanese name is Aka @-@ <unk> @-@ take ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 Like all Phallaceae species , A. coccinea begins its development in the form of a roughly spherical whitish " egg " that is 10 – 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 59 in ) in diameter , lying on or partially submerged in the substrate . On the base of the egg is a white strand of mycelium . The exoperidium ( the outer tissue layer ) is white to cream @-@ colored with a fibrous surface . The inner layer is membranous , with a hyaline ( translucent ) endoperidium ( inner tissue layer ) . The slimy spore @-@ bearing mass , the gleba , is olive @-@ brown to greenish @-@ black , with a slightly fetid odor . When the mushroom is mature , it covers the upper surface of a disc on the top of the receptacle . The receptacle has a cylindrical stipe , 10 – 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 59 in ) tall , 7 – 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 – 0 @.@ 59 in ) in diameter at the top , somewhat fusiform ( tapered at both ends ) or sometimes just tapered towards the base . The stipe is pale pink near the top , white to cream at the base , spongy in texture , and hollow . The top of the receptacle is flattened to form a disc that bears 7 – 9 , narrow , tapering " arms " . The arms consist of a single bright red tube @-@ like chamber , that is 4 – 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 39 in ) long and 0 @.@ 7 – 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 0 – 0 @.@ 1 in ) thick . 
 The thick @-@ walled spores are ellipsoid to cylindrical , and measure 4 – 5 by 2 – 2 @.@ 5 μm . They are hyaline ( translucent ) , have a smooth surface , and are sometimes truncated at the base . The peridium of the " egg " is divided into two distinct layers of tissue . The outer is up to 250 – 400 μm thick , and made of filamentous , interwoven hyphae measuring 2 @.@ 5 – 5 μm in diameter . These hyphae are thick @-@ walled , septate , and hyaline . Also present in this outer layer are thick @-@ walled pseudoparenchymatous cells ( angular , randomly arranged , and tightly packed ) that are 7 – 50 μm thick , spherical or nearly so , and yellowish @-@ brown to pale brown . The inner tissue layer of the peridium is 100 – 250 μm thick and made of elongated filamentous hyphae that are 2 – 5 μm in diameter . These thick @-@ walled hyphae are arranged in a roughly parallel fashion , septate , and hyaline . The receptacle consists of thick @-@ walled , roughly spherical pseudoparenchymatous cells 5 – 15 @.@ 5 μm thick , that contain intracellular pigment .

 A. coccinea closely resembles A. arachnoidea , but may be distinguished from the latter by its bright red arms , and its larger spores ( 4 – 5 by 2 @.@ 5 – 3 μm in A. coccinea compared with 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 by 1 @.@ 5 μm in A. arachnoidea ) . A. arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa . A. rubra is a relatively common pantropical species , and differs from A. coccinea in its reddish receptacle ( compared with pink to cream @-@ colored in A. coccinea ) and bifurcating arms that are typically <unk> .

 Although <unk> did not explicitly define the mode of nutrition for A. coccinea , most Phallaceae species are suspected to be saprobic — decomposers of wood and plant organic matter . The fruit bodies of A. coccinea , known only from temperate regions of Japan ( Tochigi Prefecture ) , grow solitarily or in groups on rice husks , straw , or dung . They are found from summer to autumn . 
 = Spit & Eggs = 
 " Spit & Eggs " is the ninth episode of the third season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars , and the fifty @-@ third episode overall . Written and directed by series creator Rob Thomas , the episode premiered on November 28 , 2006 , on The CW . The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars ( Kristen Bell ) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective . 
 In this episode , when the Greek system at Hearst College is suddenly reinstated , Veronica enlists the help of her friends in patrolling a party to look for date rape drugs . Eventually , she learns the identity of the Hearst serial rapist and puts herself in danger to catch him . In addition , Dean O 'Dell ( Ed Begley , Jr . ) acts increasingly erratically before he mysteriously appears dead in his office with a gunshot wound to the head . Meanwhile , Veronica and Logan ( Jason Dohring ) both deal with the emotional aftereffects of O 'Dell 's death . 
 " Spit & Eggs " was the second episode to be both written and directed by Thomas , who included several camera and prop changes that were not originally in the script .

 The episode was written and directed by series creator Rob Thomas , marking his seventh writing credit and second and final directing credit for the series ( after " Donut Run " ) . Starting with this episode , Thomas and the crew 's plan for the season changed — while they had initially scheduled three major story arcs for the season , this number was now bumped down to two , while the last few episodes would be standalone . The creative team decided that their choices for major mysteries had not worked since season one ; Thomas elaborated , " One feeling is that the big mysteries keep away the casual TV viewers , and the other is the thing that has been the least successful since season one [ … ] the big mysteries . " Thomas also recalled that his major design for the first season that was because Lilly had been murdered , everyone had a stake in the solving of the mystery and that the crew were finding it impossible to keep the same amount of emotional involvement since the first season ; Thomas thought that the new format would be a way of trying to return to a more emotionally driven format . 
 In addition , Thomas turned what was scheduled to be the third major mystery into a two @-@ episode storyline , with the last five episodes of the season being stand @-@ alone . He stated , " It seems like a good time to do it — a good fun test balloon . " Nevertheless , he confirmed that there would be ongoing stories in Veronica 's personal life . A week prior to the episode 's airing , Michael Ausiello received an advance screening of the episode , revealing several details that the network allowed him to divulge .

 On the Season Three DVD Commentary , Thomas remarks on his experience directing " Spit & Eggs " and shares his thoughts on several scenes of the episode . He called the scene in which Mercer attacks Veronica the one he was " happiest with for any number of reasons . " The scene was shot with 27 camera angles , the most for any Veronica Mars episode , and it took 10 or 11 hours to film . The scene also features a number of fake unicorns in various forms ; unicorns were an in @-@ joke among the cast and crew after one season 2 script involved Veronica calling a store " <unk> . " While directing the scene , Thomas wanted to find an unusual weapon to be used , and " a unicorn struck [ him ] as funny . " The scene in which Moe removes the unicorn horn from Mercer 's leg was initially intended to be Moe bandaging Mercer , but Thomas thought that the final product would be more " interesting " while preparing for the scene . 
 Thomas included Piz dancing humorously at the fraternity party because he " could watch it over and over " , and there were roughly fifteen minutes of footage of him dancing . The band that plays at the party , the Diamond Smugglers , is from Thomas 's hometown of Austin , Texas , and they played at Thomas 's wedding and 40th birthday party . The scene near the end with Logan smashing a police car to get intentionally thrown in prison confused the crew , who doubted its artistic and technical plausibility . However , Thomas was pleased with the final output , and producer Dan Etheridge called it " one of the most compact and interesting visual storytelling pieces in the episode . " The episode went over budget . In this episode , Mac wears a shirt that says " Ask Me About My STD " , something which several critics commended for its comedic value . Thomas came up with the idea for the shirt and hired one of the other guest actors in the scene for another episode , commenting " It 's funny , I actually made that up , and I now have one , too . " In addition , because Thomas was so pleased with the acting in the scene from the boy who hands Mac a whiskey , he hired the actor for a role in a subsequent episode as an important witness to Dean O 'Dell 's death .

 " Spit & Eggs " features the return of series regular Tina Majorino , who plays Mac on the show , after an absence of six episodes . Majorino had not appeared since the second episode of the season , " My Big Fat Greek Rush Week " . At the time , Majorino was also a series regular on the HBO series Big Love , so her schedule was difficult to determine . She stated : " It 's a little tough , but Big Love and Veronica Mars have both been really great about juggling the schedule so I could do both shows . " On October 24 , 2006 , the cast and crew were filming the episode . Because of this other commitment , Majorino appeared in eleven episodes of the season instead of the scheduled twelve . On that same date , Majorino revealed that she would be returning in " Spit & Eggs " , that it resolved the Hearst rapist storyline , and that it would introduce the show 's next major story arc . On her role in the episode and in the season as a whole in light of the events in the second season finale , Majorino commented , " It 's not like all of the sudden she 's over everything that happened . " 
 " Spit & Eggs " features the reveal that Mercer Hayes , played by Ryan Devlin , is the Hearst serial rapist . Devlin was unaware that he would be the perpetrator until reading the episode 's script ; he stated , " To tell you the truth , I 'm not even sure the writers knew where my story was headed . But I was happy to do it – it 's way more fun being bad than good ! " The episode also marks the final appearance by Ed Begley , Jr . , after his character is killed . The mystery surrounding his murder would be the next major story arc .

 In its original broadcast , the episode received 3 @.@ 44 million viewers , marking a series high and ranking 88th of 97 in the weekly rankings . Thomas was very pleased by the ratings . 
 The episode received critical acclaim , with many critics praising the return of Mac and the increased role of peripheral characters , the resolution to the rape mystery , and the setup of the next major story arc . Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10 , indicating that it was " great " . He wrote that " Spit & Eggs " was a welcome episode for longtime fans , as it involved several plots converging in a way that he found satisfactory . He praised the final few scenes , writing that the episode transitions well into the next mystery of Dean O 'Dell 's death by developing it slowly over the course of the season 's prior episodes , but he was more mixed towards the reveal of Mercer as the rapist , commenting " the ultimate revelation can 't help but be a little underwhelming , since not enough time has been spent on any of the credible suspects to really have a good handle on them or be invested in them one way or another . " Rowan Kaiser , writing for The A.V. Club , who was quite critical of the rape storyline in earlier episodes , said that the conclusion made the storyline slightly better overall . He praised the double reveal of Mercer and Moe as accomplices , stating , " That twist overall is effective because it plays on everyone 's expectations . The characters all believe there is a single culprit here . [ … ] It makes the revelations more plausible , while also making the need for those revelations less intense ( the two are related ) . " 
 Television Without Pity gave the episode a " B + " . Alan Sepinwall , on his blog What 's Alan Watching ? , was also relatively positive towards the episode . While calling the reveal of the rapist " out of left field " , he noted that there was some material in " My Big Fat Greek Rush Week " that pointed to this conclusion . In addition , he praised Parker rescuing Veronica and the start of the Dean O 'Dell mystery , writing " Rob quite cleverly threw the start of the new mystery into the tail end of the first one . " However , there were several plot issues that he found as well as that the nine @-@ episode storyline didn 't fully do the reveal justice , opining that Thomas and the crew had to rush to give the audience important information in this format . Cortney Martin of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the major roles played by Wallace , Mac , Weevil , Piz , and Parker in the episode , writing " the show belongs to Veronica 's sidekicks this week . " Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune gave praise as well . While being lukewarm regarding the season as a whole , she thought that " Spit & Eggs " was " appropriately suspenseful . " In addition , she enjoyed that Veronica was less sarcastic and contemptuous in the episode , in contrast to previous episodes of the season . 
 Film.com praised the episode as well , lauding the in medias res opening scene , suspenseful tone , and Mac 's reappearance , and the setup for the next mystery arc , mong other aspects of the episode . Conversely , Keith McDuffee , writing for AOL TV , was more critical , calling it " way too fast for a partial season @-@ ender " , arguing that there were too many unanswered questions left after the episode 's conclusion . 
 = United Nations = 
 The United Nations ( UN ) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co @-@ operation . A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations , the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict . At its founding , the UN had 51 member states ; there are now 193 . The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan , New York City , and experiences extraterritoriality . Further main offices are situated in Geneva , Nairobi , and Vienna . The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states . Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security , promoting human rights , fostering social and economic development , protecting the environment , and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine , natural disaster , and armed conflict . 
 The United Nations Charter was drafted at a conference in April – June 1945 ; this charter took effect 24 October 1945 , and the UN began operation . The UN 's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies . The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo , as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947 . The organization 's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s , and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping . After the end of the Cold War , the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success . 
 The UN has six principal organs : the General Assembly ( the main deliberative assembly ) ; the Security Council ( for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security ) ; the Economic and Social Council ( ECOSOC ) ( for promoting international economic and social co @-@ operation and development ) ; the Secretariat ( for providing studies , information , and facilities needed by the UN ) ; the International Court of Justice ( the primary judicial organ ) ; and the United Nations Trusteeship Council ( inactive since 1994 ) . UN System agencies include the World Bank Group , the World Health Organization , the World Food Programme , UNESCO , and UNICEF . The UN 's most prominent officer is the Secretary @-@ General , an office held by South Korean Ban Ki @-@ moon since 2007 . Non @-@ governmental organizations may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN 's work . 
 The organization won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001 , and a number of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize . Other evaluations of the UN 's effectiveness have been mixed . Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development , while others have called the organization ineffective , corrupt , or biased . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 In the century prior to the UN 's creation , several international treaty organizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between nations , such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 . Following the catastrophic loss of life in the First World War , the Paris Peace Conference established the League of Nations to maintain harmony between countries . This organization resolved some territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such as postal mail , aviation , and opium control , some of which would later be absorbed into the UN . However , the League lacked representation for colonial peoples ( then half the world 's population ) and significant participation from several major powers , including the US , USSR , Germany , and Japan ; it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 , the Second Italo @-@ Ethiopian War in 1935 , the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 , and German expansions under Adolf Hitler that culminated in the Second World War . 
 = = = 1942 " Declaration of United Nations " by the Allies of World War II = = = 
 The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the US State Department in 1939 . The text of the " Declaration by United Nations " was drafted by President Franklin Roosevelt , British Prime Minister Winston Churchill , and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins , while meeting at the White House , 29 December 1941 . It incorporated Soviet suggestions , but left no role for France . " Four Policemen " was coined to refer four major Allied countries , United States , United Kingdom , Soviet Union , and China , which was emerged in Declaration by United Nations . Roosevelt first coined the term United Nations to describe the Allied countries . " On New Year 's Day 1942 , President Roosevelt , Prime Minister Churchill , Maxim Litvinov , of the USSR , and T. V. Soong , of China , signed a short document which later came to be known as the United Nations Declaration and the next day the representatives of twenty @-@ two other nations added their signatures . " The term United Nations was first officially used when 26 governments signed this Declaration . One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for religious freedom , which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted . By 1 March 1945 , 21 additional states had signed .

 The Governments signatory hereto , 
 Having subscribed to a common program of purposes and principles embodied in the Joint Declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of Great Britain dated August 14 , 1941 , known as the Atlantic Charter , 
 Being convinced that complete victory over their enemies is essential to defend life , liberty , independence and religious freedom , and to preserve human rights and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands , and that they are now engaged in a common struggle against savage and brutal forces seeking to subjugate the world ,

 ( 1 ) Each Government pledges itself to employ its full resources , military or economic , against those members of the Tripartite Pact and its adherents with which such government is at war . 
 ( 2 ) Each Government pledges itself to cooperate with the Governments signatory hereto and not to make a separate armistice or peace with the enemies . 
 The foregoing declaration may be adhered to by other nations which are , or which may be , rendering material assistance and contributions in the struggle for victory over Hitlerism . 
 During the war , the United Nations became the official term for the Allies . To join countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the Axis . 
 = = = Founding the UN 1945 = = = 
 The United Nations was formulated and negotiated among the delegations from the Soviet Union , the UK , the US and China at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944 . After months of planning , the UN Conference on International Organization opened in San Francisco , 25 April 1945 , attended by 50 governments and a number of non @-@ governmental organizations involved in drafting the United Nations Charter . " The heads of the delegations of the sponsoring countries took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings : Anthony Eden , of Britain , Edward Stettinius , of the United States , T. V. Soong , of China , and Vyacheslav Molotov , of the Soviet Union . At the later meetings , Lord Halifax deputized for Mr. Eden , Wellington Koo for T. V. Soong , and Mr Gromyko for Mr. Molotov . " The UN officially came into existence 24 October 1945 , upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the Security Council — France , the Republic of China , the Soviet Union , the UK and the US — and by a majority of the other 46 signatories . 
 The first meetings of the General Assembly , with 51 nations represented , and the Security Council took place in London beginning 6 January 1946 . The General Assembly selected New York City as the site for the headquarters of the United Nations , and the facility was completed in 1952 . Its site — like UN headquarters buildings in Geneva , Vienna , and Nairobi — is designated as international territory . The Norwegian Foreign Minister , Trygve Lie , was elected as the first UN Secretary @-@ General . 
 = = = Cold War era = = = 
 Though the UN 's primary mandate was peacekeeping , the division between the US and USSR often paralysed the organization , generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War . ( A notable exception was a Security Council resolution in 1950 authorizing a US @-@ led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South Korea , passed in the absence of the USSR . ) In 1947 , the General Assembly approved a resolution to partition Palestine , approving the creation of the state of Israel . Two years later , Ralph Bunche , a UN official , negotiated an armistice to the resulting conflict . In 1956 , the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis ; however , the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR 's simultaneous invasion of Hungary following that country 's revolution . 
 In 1960 , the UN deployed United Nations Operation in the Congo ( <unk> ) , the largest military force of its early decades , to bring order to the breakaway State of Katanga , restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo by 1964 . While travelling to meet with rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the conflict , Dag Hammarskjöld , often named as one of the UN 's most effective Secretaries @-@ General , died in a plane crash ; months later he was posthumously awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . In 1964 , Hammarskjöld 's successor , U Thant , deployed the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus , which would become one of the UN 's longest @-@ running peacekeeping missions . 
 With the spread of decolonization in the 1960s , the organization 's membership saw an influx of newly independent nations . In 1960 alone , 17 new states joined the UN , 16 of them from Africa . On 25 October 1971 , with opposition from the United States , but with the support of many Third World nations , the mainland , communist People 's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council in place of the Republic of China that occupied Taiwan ; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning US influence in the organization . Third World nations organized into the Group of 77 coalition under the leadership of Algeria , which briefly became a dominant power at the UN . In 1975 , a bloc comprising the USSR and Third World nations passed a resolution , over strenuous US and Israeli opposition , declaring Zionism to be racism ; the resolution was repealed in 1991 , shortly after the end of the Cold War . 
 With an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East , Vietnam , and Kashmir , the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange . By the 1970s , the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget . 
 = = = Post @-@ Cold War = = = 
 After the Cold War , the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties , taking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four decades . Between 1988 and 2000 , the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more than doubled , and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold . The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War , launched a successful peacekeeping mission in Namibia , and oversaw democratic elections in post @-@ apartheid South Africa and post @-@ Khmer Rouge Cambodia . In 1991 , the UN authorized a US @-@ led coalition that repulsed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait . Brian Urquhart , Under @-@ Secretary @-@ General from 1971 to 1985 , later described the hopes raised by these successes as a " false renaissance " for the organization , given the more troubled missions that followed . 
 Though the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one nation against another , in the early 1990s the UN faced a number of simultaneous , serious crises within nations such as Somalia , Haiti , Mozambique , and the former Yugoslavia . The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as a failure after the US withdrawal following casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu , and the UN mission to Bosnia faced " worldwide ridicule " for its indecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing . In 1994 , the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan Genocide amid indecision in the Security Council . 
 Beginning in the last decades of the Cold War , American and European critics of the UN condemned the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption . In 1984 , the US President , Ronald Reagan , withdrew his nation 's funding from UNESCO ( the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , founded 1946 ) over allegations of mismanagement , followed by Britain and Singapore . Boutros Boutros @-@ Ghali , Secretary @-@ General from 1992 to 1996 , initiated a reform of the Secretariat , reducing the size of the organization somewhat . His successor , Kofi Annan ( 1997 – 2006 ) , initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues . 
 In the late 1990s and 2000s , international interventions authorized by the UN took a wider variety of forms . The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991 – 2002 was supplemented by British Royal Marines , and the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by <unk> 2003 , the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization , prompting a new round of questioning of the organization 's effectiveness . Under the current Secretary @-@ General , Ban Ki @-@ moon , the UN has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical weapons inspectors to the Syrian Civil War . In 2013 , an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered " systemic failure " . One hundred and one UN personnel died in the 2010 Haiti earthquake , the worst loss of life in the organization 's history . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The United Nations ' system is based on five principal organs : the General Assembly , the Security Council , the Economic and Social Council ( ECOSOC ) , the Secretariat , and the International Court of Justice . A sixth principal organ , the Trusteeship Council , suspended operations in 1994 , upon the independence of Palau , the last remaining UN trustee territory . 
 Four of the five principal organs are located at the main UN Headquarters in New York City . The International Court of Justice is located in The Hague , while other major agencies are based in the UN offices at Geneva , Vienna , and Nairobi . Other UN institutions are located throughout the world . The six official languages of the United Nations , used in intergovernmental meetings and documents , are Arabic , Chinese , English , French , Russian , and Spanish . On the basis of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations , the UN and its agencies are immune from the laws of the countries where they operate , safeguarding the UN 's impartiality with regard to the host and member countries . 
 Below the six organs sit , in the words of the author Linda <unk> , " an amazing collection of entities and organizations , some of which are actually older than the UN itself and operate with almost complete independence from it " . These include specialized agencies , research and training institutions , programmes and funds , and other UN entities . 
 The United Nations obey the <unk> principle , which is binding on any organization that belongs to the united nations system . This principle calls for salaries that will draw and keep citizens of countries where salaries are highest , and also calls for equal pay for work of equal value independent of the employee 's nationality . Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations . 
 = = = General Assembly = = = 
 The General Assembly is the main deliberative assembly of the United Nations . Composed of all United Nations member states , the assembly meets in regular yearly sessions , but emergency sessions can also be called . The assembly is led by a president , elected from among the member states on a rotating regional basis , and 21 vice @-@ presidents . The first session convened 10 January 1946 in the Methodist Central Hall Westminster in London and included representatives of 51 nations . 
 When the General Assembly votes on important questions , a two @-@ thirds majority of those present and voting is required . Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security ; election of members to organs ; admission , suspension , and expulsion of members ; and budgetary matters . All other questions are decided by a majority vote . Each member country has one vote . Apart from approval of budgetary matters , resolutions are not binding on the members . The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters within the scope of the UN , except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council . 
 Draft resolutions can be forwarded to the General Assembly by eight committees : 
 General Committee – a supervisory committee consisting of the assembly 's president , vice @-@ president , and committee heads 
 Credentials Committee – responsible for determining the credentials of each member nation 's UN representatives 
 First Committee ( Disarmament and International Security ) 
 Second Committee ( Economic and Financial ) 
 Third Committee ( Social , Humanitarian , and Cultural ) 
 Fourth Committee ( Special Political and Decolonization ) 
 Fifth Committee ( Administrative and Budgetary ) 
 Sixth Committee ( Legal ) 
 = = = Security Council = = = 
 The Security Council is charged with maintaining peace and security among countries . While other organs of the United Nations can only make " recommendations " to member states , the Security Council has the power to make binding decisions that member states have agreed to carry out , under the terms of Charter Article 25 . The decisions of the Council are known as United Nations Security Council resolutions . 
 The Security Council is made up of fifteen member states , consisting of five permanent members — China , France , Russia , the United Kingdom , and the United States — and ten non @-@ permanent members — Angola ( term ends 2016 ) , Chad ( 2015 ) , Chile ( 2015 ) , Jordan ( 2015 ) , Lithuania ( 2015 ) , Malaysia ( 2016 ) , New Zealand ( 2016 ) , Nigeria ( 2015 ) , Spain ( 2016 ) , and Venezuela ( 2016 ) . The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions , allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution , though not debate . The ten temporary seats are held for two @-@ year terms , with member states voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis . The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month . 
 = = = Secretariat = = = 
 The UN Secretariat is headed by the Secretary @-@ General , assisted by a staff of international civil servants worldwide . It provides studies , information , and facilities needed by United Nations bodies for their meetings . It also carries out tasks as directed by the Security Council , the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council , and other UN bodies . 
 The Secretary @-@ General acts as the de facto spokesperson and leader of the UN . The position is defined in the UN Charter as the organization 's " chief administrative officer " . Article 99 of the charter states that the Secretary @-@ General can bring to the Security Council 's attention " any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security " , a phrase that Secretaries @-@ General since Trygve Lie have interpreted as giving the position broad scope for action on the world stage . The office has evolved into a dual role of an administrator of the UN organization and a diplomat and mediator addressing disputes between member states and finding consensus to global issues . 
 The Secretary @-@ General is appointed by the General Assembly , after being recommended by the Security Council , where the permanent members have veto power . There are no specific criteria for the post , but over the years it has become accepted that the post shall be held for one or two terms of five years , that the post shall be appointed on the basis of geographical rotation , and that the Secretary @-@ General shall not originate from one of the five permanent Security Council member states . The current Secretary @-@ General is Ban Ki @-@ moon , who replaced Kofi Annan in 2007 and was elected for a second term to conclude at the end of 2016 . 
 = = = International Court of Justice = = = 
 The International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , located in The Hague , in the Netherlands , is the primary judicial organ of the UN . Established in 1945 by the UN Charter , the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice . The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9 @-@ year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly ; every sitting judge must be from a different nation . 
 It is based in the Peace Palace in The Hague , sharing the building with the Hague Academy of International Law , a private centre for the study of international law . The ICJ 's primary purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states . The court has heard cases related to war crimes , illegal state interference , ethnic cleansing , and other issues . The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions . 
 = = = Economic and Social Council = = = 
 The Economic and Social Council ( ECOSOC ) assists the General Assembly in promoting international economic and social co @-@ operation and development . ECOSOC has 54 members , which are elected by the General Assembly for a three @-@ year term . The president is elected for a one @-@ year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC . The council has one annual meeting in July , held in either New York or Geneva . Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co @-@ ordinates , ECOSOC 's functions include information gathering , advising member nations , and making recommendations . Owing to its broad mandate of co @-@ ordinating many agencies , ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant . 
 ECOSOC 's subsidiary bodies include the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , which advises UN agencies on issues relating to indigenous peoples ; the United Nations Forum on Forests , which co @-@ ordinates and promotes sustainable forest management ; the United Nations Statistical Commission , which co @-@ ordinates information @-@ gathering efforts between agencies ; and the Commission on Sustainable Development , which co @-@ ordinates efforts between UN agencies and NGOs working toward sustainable development . ECOSOC may also grant consultative status to non @-@ governmental organizations ; by 2004 , more than 2 @,@ 200 organizations had received this status .

 The UN Charter stipulates that each primary organ of the UN can establish various specialized agencies to fulfill its duties . Some best @-@ known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency , the Food and Agriculture Organization , UNESCO ( United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ) , the World Bank , and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies . Examples include mass vaccination programmes ( through WHO ) , the avoidance of famine and malnutrition ( through the work of the WFP ) , and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people ( for example , by UNHCR ) . 
 = = Membership = = 
 With the addition of South Sudan 14 July 2011 , there are 193 United Nations member states , including all undisputed independent states apart from Vatican City . The UN Charter outlines the rules for membership : 
 Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace @-@ loving states that accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and , in the judgment of the Organization , are able and willing to carry out these obligations . 
 The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council . Chapter II , Article 4 
 In addition , there are two non @-@ member observer states of the United Nations General Assembly : the Holy See ( which holds sovereignty over Vatican City ) and the State of Palestine . The Cook Islands and Niue , both states in free association with New Zealand , are full members of several UN specialized agencies and have had their " full treaty @-@ making capacity " recognized by the Secretariat . 
 = = = Group of 77 = = = 
 The Group of 77 at the UN is a loose coalition of developing nations , designed to promote its members ' collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the United Nations . Seventy @-@ seven nations founded the organization , but by November 2013 the organization had since expanded to 133 member countries . The group was founded 15 June 1964 by the " Joint Declaration of the Seventy @-@ Seven Countries " issued at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) . The group held its first major meeting in Algiers in 1967 , where it adopted the Charter of Algiers and established the basis for permanent institutional structures . 
 = = Objectives = = 
 = = = Peacekeeping and security = = = 
 The UN , after approval by the Security Council , sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities . Since the UN does not maintain its own military , peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states . These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed " Blue Helmets " for their distinctive gear . The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988 . 
 In September 2013 , the UN had peacekeeping soldiers deployed on 15 missions . The largest was the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( MONUSCO ) , which included 20 @,@ 688 uniformed personnel . The smallest , United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan ( <unk> ) , included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir . UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization ( <unk> ) have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948 , the longest @-@ running active peacekeeping mission . 
 A study by the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts . It compared efforts at nation @-@ building by the United Nations to those of the United States , and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace , as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace . Also in 2005 , the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars , genocides , and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War , and presented evidence , albeit circumstantial , that international activism — mostly spearheaded by the UN — has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period . Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War ( 1950 – 53 ) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War ( 1990 – 91 ) . 
 The UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures . In many cases , member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions . Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention are seen as having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971 , the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s , and the Rwandan genocide in 1994 . Similarly , UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992 – 93 during the Somali Civil War . UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape , soliciting prostitutes , and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , Haiti , Liberia , Sudan and what is now South Sudan , Burundi , and Ivory Coast . Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010 – 13 Haiti cholera outbreak , which killed more than 8 @,@ 000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake . 
 In addition to peacekeeping , the UN is also active in encouraging disarmament . Regulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in 1945 and was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic resources for their creation . The advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks after the signing of the charter , resulting in the first resolution of the first General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for " the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction " . The UN has been involved with arms @-@ limitation treaties , such as the Outer Space Treaty ( 1967 ) , the Treaty on the Non @-@ Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( 1968 ) , the Seabed Arms Control Treaty ( 1971 ) , the Biological Weapons Convention ( 1972 ) , the Chemical Weapons Convention ( 1992 ) , and the Ottawa Treaty ( 1997 ) , which prohibits landmines . Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues : the International Atomic Energy Agency , the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , and the Comprehensive Nuclear @-@ Test @-@ Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission . 
 = = = Human rights = = = 
 One of the UN 's primary purposes is " promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " , and member states pledge to undertake " joint and separate action " to protect these rights . 
 In 1948 , the General Assembly adopted a Universal Declaration of Human Rights , drafted by a committee headed by Franklin D. Roosevelt 's widow , Eleanor , and including the French lawyer René Cassin . The document proclaims basic civil , political , and economic rights common to all human beings , though its effectiveness toward achieving these ends has been disputed since its drafting . The Declaration serves as a " common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations " rather than a legally binding document , but it has become the basis of two binding treaties , the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . In practice , the UN is unable to take significant action against human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution , though it does substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses . 
 In 1979 , the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , followed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 . With the end of the Cold War , the push for human rights action took on new impetus . The United Nations Commission on Human Rights was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues for the UN , following the recommendation of that year 's World Conference on Human Rights . Jacques Fomerand , a scholar of the UN , describes this organization 's mandate as " broad and vague " , with only " meager " resources to carry it out . In 2006 , it was replaced by a Human Rights Council consisting of 47 nations . Also in 2006 , the General Assembly passed a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , and in 2011 it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of LGBT people . 
 Other UN bodies responsible for women 's rights issues include United Nations Commission on the Status of Women , a commission of ECOSOC founded in 1946 ; the United Nations Development Fund for Women , created in 1976 ; and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women , founded in 1979 . The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , one of three bodies with a mandate to oversee issues related to indigenous peoples , held its first session in 2002 . 
 = = = Economic development and humanitarian assistance = = = 
 Another primary purpose of the UN is " to achieve international co @-@ operation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural , or humanitarian character " . Numerous bodies have been created to work towards this goal , primarily under the authority of the General Assembly and ECOSOC . In 2000 , the 192 United Nations member states agreed to achieve eight Millennium Development Goals by 2015 . 
 The UN Development Programme ( UNDP ) , an organization for grant @-@ based technical assistance founded in 1945 , is one of the leading bodies in the field of international development . The organization also publishes the UN Human Development Index , a comparative measure ranking countries by poverty , literacy , education , life expectancy , and other factors . The Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , also founded in 1945 , promotes agricultural development and food security . UNICEF ( the United Nations Children 's Fund ) was created in 1946 to aid European children after the Second World War and expanded its mission to provide aid around the world and to uphold the Convention on the Rights of the Child . 
 The World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) are independent , specialized agencies and observers within the UN framework , according to a 1947 agreement . They were initially formed separately from the UN through the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944 . The World Bank provides loans for international development , while the IMF promotes international economic co @-@ operation and gives emergency loans to indebted countries . 
 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) , which focuses on international health issues and disease eradication , is another of the UN 's largest agencies . In 1980 , the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed . In subsequent decades , WHO largely eradicated polio , river blindness , and leprosy . The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS ( UNAIDS ) , begun in 1996 , co @-@ ordinates the organization 's response to the AIDS epidemic . The UN Population Fund , which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV , is the world 's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services . 
 Along with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement , the UN often takes a leading role in co @-@ ordinating emergency relief . The World Food Programme ( WFP ) , created in 1961 , provides food aid in response to famine , natural disasters , and armed conflict . The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year . The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , established in 1950 , works to protect the rights of refugees , asylum seekers , and stateless people . UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments , corporations , and individuals , though the UNHCR 's administrative costs are paid for by the UN 's primary budget . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 Since the UN 's creation , over 80 colonies have attained independence . The General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples in 1960 with no votes against but abstentions from all major colonial powers . The UN works toward decolonization through groups including the UN Committee on Decolonization , created in 1962 . The committee lists seventeen remaining " Non @-@ Self @-@ Governing Territories " , the largest and most populous of which is Western Sahara . 
 Beginning with the formation of the UN Environmental Programme ( UNEP ) in 1972 , the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda . A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , which sought to give new impetus to these efforts . In 1988 , the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , another UN organization , established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which assesses and reports on research on global warming . The UN @-@ sponsored Kyoto Protocol , signed in 1997 , set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states . 
 The UN also declares and co @-@ ordinates international observances , periods of time to observe issues of international interest or concern . Examples include World Tuberculosis Day , Earth Day , and the International Year of Deserts and <unk> . 
 = = Funding = = 
 The UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from member states . The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the assessment for each member . This is broadly based on the relative capacity of each country to pay , as measured by its gross national income ( GNI ) , with adjustments for external debt and low per capita income . The two @-@ year budget for 2012 – 13 was $ 5 @.@ 512 billion in total . 
 The Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly dependent on any one member to finance its operations . Thus , there is a " ceiling " rate , setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for the regular budget . In December 2000 , the Assembly revised the scale of assessments in response to pressure from the United States . As part of that revision , the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25 % to 22 % . For the least developed countries ( <unk> ) , a ceiling rate of 0 @.@ 01 % is applied . In addition to the ceiling rates , the minimum amount assessed to any member nation ( or " floor " rate ) is set at 0 @.@ 001 % of the UN budget ( $ 55 @,@ 120 for the two year budget 2013 @-@ 2014 ) . 
 A large share of the UN 's expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security , and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational budget . The peacekeeping budget for the 2015 – 16 fiscal year was $ 8 @.@ 27 billion , supporting 82 @,@ 318 troops deployed in 15 missions around the world . UN peace operations are funded by assessments , using a formula derived from the regular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council members , who must approve all peacekeeping operations . This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment rates for less developed countries . In 2013 , the top 10 providers of assessed financial contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations were the United States ( 28 @.@ 38 % ) , Japan ( 10 @.@ 83 % ) , France ( 7 @.@ 22 % ) , Germany ( 7 @.@ 14 % ) , the United Kingdom ( 6 @.@ 68 % ) , China ( 6 @.@ 64 % ) , Italy ( 4 @.@ 45 % ) , the Russian Federation ( 3 @.@ 15 % ) , Canada ( 2 @.@ 98 % ) , and Spain ( 2 @.@ 97 % ) . 
 Special UN programmes not included in the regular budget , such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme , are financed by voluntary contributions from member governments , corporations , and private individuals . 
 = = Evaluations , awards , and criticism = = 
 A number of agencies and individuals associated with the UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work . Two Secretaries @-@ General , Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan , were each awarded the prize ( in 1961 and 2001 , respectively ) , as were Ralph Bunche ( 1950 ) , a UN negotiator , René Cassin ( 1968 ) , a contributor to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull ( 1945 ) , the latter for his role in the organization 's founding . Lester B. Pearson , the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs , was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN 's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis . UNICEF won the prize in 1965 , the International Labour Organization in 1969 , the UN Peace @-@ Keeping Forces in 1988 , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( which reports to the UN ) in 2005 , and the UN @-@ supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013 . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981 , becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice . The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001 , sharing it with Annan . 
 Since its founding , there have been many calls for reform of the United Nations but little consensus on how to do so . Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs , while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work . There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council 's membership to be increased , for different ways of electing the UN 's Secretary @-@ General , and for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly . Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the UN is " the North – South split " between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations . Southern nations tend to favor a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly , allowing them a greater voice in world affairs , while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez @-@ faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism . 
 After World War II , the French Committee of National Liberation was late to be recognized by the US as the government of France , and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization . The future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN , famously calling it a <unk> ( " contraption " ) , and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help maintain world peace , preferring direct defence treaties between countries . Throughout the Cold War , both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favoring the other . In 1953 , the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie , the Secretary @-@ General , through its refusal to deal with him , while in the 1950s and 1960s , a popular US bumper sticker read , " You can 't spell communism without U.N. " In a sometimes @-@ misquoted statement , President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 ( referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime ) that " free nations will not allow the United Nations to fade into history as an ineffective , irrelevant debating society . " In contrast , the French President , François Hollande , stated in 2012 that " France trusts the United Nations . She knows that no state , no matter how powerful , can solve urgent problems , fight for development and bring an end to all crises ... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance . " Critics such as Dore Gold , an Israeli diplomat , Robert S. Wistrich , a British scholar , Alan Dershowitz , an American legal scholar , Mark Dreyfus , an Australian politician , and the Anti @-@ Defamation League consider UN attention to Israel 's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive . In September 2015 , Saudi Arabia 's Faisal bin Hassan Trad has been elected Chair of the United Nations Human Rights Council panel that appoints independent experts , a move criticized by human rights groups . 
 Critics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency , waste , and corruption . In 1976 , the General Assembly established the Joint Inspection Unit to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system . During the 1990s , the US withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative was introduced . In 1994 , the Office of Internal Oversight Services ( <unk> ) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog . In 1994 , former Special Representative of the Secretary @-@ General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed <unk> published " Somalia : The Missed Opportunities " , a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia , showing that , between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991 , the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies ; when the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance , they were totally outperformed by NGOs , whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN 's excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies . If radical reform was not undertaken , warned Mohamed <unk> , then the UN would continue to respond to such crisis with inept improvisation . In 2004 , the UN faced accusations that its recently ended Oil @-@ for @-@ Food Programme — in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions — had suffered from widespread corruption , including billions of dollars of kickbacks . An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved , as well as raising " significant " questions about the role of Kojo Annan , the son of Kofi Annan . 
 In evaluating the UN as a whole , Jacques Fomerand writes that the " accomplishments of the United Nations in the last 60 years are impressive in their own terms . Progress in human development during the 20th century has been dramatic and the UN and its agencies have certainly helped the world become a more hospitable and livable place for millions . " Evaluating the first 50 years of the UN 's history , the author Stanley Meisler writes that " the United Nations never fulfilled the hopes of its founders , but it accomplished a great deal nevertheless " , citing its role in decolonization and its many successful peacekeeping efforts . The British historian Paul Kennedy states that while the organization has suffered some major setbacks , " when all its aspects are considered , the UN has brought great benefits to our generation and ... will bring benefits to our children 's and grandchildren 's generations as well .

 = 12 Days = 
 12 Days is a debut graphic novel / global manga written and illustrated by June Kim . Basing the plot partially on a story told to her by a stranger , Kim began an early version of 12 Days as a sophomore in college to help herself cope with the end of a relationship . After moving on emotionally with her break @-@ up , she stopped developing the comic and later left South Korea to attend the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan , New York , United States , from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning . Following her successful pitch of 12 Days to manga publisher Tokyopop , she resumed work on it in early 2005 and finished in the middle of August 2006 . 12 Days focuses on Jackie Yuen , who decides to drink the ashes of her former lover for twelve days in beverages as a way to cope with her grief over her death . 
 Tokyopop published 12 Days in North America on 7 November 2006 , to generally positive reviews . Critics praised the manga for its mature portrayal of grief and relationships , and its realistic artwork , although the choice of print for the dialogue was considered distracting . Reviewers also discussed the comic 's treatment of the issues of love , loss , and lesbian elements . In May 2011 , Tokyopop shut down its North American publishing branch , with the status of its original , global manga titles left unclear . 
 = = Plot = = 
 For the first eight chapters , 12 Days centers on Jackie Yuen , a 29 @-@ year @-@ old part Cantonese and part Korean editor . After the death of her former lover , the Korean American school nurse Noah Yoon , she decides to drink her ashes over twelve days in beverages as a way of coping with her grief . Nicholas " Nick " Yoon , Noah 's younger half brother , steals some of Noah 's ashes for her to use , and soon joins her in mourning . She reminisces on how she met her and became involved in a lesbian relationship ; however , Noah ended their relationship to marry a man to appease her father , and died returning from her honeymoon in a car accident a month ago . As Jackie continues her ritual , she begins to feel ill and eventually faints . Nick takes her to the hospital , where she recovers . On New Year 's Day , she parts from Nick and returns to her apartment to find that he has taken the engagement ring she had wanted to give Noah , and unknown to her , he mixes it in with the remaining ashes . 12 Days concludes with " Chapter 0 " , set before the events in the rest of the comic : Noah finds Nick studying for exams , and they briefly discuss Artemisia II of Caria , an ancient Greek queen who drank the ashes of her husband . Noah then hints that she has found someone whose ashes she would drink . 
 = = Style and issues = = 
 June Kim , the author and illustrator for 12 Days , primarily drew the artwork in the realism style , although she occasionally rendered characters as super @-@ deformed versions of themselves . While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring , the artwork primarily appears in black and white , with occasional gray shading . Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium , then toned her art with the software application <unk> . For the narrative , she explores the characters ' pasts through dreams , and periodic , nonlinear flashbacks . Several character traits , such as Jackie 's chocolate allergy , are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition . Additionally , Kim uses a brief , untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text . 
 Critics have focused on the issues of love and loss . 12 Days primarily deals with " a love affair and its aftermath , " according to Dirk <unk> of The Comics Journal . He considered it " a meditation on loss , " which explores " a relationship neither fully ended nor easily forgotten by either party . " Theron Martin of Anime News Network considered it a story about " trying to find a way to cope with a devastating loss " . According to Katherine Dacey , the former senior manga editor for PopCultureShock , 12 Days contains " lovely , quiet observations about the way we grieve , define family , express desire , and remember moments of hurt and betrayal . " Johanna Draper Carlson , a reviewer for Publishers Weekly , wrote that Jackie 's action of consuming the ashes serves as " a transition period , a way to indulge her grief and then a time to be able to be herself again . " AfterEllen.com 's editor @-@ in @-@ chief Karman Kregloe stated that the comic " explores the impact of loss , and how relationships are supported and broken in times of grief . " 
 To a lesser extent , critics also discussed the lesbian aspect . Martin felt that the lesbian element of 12 Days had been addressed , without becoming overstated . Casey Brienza , a fellow reviewer for Anime News Network , suggested that the shame Jackie and Noah felt as lesbians " ultimately destroyed their relationship . " In her comparison of Alison Bechdel 's 2006 graphic memoir Fun Home and 12 Days , Erica Friedman , the founder of the lesbian @-@ themed anime convention Yuricon , considered neither story to be " lesbian narratives " , but rather " narratives of grief , of relationships and of missed opportunities for communication and closeness . "

 Partially modeled on a story told to Kim by a stranger , 12 Days began during her sophomore year in college as a way of coping with the end of a relationship . Kim soon abandoned the unfinished comic after moving on emotionally from the breakup , and considered the early concept " poorly built . " After completing her junior year in college in Seoul , South Korea , where she had been studying Japanese language and literature , Kim moved to New York , United States . There , she attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan , New York , for four years , and graduated in 2002 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in cartooning . In addition to illustrating the cover of Australian rock band Jet 's 2003 debut album Get Born , she had three of her short comics published in anthologies : " <unk> " ( 2003 ) in Broad Appeal , " B @-@ 612 " ( 2003 / 4 ) in New Thing Vol.2 , and " Repeat " ( 2005 ) in <unk> <unk> 
 At the 2004 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , she encountered now @-@ former Tokyopop editors Mark <unk> and Lillian M. Diaz @-@ <unk> , who helped to pitch 12 Days to their publisher . Kim later expressed surprise for her successful pitch of 12 Days , and commented : " It made me believe there is room for diverse stories . " Resuming work on 12 Days in early 2005 , Kim felt that her " slow speed , other projects and family matters " delayed its production . Additionally , the South Korean @-@ native Kim , who speaks Korean , English , and Japanese fluently , would think of ideas in Korean that did not translate well over to English , ultimately leading her to change her method of thinking for the comic . She considered her creation of a global manga " a bit ironic , " because she " wanted to do something different from manhwa or manga , " which she had grown up around . Completed in the middle of August 2006 , 12 Days was published by Tokyopop in North America in November of the same year . However , in May 2011 , Tokyopop shut down its North American branch , with the status of global manga titles left unclear . 12 Days is also published in Germany by Tokyopop Germany .

 12 Days received generally positive reviews from critics . Caroline Ryder of The Advocate , a LGBT @-@ interest magazine , highlighted 12 Days as " a dark , deeply emotional graphic novel . " Brienza complimented Kim 's artistic attention to the background and setting 's details , and summed up the comic as " a sensitive depiction of lesbians that strives for literariness " . While not personally enjoying the comic , Friedman considered it " excellent and well worth reading . " Noting the potentially confusing <unk> , Martin stated : " 12 Days doesn 't easily fall into any of the normal manga ( or manga @-@ like ) categories . It avoids any kind of sensationalism in providing a mature piece about a difficult topic , which may limit its appeal but certainly makes it worth reading . " While <unk> praised it as " an ambitious and partly satisfying work that very nearly succeeds , " he considered it not " as daring or complex a work " as Fun Home . Although Dacey disliked the backgrounds and the " self @-@ consciously literary " ashes @-@ in @-@ beverages aspect , she enjoyed the plot and Kim 's use of naturalism in her artwork . She later placed it on her list of the top ten global manga . Draper Carlson recommended it , commenting : " The emotions the book carries will be familiar to anyone who ’ s suffered a loss in love . It ’ s a work to meditate on . " Conversely , A. E. Sparrow of IGN wrote that the story sacrificed its coherency in its attempt " for a deeper level of understanding " ; Sparrow concluded : " 12 Days is simply trying too hard , burying some absolutely beautiful illustrations in a sea of chaotic storytelling .

 = Belgian ship A4 = 
 Patrol vessel A4 ( French : <unk> A4 ) was a small Mersey @-@ class naval trawler operated by Belgium during the Second World War . Originally built for the British Royal Navy , as HMS John Ebbs , the ship is notable for its role in evacuating Belgian gold reserves to England during the Battle of Belgium in May 1940 . The success of the operation not only allowed the Belgian government in exile to fund its operations but deprived the German occupiers of an important asset to support their war effort . After the Belgian surrender , the vessel and its crew interned themselves in neutral Spain . In 1946 , the vessel and its crew were released and the ship was scrapped soon afterwards .

 Pilote 4 ( later renamed <unk> A4 ) was purchased by the Belgian Corps de Marine in 1920 , having previously served in the British Royal Navy during the First World War as HMS John Ebbs ( <unk> ) . The vessel was a Mersey @-@ class naval trawler , built by <unk> in Selby , North Yorkshire , and was launched on 2 October 1917 . Displacing 334 long tons ( 339 t ) , the vessel was 148 feet ( 45 m ) long , and had a draught of 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) . Fitted with engines that were capable of producing 600 horsepower ( 450 kW ) , it could travel at between 9 and 10 knots . With a complement of 27 , the Belgians armed the ship with two Maxim machine guns on the bridge and a 47mm gun at the stern . In 1939 , A4 was waiting to be scrapped , but the deteriorating international situation caused by German expansionism led to its reactivation by the Ministry of National Defence . 
 Because of Belgium 's neutral status in the early stages of the Second World War , A4 had large Belgian <unk> painted on each side of its hull , as well as the word " <unk> " ( Dutch for " Belgium " ) in white , to prevent it being mistaken for a belligerent ship . After Belgium was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940 , it was not repainted . 
 = = Evacuation of Belgian gold = = 
 During the interwar period , Belgium had created a gold @-@ based currency , called the Belga , which ran parallel to the Belgian franc . The Belga was intended for international trading and meant that the National Bank of Belgium amassed considerable gold reserves , amounting to some 600 tonnes by 1940 . 
 During the escalating international tensions in the 1930s , the Belgian government began moving large amounts of gold to the United States , Great Britain and Canada , but was forced to retain some gold in the country to maintain the Belga 's value . 
 By the time the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940 , there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium , held at the bank 's offices in the port of Ostend . The only ship available in the area was A4 , commanded by Lieutenant Van <unk> . On 19 May 1940 , the vessel was loaded with the gold and , avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe , headed for the British coast , accompanied by the ship <unk> which was carrying refugees . After being transferred from port to port because of concerns for the safety of the cargo during unloading , the gold was landed at Plymouth on 26 May , two days before the Belgian surrender . The gold was finally deposited at the Bank of England . A4 also carried Hubert <unk> , the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank . 
 The fact that so much Belgian gold had been rescued before the German occupation allowed the Belgian government in exile to finance its own operations , unlike most other exiled governments which had to rely on British financial support . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Since Belgium had officially surrendered on 28 May and no official Belgian government yet existed in England , the crew of A4 took their ship to Bilbao in neutral Spain to avoid having to return to Belgium and become German prisoners of war . They arrived in Spain on 26 June and spent the rest of the war interned . Control of the ship was returned to Belgium in 1946 and it was scrapped in 1948 . 
 For his role in the evacuation of the gold , Lieutenant Van <unk> was awarded the Order of Leopold II .
