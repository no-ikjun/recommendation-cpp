 While under construction , the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions . On the weekend of July 4 , 2011 , it was lit up with the colors of the American flag to commemorate Independence Day , and it was lit up with the same colors on September 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks . On October 27 of that same year , it was illuminated with pink in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month . On December 11 , the Port Authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season . On February 24 , 2012 , the building was lit up with red in honor of Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan , who became a cardinal on February 18 . On June 14 , 2012 , it was illuminated with red , white , and blue to honor Flag Day . In August , it was illuminated with red in honor of the Armed Forces . On September 8 , 2012 , it was once again illuminated with red , white , and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks . On June 24 , 2013 , the building was again illuminated with red , white , and blue to celebrate the Fourth of July . On November 12 , 2013 , three hundred red , white , and blue lights were lit up . 
 The tower 's loading dock , however , was not due to be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building , so five temporary loading bays were added at a cost of millions of dollars . The temporary PATH station was not to be removed until its official replacement , the World Trade Center Transportation Hub , was completed , blocking access to the planned loading area . By March 2012 , One World Trade Center 's steel structure had reached 93 floors , growing to 94 floors and 1 @,@ 240 feet ( 380 m ) by the end of the month . However , because the floor numberings were based on standard measurements , the 94th floor was numbered " floor 100 " , because the extra space was occupied by the high @-@ ceilinged 91st floor , which was used for mechanical purposes . 
 The still @-@ incomplete tower became New York City 's tallest building by roof height in April 2012 , passing the 1 @,@ 250 @-@ foot ( 380 m ) roof height of the Empire State Building . President Barack Obama visited the construction site two months later and wrote , on a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower , the sentence " We remember , we rebuild , we come back stronger ! " That same month , with the tower 's structure nearing completion , the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building , seeking to attract visitors and tenants . 
 One World Trade Center 's steel structure topped out at the nominal 104th floor , with a total height of 1 @,@ 368 feet ( 417 m ) , in August 2012 . The tower 's antenna was shipped to New York in November 2012 ; the first section of the antenna was hoisted to the top of the tower on December 12 , 2012 , and was installed on January 15 , 2013 . By March 2013 , two sections of the antenna had been installed . The spire 's completion was scheduled for April 29 , 2013 , but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces . On May 10 , 2013 , the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center , bringing the tower to its full height of 1 @,@ 776 feet ( 541 m ) , and making it the fourth @-@ tallest building in the world , as well as the tallest in the city , surpassing the 1 @,@ 454 @-@ foot ( 443 m ) Empire State Building . In subsequent months , the exterior elevator shaft was removed ; the podium glass , interior decorations , and other finishings were being installed ; and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed . 
 A report in September 2013 revealed that , at the time of the report , the World Trade Center Association ( WTCA ) was negotiating with regard to the " World Trade Center " name , as the WTCA had purchased the rights to the name in 1986 . The WTCA sought $ 500 @,@ 000 worth of free office space in the tower in exchange for the use of " World Trade Center " in the tower 's name and associated souvenirs . 
 On November 12 , 2013 , the Height Committee of the Chicago @-@ based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ( CTBUH ) made the controversial announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest building in the United States at 1 @,@ 776 feet , declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building 's architecture . By the same reasoning , the building was also the tallest in the Western Hemisphere .

 On November 1 , 2014 , moving trucks started moving items for the tower 's first tenant , magazine publisher Condé Nast , from its old headquarters in Times Square to One World Trade Center . The New York Times noted that the area around the World Trade Center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms , residences , and luxury shops , coincident with the building of the new tower . 
 The building opened on November 3 , 2014 , and Condé Nast employees moved into spaces spread among 24 floors . Condé Nast occupies floors 20 to 44 , having completed its move in early 2015 . It is expected that the company will attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40 % of unleased space in the tower , as Condé Nast had revitalized Times Square after moving there in 1999 . Only about 170 of 3 @,@ 400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day . Future tenants will include Kids Creative , Legends Hospitality , the BMB Group , <unk> , and GQ . 
 On November 12 , 2014 , the supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked . The cables were manufactured by <unk> , and they were used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the building 's exterior . At the time , the platform was holding a two @-@ man , SEIU @-@ affiliated window washing team . The slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower . The workers were rescued by over 100 FDNY firefighters , who used a diamond saw to cut through the glass . After the incident , the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia , and were taken to the hospital . 
 = = = Estimated cost and funding = = = 
 An estimate in February 2007 placed the initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $ 3 billion , or $ 1 @,@ 150 per square foot ( $ 12 @,@ 380 per square meter ) . However , the tower 's total estimated construction cost had risen to $ 3 @.@ 9 billion by April 2012 , making it the most expensive building in the world at the time . The tower 's construction was partly funded by approximately $ 1 billion of insurance money that Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks . The State of New York provided an additional $ 250 million , and the Port Authority agreed to give $ 1 billion , which would be obtained through the sale of bonds . The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds , with a 56 percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015 ; however , the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower 's construction . 
 = = = Architecture and design = = = 
 Many of Daniel Libeskind 's original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the tower 's final design . One World Trade Center 's final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile , intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline . The tower 's central spire draws from previous buildings , such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building . It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers , rather than being an off @-@ center spire similar to the Statue of Liberty . 
 The building occupies a 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) square , with an area of 40 @,@ 000 square feet ( 3 @,@ 700 m2 ) , nearly identical to the footprints of the original Twin Towers . The tower is built upon a 185 @-@ foot ( 56 m ) tall windowless concrete base , designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground @-@ level attacks . Originally , the base was to be covered in decorative prismatic glass , but a simpler glass @-@ and @-@ steel façade was adopted when the prisms proved unworkable . The current base cladding consists of angled glass fins protruding from stainless steel panels , similar to those on 7 World Trade Center . LED lights behind the panels illuminate the base at night . Cable @-@ net glass façades on all four sides of the building for the higher floors , designed by <unk> <unk> , will be consistent with the other buildings in the complex . The façades are 60 feet ( 18 m ) high , and range in width from 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) on the east and west sides , 50 feet ( 15 m ) on the north side , and 70 feet ( 21 m ) on the south side . The curtain wall was manufactured and assembled by Benson Industries in Portland , Oregon , using glass made in Minnesota by <unk> . 
 From the 20th floor upwards , the square edges of the tower 's cubic base are chamfered back , shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles , or an elongated square <unk> . Near its middle , the tower forms a perfect octagon , and then culminates in a glass parapet , whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base . A 408 @-@ foot ( 124 m ) sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna – designed in a collaboration between Skidmore , Owings and Merrill ( SOM ) , artist Kenneth <unk> ( who invented the tensegrity structure ) , lighting designers , and engineers – is secured by a system of cables , and rises from a circular support ring , which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment . At night , an intense beam of light is projected horizontally from the spire and shines over 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) above the tower . 
 David Childs of SOM , the architect of One World Trade Center , said the following regarding the tower 's design : 
 We really wanted our design to be grounded in something that was very real , not just in sculptural sketches . We explored the infrastructural challenges because the proper solution would have to be compelling , not just beautiful . The design does have great sculptural implications , and we fully understand the iconic importance of the tower , but it also has to be a highly efficient building . The discourse about Freedom Tower has often been limited to the symbolic , formal and aesthetic aspects but we recognize that if this building doesn 't function well , if people don 't want to work and visit there , then we will have failed as architects .

 Just south of the new One World Trade Center is the National September 11 Memorial & Museum , which is located where the original Twin Towers stood . Immediately to the east is World Trade Center Transportation Hub and the new Two World Trade Center site . To the north is Seven World Trade Center , and to the west is Brookfield Place . 
 One World Trade Center 's top floor is officially designated as floor 104 , despite the fact that the tower only contains 94 actual stories . The building has 86 usable above @-@ ground floors , of which 78 are intended for office purposes ( approximately 2 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 square feet ( 240 @,@ 000 m2 ) ) . The base consists of floors 1 – 19 , including a 65 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 20 m ) public lobby . The office floors begin at floor 20 , and go up to floor 63 . There is a sky lobby on floor 64 ; office floors resume on floor 65 , and stop at floor 90 . Floors 91 – 99 and 103 – 104 are mechanical floors . 
 The tower has a three @-@ story observation deck , located on floors 100 – 102 , in addition to existing broadcast and antenna facilities . Similar to in the Empire State Building , visitors will be separated from the tenants , having their own separate entrance next to the museum , descending down to a below @-@ ground security screening area . On the observation deck , the actual viewing space is on the 100th floor , but there will be a food court on the 101st floor and a space for events for the 102nd floor . To show visitors the city , and give them information and stories about New York , an interactive tool called City Pulse is used by Tour Ambassadors . The admission fee will be $ 32 per person , but admission discounts are available for children and seniors , and the deck will be free for 9 / 11 responders and families of 9 / 11 victims . When it opens , the deck is expected to have about 3 @.@ 5 million visitors per year . Tickets went on sale starting on April 8 . However , the Manhattan District Attorney probed the Port Authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck . It officially opened on May 28 , 2015 , one day ahead of schedule . 
 There are three eating venues at the top of the building : a café ( called One Café ) , a bar and " small plates " grill ( One Mix ) , and a fine dining restaurant ( One Dining ) . Some have criticized the food prices ; the need of a full observatory ticket purchase to enter ; and their reputations compared to Windows on the World , the top @-@ floor restaurant in the original One World Trade Center . The tenants have access to below @-@ ground parking , storage , and shopping ; access to PATH , New York City Subway trains , and the World Financial Center is also provided at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub , Fulton Street / Fulton Center , Chambers Street , and Cortlandt Street stations . The building allows direct access to West Street , Vesey Street , and Fulton Street at ground level . The building has an approximate underground footprint of 42 @,@ 000 square feet ( 3 @,@ 900 m2 ) , of which 55 @,@ 000 square feet ( 5 @,@ 100 m2 ) is retail space . A plan to build a restaurant near the top of the tower , similar to the original One World Trade Center 's Windows on the World , was abandoned as logistically impractical . The tower 's window @-@ washing tracks are located on a 16 @-@ square @-@ foot area , which will be designated as floor 110 as a symbolic reference to the 110 floors of the original tower . 
 = = = = = Design evolution = = = = = 
 The original design went through significant changes after the Durst Organization joined the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as the co @-@ developer of the project in 2010 . 
 The 185 @-@ foot ( 56 m ) tall base corners were originally designed to gently slope upward , and have prismatic glass . The corners were later squared . In addition , the base 's walls are now covered in " hundreds of pairs of 13 @-@ foot vertical glass fins set against horizontal bands of eight @-@ inch @-@ wide stainless @-@ steel slats . " 
 The spire was originally to be enclosed with a protective radome , described as a " sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels " . However , the radome @-@ enclosed spire was changed to a plain antenna . Douglas Durst , the chairman of the Durst Organization , stated that the design change would save $ 20 million . However , the tower 's architect , Skidmore Owings & Merrill , strongly criticized the change . David Childs , the lead designer , said , " Eliminating this integral part of the building 's design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate ... We stand ready to work with the Port on an alternate design . " After joining the project in 2010 , the Durst Organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs , but the proposal was rejected by the Port Authority 's then @-@ executive director , Christopher O. Ward . Ward was replaced by Patrick Foye in September 2011 . Foye changed the Port Authority 's position , and the radome was removed from the plans . In 2012 , Douglas Durst gave a statement regarding the final decision : " ( the antenna ) is going to be mounted on the building over the summer . There 's no way to do anything at this point . " 
 The large triangular plaza on the west side of One World Trade Center , facing the Hudson River , was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street . However , the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design . The terrace can be accessed through a staircase on Vesey Street . The terrace is paved in granite , and has 12 sweetgum trees , in addition to a block @-@ long planter / bench . 
 Durst also removed a skylight from the plaza 's plans ; the skylight was designed to allow natural light to enter the below @-@ ground observation deck lobby . The plaza is 5 ft 8 in ( 1 @.@ 73 m ) higher than the adjacent sidewalk . 
 The Port Authority formally approved all these revisions , and the revisions were first reported by the New York Post . Patrick Foye , the executive director of the Port Authority , said that he thought that the changes were " few and minor " in a telephone interview . 
 A contract negotiated between the Port Authority and the Durst Organization states that the Durst Organization will receive a $ 15 million fee and a percentage of " base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project . " The specifics of the signed contract give Durst 75 percent of the savings , up to $ 24 million , with further returns going down to 50 percent , 25 percent and 15 percent as the savings increase . 
 = = = = = Height = = = = = 
 The top floor of One World Trade Center is 1 @,@ 368 feet ( 417 m ) above ground level , along with a 33 ft 4 in ( 10 @.@ 16 m ) parapet ; this is identical to the roof height of the original One World Trade Center . The tower 's antenna / spire brings it to a pinnacle height of 1 @,@ 776 feet ( 541 m ) , a figure intended to symbolize the year 1776 , when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed . If the antenna is included in the building 's height , as stated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ( CTBUH ) , One World Trade Center surpasses the height of Taipei 101 ( 1 @,@ 671 @-@ foot ( 509 m ) ) , is the world 's tallest all @-@ office building , and the fourth @-@ tallest skyscraper in the world , behind the Burj Khalifa , <unk> Al Bait , and Shanghai Tower . 
 One World Trade Center is the second @-@ tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere , as the CN Tower in Toronto exceeds One World Trade Center 's pinnacle height by approximately 12 m ( 39 @.@ 4 ft ) . The Chicago Spire , with a planned height of 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) , was expected to exceed the height of One World Trade Center , but its construction was canceled due to financial difficulties in 2009 . 
 After design changes for One World Trade Center 's spire were revealed in May 2012 , there were questions as to whether the 408 @-@ foot ( 124 m ) -tall structure would still qualify as a spire , and thus be included in the building 's height . Since the tower 's spire is not enclosed in a radome as originally planned , it could be classified as a simple antenna , which is not included in a building 's height , according to the CTBUH . Without the antenna , One World Trade Center would be 1 @,@ 368 feet ( 417 m ) tall , making it the fourth @-@ tallest building in the United States , behind the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel & Tower , both located in Chicago , and 432 Park Avenue in New York . The building is currently the tallest in New York City with the antenna ; however , without the antenna , it was surpassed in 2015 by 432 Park Avenue , which topped out at 1 @,@ 396 feet ( 426 m ) high . One World Trade Center 's developers have disputed the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign , with Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman reiterating that " One World Trade Center will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere . " In 2012 , the CTBUH announced that it would wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire would count towards the building 's height . On November 12 , 2013 , the CTBUH announced that One World Trade Center 's spire would count as part of the building 's recognized height , giving it a final height of 1 @,@ 776 feet , and making it the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere . 
 = = = = Sustainability = = = = 
 Like other buildings in the new World Trade Center complex , One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features . Much of the building 's structure and interior is built from recycled materials , including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles ; around 80 percent of the tower 's waste products are recycled . Although the roof area of any tower is limited , the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems . The building 's <unk> phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4 @.@ 8 megawatts ( MW ) of power , and its waste steam generates electricity . The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower 's fuel cell system , which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed . The tower also makes use of off @-@ site hydroelectric and wind power . The windows are made of an ultra @-@ clear glass , which allows maximum sunlight to pass through ; the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days , reducing energy costs . Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site , One World Trade Center is heated by steam , with limited oil or natural gas utilities on @-@ site . One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) Gold Certification , making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world .

 Along with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base , a number of other safety features were included in the building 's design , so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack . Like 7 World Trade Center , the building has 3 @-@ foot ( 91 cm ) thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells , elevator shafts , risers , and sprinkler systems . There are also extra @-@ wide , pressurized stairwells , along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters , and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system . In comparison , the original Twin Towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions , protected only by lightweight drywall panels . 
 The building is no longer 25 feet ( 8 m ) away from West Street , as the Twin Towers were ; at its closest point , West Street is 65 feet ( 20 m ) away . The windows facing West Street are equipped with specially tempered blast @-@ resistant plastic , which looks almost like the glass used in the other sides of the building . The Port Authority has stated : " Its structure is designed around a strong , redundant steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected by a combination of welding and bolting . Paired with a concrete @-@ core shear wall , the moment frame lends substantial rigidity and redundancy to the overall building structure while providing column @-@ free interior spans for maximum flexibility . " 
 In addition to optimal safety design , new security measures will be implemented . All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before they enter the site through the underground road . Four hundred closed @-@ circuit surveillance cameras will be placed in and around the site , with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD . A computer system will use video @-@ analytic computer software , designed to detect potential threats , such as unattended bags , and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects . New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site . 
 Once the World Trade Center site is fully completed , the plaza will be completely opened to the public , as the original World Trade Center plaza was . The initial stage of the opening process began on Thursday , May 15 , 2014 , when the " Interim Operating Period " of the National September 11 Memorial ended . During this period , all visitors were required to undergo airport style security screening , as part of the " Interim Operating Period " , which was expected to end on December 31 , 2013 . However , screening did not fully end until the official dedication and opening of the museum on May 21 , 2014 , after which visitors were allowed to use the plaza without needing passes . 
 = = = = = Incidents = = = = = 
 In March 2014 , the tower was scaled by 16 @-@ year @-@ old New Jersey resident Justin <unk> , who entered the site through a hole in a fence . He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges . He allegedly dressed like a construction worker , sneaked in , and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower ’ s 88th floor , according to news sources . He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor , walked past a sleeping security guard , and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna , where he took pictures for two hours . The elevator operator was reassigned , and the guard was fired . It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower , which facilitated <unk> 's entry to the site . 
 Less than a week after the trespassing incident , four people — three male parachutists ( one of whom was a construction worker at the site ) and their lookout — were arrested for a BASE jump they conducted on September 30 , 2013 . They had posted a video of the jump online . As a result of these incidents , the Durst Organization 's head of security at One World Trade Center , David Velazquez , resigned on March 28 , 2014 . 
 = = = = Controversies = = = = 
 The social center of the previous One World Trade Center included a restaurant on the 107th floor , called Windows on the World , and The Greatest Bar on Earth ; these were tourist attractions in their own right , and a gathering spot for people who worked in the towers . This restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the United States , called " Windows on the World Wine School " , run by wine personality Kevin <unk> . Despite numerous assurances that these attractions would be rebuilt , the Port Authority scrapped plans to rebuild them , which has outraged some observers . 
 The fortified base of the tower has also been a source of controversy . Some critics , including Deroy Murdock of the National Review , have said that it is alienating and dull , and reflects a sense of fear rather than freedom , leading them to dub the building " the Fear Tower " . Nicolai <unk> , the architecture critic for The New York Times , calls the tower base a " grotesque attempt to disguise its underlying paranoia " . 
 = = = = Statue in front of the building = = = = 
 The America 's Response Monument , a life @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half scale bronze statue commemorating the actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces in the first few weeks of the War in Afghanistan , was unveiled to the public during the Veteran 's Day Parade in New York City on November 11 , 2011 . The statue was displayed on a float , which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street . It was dedicated that same day , in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant @-@ General John Mulholland , commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan . It was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby inside One World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero . 
 It is the first public monument to honor United States special forces ; there is also a monument commemorating the Green Berets on Meadows Memorial Field in Fort Bragg , North Carolina . 
 On October 19 , 2012 , the monument was rededicated in front of the tower . The inscription at base of the sculpture bears its name , " America 's Response Monument " , and the Latin subtitle De <unk> Liber . The subtitle , traditionally translated as " to free the oppressed " , is the motto of the Green Berets , who inspired the monument . A piece of steel from the original World Trade Center is embedded in the base . 
 The statue was dedicated by Lieutenant General John Mulholland , Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command . Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the dedication ceremony . The land on which the monument stands was donated by a private Wall Street firm . The statue cost over $ 750 @,@ 000 to make , but all the needed money was donated by hundreds of private citizens , including some survivors of the September 11 attacks . 
 = = = Owners and tenants = = = 
 One World Trade Center is principally owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . Around 5 percent equity of the building was sold to the Durst Organization , a private real estate company , in exchange for an investment of at least $ 100 million . The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building 's construction , and manages the building for the Port Authority , having responsibility for leasing , property management , and tenant installations . By September 2012 , around 55 percent of the building 's floor space had been leased , but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014 ; the amount of space leased had gone up to 62 @.@ 8 percent by November 2014 . 
 In 2006 , the State of New York agreed to a 15 @-@ year 415 @,@ 000 square feet ( 38 @,@ 600 m2 ) lease , with an option to extend the lease 's term and occupy up to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 square feet ( 90 @,@ 000 m2 ) . The General Services Administration ( GSA ) initially agreed to a lease of around 645 @,@ 000 square feet ( 59 @,@ 900 m2 ) , and New York State 's Office of General Services ( <unk> ) planned to occupy around 412 @,@ 000 square feet ( 38 @,@ 300 m2 ) . However , the GSA ceded most of its floor space to the Port Authority in July 2011 , and the <unk> withdrew from the lease contract . In April 2008 , the Port Authority announced that it was seeking a bidder to operate the 18 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 1 @,@ 700 m2 ) observation deck on the tower 's 102nd floor ; in 2013 , Legends Hospitality Management agreed to operate the observatory in a 15 @-@ year , $ 875 million contract . 
 The building 's first lease , a joint project between the Port Authority and Beijing @-@ based Vantone Industrial , was announced on March 28 , 2009 . A 190 @,@ 810 sq ft ( 17 @,@ 727 m2 ) " China Center " , combining business and cultural facilities , is planned between floors 64 and 69 ; it is intended to represent Chinese business and cultural links to the United States , and to serve American companies that wish to conduct business in China . Vantone Industrial 's lease is for 20 years and 9 months . In April 2011 , a new interior design for the China Center was unveiled , featuring a vertical " Folding Garden " , based on a proposal by the Chinese artist Zhou Wei . 
 On August 3 , 2010 , Condé Nast Publications signed a tentative agreement to move the headquarters and offices for its magazines into One World Trade Center , occupying up to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 square feet ( 90 @,@ 000 m2 ) of floor space . On May 17 , 2011 , Condé Nast reached a final agreement with the Port Authority , securing a 25 @-@ year lease with an estimated value of $ 2 billion . On May 25 , 2011 , Condé Nast finalized the lease contract , obtaining 1 @,@ 008 @,@ 012 square feet ( 93 @,@ 647 @.@ 4 m2 ) of office space between floors 20 – 41 . The lease also includes 30 @,@ 000 square feet ( 2 @,@ 800 m2 ) of usable space in the podium and below grade floors , for mail , messenger services , and storage use . On January 17 , 2012 , it was reported that Condé Nast would be leasing an additional 133 @,@ 000 square feet ( 10 @,@ 000 m2 ) of space , occupying floors 42 through 44 . Conde Nast moved in on November 3 , 2014 . 
 However , some leases had failed . In January 2012 , Chadbourne & Parke , a Midtown Manhattan @-@ based law firm , was to sign a 300 @,@ 000 square feet ( 30 @,@ 000 m2 ) lease contract , but after negotiations broke down , the deal was abruptly canceled in March .

 = = = = Developer = = = = 
 Larry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties , the leaseholder and developer of the complex , retains control of the surrounding buildings , while the Port Authority has full control of the tower itself . Silverstein signed a 99 @-@ year lease for the World Trade Center site in July 2001 , and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site 's redevelopment process . 
 Before construction of the new tower began , Silverstein was involved in an insurance dispute regarding the tower . The terms of the lease agreement signed in 2001 , for which Silverstein paid $ 14 million , gave Silverstein , as leaseholder , the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed . After the September 11 attacks , there were a series of disputes between Silverstein and insurance companies concerning the insurance policies that covered the original towers ; this resulted in the construction of One World Trade Center being delayed . After a trial resulted , a verdict was given on April 29 , 2004 . The verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the " one occurrence " interpretation , so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies . Three insurers were added to the second trial group . At that time , the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer , Swiss Reinsurance , but it did so several days later on May 3 , 2004 , finding that this company was also subject to the " one occurrence " interpretation . Silverstein appealed the Swiss Reinsurance decision , but the appeal failed on October 19 , 2006 . The second trial resulted in a verdict on December 6 , 2004 . The jury determined that nine insurers were subject to the " two occurrences " interpretation , referring to the fact that two different planes had destroyed the towers during the September 11 attacks . They were therefore liable for a maximum of double the face value of those particular policies ( $ 2 @.@ 2 billion ) . The highest potential payout was $ 4 @.@ 577 billion , for buildings 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 . 
 In March 2007 , Silverstein appeared at a rally of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference . He highlighted what he describes as the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $ 800 million in claims related to the attacks . Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is a cause for concern .

 David Childs , one of Silverstein 's favorite architects , joined the project after Silverstein urged him to do so . He developed a design proposal for One World Trade Center , initially collaborating with Daniel Libeskind . In May 2005 , Childs revised the design to address security concerns . He is the architect of the tower , and is responsible for overseeing its day @-@ to @-@ day design and development . 
 Architect Daniel Libeskind won the invitational competition to develop a plan for the new tower in 2002 . He gave an initial proposal , which he called " Memory Foundations " , for the design of One World Trade Center . His design included aerial gardens , windmills , and off @-@ center spire . Libeskind later denied a request to place the tower in a more rentable location next to the PATH station . He instead placed it another block west , as it would then line up with , and resemble , the Statue of Liberty . Most of Libeskind 's original designs were later scrapped , and other architects were chosen to design the other WTC buildings . However , one element of Libeskind 's initial plan was included in the final design – the tower 's symbolic height of 1 @,@ 776 feet ( 541 m ) . 
 Daniel R. Tishman – along with his father John Tishman , builder of the original World Trade Center – led the construction team from Tishman Realty & Construction , the selected builder for One World Trade Center . 
 Douglas and Jody Durst , the co @-@ presidents of the Durst Organization , a real estate development company , won the right to invest at least $ 100 million in the project on July 7 , 2010 . 
 In August 2010 , Condé Nast , a long @-@ time Durst tenant , confirmed a tentative deal to move into 1 World Trade Center , and finalized the deal on May 26 , 2011 . The contract negotiated between the Port Authority and the Durst Organization specifies that the Durst Organization will receive a $ 15 million fee , and a percentage of " base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project " . The specifics of the signed contract give Durst 75 percent of savings up to $ 24 million , stepping down to 50 , 25 , and 15 percent as savings increase . Since Durst joined the project , significant changes have been made to the building , including the 185 foot base of the tower , the spire , and the plaza to the west of the building , facing the Hudson River . The Port Authority has approved all the revisions .

 A <unk> Films short @-@ subject documentary entitled How does it feel to work on One World Trade Center ? was uploaded to YouTube on August 31 , 2010 . It depicted construction workers who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site .

 The Reputation was an indie rock band from Chicago , Illinois . The band was fronted by former Sarge singer @-@ songwriter Elizabeth Elmore , with other positions filled by various members . 
 The band , which formed while Elmore was attending law school , released two albums between the years of 2001 and 2006 , both of which were met with generally positive reviews . The band has toured the United States and the United Kingdom . 
 = = History = = 
 Following the disbanding of her old band , Sarge , Elmore enrolled in law school at Northwestern University . She embarked on a series of solo tours between classes , but after growing tired of performing solo Elmore recruited ex @-@ Sarge drummer Russ Horvath and ex @-@ Chisel bassist and law school classmate Chris <unk> to tour with . The group toured together and recorded a five song demo , but after a while Horvath and <unk> were no longer able to tour due to schooling . Elmore recruited friend and ex @-@ Moreno guitarist Sean Hulet , ex @-@ Moreno drummer Scott Rosenquist , and ex @-@ <unk> bassist Joel Root . The new group completed a tour of the East Coast . 
 Elmore requested a leave of absence from Northwestern Law School in 2001 to focus on the band . After ex @-@ <unk> drummer Ben Kane replaced the unavailable Rosenquist , the group signed to Initial Records . Kane left the band , and former Sarge drummer Chad Romanski joined the group after several weeks of Elmore begging . The band completed a fall West Coast tour and began recording their debut album with Romanski . The band took on the name The Reputation at this time . 
 = = = Self @-@ titled debut = = = 
 The Reputation , the band 's self @-@ titled debut album , was released in 2002 after the band spent much of the fall and winter of 2001 in the recording studio . The majority of the album was recorded in Chicago at Atlas , with the exception of a cover of Elvis Costello 's song " Almost Blue , " which was recorded with then @-@ Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett on piano and production duties , as well as extra arrangements and recording on other tracks . Elmore , as she did with her work in Sarge , wrote all of the original songs and lyrics , and assisted with the production along with Matt Allison . 
 The album was well received critically . The Los Angeles Times gave the album 3 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars , with reviewer Kevin Bronson saying that " [ Elmore 's ] streaming anecdotes give the listener the feeling of walking right into the middle of life @-@ altering events . " The College Music Journal 's Amy Wan called the album a " showcase for Elmore 's powerfully biting lyrics and her passionate voice , dancing deftly between little @-@ girl sweet and outright roar , " and The Village Voice gave the album an A- , with famed music journalist Robert Christgau praising the debut , saying that " Elmore left a great band to go to law school . Now she leaves a great law school to start a better band . " 
 Along with the positive feedback for the album , the band was able to secure its first permanent drummer in Matt Espy . The band would tour the United States and parts of Canada a number of times following the release of the album . Along with the performance agenda in 2003 , Elmore balanced touring , songwriting for their next album , and a return to law school while the band suffered the loss of yet another drummer , as Espy was forced to leave after a tenure of nearly a year and a half for personal reasons . 
 = = = To Force a Fate = = = 
 The band settled on their second permanent drummer , Steve Van Horn , shortly after Espy left following their round of touring . At the same time , the band began negotiations with Lookout ! Records to release their follow @-@ up . After a marathon run of shows and songwriting toward the end of 2003 , the band recorded their second album . The sessions were difficult , with 14 @-@ hour recording days being balanced with Elmore attempting to finish remaining law school papers , combined with weekend tour jaunts to the East Coast . The album was unique compared to other Elmore projects in that other members of the band assisted in the songwriting process . 
 To Force a Fate was ultimately released in April 2004 on Lookout ! Records . The album received generally positive press , including favorable reviews in Spin Magazine , calling the album " a bang of power pop epiphany . " Blender Magazine gave the album four stars , stating that " Elizabeth Elmore , a law @-@ school graduate with boy trouble to match her student loans , writes songs that are as much legal briefs as diary entries . " Entertainment Weekly called the album " muscular yet lush , " and gave the album a B + . The album would eventually reach No. 58 on the CMJ charts .

 The band spent 2004 and 2005 touring the United States for over nine months , including opening slots for Ted Leo and the Pharmacists and Grammy nominees The Killers , Modest Mouse , Death Cab for Cutie , and the Donnas . The band 's performance at South by Southwest in particular was covered positively in Entertainment Weekly . 
 2005 took the band overseas to tour the United Kingdom for the first time , as well as two separate two @-@ month United States tours . In June 2005 , bassist Joel Root left the band for personal reasons . They completed their summer tour with Stereo South bassist Greg <unk> , and planned to record a new album in 2006 , but came to a halt due to mitigating factors , including the issues with Lookout ! Records . In September 2005 , the band performed at North East Sticks Together . Elmore , in November 2006 , posted a message to the band 's official mailing list noting that the band had dissolved and no further plans had been announced . Drummer Steve Van Horn has joined former Chicagoan and current Austin , TX based singer / songwriter Che Arthur 's touring band .

 The Reputation 's music is influenced by that of Elmore 's previous band , Sarge . The band also drew comparisons to the Fastbacks , Liz Phair , Neil Young , and Elvis Costello , the last of which the band covered with their version of the song " Almost Blue " . Elmore drew influence from a wide variety of music , including post @-@ hardcore , alternative country , 1970s singer @-@ songwriters , indie rock , classical music , country music , bluegrass , and 1980s pop music . While the band 's first album used conventional punk rock instruments , To Force a Fate included more diverse instruments such as piano , strings , and horns . According to a review in Allmusic , To Force a Fate 's contains " thoughtful songwriting and dashes of indie rock <unk> " . 
 The subjects of the band 's songs are frequently related to Elmore 's relationships . She stated " as far as I can tell , I am too brutally honest and opinionated for most people . "

 = = Plot = = 
 One Sunday afternoon , Hibiki Kuze and Daichi Shijima receive macabre videos from the Nicaea website which predict their deaths mere seconds before they are involved in a gruesome train accident . They are spared however , when a Demon Summoning App installs itself on their phones and allows the duo and schoolmate Io Nitta to escape from carnivorous monsters feasting on the dead in the wrecked subway station . The trio are shocked to discover a massive catastrophe on the surface and take refuge in Roppongi with other panicked citizens . Suddenly , when a creature known as <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) appears and attacks the crowd , Hibiki puts a stop to the carnage by summoning a demon from the app and destroying the creature . This prompts the Japan Meteorological Agency , Geomagnetism Research Department - JP 's to detain Hibiki and his friends and they are brought before its head — Yamato Hotsuin , who enlists their aid in defeating the remaining Septentriones to prevent the end of the world in one week . 
 Yamato then dispatches them on a mission to retrieve the JP 's scientist Fumi Kanno with fellow demon summoners Hinako <unk> and Keita <unk> , which ends up as a success at the cost of Keita 's life . Following a devastating battle with Merak ( <unk> , <unk> ) , Hibiki joins the Resistance leader — Ronaldo <unk> and learns of Yamato 's true intentions as opposed to his own .

While a somber Hibiki struggles to cope with the steep cost of victory , Alcor reveals the true nature of events thus far . He explains it all to be the will of an entity known as Polaris ( <unk> , <unk> ) as it seeks to erase humanity 's " artificial " reality using its Void phenomenon and hence restore the " natural " order . Therefore , it sent the Septentriones to destroy the spiritual barriers protecting Japan from the Void . When Hinako and Airi defeat <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) the next day , its massive shell plummets from orbit and crushes the city — killing thousands more people and sparking outrage from Hibiki over the lengths Yamato will go to achieve his goal .

However , when the demon possesses Io and attempts to kill Yamato for its imprisonment , Hibiki wields the Dragon Stream and saves Io . 
 As the week draws to a close , <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) appears on Saturday and completely destroys the barriers . Upon engaging the creature , Yamato allows the other summoners to die by ignoring them in the battle and ultimately defeats it with Hibiki and Daichi 's help . In the aftermath , Alcor decides to support Hibiki and Yamato ends up killing him . Finally , Yamato activates the Transport Terminal to seek an audience with Polaris and Io and Daichi forfeit their lives to give Hibiki a chance at going after Yamato and saving the world .

 A seasonal review column on the Anime News Network called The Stream generally made light remarks of the first four episodes . Written by Bamboo Dong , the editor called the series mindlessly fun ; jokingly citing how the cell phones are always pointed directly at the demons as if they would be incapable of fighting if it were otherwise . Dong also likened the series as watching someone else play the video game . The designs of the various demons and Septentriones were described as the most interesting part of the series . On the other hand , the editor described the immense amount of [ video game ] plot packed into the next batch of four episodes as messy . Dong also referred to the central premise as being pretty dark since it involved the main characters constantly receiving videos showing exactly how their friends would die . The editor gave the series props for not dabbling in the destruction porn taking place since all of the widespread death around Japan is implied , but added that showing some of it would have aided the realism of the story . After reviewing twelve episodes Dong was not able to develop any interest in the characters . This continued into the series finale and Dong still felt that the characters were not fleshed out as much as they could have been . Dong explained that since there was basically no time to explore how the characters reacted to a disappearing world , it was essentially dehumanizing to such an extent that their deaths carried no emotional weight . Dong presented a full series review in their Shelf Life column and expressed that viewers who like brawn , action and some emotion will enjoy the series as long as they can come to terms with the fact that they 'll pretty much just be watching someone play a video game for several hours . 
 The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide written by Rebecca Silverman , also of the Anime News Network , expressed differing sentiments than that of Dong . Silverman was quick to mention that she had not previously played the game to which the series was based on . With that being said , she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play . She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive . She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s . In her full series review , Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used . Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong , Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down . She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise . On the other hand , Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change . 
 After seven episodes , Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku disliked the series so much that he discouraged viewers from watching it for that particular season . He supported this by stating that the premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that the adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored . Eisenbeis shared sentiments with the Anime News Network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called the " woefully underdeveloped " characters of Devil Survivor 2 who are only given rudimentary back @-@ stories . This had the added effect of making it nearly impossible to figure out who exactly is a one @-@ off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to the threat of death . Eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to the viewing tension . Eisenbeis went on to write that the other characters were contrast to the main villain ( or antihero ) Yamato Hotsuin since he gets so much development that much of the series ' runtime is spent on his backstory and goals than all the other characters combined . This helps give an in @-@ depth understanding of the character and simultaneously made him an excellent villain . 
 The UK Anime Network had Andy Hanley review the first four episodes and he expressed a much more positive outlook than previous reviewers . Hanley wrote about how fast the series was in setting up its premise and described it as an in at the deep end experience . Hanley cited the ruination of Tokyo at the end of the first episode and the countless deaths that occur by episode four to support this . Hanley argued that while this pace leaves the series open to being labelled as shallow , it 's actually very effective in keeping the viewer engaged .

 = Israeli cuisine = 
 Israeli cuisine ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> ha @-@ <unk> ha @-@ <unk> ’ <unk> ) comprises local dishes by people native to Israel and dishes brought to Israel by Jews from the Diaspora . Since before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 , and particularly since the late 1970s , an Israeli Jewish fusion cuisine has developed . 
 Israeli cuisine has adopted , and continues to adapt , elements of various styles of Jewish cuisine , particularly the Mizrahi , Sephardic and Ashkenazi styles of cooking . It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in Levantine , Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines , and foods such as falafel , hummus , <unk> , shakshouka , couscous , and za 'atar are now widely popular in Israel . 
 Other influences on the cuisine are the availability of foods common to the Mediterranean region , especially certain kinds of fruits and vegetables , dairy products and fish ; the distinctive traditional dishes prepared at holiday times ; the tradition of keeping kosher ; and food customs specific to Shabbat and different Jewish holidays , such as challah , jachnun , <unk> , gefilte fish , hamin and sufganiyot . 
 New dishes based on agricultural products such as oranges , avocados , dairy products and fish , and others based on world trends have been introduced over the years , and chefs trained abroad have brought in elements of other international cuisines . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Israel ’ s culinary traditions comprise foods and cooking methods that span three thousand years of history . Over that time , these traditions have been shaped by influences from Asia , Africa and Europe , and religious and ethnic influences have resulted in a culinary melting pot . Biblical and archaeological records provide insight into the culinary life of the region as far back as 968 BCE , in the days of the kings of ancient Israel . 
 During the Second Temple period ( 516 BCE to 70 CE ) , Hellenistic and Roman culture heavily influenced cuisine , particularly of the priests and aristocracy of Jerusalem . Elaborate meals were served that included piquant entrées and alcoholic drinks , fish , meat , pickled and fresh vegetables , olives , and tart or sweet fruits . 
 The food of the ancient Israelites was based on several products that still play important roles in modern Israeli cuisine . These were known as the seven species : olives , figs , dates , pomegranates , wheat , barley and grapes . The diet , based on locally grown produce , was enhanced by imported spices , readily available due to the country ’ s position at the crossroads of east @-@ west trade routes . 
 After the destruction of the Second Temple and the exile of the majority of Jews from the land of Israel , Jewish cuisine continued to develop in the many countries where Jewish communities have existed since Late Antiquity , influenced by the economics , agriculture , and culinary traditions of those countries . 
 = = = Old Yishuv = = = 
 The Jewish community that lived in Ottoman Syria prior to Zionist immigration that began in 1881 was known as the Old Yishuv . The cooking style of the community was Sephardi cuisine , which developed among the Jews of Spain before their expulsion in 1492 , and in the areas to which they migrated thereafter , particularly the Balkans and Ottoman Empire . Sephardim also established communities in the Old Yishuv . Particularly in Jerusalem , they continued to develop their culinary style , influenced by Ottoman cuisine , creating a style that became known as Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine . This cuisine included pies like <unk> , pastels and <unk> , vegetable <unk> and stuffed vegetables , and rice and bulgur <unk> , which are now considered to be Jerusalem classics . 
 Groups of Hasidic Jews from Eastern Europe began establishing communities in the late 18th century , and brought with them their traditional Ashkenazi cuisine , developing , however , distinct local variations , notably a peppery , caramelized noodle pudding known as kugel yerushalmi . 
 Beginning with the First Aliyah in 1881 , Jews began immigrating to the area from Eastern Europe in larger numbers , particularly from Poland and Russia . These Zionist pioneers were motivated both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles they had grown up with , and adapt by using local produce , especially vegetables such as zucchini , peppers , eggplant , artichoke and chickpeas . The first Hebrew cookbook , written by Erna Meyer , and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women 's International Zionist Organization ( <unk> ) , exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking . The bread , olives , cheese and raw vegetables they adopted became the basis for the kibbutz breakfast , which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels , and in various forms in most Israeli homes today . 
 = = = Early years of the State = = = 
 The State of Israel faced enormous military and economic challenges in its early years , and the period from 1948 to 1958 was a time of food rationing and austerity , known as <unk> . In this decade , over one million Jewish immigrants , mainly from Arab countries , but also including European Holocaust survivors , inundated the new state . They arrived when only basic foods were available and ethnic dishes had to be modified with a range of mock or simulated foods , such as chopped “ liver ” from eggplant , and turkey as a substitute for veal schnitzel for Ashkenazim , <unk> made from frozen fish instead of ground meat for Iraqi Jews , and turkey in place of the lamb kebabs of the Mizrahi Jews . These adaptations remain as a legacy of that time . 
 Substitutes , such as the wheat @-@ based rice substitute , ptitim , were introduced , and versatile vegetables such as eggplant were used as alternatives to meat . Additional flavor and nutrition was provided from inexpensive canned tomato paste and puree , hummus , tahina , and mayonnaise in tubes . Meat was scarce , and it was not until the late 1950s that herds of beef cattle were introduced into the agricultural economy . 
 <unk> , a local variety of the mallow plant , became an important food source during the War of Independence . During the siege of Jerusalem , when convoys of food could not reach the city , <unk> went out to the fields to pick khubeza leaves , which are high in iron and vitamins . The Jerusalem radio station , Kol <unk> , broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand . In the past decade , food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day . Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants . The dish from the Independence war is called <unk> <unk> and still eaten by Israelis today . 
 = = = Impact of immigration = = = 
 Immigrants to Israel have incorporated elements of the cuisines of the cultures and countries whence they came . During approximately fifty years before 1948 , there were successive waves of Jewish immigration , which brought with them a whole range of foods and cooking styles . Immigrants arriving from central Europe brought foods such as schnitzel and <unk> , while Russian Jews brought borsht and herring dishes , such as schmaltz herring and <unk> ( <unk> herring ) . 
 Ashkenazi dishes include chicken soup , schnitzel , <unk> , chopped liver , gefilte fish , <unk> , <unk> and kugel . The first Israeli <unk> were opened by Ashkenazi Jews , who popularized cakes and pastries from central and Eastern Europe , such as yeast cakes ( <unk> ) , nut spirals ( <unk> ) , chocolate rolls and layered pastries . 
 After 1948 , the greatest impact came from the large migration of Jews from Turkey , Iraq , Kurdistan and Yemen , and Mizrahi Jews from North Africa , particularly Morocco . Typically , the staff of army kitchens , schools , hospitals , hotels and restaurant kitchens has consisted of Mizrahi , Kurdish and Yemenite Jews , and this has had an influence on the cooking fashions and ingredients of the country . 
 Mizrahi cuisine , the cuisine of Jews from North Africa , features grilled meats , sweet and savory puff pastries , rice dishes , stuffed vegetables , pita breads and salads , and shares many similarities with Arab cuisine . Other North African dishes popular in Israel include couscous , shakshouka , <unk> , carrot salad and <unk> ( slices of fish cooked in a spicy tomato sauce ) . Sephardic dishes , with Balkan and Turkish influences incorporated in Israeli cuisine include <unk> , yogurt and <unk> . Yemenite Jewish foods include jachnun , <unk> , skhug and <unk> . Iraqi dishes popular in Israel include amba , various types of kubba , stuffed vegetables ( <unk> ) , kebab , sambusac , <unk> and pickled vegetables ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Modern trends = = = 
 As Israeli agriculture developed and new kinds of fruits and vegetables appeared on the market , cooks and chefs began to experiment and devise new dishes with them . 
 They also began using " biblical " ingredients such as honey , figs , and pomegranates , and indigenous foods such as prickly pears ( <unk> ) and chickpeas . Since the late 1970s , there has been an increased interest in international cuisine , cooking with wine and herbs , and vegetarianism . A more sophisticated food culture in Israel began to develop when cookbooks , such as “ From the Kitchen with Love ” by Ruth <unk> , published in 1974 , introduced international cooking trends , and together with the opening of restaurants serving cuisines such as Chinese , Italian and French , encouraged more dining out . 
 The 1980s were a formative decade : the increased optimism after the signing of the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 , the economic recovery of the mid @-@ 1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine . In addition , high quality , locally produced ingredients became increasingly available . For example , privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat , sheep and cow ’ s milk , which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public . In 1983 , the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world @-@ class , semi @-@ dry and dry wines . New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil . The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish , and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit , vegetables and herbs . 
 Ethnic heritage cooking , both Sephardic and Ashkenazi , has made a comeback with the growing acceptance of the heterogeneous society . Apart from home cooking , many ethnic foods are now available in street markets , supermarkets and restaurants , or are served at weddings and bar mitzvahs , and people increasingly eat foods from ethnic backgrounds other than their own . Overlap and combinations of foods from different ethnic groups is becoming standard as a multi @-@ ethnic food culture develops . 
 The 1990s saw an increasing interest in international cuisines . Sushi , in particular , has taken hold as a popular style for eating out and as an entrée for events . In restaurants , fusion cuisine , with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread . In the 2000s , the trend of “ eating healthy ” with an emphasis on organic and whole grain foods has become prominent , and medical research has led many Israelis to re @-@ embrace the Mediterranean diet , with its touted health benefits . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Geography has a large influence on Israel cuisine , and foods common in the Mediterranean region , such as olives , wheat , chickpeas , dairy products , fish , and vegetables such as tomatoes , eggplants , and zucchini are prominent in Israeli cuisine . Fresh fruits and vegetables are plentiful in Israel and are cooked and served in many ways . 
 There are various climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow a variety of products to be grown . Citrus trees such as orange , lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain . Figs , pomegranates and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas . The subtropical climate near the Sea of Galilee and in the Jordan River Valley is suitable for mangoes , kiwis and bananas , while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan is suitable for grapes , apples and cherries . 
 Israeli eating customs also conform to the wider Mediterranean region , with lunch , rather than dinner , being the focal meal of a regular workday . “ Kibbutz foods ” have been adopted by many Israelis for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts , and may consist of various types of cheeses , both soft and hard , yogurt , <unk> and sour cream , vegetables and salads , olives , hard @-@ boiled eggs or <unk> , pickled and smoked herring , a variety of breads , and fresh orange juice and coffee . 
 In addition , Jewish holidays influence the cuisine , with the preparation of traditional foods at holiday times , such as various types of challah ( braided bread ) for <unk> and Festivals , jelly doughnuts ( sufganiyot ) for Hanukah , the <unk> pastry ( <unk> <unk> ) for Purim , <unk> , a type of fruit paste , for Passover , and dairy foods for Shavuot . The Shabbat dinner , eaten on Friday , and to a lesser extent the Shabbat lunch , is a significant meal in Israeli homes , together with holiday meals . 
 Although not all Jews in Israel keep kosher , the tradition of kashrut strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes , public institutions and many restaurants , including the separation of milk and meat and avoiding the use of non @-@ kosher foods , especially pork and shellfish . During Passover , bread and other leavened foods are prohibited to observant Jews and <unk> and leaven @-@ free foods are substituted .

These include cheeses and yogurts , cheese @-@ based pies and quiches called <unk> , cheese <unk> , and cheesecake prepared with soft white cheese ( <unk> <unk> ) or cream cheese . 
 = Chariot racing = 
 Chariot racing ( Greek : <unk> <unk> , Latin : ludi circenses ) was one of the most popular ancient Greek , Roman , and Byzantine sports . Chariot racing was dangerous to both drivers and horses as they often suffered serious injury and even death , but these dangers added to the excitement and interest for spectators . Chariot races could be watched by women , who were barred from watching many other sports . In the Roman form of chariot racing , teams represented different groups of financial backers and sometimes competed for the services of particularly skilled drivers . As in modern sports like soccer , spectators generally chose to support a single team , identifying themselves strongly with its fortunes , and violence sometimes broke out between rival factions . The rivalries were sometimes politicized , when teams became associated with competing social or religious ideas . This helps explain why Roman and later Byzantine emperors took control of the teams and appointed many officials to oversee them . 
 The sport faded in importance after the fall of Rome in the West , surviving only for a time in the Byzantine Empire , where the traditional Roman factions continued to play a prominent role for some time , gaining influence in political matters . Their rivalry culminated in the Nika riots , which marked the gradual decline of the sport .

 = = = Early chariot racing = = = 
 It is unknown exactly when chariot racing began , but it may have been as old as chariots themselves . It is known from artistic evidence on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world , but the first literary reference to a chariot race is one described by Homer , at the funeral games of Patroclus . The participants in this race were Diomedes , <unk> , <unk> , Menelaus , and Meriones . The race , which was one lap around the stump of a tree , was won by Diomedes , who received a slave woman and a cauldron as his prize . A chariot race also was said to be the event that founded the Olympic Games ; according to one legend , mentioned by Pindar , King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race , but was defeated by Pelops , who founded the Games in honour of his victory . 
 = = = Olympic Games = = = 
 In the ancient Olympic Games , as well as the other Panhellenic Games , there were both four @-@ horse ( <unk> , Greek : <unk> ) and two @-@ horse ( <unk> , Greek : <unk> ) chariot races , which were essentially the same aside from the number of horses . The chariot racing event was first added to the Olympics in 680 BC with the games expanding from a one @-@ day to a two @-@ day event to accommodate the new event ( but was not , in reality , the founding event ) . The chariot race was not so prestigious as the foot race of 195 meters ( stadion , Greek : <unk> ) , but it was more important than other equestrian events such as racing on horseback , which were dropped from the Olympic Games very early on . 
 The races themselves were held in the hippodrome , which held both chariot races and riding races . The single horse race was known as the " <unk> " ( <unk> , Greek : <unk> ) . The hippodrome was situated at the south @-@ east corner of the sanctuary of Olympia , on the large flat area south of the stadium and ran almost parallel to the latter . Until recently , its exact location was unknown , since it is buried by several meters of sedimentary material from the <unk> River . In 2008 , however , Annie Muller and staff of the German Archeological Institute used radar to locate a large , rectangular structure similar to Pausanias 's description . Pausanias , who visited Olympia in the second century AD , describes the monument as a large , elongated , flat space , approximately 780 meters long and 320 meters wide ( four stadia long and one <unk> <unk> wide ) . The elongated racecourse was divided longitudinally into two tracks by a stone or wooden barrier , the <unk> . All the horses or chariots ran on one track toward the east , then turned around the <unk> and headed back west . Distances varied according to the event . The racecourse was surrounded by natural ( to the north ) and artificial ( to the south and east ) banks for the spectators ; a special place was reserved for the judges on the west side of the north bank . 
 The race was begun by a procession into the hippodrome , while a herald announced the names of the drivers and owners . The <unk> consisted of twelve laps around the hippodrome , with sharp turns around the posts at either end . Various mechanical devices were used , including the starting gates ( <unk> , Greek : <unk> ; singular : hysplex , Greek : <unk> ) which were lowered to start the race . According to Pausanias , these were invented by the architect <unk> , and staggered so that the chariots on the outside began the race earlier than those on the inside . The race did not begin properly until the final gate was opened , at which point each chariot would be more or less lined up alongside each other , although the ones that had started on the outside would have been traveling faster than the ones in the middle . Other mechanical devices known as the " eagle " and the " dolphin " were raised to signify that the race had begun , and were lowered as the race went on to signify the number of laps remaining . These were probably bronze carvings of those animals , set up on posts at the starting line . 
 In most cases , the owner and the driver of the chariot were different persons . In 416 BC , the Athenian general Alcibiades had seven chariots in the race , and came in first , second , and fourth ; obviously , he could not have been racing all seven chariots himself . Philip II of Macedon also won an Olympic chariot race in an attempt to prove he was not a barbarian , although if he had driven the chariot himself he would likely have been considered even lower than a barbarian . The poet Pindar did praise the courage of <unk> of Thebes , however , for driving his own chariot . This rule also meant that women could win the race through ownership , despite the fact that women were not allowed to participate in or even watch the Games . This happened rarely , but a notable example is the Spartan <unk> , daughter of Archidamus II , who won the chariot race twice . Chariot racing was a way for Greeks to demonstrate their prosperity at the games . The case of Alcibiades indicates also that chariot racing was an alternative route to public exposure and fame for the wealthy . 
 The charioteer was usually a family member of the owner of the chariot or , in most cases , a slave or a hired professional . Driving a racing chariot required unusual strength , skill , and courage . Yet , we know the names of very few charioteers , and victory songs and statues regularly contrive to leave them out of account . Unlike the other Olympic events , charioteers did not perform in the nude , probably for safety reasons because of the dust kicked up by the horses and chariots , and the likelihood of bloody crashes . Racers wore a sleeved garment called a <unk> . It fell to the ankles and was fastened high at the waist with a plain belt . Two straps that crossed high at the upper back prevented the <unk> from " ballooning " during the race . 
 The chariots themselves were modified war chariots , essentially wooden carts with two wheels and an open back , although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle . The charioteer 's feet were held in place , but the cart rested on the axle , so the ride was bumpy . The most exciting part of the chariot race , at least for the spectators , was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome . These turns were very dangerous and often deadly . If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn , it might be overturned or crushed ( along with the horses and driver ) by the other chariots as they went around the post . Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal , but nothing could be done about it ( at Patroclus ' funeral games , <unk> in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way , ) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway . 
 = = = Other festivals = = = 
 As a result of the rise of the Greek cities of the classic period , other great festivals emerged in Asia Minor , Magna Graecia , and the mainland providing the opportunity for athletes to gain fame and riches . Apart from the Olympics , the best respected were the Isthmian Games in Corinth , the Nemean Games , the Pythian Games in Delphi , and the Panathenaic Games in Athens , where the winner of the four @-@ horse chariot race was given 140 amphorae of olive oil ( much sought after and precious in ancient times ) . Prizes at other competitions included corn in Eleusis , bronze shields in Argos , and silver vessels in Marathon . Another form of chariot racing at the Panathenaic Games was known as the apobatai , in which the contestant wore armor and periodically leapt off a moving chariot and ran alongside it before leaping back on again . In these races , there was a second charioteer ( a " rein @-@ holder " ) while the <unk> jumped out ; in the catalogues with the winners both the names of the <unk> and of the rein @-@ holder are mentioned . Images of this contest show warriors , armed with helmets and shields , perched on the back of their racing chariots . Some scholars believe that the event preserved traditions of Homeric warfare . 
 = = Roman era = = 
 The Romans probably borrowed chariot racing from the Etruscans as well as the racing tracks , who themselves borrowed it from the Greeks , but the Romans were also influenced directly by the Greeks . According to Roman legend , chariot racing was used by Romulus just after he founded Rome in 753 BC as a way of distracting the Sabine men . Romulus sent out invitations to the neighbouring towns to celebrate the festival of the <unk> , which included both horse races and chariot races . Whilst the Sabines were enjoying the spectacle , Romulus and his men seized and carried off the Sabine women , who became wives of the Romans . Chariot races were a part of several Roman religious festivals , and on these occasions were preceded by a parade ( <unk> <unk> ) that featured the charioteers , music , costumed dancers , and images of the gods . While the entertainment value of chariot races tended to overshadow any sacred purpose , in late antiquity the Church Fathers still saw them as a traditional " pagan " practice , and advised Christians not to participate . 
 In ancient Rome , chariot races commonly took place in a circus . The main centre of chariot racing was the Circus Maximus in the valley between Palatine Hill and Aventine Hill , which could seat 250 @,@ 000 people . It was the earliest circus in the city of Rome . The Circus was supposed to date to the city 's earliest times , but it was rebuilt by Julius Caesar around 50 BC so that it had a length of about 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) and a width of about 125 metres ( 410 ft ) . One end of the track was more open than the other , as this was where the chariots lined up to begin the race . The Romans used a series of gates known as carceres , an equivalent to the Greek hysplex . These were staggered in the same way as the hysplex , but they were slightly different because Roman racing tracks also had a median ( the spina ) in the centre of the track . The carceres took up the angled end of the track , and the chariots were loaded into spring @-@ loaded gates . When the chariots were ready , the emperor ( or whoever was hosting the races , if they were not in Rome ) dropped a cloth known as a <unk> , signalling the beginning of the race . The gates would spring open , creating a perfectly fair beginning for all participants . 
 Once the race had begun , the chariots could move in front of each other in an attempt to cause their opponents to crash into the spinae ( singular spina ) . On the top of the spinae stood small tables or frames supported on pillars , and also small pieces of marble in the shape of eggs or dolphins . The spina eventually became very elaborate , with statues and obelisks and other forms of art , but the multiplication of the adornments of the spina had one unfortunate result : They became so numerous that they obstructed the view of spectators on lower seats . At either end of the spina was a meta , or turning point , in the form of large gilded columns . Spectacular crashes took place there , as in the Greek races , in which the chariot was destroyed and the charioteer and horses incapacitated were known as <unk> , also the Latin word for shipwrecks . 
 The race itself was much like its Greek counterpart , although there were usually 24 races every day that , during the fourth century , took place on 66 days each year . However , a race consisted of only 7 laps ( and later 5 laps , so that there could be even more races per day ) , instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race . The Roman style was also more money @-@ oriented ; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators . There were four @-@ horse chariots ( <unk> ) and two @-@ horse chariots ( <unk> ) , but the four @-@ horse races were more important . In rare cases , if a driver wanted to show off his skill , he could use up to 10 horses , although this was extremely impractical . 
 The technique and clothing of Roman charioteers differed significantly from those used by the Greeks . Roman drivers wrapped the reins round their waist , while the Greeks held the reins in their hands . Because of this , the Romans could not let go of the reins in a crash , so they would be dragged around the circus until they were killed or they freed themselves . In order to cut the reins and keep from being dragged in case of accident , they carried a falx , a curved knife . They also wore helmets and other protective gear . In any given race , there might be a number of teams put up by each faction , who would cooperate to maximize their chances of victory by ganging up on opponents , forcing them out of the preferred inside track or making them lose concentration and expose themselves to accident and injury . Spectators could also play a part as there is evidence they threw lead " curse " amulets studded with nails at teams opposing their favourite . 
 Another important difference was that the charioteers themselves , the <unk> , were considered to be the winners , although they were usually also slaves ( as in the Greek world ) . They received a wreath of laurel leaves , and probably some money ; if they won enough races they could buy their freedom . Drivers could become celebrities throughout the Empire simply by surviving , as the life expectancy of a charioteer was not very high . One such celebrity driver was <unk> , who won over 2000 races before being killed in a collision at the meta when he was about 27 years old . The most famous of all was Gaius <unk> Diocles who won 1 @,@ 462 out of 4 @,@ 257 races . When Diocles retired at the age of 42 after a 24 @-@ year career his winnings reportedly totalled 35 @,@ 863 @,@ 120 sesterces ( $ US 15 billion ) , making him the highest paid sports star in history . The horses , too , could become celebrities , but their life expectancy was also low . The Romans kept detailed statistics of the names , breeds , and pedigrees of famous horses . 
 Seats in the Circus were free for the poor , who by the time of the Empire had little else to do , as they were no longer involved in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic . The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view , and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races . The circus was the only place where the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers , and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger . The imperial box , called the <unk> in the Circus Maximus , was directly connected to the imperial palace . 
 The driver 's clothing was color @-@ coded in accordance with his faction , which would help distant spectators to keep track of the race 's progress . According to Tertullian , there were originally just two factions , White and Red , sacred to winter and summer respectively . As fully developed , there were four factions , the Red , White , Green , and Blue . Each team could have up to three chariots each in a race . Members of the same team often collaborated with each other against the other teams , for example to force them to crash into the spina ( a legal and encouraged tactic ) . Drivers could switch teams , much like athletes can be traded to different teams today . 
 By 77 BC , the rivalry between the Red and the Whites was already developed , when a funeral for a Red driver involved a Red supporter throwing himself on the funeral pyre . No writer of the time , however , refers to these as factions such as came into existence later , with the factions being official organizations . Writing near the beginning of the third century , he wrote that the Reds were dedicated to Mars , the Whites to the Zephyrs , the Greens to Mother Earth or spring , and the Blues to the sky and sea or autumn . Domitian created two new factions , the Purples and Golds , which disappeared soon after he died . The Blues and the Greens gradually became the most prestigious factions , supported by emperor and populace alike . Numerous occasions occurred when a Blue vs. Green clash would break out during a race . Indeed , Reds and Whites are only rarely mentioned in the surviving literature , although their continued activity is documented in inscriptions and in curse @-@ tablets . 
 = = Byzantine era = = 
 Like many other aspects of the Roman world , chariot racing continued in the Byzantine Empire , although the Byzantines did not keep as many records and statistics as the Romans did . In place of the detailed inscriptions of Roman racing statistics , several short epigrams in verse were composed celebrating some of the more famous Byzantine Charioteers . The six charioteers about whom these laudatory verses were written were Anastasius , Julianus of Tyre , Faustinus , his son , Constantinus , <unk> , and Porphyrius . Although Anastasius 's single epigram reveals almost nothing about him , Porphyrius is much better known , having thirty @-@ four known poems dedicated to him . 
 Constantine I ( r . 306 – 337 ) preferred chariot racing to gladiatorial combat , which he considered a vestige of paganism . However , the end of gladiatorial games in the Empire may have been more the result of the difficulty and expense that came with procuring gladiators to fight in the games , than the influence of Christianity in Byzantium . The Olympic Games were eventually ended by Emperor Theodosius I ( r . 379 – 395 ) in 393 , perhaps in a move to suppress paganism and promote Christianity , but chariot racing remained popular . The fact that chariot racing became linked to the imperial majesty meant that the Church did not prevent it , although gradually prominent Christian writers , such as Tertullian , began attacking the sport . Despite the influence of Christianity in the Byzantine Empire , venationes , bloody wild @-@ beast hunts , continued as a form of popular entertainment during the early days of the Empire as part of the extra entertainment that went along with chariot racing . Eventually , Emperor Leo ( r . 457 – 474 ) banned public entertainments on Sundays in 469 , showing that the hunts did not have imperial support , and the venationes were banned completely by Emperor Anastasius ( r . 491 – 518 ) in 498 . Anastasius was praised for this action by some sources , but their concern seems to be more for the danger the hunts could put humans in rather than for objections to the brutality or moral objections . There continued to be burnings and mutilations of humans who committed crimes or were enemies of the state in the hippodrome throughout the Byzantine Empire , as well as victory celebrations and imperial coronations . 
 The chariot races were important in the Byzantine Empire , as in the Roman Empire , as a way to reinforce social class and political power , including the might of the Byzantine emperor , and were often put on for political or religious reasons . In addition , chariot races were sometimes held in celebration of an emperor 's birthday . An explicit parallel was drawn between the victorious charioteers and the victorious emperor . The factions addressed their victors by chanting " Rejoice ... your Lords have conquered " while the charioteer took a victory lap , further indicating the parallel between the charioteer 's victory and the emperor 's victory . Indeed , reliefs of Porphyrius , the famous Byzantine charioteer , show him in a victor 's pose being acclaimed by partisans , which is clearly modeled on the images on the base of Emperor Theodosius 's obelisk . The races could also be used to symbolically make religious statements , such as when a charioteer , whose mother was named Mary , fell off his chariot and got back on and the crowd described it as " The son of Mary has fallen and risen again and is victorious . " 
 The Hippodrome of Constantinople ( really a Roman circus , not the open space that the original Greek <unk> were ) was connected to the emperor 's palace and the Church of Hagia Sophia , allowing spectators to view the emperor as they had in Rome . Citizens used their proximity to the emperor in the circuses and theatres to express public opinion , like their dissatisfaction with the Emperor 's arrant policy . It has been argued that the people became so powerful that the emperors had no choice but to grant them more legal rights . However , contrary to this traditional view , it appears , based on more recent historical research , that the Byzantine emperors treated the protests and petitions of their citizens in the circuses with greater contempt and were more dismissive of them than their Roman predecessors . Justinian I ( r . 527 – 565 ) , for instance , seems to have been dismissive of the Greens ' petitions and to have never negotiated with them at all . 
 There is not much evidence that the chariot races were subject to bribes or other forms of cheating in the Roman Empire . In the Byzantine Empire , there seems to have been more cheating ; Justinian I 's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents , but otherwise there does not seem to have been any mechanical tampering or bribery . Wearing the colours of one 's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress . 
 Chariot racing in the Byzantine Empire also included the Roman racing clubs , which continued to play a prominent role in these public exhibitions . By this time , the Blues ( <unk> ) and the Greens ( <unk> ) had come to overshadow the other two factions of the Whites ( <unk> ) and Reds ( <unk> ) , while still maintaining the paired alliances , although these were now fixed as Blue and White vs. Green and Red . These circus factions were no longer the private businesses they were during the Roman Empire . Instead , the races began to be given regular , public funding , putting them under imperial control . Running the chariot races at public expense was probably a cost @-@ cutting and labor @-@ reducing measure , making it easier to channel the proper funds into the racing organizations . The Emperor himself belonged to one of the four factions , and supported the interests of either the Blues or the Greens . 
 Adopting the color of their favorite charioteers was a way fans showed their loyalty to that particular racer or faction . Many of the young men in the fan clubs , or factions , adopted extravagant clothing and hairstyles , such as billowing sleeves , " Hunnic " hair @-@ styles , and " Persian " facial hair . There is evidence that these young men were the faction members most prone to violence and extreme factional rivalry . Some scholars have tried to argue that the factional rivalry and violence was a result of opposing religious or political views , but more likely the young men simply identified strongly with their faction for group solidarity . The factional violence was probably engaged in similarly to the violence of modern football or soccer fans . The games themselves were the usual focus of the factional violence , even when it was taken to the streets . Although fans who went to the hippodrome cheered on their favorite charioteers , their loyalty appears to be to the color for which the charioteer drove more than for the individual driver . Charioteers could change faction allegiance and race for different colors during their careers , but the fans didn 't change their allegiance to their color . 
 The Blues and the Greens were now more than simply sports teams . They gained influence in military , political , and theological matters , although the hypothesis that the Greens tended towards Monophysitism and the Blues represented Orthodoxy is disputed . It is now widely believed that neither of the factions had any consistent religious bias or allegiance , in spite of the fact that they operated in an environment fraught with religious controversy . According to some scholars , the Blue @-@ Green rivalry contributed to the conditions that underlay the rise of Islam , while factional enmities were exploited by the Sassanid Empire in its conflicts with the Byzantines during the century preceding Islam 's advent . 
 The Blue @-@ Green rivalry often erupted into gang warfare , and street violence had been on the rise in the reign of Justin I ( r . 518 – 527 ) , who took measures to restore order , when the gangs murdered a citizen in the Hagia Sophia . Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian , which began when the two main factions united and attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the emperor . 
 Chariot racing seems to have declined in the course of the seventh century , with the losses the Empire suffered at the hands of the Arabs and the decline of the population and economy . The Blues and Greens , deprived of any political power , were relegated to a purely ceremonial role . After the Nika riots , the factions grew less violent as their importance in imperial ceremony increased . In particular , the iconoclast emperor Constantine V ( r . 741 – 775 ) courted the factions for their support in his campaigns against the monks . They aided the emperor in executing his prisoners and by putting on shows in which monks and nuns held hands while the crowd hissed at them . Constantine V seems to have given the factions a political role in addition to their traditionally ceremonial role . The two factions continued their activity until the imperial court was moved to Blachernae during the 12th century . 
 The Hippodrome in Constantinople remained in use for races , games , and public ceremonies up to the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204 . In the 12th century , Emperor Manuel I Komnenos ( r . 1143 – 1180 ) even staged Western @-@ style jousting matches in the Hippodrome . During the sack of 1204 , the Crusaders looted the city and , among other things , removed the copper quadriga that stood above the carceres ; it is now displayed at St. Mark 's Cathedral in Venice . Thereafter , the Hippodrome was neglected , although still occasionally used for spectacles . A print of the Hippodrome from the fifteenth century shows a derelict site , a few walls still standing , and the spina , the central reservation , robbed of its splendor . Today , only the obelisks and the Serpent Column stand where for centuries the spectators gathered . In the West , the games had ended much sooner ; by the end of the fourth century public entertainments in Italy had come to an end in all but a few towns . The last recorded chariot race in Rome itself took place in the Circus Maximus in 549 AD . 
 = Valencia ( Spanish Congress Electoral District ) = 
 Valencia is one of the 52 electoral districts ( Spanish : <unk> ) used for the Spanish Congress of Deputies — the lower chamber of the Spanish Parliament , the Cortes Generales . It is the third largest district in Congress in terms of the numbers of deputies elected . From 1986 until 2015 it elected sixteen deputies out of the total number of three hundred and fifty . Since the 2015 General Election it has elected fifteen members . Corresponding to the Province of Valencia , most of the electorate resides in the metropolitan area of Valencia which includes Valencia City and its satellite towns such as Torrent , Paterna , Mislata , <unk> and Xirivella . 
 In political terms , the district has shown a long term shift to the right . Valencia initially favoured the parties of the left and centre left who won nine of the district ’ s fifteen seats in the 1977 election , an election which was won overall by the centre right Union of the Democratic Centre ( UCD ) . However , by 2008 , despite the fact that the centre left Spanish Socialist Workers ' Party ( PSOE ) won the election , the centre right People 's Party ( PP ) won nine of the sixteen seats in the district . Although smaller parties such as United Left and Valencian Union polled over 10 % in previous elections and won seats , elections until 2008 had become dominated by the two main Spanish parties , the PSOE and PP , who won all the seats in the 2008 election and together received over 90 % of the votes cast . However , at the 2011 election , United Left regained a seat , while Coalició Compromís and Union , Progress and Democracy won their first seats in the district . 
 = = Boundaries and electoral system = = 
 Under Article 68 of the Spanish constitution , the boundaries of the electoral district must be the same as the province of Valencia and , under Article 140 , this can only be altered with the approval of congress . At the time of the 2008 election , the largest municipality , Valencia City , had 585 @,@ 000 voters out of the total electorate of 1 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 . The next largest municipalities were Torrent ( 56 @,@ 000 ) , <unk> ( 49 @,@ 000 ) , Gandia ( 48 @,@ 000 ) , Paterna ( 44 @,@ 000 ) , <unk> ( 32 @,@ 000 ) and Mislata ( 32 @,@ 000 ) . There are no other municipalities with electorates over 30 @,@ 000 . 
 Voting is on the basis of universal suffrage in a secret ballot . The electoral system used is closed list proportional representation with seats allocated using the D 'Hondt method . Only lists which poll 3 % of the total vote ( which includes votes " en blanco " i.e. for none of the above ) can be considered . Under article 12 of the constitution , the minimum voting age is 18 . 
 = = Electoral procedures = = 
 The laws regulating the conduct and administration of elections are laid out in detail in the 1985 electoral law . ( Ley <unk> del <unk> Electoral General . ) Under this law , the elections in Valencia , as in other districts , are supervised by the Electoral Commission ( Junta Electoral ) , a permanent body composed of eight Supreme Court judges and five political scientists or sociologists appointed by the Congress of Deputies . The Electoral commission is supported in its work by the Interior Ministry . On election day , polling stations are run by electoral boards which consist of groups of citizens selected by lottery . 
 The format of the ballot paper is designed by the Spanish state , however , the law allows political parties to produce and distribute their own ballot papers , either by mailing them to voters or by other means such as street distribution , provided that they comply with the official model . The government then covers the cost of all printed ballot papers . These must then be marked by voters , either in the polling station or outside the polling station and placed inside sealed envelopes which are then placed inside ballot boxes in the polling station . Following the close of polls , the ballots are then counted in each individual polling station in the presence of representatives of the political parties and candidates . The ballots are then immediately destroyed , with the exception of those considered invalid or challenged by the candidates ' representatives , which are retained for further scrutiny . The result is that full recounts are impossible . 
 = = Eligibility = = 
 Article 67 @.@ 3 of the Spanish Constitution prohibits dual membership of both chambers of the Cortes or of the Cortes and regional assemblies , meaning that candidates must resign from regional assemblies if elected . Article 70 also makes active judges , magistrates , public defenders , serving military personnel , active police officers and members of constitutional and electoral tribunals ineligible . Additionally , under Article 11 of the Political Parties Law , June 2002 ( Ley <unk> 6 / 2002 , de 27 de <unk> , de <unk> <unk> ) , parties and individual candidates may be prevented from standing by the Spanish Supreme Court ( Tribunal Supremo ) , if they are judged to have violated Article 9 of that law which prohibits parties which are perceived to discriminate against people on the basis of ideology , religion , beliefs , nationality , race , gender or sexual orientation ( Article 9a ) , foment or organise violence as a means of achieving political objectives ( Article 9b ) or support or compliment the actions of " terrorist organisations " ( Article 9c ) . Article 55 , Section 2 of the 1985 electoral law also disqualifies director generals or equivalent leaders of state monopolies and public bodies such as the Spanish state broadcaster RTVE . Lastly , following changes to the electoral law which took effect for the 2007 municipal elections , candidates ' lists must be composed of at least 40 % of candidates of either gender and each group of five candidates must contain at least two males and two females . 
 = = = Presenting candidates = = = 
 Parties and coalitions of different parties which have registered with the Electoral Commission can present lists of candidates ( Article 44 , 1985 electoral law ) . Groups of electors which have not registered with the commission can also present lists , provided that they obtain the signatures of 1 % of registered electors in a particular district ( Article 169 ) . 
 = = Number of members = = 
 In the general elections of 1977 , 1979 and 1982 , Valencia returned 15 members . That figure was increased to 16 members for the 1986 general election and remained at that level until the 2015 General Election , when it was reduced to 15 members . It returned to 16 members for the 2016 General Election . 
 Under Spanish electoral law , all provinces are awarded an initial minimum of two seats , while the cities of Ceuta and Melilla must be single member districts . The remaining 248 seats are then allocated to provinces according to their population , ignoring the two minimum seats that they were awarded . 
 The practical effect of this law has been to over @-@ represent smaller provinces at the expense of larger provinces like Valencia .

 In recent elections the People 's Party ( PP ) has polled best in Valencia City , with the Spanish Socialist Workers ' Party ( PSOE ) polling best in the satellite towns , particularly to the immediate west of Valencia in the region known as " L <unk> <unk> " . 
 = = = 2004 election = = = 
 While the PP enjoyed a lead of 3 @.@ 5 % overall , PSOE polled strongly in Quart de Poblet where they led the PP by over 20 % . They led by 15 % in the neighbouring municipality of <unk> and had leads of 10 % in the nearby towns of <unk> and Xirivella . PP led by almost 10 % in Valencia City and this was strongly concentrated in the city 's central districts . In four districts in particular — <unk> , L <unk> , Ciutat Vella and El Pla del Real — PP polled between 60 % and 67 % and led PSOE by between 31 % and 41 % . 
 At neighbourhood level the differences were even more pronounced . While Carmen and <unk> districts were close to the city average , the PP polled nearly 80 % of the vote in the central neighbourhoods of Sant Francesc and El Pla del <unk> ( in the latter they had polled 84 @.@ 1 % against 8 @.@ 7 % for the PSOE in the year 2000 ) . PSOE 's best performances came in the outlying neighbourhood of Ciutat <unk> where they led by 20 % and they also polled well in parts of <unk> and the <unk> area , adjacent Valencia port . 
 United Left ( IU ) generally failed to break the 10 % barrier in most areas . In the seven largest municipalities , they only polled more than 10 % in <unk> . They polled best in Favara ( 21 @.@ 0 % ) , <unk> ( 20 @.@ 8 % ) , <unk> ( 20 @.@ 6 % ) and <unk> , where they received 18 @.@ 6 % of the vote . Bloc Nacionalista Valencia 's best performances were in the <unk> of Safor , near the city of Gandia .

Outside of Safor , their best result came in <unk> dels <unk> where they polled almost 12 % . 
 = = = 2008 election = = = 
 The 2008 election saw the PP improve their position relative to the PSOE in most municipalities in the Valencian community . In Valencia City , they extended their lead over the PSOE to 15 % and overtook the PSOE to become the most voted party in <unk> , Mislata , Paterna and Xirivella . In the other satellite towns , PSOE ’ s lead over the PP was cut to 10 % in Quart de Poblet and to 1 % in both <unk> and <unk> . PP ’ s highest vote shares came in <unk> de la <unk> where they polled nearly 76 % and <unk> ( 74 % ) . PSOE ’ s highest percentages came in <unk> ( 77 % ) and <unk> ( 74 % ) . 
 United Left ( IU ) and Bloc Nacionalista Valencia were outpolled by the PP and PSOE in all municipalities . IU ’ s highest vote shares were just over 16 % in <unk> de <unk> and <unk> . Bloc exceeded 10 % of the vote in only two municipalities — <unk> and <unk> . While Bloc and IU ’ s vote share declined in most areas , IU increased their vote from under 1 % in 2004 in Real de Gandia to 8 % in 2008 . Coalició <unk> ( <unk> ) were the only other party to exceed the 5 % barrier in any municipality which they achieved in <unk> . As in 2004 , <unk> de Salem had the highest turnout at over 94 % . The lowest turnout was in <unk> at 73 % . 
 One of the more unusual results relative to 2004 occurred in Puebla de San Miguel which had the lowest turnout in 2004 at 51 % . In 2008 , the turnout increased to 76 % and this benefited the PSOE who increased their vote by 25 % with the PP 's share dropping by 19 % .

 The then Deputy Prime Minister and former Madrid deputy María Teresa Fernández de la Vega headed the PSOE list at the 2008 election . This was interpreted as an attempt to at least gain the United Left seat and possibly advance to nine seats . However , the PSOE vote share fell . Controversy over the repeal of a PP plan to divert the River Ebro had been an important issue in the campaign . The National Hydrological Plan , approved by the former PP government in 2001 , had planned to divert the Ebro to the Communities of Valencia and Murcia . 
 For the PP , former President of the Valencian community , Eduardo <unk> , moved to Madrid district while Vicente Martinez <unk> , who became the first deputy in the 2004 @-@ 08 congress to be expelled from the chamber by the speaker , stood instead in Murcia . Both were reelected . After the Mayor of Valencia , Rita <unk> <unk> turned down an offer to head the PP list , Esteban Gonzalez Pons was selected as head of the list . 
 <unk> Navarro was deselected by the regional federation of United Left ( IU ) on 18 November 2007 being replaced by Antonio Montalbán . The Federal Executive <unk> of IU annulled this result one month later , citing irregularities in membership registration . Following the controversy , Navarro resigned from IU and stood unsuccessfully as part of a multi @-@ party list which included Bloc Nacionalista Valencia . However , neither Montalbán nor Navarro were successful , with the PP gaining the final seat . Valencian Union , which had previously won seats in the district , decided not to contest the 2008 election . 
 In the wake of the 2008 election result , the Prime Minister , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , highlighted Valencia as one of five areas where the PSOE needed to improve its results .

 = Hurricane Kenneth ( 2005 ) = 
 Hurricane Kenneth was the strongest and longest @-@ tracked hurricane of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season . The eleventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the season , Kenneth developed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the southwest of Mexico on September 14 . It quickly attained peak winds of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) on September 18 , before weakening due to increased wind shear and turning to a southwest drift . After weakening to tropical storm status , Kenneth attained a steady west @-@ northwest motion and encountered favorable enough conditions for it to gain power and attain hurricane status on September 25 . The cyclone again weakened as its motion halted , and on September 30 Kenneth dissipated a short distance off the Big Island of Hawaii . The remnants of Kenneth produced one of the highest rainfall totals in Hawaii , reaching up to 12 inches ( 305 mm ) on Oahu . The rainfall caused flooding , though no major damage was reported . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Kenneth are believed to have been from a tropical wave that crossed Central America into the eastern North Pacific Ocean on September 9 . The system tracked westward within the Intertropical Convergence Zone — a belt of thunderstorm activity across the eastern Pacific Ocean — and on September 13 its associated thunderstorm activity began showing signs of organization . Despite being located only 625 miles ( 1010 km ) east @-@ southeast of the larger Tropical Depression Ten , the National Hurricane Center remarked the potential for further development of the system ; as the depression was further west and moving faster than the system , little interference from Jova was anticipated . The system organized further , and at 1800 UTC on September 14 the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Eleven about 900 miles ( 1450 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas , Mexico . The depression maintained a general westward track throughout its entire duration , due to the subtropical ridge to its north . 
 Initially , the depression was forecast to reach maximum strength as a tropical storm before weakening , and only the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory 's hurricane model predicted it to attain hurricane status . However , low amounts of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures favored further intensification . After being previously removed from the primary thunderstorm activity , the circulation became situated beneath a persistent area of deep convection . It is estimated the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Kenneth early on September 15 . The storm quickly developed banding features — spiral rain showers of convection — as its convection formed into a central area of deep convection . These were all signs for further development , and Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 16 . By September 17 , the hurricane had finished an eyewall replacement cycle , meaning its original eye was replaced by a larger , better defined eye . As a result , it quickly intensified and attained major hurricane status . With a 23 mile ( 37 km ) wide eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops , Kenneth strengthened to reach peak sustained winds of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) , a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale , on September 18 about 1725 miles ( <unk> km ) east of the Big Island of Hawaii . 
 After maintaining peak strength for about 18 hours , Kenneth began a sharp weakening trend due to unfavorable north @-@ northeasterly wind shear ; this was caused by the anticyclone over Hurricane Jova , which eroded the eyewall of Hurricane Kenneth . While weakening , the hurricane turned to a southwest drift , due to a weakness in steering currents . By September 20 , its deepest convection was confined to the southern half of the hurricane , and later in the day Kenneth weakened to tropical storm status . Reduced moisture in the atmosphere weakened the system further , and by September 21 its circulation was exposed to the east @-@ northeast of the convection . Kenneth began a steady west @-@ northwest track due to a weak ridge to its north . Operationally the storm was predicted to continue weakening and dissipate within four days . However , deep convection re @-@ developed near the center as the outflow became better defined , and Kenneth remained a moderate tropical storm for several days . On September 24 , the motion became nearly stationary as steering currents again weakened . Vertical shear sharply declined , allowing the convection to become more symmetrical and for an eye feature to develop . On September 25 , Kenneth again attained hurricane status while located about 1085 miles ( 1745 km ) east @-@ southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii . 
 Hurricane Kenneth maintained minimal hurricane status for about 30 hours as it drifted southwestward , during which it entered the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center . Increasing shear weakened Kenneth to tropical storm status on September 26 , and it began a steady northwest track under the influence of low- to mid @-@ level steering flow . By September 27 , most of its convection had dissipated , excluding a small area of thunderstorms to the southeast of the center . Convection intermittently reformed near the center , though the combination of wind shear and cooler water temperatures prevented restrengthening . On September 29 , an intensifying upper @-@ level trough over the Hawaiian Islands weakened Kenneth to tropical depression status . Thunderstorms failed to reform , and on September 30 it degenerated into a tropical wave about 40 miles ( 65 km ) east of the Big Island of Hawaii . A remnant swirl of clouds later moved onshore of the Big Island . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 The remnants of Kenneth produced rainfall in the Hawaiian Islands when they interacted with an upper @-@ level trough , causing some reports of flash flooding . At Nu ‘ <unk> Pali on Oahu , a gauge recorded a total precipitation of 10 @.@ 25 inches ( 260 @.@ 4 mm ) ; the gauge also reported 1 @.@ 6 inches ( 40 mm ) in 15 minutes , as well as 4 @.@ 11 inches ( 104 mm ) in one hour . Peak rainfall totals on Oahu included reports of up to 12 inches ( 305 mm ) , which puts Kenneth in a three @-@ way tie for ninth on Hawaii 's rainiest tropical cyclones list , along with Diana in 1972 and a system dubbed " B " from the 1967 season . On October 1 , rains caused the <unk> Stream to burst its banks and Lake Wilson to overflow behind the <unk> Dam . The rainfall produced up to 1 foot ( 300 mm ) of flowing water on Pali Highway , leading to surface runoff which flooded a few homes . 
 On Kauai , the six @-@ hour total at Mount Waialeale was 6 @.@ 17 inches ( 157 mm ) . Flash flooding occurred on the Hanalei River , which resulted in the closure of the <unk> Highway at the Hanalei Bridge . Rapid water level rises also occurred on the Wailua River and the Hanapepe River , though no significant damages were reported along these waterways . 
 Large swells churned up by Kenneth generated surf of 8 – 10 ft ( 2 – 3 m ) that crashed ashore on September 30 along the east shores of the islands of Hawaii , Kauai , Molokai , Maui , and Oahu . No reports of injuries or serious damage were received . 
 During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference , the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name Kenneth , citing that the storm had become memorable due to threat or damage . However , the World Meteorological Organization did not approve the request , and the name is on the list to be reused for the 2011 season . 
 = Adrenal gland = 
 The adrenal glands ( also known as suprarenal glands ) are endocrine glands that produce a variety of hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol . They are found above the kidneys . Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla . The adrenal cortex itself is divided into three zones : zona glomerulosa , the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis . 
 The adrenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones : mineralocorticoids , glucocorticoids , and androgens . Mineralocorticoids ( such as aldosterone ) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance . The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata ; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression . The innermost layer of the cortex , the zona reticularis , produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs . The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis , and involves a number of reactions and processes that take place in cortical cells . The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline , which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations . 
 A number of endocrine diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland . <unk> of cortisol leads to Cushing 's syndrome , whereas insufficient production is associated with Addison 's disease . Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms . A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The adrenal glands are located on both sides of the body in the <unk> , above and slightly medial to the kidneys . In humans , the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape , whereas the left is <unk> and somewhat larger . The glands are usually about <unk> cm in size , and their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10 grams . The glands are yellowish in colour . 
 The adrenal glands are surrounded by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia , which also surrounds the kidneys . A weak wall of connective tissue separates the glands from the kidneys . The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm , and are attached to the crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia . 
 Each adrenal gland has two distinct parts , each with a unique function , the outer adrenal cortex and the inner medulla , both of which produce hormones . 
 = = = Cortex = = = 
 The adrenal cortex is the outermost layer of the adrenal gland . Within the cortex are three layers , called " zones " . When viewed under a microscope each layer has a distinct appearance , and each has a different function . The adrenal cortex is devoted to production of hormones , namely aldosterone , cortisol , and androgens . 
 = = = = Zona glomerulosa = = = = 
 The outermost layer of the adrenal cortex is the zona glomerulosa . It lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland . Cells in this layer form oval groups , separated by thin strands of connective tissue from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries . 
 This layer is the main site for production of aldosterone , a mineralocorticoid , by the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase . <unk> plays an important role in the long @-@ term regulation of blood pressure . 
 = = = = Zona fasciculata = = = = 
 The zona fasciculata is situated between the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis . Cells in this layer are responsible for producing glucocorticoids such as cortisol . It is the largest of the three layers , accounting for nearly 80 % of the volume of the cortex . In the zona fasciculata , cells are arranged in columns radially oriented towards the medulla . Cells contain numerous lipid droplets , abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum . 
 = = = = Zona reticularis = = = = 
 The innermost cortical layer , the zona reticularis , lies directly adjacent to the medulla . It produces androgens , mainly <unk> ( DHEA ) , DHEA sulfate ( DHEA @-@ S ) , and androstenedione ( the precursor to testosterone ) in humans . Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters , separated by capillaries and connective tissue . The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets , and sometimes display brown <unk> pigment . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The adrenal medulla is at the centre of each adrenal gland , and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex . The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body 's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline , released by the medulla . Approximately 20 % noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) and 80 % adrenaline ( epinephrine ) are secreted here . 
 The adrenal medulla is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via <unk> fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord , from vertebrae T5 – T11 . Because it is innervated by <unk> nerve fibers , the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion . Unlike other sympathetic ganglia , however , the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood . 
 = = = Blood supply = = = 
 The adrenal glands have one of the greatest blood supply rates per gram of tissue of any organ : up to 60 small arteries may enter each gland . Three arteries usually supply each adrenal gland : 
 The superior suprarenal artery , a branch of the inferior phrenic artery 
 The middle suprarenal artery , a direct branch of the abdominal aorta 
 The inferior suprarenal artery , a branch of the renal artery 
 These blood vessels supply a network of small arteries within the capsule of the adrenal glands . Thin strands of the capsule enter the glands , carrying blood to them . 
 Venous blood is drained from the glands by the suprarenal veins , usually one for each gland : 
 The right suprarenal vein drains into the inferior vena cava 
 The left suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein or the left inferior phrenic vein . 
 The central <unk> vein , in the adrenal medulla , is an unusual type of blood vessel . Its structure is different from the other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media ( the middle layer of the vessel ) is arranged in conspicuous , longitudinally oriented bundles . 
 = = = Variability = = = 
 The adrenal glands may not develop at all , or may be fused in the midline behind the aorta . These are associated with other congenital abnormalities , such as failure of the kidneys to develop , or fused kidneys . The gland may develop with a partial or complete absence of the cortex , or may develop in an unusual location . 
 = = Function = = 
 The adrenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other parts of the body . These hormones are involved in a number of essential biological functions . 
 = = = Corticosteroids = = = 
 Corticosteroids are a group of steroid hormones produced from the cortex of the adrenal gland , from which they are named . Corticosteroids are named according to their actions : 
 Mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone regulate salt ( " mineral " ) balance and blood volume . 
 Glucocorticoids such as cortisol influence metabolism rates of proteins , fats and sugars ( " glucose " ) . 
 Mineralocorticoids 
 The adrenal gland produces aldosterone , a mineralocorticoid , which is important in the regulation of salt ( " mineral " ) balance and blood volume . In the kidneys , aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions . <unk> is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2 % of filtered sodium in the kidneys , which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates . Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation . Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production . The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume , which in turn influences blood pressure . Therefore , the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure . 
 Glucocorticoids 
 Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid in humans . In species that do not create cortisol , this role is played by corticosterone instead . Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism . As their name suggests , they increase the circulating level of glucose . This is the result of an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver . In addition , they increase the levels of free fatty acids , which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy . Glucocorticoids also have effects not related to the regulation of blood sugar levels , including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti @-@ inflammatory effect . Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract . 
 The adrenal gland secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) from the anterior pituitary . Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest in the early morning and lowest in the evening as a result of the circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion . <unk> is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β @-@ HSD on cortisol . The reaction catalyzed by 11β @-@ HSD is reversible , which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol , the biologically active hormone . 
 Formation 
 All corticosteroid hormones share cholesterol as a common precursor . Therefore , the first step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis . Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths . The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) . LDL enters the cells through receptor @-@ mediated endocytosis . The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell 's endoplasmic reticulum . Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low . In the lysosome , cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol , which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell . 
 The initial part of conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones involves a number of enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that are located in the inner membrane of mitochondria . Transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane is facilitated by <unk> acute regulatory protein and is the rate @-@ limiting step of steroid synthesis . 
 The layers of the adrenal gland differ by function , with each layer having distinct enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor . The first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain , a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme <unk> , also known as cholesterol <unk> . After the production of pregnenolone , specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it . Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and <unk> <unk> and <unk> dehydrogenases . Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones . Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases . For example , the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21 @-@ hydroxylase , an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production . 
 Regulation 
 Glucocorticoids are under the regulatory influence of the hypothalamus @-@ pituitary @-@ adrenal ( HPA ) axis . <unk> synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary . In turn , production of ACTH is stimulated by the presence of corticotropin @-@ releasing hormone ( CRH ) , which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus . ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of <unk> within the cells , and then of all <unk> P450 enzymes . The HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system , in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis . The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response . 
 <unk> secretion is regulated mainly by the renin – angiotensin – aldosterone system ( <unk> ) , the concentration of potassium , and to a lesser extent the concentration of ACTH . Sensors of blood pressure in the <unk> apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood , which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II . Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance , and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone . 
 = = = Adrenaline and noradrenaline = = = 
 Nowadays referred to as Epinephrine and norepinephrine , Adrenaline and noradrenaline are catecholamines , water @-@ soluble compounds that have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group . The adrenal glands are responsible for most of the adrenaline that circulates in the body , but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline . These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla , which contains a dense network of blood vessels . Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at <unk> throughout the body , with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate . The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response , characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate , an increase in blood pressure , and constriction of blood vessels in many parts of the body . 
 Formation 
 <unk> are produced in chromaffin cells in the medulla of the adrenal gland , from tyrosine , a non @-@ essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver . The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L @-@ DOPA in the first step of catecholamine synthesis . L @-@ DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline . In the cytosol , noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N @-@ methyltransferase ( <unk> ) and stored in granules . Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and <unk> . 
 <unk> release is stimulated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system . <unk> nerves of the sympathetic nervous system innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland . When activated , it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Cells in zona reticularis of the adrenal glands produce male sex hormones , or androgens , the most important of which is DHEA . In general , these hormones do not have an overall effect in the male body , and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT or to estrogens ( female sex hormones ) in the gonads , acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate . 
 = = Development = = 
 The adrenal glands are composed of two heterogenous types of tissue . In the center is the adrenal medulla , which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream , as part of the sympathetic nervous system . Surrounding the medulla is the cortex , which produces a variety of steroid hormones . These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths . The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm , whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest , which is of <unk> origin . 
 The adrenal glands in a newborn baby are much larger as a proportion of the body size than in an adult . For example , at age three months the glands are four times the size of the kidneys . The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth , mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex . The cortex , which almost completely disappears by age 1 , develops again from age 4 – 5 . The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each . In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development . 
 = = = Cortex = = = 
 Adrenal cortex tissue is derived from the intermediate mesoderm . It first appears 33 days after fertilisation , shows steroid hormone production capabilities by the eighth week and undergoes rapid growth during the first trimester of pregnancy . The fetal adrenal cortex is different from its adult counterpart , as it is composed of two distinct zones : the inner " fetal " zone , which carries most of the hormone @-@ producing activity , and the outer " definitive " zone , which is in a proliferative phase . The fetal zone produces large amounts of adrenal androgens ( male sex hormones ) that are used by the placenta for estrogen biosynthesis . Cortical development of the adrenal gland is regulated mostly by ACTH , a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates cortisol synthesis . During <unk> , the fetal zone occupies most of the cortical volume and produces 100 – 200 mg / day of DHEA @-@ S , an androgen and precursor of both androgens and estrogens ( female sex hormones ) . Adrenal hormones , especially glucocorticoids such as cortisol , are essential for prenatal development of organs , particularly for the maturation of the lungs . The adrenal gland decreases in size after birth because of the rapid disappearance of the fetal zone , with a corresponding decrease in androgen secretion . 
 = = = = Adrenarche = = = = 
 During early childhood androgen synthesis and secretion remain low , but several years before puberty ( from 6 – 8 years of age ) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA @-@ S. These changes are part of a process called adrenarche , which has only been described in humans and some other primates . Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex . Functionally , adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells , which come from the ectoderm layer of the embryo . These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta , a primitive blood vessel , which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs . These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system . Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts , a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs . Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells . More recent research suggests that BMP @-@ 4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this , and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells . 
 = = Clinical significance = = 
 The normal function of the adrenal gland may be impaired by conditions such as infections , tumors , genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases , or as a side effect of medical therapy . These disorders affect the gland either directly ( as with infections or autoimmune diseases ) or as a result of the dysregulation of hormone production ( as in some types of Cushing 's syndrome ) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms . 
 = = = <unk> overproduction = = = 
 = = = = Cushing 's syndrome = = = = 
 Cushing 's syndrome is the manifestation of glucocorticoid excess . It can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol . Causes can be further classified into ACTH @-@ dependent or ACTH @-@ independent . The most common cause of endogenous Cushing 's syndrome is a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH . The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity , diabetes , increased blood pressure , excessive body hair ( <unk> ) , osteoporosis , depression and , most distinctively , stretch marks in the skin , caused by its progressive thinning . 
 = = = = Primary aldosteronism = = = = 
 When the zona glomerulosa produces excess aldosterone , the result is primary aldosteronism . Causes for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia ( excessive tissue growth ) of the glands , or aldosterone @-@ producing adenomas ( a condition called Conn 's syndrome ) . Primary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance , increasing potassium depletion and sodium retention . 
 = = = Adrenal insufficiency = = = 
 Adrenal insufficiency ( the deficiency of glucocorticoids ) occurs in about 5 in 10 @,@ 000 in the general population . Diseases classified as primary adrenal insufficiency ( including Addison 's disease and genetic causes ) directly affect the adrenal cortex . If a problem that affects the hypothalamic @-@ pituitary @-@ adrenal axis arises outside the gland , it is a secondary adrenal insufficiency . 
 = = = = Addison 's disease = = = = 
 Addison 's disease refers to primary <unk> , which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland . In the Western world , Addison 's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition , in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex . Worldwide , the disease is more frequently caused by infection , especially from tuberculosis . A distinctive feature of Addison 's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin , which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue . 
 A complication seen in untreated Addison 's disease and other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis , a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever . An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma . The management of adrenal crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections . 
 = = = = Secondary adrenal insufficiency = = = = 
 In secondary adrenal insufficiency , a dysfunction of the hypothalamic @-@ pituitary @-@ adrenal axis leads to decreased stimulation of the adrenal cortex . Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy , the most common cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) by the pituitary gland . This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids , which are under regulation of the renin @-@ angiotensin system instead . 
 = = = = Congenital adrenal hyperplasia = = = = 
 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a congenital disease in which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis . In the HPA axis , cortisol ( a glucocorticoid ) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH , hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis . As cortisol cannot be synthesized , these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead . The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21 @-@ hydroxylase deficiency . 21 @-@ hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids , but not androgens . Therefore , ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens , which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics . 
 = = = Adrenal tumors = = = 
 Adrenal tumors are commonly found as <unk> , unexpected asymptomatic tumors found during medical imaging . They are seen in around 3 @.@ 4 % of CT scans , and in most cases they are benign adenomas . Adrenal carcinomas are very rare , with an incidence of 1 case per million per year . 
 <unk> are tumors of the adrenal medulla that arise from chromaffin cells . They can produce a variety of nonspecific symptoms , which include headaches , sweating , anxiety and palpitations . Common signs include hypertension and tachycardia . Surgery , especially adrenal laparoscopy , is the most common treatment for small <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 Bartolomeo <unk> , an Italian anatomist , is credited with the first description of the adrenal glands in 1563 @-@ 4 . However , these publications were part of the papal library and did not receive public attention , which was first received with Caspar Bartholin the Elder 's illustrations in 1611 . 
 The adrenal glands are named for their location relative to the kidneys . The term " adrenal " comes from <unk> ( Latin , " near " ) and <unk> ( Latin , " kidney " ) . Similarly , " suprarenal " , as termed by Jean <unk> the Younger in 1629 , is derived from the Latin supra ( Latin : " above " ) and <unk> ( Latin : kidney ) . The suprarenal nature of the glands was not truly accepted until the 19th century , as anatomists clarified the <unk> nature of the glands and their likely secretory role – prior to this , there was some debate as to whether the glands were indeed suprarenal or part of the kidney . 
 One of the most recognized works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 with the publication of On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the <unk> Capsule , by the English physician Thomas Addison . In his monography , Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison 's disease , an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations . In 1894 , English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their <unk> effects . In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the adrenal cortex to treat Addison 's disease . Edward Calvin Kendall , Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones .

 StarCraft is a military science fiction media franchise created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney , and owned by Blizzard Entertainment . The series centers on a galactic struggle for dominance between four species — the adaptable and mobile Terrans , the ever @-@ evolving insectoid Zerg , the powerfully enigmatic Protoss , and the " god @-@ like " Xel 'Naga creator race — in a distant part of the Milky Way galaxy known as the Koprulu Sector at the beginning of the 26th century . The series debuted with the video game StarCraft in 1998 . Since then it has grown to include a number of other games as well as eight novelizations , two Amazing Stories articles , a board game , and other licensed merchandise such as collectible statues and toys . 
 Blizzard Entertainment began planning StarCraft in 1995 , with a development team led by Metzen and Phinney . The game debuted at E3 1996 , and used a modified Warcraft II game engine . StarCraft also marked the creation of Blizzard Entertainment 's film department ; the game introduced high quality cinematics integral to the storyline of the series . Most of the original development team for StarCraft returned to work on the game 's official expansion pack , Brood War ; the game 's development began shortly after StarCraft was released . In 2001 , StarCraft : Ghost began development under Nihilistic Software . Unlike the previous real @-@ time strategy games in the series , Ghost was to be a stealth @-@ action game . After three years of development , work on the game was postponed in 2004 . Development of StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty began in 2003 ; the game was later announced on May 19 , 2007 and was released on July 27 , 2010 . The StarCraft II franchise continued with the StarCraft II : Heart of the Swarm expansion , which was released on March 12 , 2013 . The third StarCraft II installment is titled StarCraft II : Legacy of the Void , released on November 10 , 2015 . 
 The original game and its official expansion have been praised as one of the benchmark real @-@ time strategy games of its time . The series has gathered a solid following around the world , particularly in South Korea , where professional players and teams participate in matches , earn sponsorships , and compete in televised matches . As of May 31 , 2007 , StarCraft and Brood War have sold almost 10 million copies combined . In addition , the series was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in 2006 , and holds four Guinness World Records in the Guinness World Records Gamer 's Edition of 2008 . 
 = = Story = = 
 The story focuses on the activities of the three species in a part of the Milky Way known as the Koprulu Sector . Millennia before any of the events of the games , a species known as the Xel 'Naga genetically engineered the Protoss and later the Zerg in attempts to create pure beings . These experiments backfire and the Xel 'Naga are largely destroyed by the Zerg . Centuries before the beginning of StarCraft in 2499 , the hardline international government of Earth , the United Earth Directorate ( UED ) , commissions a colonization program as part of a solution to overpopulation . However , the computers automating the colony ships malfunction , propelling the Terran colonists far off course to the edge of Protoss space . Out of contact with Earth , they form various factions to maintain their interests . Intrigued by the behavior and mentality of the Terrans , the Protoss remain hidden to examine the humans , while protecting them from other threats without their knowledge . However , the Zerg target the Terrans for assimilation to harness their psionic potential , forcing the Protoss to destroy tainted Terran colonies to contain the Zerg infestation . 
 StarCraft begins just days after the first of these attacks , where the predominant Terran government , the Confederacy of Man , falls into a state of panic as it comes under attack by both the Zerg and the Protoss , in addition to increasing rebel activity led by Arcturus Mengsk against its rule . The Confederacy eventually succumbs to Mengsk 's rebels when they use Confederate technology to lure the Zerg into attacking the Confederate capital , Tarsonis . In the consequent power vacuum , Mengsk crowns himself emperor of a new Terran Dominion . However , during the assault on Tarsonis , Mengsk allows the Zerg to capture and infest his psychic second @-@ in @-@ command , Sarah Kerrigan . This betrayal prompts Mengsk 's other commander , Jim Raynor , to desert him with a small army . Having retreated with Kerrigan to their primary hive clusters , the Zerg are assaulted by Protoss forces commanded by Tassadar and the dark templar Zeratul . Through assassinating a Zerg cerebrate , Zeratul inadvertently allows the Overmind to learn the location of the Protoss homeworld , Aiur . The Overmind quickly launches an invasion to assimilate the Protoss and gain genetic perfection . Pursued by his own people as a heretic for siding with the dark templar , Tassadar returns with Zeratul to Aiur and with the assistance of Raynor and the templar Fenix , Tassadar launches an attack on the Overmind and ultimately sacrifices himself to kill the creature . 
 In Brood War , the Protoss are now led by Zeratul and Artanis . They begin to evacuate the surviving population of Aiur to the dark templar homeworld of Shakuras under a fragile alliance between the two untrusting branches of the Protoss . On Shakuras , they are misled by Kerrigan into attacking the Zerg to advance Kerrigan 's quest to securing power over the Zerg . This deception comes after she reveals that a new Overmind has entered incubation . Meanwhile , Earth decides to take action in the sector , sending a fleet to conquer the Terran Dominion and capture the new Overmind . Although successfully taking the Dominion capital Korhal and enslaving the Overmind , the UED 's efforts to capture Mengsk are thwarted by a double agent working for Kerrigan , Samir Duran . Kerrigan , allying with Mengsk , Fenix and Raynor , launches a campaign against the UED , recapturing Korhal . However , she turns against her allies ; Fenix and Duke both perish in the ensuing attacks . Kerrigan later blackmails Zeratul into killing the new Overmind , giving her full control over the entire Zerg Swarm . After defeating a retaliatory attack by the Protoss , Dominion and the UED , consequently destroying the last of the UED fleet , Kerrigan and her Zerg broods become the dominant power in the sector . 
 Four years later , in Wings of Liberty , Kerrigan and the Zerg suddenly vanish from the Koprulu Sector , allowing the Protoss to once again take on a passive role in the galaxy . Meanwhile , Raynor forms a revolutionary group named Raynor 's Raiders in order to overthrow Mengsk . On Mar Sara , Raynor liberates the local population from Dominion control and also discovers a component of a mysterious Xel 'Naga artifact . The Zerg suddenly reappear and overrun Mar Sara , forcing Raynor to arrange an evacuation to his battlecruiser , the Hyperion . The Raiders embark on a series of missions to undermine Mengsk , stop frequent Zerg infestations on Terran worlds , gather psychic individuals for military assets , and find the remaining pieces of the Xel 'Naga artifact , which they sell to the enigmatic Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution . Soon after , Zeratul delivers a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg @-@ Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out the Terrans and the Protoss . The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond . After collecting more artifact pieces , the Raiders forge an alliance with Valerian Mengsk , Arcturus ' son , who is their secret benefactor from Moebius Foundation . After recovering the final artifact piece , Valerian and Raynor work together to invade the Zerg world of Char and use the artifact to restore Kerrigan 's humanity , thus weakening the Zerg at the cost of much of the Dominion fleet . However , an agent of Arcturus makes an attempt on Kerrigan 's life , and Raynor defends her and takes her in for medical examination . 
 In Heart of the Swarm , the Dominion discovers where Raynor and Kerrigan are hiding and launch an attack on them . Kerrigan manages to escape , but is cut off from Raynor and upon hearing news that he was captured and executed , she returns to Zerg territory to retake control of the swarm and enact revenge on Mengsk . During her quest , she has an encounter with Zeratul , who advises her to travel to Zerus , the original homeworld of the Zerg , where she not only regains her powers as the Queen of Blades , returning stronger than ever , but also learns that a fallen Xel 'Naga named Amon was responsible for making the Zerg what they are : A warring swarm , bound to a single overriding will . After confronting a legion of servants of Amon , including a breed of Protoss @-@ Zerg hybrids , Mengsk informs Kerrigan that Raynor is still alive and uses him as a leverage against her , keeping the location where he is imprisoned a secret , until she joins forces with the Hyperion to locate and rescue him . However , seeing that she discarded her humanity after all the effort he took to restore it , Raynor rejects her , despite her confession that she loves him , and part ways with her . Kerrigan then turns her attention to Korhal and sends her forces to bring down Mengsk once and for all . However , during their showdown , Mengsk uses the artifact to immobilize her , but Raynor appears to protect her , and Mengsk is ultimately killed by Kerrigan . With the Dominion under control of Mengsk 's son Valerian , Kerrigan bids farewell to Raynor and departs with the Zerg Swarm to confront Amon and his forces . 
 In Legacy of the Void , Zeratul invades a Terran installation under control of Amon in order to pinpoint the exact location of his resurrection , taking advantage of a sudden attack by Kerrigan and the Zerg swarm . After obtaining the exact location , he departs to an ancient Xel 'Naga temple where he has a vision of Tassadar , who prompts him to claim the artifact in possession of the Terrans . Zeratul then returns to warn Artanis of Amon 's return , but he decides to proceed with his plans of leading his army to reclaim Aiur . However , Amon awakens on Aiur and takes control of the majority of the Protoss race through the Khala , the telepathic bond that unites all emotions for the Khalai faction of the Protoss . Only Zeratul and the Nerazim , the Dark Templar , are immune due to their lack of connection to the Khala , and the Nerazim proceed to save as many Khalai as they can by severing their nerve chords , which connect them to the Khala , with Zeratul sacrificing himself to save Artanis in the occasion . After escaping the planet with an ancient vessel , the Spear of Adun , Artanis reclaims the artifact as Zeratul suggested and gathers allies among the many Protoss tribes scattered across the galaxy in order to remake his army and launch another assault on Aiur . Using the artifact , Artanis ' forces restrain Amon 's essence , time enough for the other Khalai Protoss who were still under his control to sever their nerve chords and banish Amon to the Void . 
 In a short epilogue after the end of Legacy of the Void , Kerrigan calls for Artanis and Raynor 's help to confront Amon inside the Void to defeat him once and for all . In the occasion , they meet Ouros , the last of the Xel 'Naga who reveals that to confront Amon on equal terms , Kerrigan must inherit Ouros ' essence and become a Xel 'Naga herself , as Ouros himself is at the last of his strengths . Assisted by the Zerg , Terran and Protoss forces , the empowered Kerrigan vanquishes Amon , before disappearing without a trace . Two years later , Kerrigan appears before Raynor in human form and he departs with her to never be heard from again , while the Zerg , the Terran and the Protoss civilizations begin to rebuild in an age of peace and prosperity .

 The StarCraft series includes a core set of titles which carry the main storyline . These games were released in chronological order , with each new title following on from the events that are depicted in the previous title . A full second game , StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty , was released on July 27 , 2010 , taking place four years after the end of Brood War . Two expansions , Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void ( both currently stand alone games ) , were planned from the beginning ; the former was released on March 12 , 2013 . 
 All the games in the main series are real @-@ time strategy games , where the player views the events as a military commander for each of the three species . In addition , two spin @-@ off titles have been released ; these are authorized expansion packs to the original which focus on other characters and settings based at the same time as the main storyline . Like the main series , these two titles are also real @-@ time strategy games . A spin @-@ off , StarCraft : Ghost , which was to be a third person action @-@ stealth game was in development , but has been placed on indefinite hiatus .

 StarCraft , released for Windows on March 31 , 1998 , is the first video game in the StarCraft series . A science fiction real @-@ time strategy game , StarCraft is set in a distant sector of the Milky Way galaxy . A Mac OS version of the game was released by Blizzard Entertainment in March 1999 . A Nintendo 64 port including StarCraft , Brood War and a new secret mission " Resurrection IV " was released in the United States on June 13 , 2000 . The game 's story revolves around the appearance of two alien races in Terran space , and each race 's attempts to survive and adapt over the others . The player assumes three roles through the course of the three campaigns : a Confederate colonial governor who becomes a revolutionary commander , a Zerg cerebrate pushing forward the species ' doctrine of assimilation , and a Protoss fleet executor tasked with defending the Protoss from the Zerg . StarCraft soon gained critical acclaim , winning numerous awards , including being labelled " the best real @-@ time strategy game ever made " and being ranked the seventh best game of all time by IGN in both 2003 and 2005 , and the eleventh best game in 2007 . 
 StarCraft : Brood War is the official expansion pack for StarCraft , developed by Blizzard Entertainment and Saffire . Released for Windows and Mac OS in the United States on November 30 , 1998 , the expansion directly continues the events of StarCraft . The expansion 's story continues only days after the conclusion of the original game . It starts with the Protoss ' struggle to ensure the survival of their species and continues with the intervention of the United Earth Directorate into local Terran affairs . The livelihood of both the Protoss and the previously silent Earth government is then threatened by the ever @-@ increasing power of Sarah Kerrigan and her Zerg broods . In addition , the expansion introduces new features and improvements . A total of seven new units with different functions and abilities are included , the artificial intelligence behavior was modified , new graphical tilesets for terrain were added and the game 's level editor received improved scripting tools to facilitate cut scenes with the in @-@ game engine . The expansion received critical praise for fixing various balance issues with the original game , development attention on par with that of a full game and for continuing with single player campaigns that were heavily story @-@ driven .

 StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty is the official sequel to StarCraft released for Windows and Mac OS X by Blizzard Entertainment on July 27 , 2010 . The game was announced at the Worldwide Invitational in South Korea on May 19 , 2007 with a pre @-@ rendered cinematic cut scene trailer and a gameplay demonstration of the Protoss . Further demonstrations regarding the game 's new features have been showcased at subsequent <unk> and other games conventions . The game incorporates a new 3D graphics engine and adds new features such as the Havok physics engine . StarCraft II also incorporates DirectX 10 level effects in Windows . Originally envisioned as a single game , StarCraft II was split into three parts during development , one for focusing on each race . The base game , Wings of Liberty , follows the Terrans , while two expansion packs , Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void are to be released to complement Wings of Liberty after release and further the story from the views of the Zerg and Protoss , respectively . The story of Wings of Liberty continues from four years after the conclusion of Brood War , and revolves around Jim Raynor 's struggles against the Terran Dominion . 
 StarCraft II : Heart of the Swarm is an expansion pack to StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty and was released on March 12 , 2013 . It is part two of the StarCraft II trilogy . The expansion includes additional units and multiplayer changes from Wings of Liberty , as well as a continuing campaign focusing on Kerrigan and the Zerg race . It spans 27 missions ( 20 main missions and 7 side missions ) . 
 The saga of StarCraft is ultimately completed with StarCraft II : Legacy of the Void , which was released on November 10 , 2015 . StarCraft II : Legacy of the Void is a stand @-@ alone game in which new units are added to all three races as well as changing existing units , and also makes groundbreaking changes to the economy @-@ aspect of the game . The story of Starcraft is concluded by following the Protoss Race in their quest to reclaim their homeworld and for Kerrigan to ultimately slay the greatest threat to the entire universe . The game is divided by a 3 @-@ mission prologue , a 19 @-@ mission main story campaign followed by a 3 @-@ mission epilogue wrapping up . 
 At BlizzCon 2015 during the " Future of Starcraft 2 " presentation it was revealed that Blizzard will release additional mission packs to keep players engaged with Starcraft 2 . The first pack is called Nova Covert Ops , and will center around the character Nova . The mission pack will consist of three episodes , with a total of nine new missions . It does not require the purchase of StarCraft II , and can be played with the Starter Edition . The release date for the first episode is 29 March 2016 . At the same time Blizzard has announced that new commanders are planned to be added to the Co @-@ Op mode in Legacy of the Void as a DLC , with Karax to be the first addition given for free .

 The success of StarCraft has spurred the creation of two authorized add @-@ on titles to StarCraft , as well as a deviation into genres other than real @-@ time strategy . Insurrection was the first add @-@ on pack released for StarCraft . Although developed and published by <unk> New Media , it is authorized by Blizzard Entertainment . It was released for the PC on July 31 , 1998 . The expansion 's story focuses on a Confederate colony during the course of the first campaign of StarCraft . As in StarCraft , the player takes control of each race in three separate campaigns . In the first campaign , Terran colonists attempt to defend themselves from the Zerg invasion of the sector as well as from a rising insurgency . The second campaign has the player directing a Protoss task force sent to clear the Zerg infestation of the colony by any means necessary . In the final campaign the player assumes the role of a Zerg cerebrate , whose goal is to crush all opposition on the surface . The expansion contains 30 new campaign missions and over 100 new multiplayer maps , although it does not include new content such as units and graphical terrain tilesets . Insurrection was criticized by reviewers for lacking the quality of the original game and it is not widely available . Although the add @-@ on is authorized by Blizzard Entertainment , they offer no comment on support or availability of the game . 
 Retribution is the second of the two authorized add @-@ on packs released for StarCraft . The add @-@ on was developed by Stardock and published by <unk> Software . It was released for the PC in late 1998 . The game is set during the second campaign in StarCraft , revolving around the acquisition of a crystal of immense power connected to the Xel 'Naga . Divided into three campaigns , the player assumes the roles of a Protoss fleet executor , the commander of a Dominion task force and a Zerg cerebrate , all tasked with retrieving the crystal from a Dominion colony and getting it off the planet as quickly as possible . As with its predecessor , Retribution does not include any new gameplay features beyond its single player campaigns and an abundance of multiplayer levels . The add @-@ on was not well received by reviewers , and instead was regarded as average but at least challenging . Retribution is not widely available , and Blizzard Entertainment offers no comment regarding support or the availability of Retribution despite authorizing the add @-@ on . 
 StarCraft : Ghost is a tactical stealth game for consoles developed under supervision of Blizzard Entertainment . Announced in 2002 , the game was constantly delayed due to various issues , most notably including a change of development team from Nihilistic Software to Swingin ' Ape Studios in July 2004 . As updates for the game became less frequent and the graphics and game mechanics more outdated , suspicion began to grow that Blizzard would cancel the game . On March 24 , 2006 , Blizzard indefinitely postponed the game 's development . The story of the game is based around Nova , a psychic assassin in the employ of the Terran Dominion . Although frequently used as an example of development hell , Blizzard Entertainment 's Rob Pardo has indicated that he would like the game to be completed in the future , and Blizzard Entertainment refuses to list the game as having been canceled . 
 On August 23 , 2014 in an interview with Polygon about the cancellation of Blizzard 's next gen MMO Titan Chris Metzen confirmed that StarCraft : Ghost was also cancelled . " It was hard when we canceled Warcraft Adventures . It was hard when we canceled StarCraft : Ghost , " he said . " But it has always resulted in better @-@ quality work . " 
 = = Development = = 
 Blizzard Entertainment began planning development on StarCraft in 1995 , shortly after the beginning of development for Diablo . The development was led by Chris Metzen and James Phinney , who also created the game 's fictional universe . Using the Warcraft II : Tides of Darkness game engine as a base , StarCraft made its debut at E3 1996 . The game 's success led to the development of two authorized add @-@ ons , which were both released in 1998 . However , neither of the two add @-@ ons were particularly well received by critics . StarCraft also marked the debut of Blizzard Entertainment 's film department . Previously , cinematic cut scenes were seen as simply gap fillers that often deviated from the game , but with StarCraft and later Brood War introducing high quality cinematics integral to the storyline of the series , Blizzard Entertainment is cited as having changed this perception and became one of the first game companies to raise the standard regarding such cut scenes . 
 StarCraft 's success also inspired third @-@ party developer Microstar Software to release an unauthorized add @-@ on , entitled Stellar Forces , in May 1998 . Blizzard Entertainment consequently filed a lawsuit against Microstar for selling the add @-@ on , arguing that as the product was unauthorized and created using StarCraft 's level editing software , it was a breach of the end user license agreement . 
 In November 1998 , Blizzard Entertainment won the court case against Microstar Software . In the settlement , Microstar agreed to pay an undisclosed amount in punitive damages and to destroy all remaining copies of Stellar Forces in its possession , as well as to formally apologize to Blizzard Entertainment .
