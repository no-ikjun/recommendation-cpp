 In addition to Taiwan , China is also involved in other international territorial disputes . Since the 1990s , China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders , including a disputed border with India and an undefined border with Bhutan . China is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas , such as the Senkaku Islands and the Scarborough Shoal . On 21 May 2014 President Xi , speaking at a conference in Shanghai , pledged to settle China 's territorial disputes peacefully . " China stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests " , he said . 
 = = = = Emerging superpower status = = = = 
 China is regularly hailed as a potential new superpower , with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress , growing military might , very large population , and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century . Others , however , warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt China 's growth as the century progresses . Some authors also question the definition of " superpower " , arguing that China 's large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower , and noting that it lacks the military and cultural influence of the United States . 
 = = = Sociopolitical issues , human rights , and reform = = = 
 The Chinese democracy movement , social activists , and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform . While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s , political freedom is still tightly restricted . The Constitution of the People 's Republic of China states that the " fundamental rights " of citizens include freedom of speech , freedom of the press , the right to a fair trial , freedom of religion , universal suffrage , and property rights . However , in practice , these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state . Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling Communist Party are tolerated , censorship of political speech and information , most notably on the Internet , are routinely used to prevent collective action . In 2005 , Reporters Without Borders ranked China 159th out of 167 states in its Annual World Press Freedom Index , indicating a very low level of press freedom . In 2014 , China ranked 175th out of 180 countries . 
 Rural migrants to China 's cities often find themselves treated as second @-@ class citizens by the hukou household registration system , which controls access to state benefits . Property rights are often poorly protected , and taxation disproportionately affects poorer citizens . However , a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s , and additional social services provided to rural dwellers . 
 A number of foreign governments , foreign press agencies and NGOs also routinely criticize China 's human rights record , alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial , forced abortions , forced confessions , torture , restrictions of fundamental rights , and excessive use of the death penalty . The government has suppressed popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to " social stability " , as was the case with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 . 
 Falun Gong was first taught publicly in 1992 . In 1999 , when there were 70 million practitioners , the persecution of Falun Gong began , resulting in mass arrests , extralegal detention , and reports of torture and deaths in custody . The Chinese state is regularly accused of large @-@ scale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang , including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression . 
 The Chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights , and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country 's present level of economic development . It emphasizes the rise in the Chinese standard of living , literacy rate and average life expectancy since the 1970s , as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial Yangtze River floods . Furthermore , some Chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization , although others remain more conservative . Some major reform efforts have been conducted ; for an instance in November 2013 , the government announced plans to relax the one @-@ child policy and abolish the much @-@ criticized re @-@ education through labour program , though human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic . During the 2000s and early 2010s , the Chinese government was increasingly tolerant of NGOs that offer practical , efficient solutions to social problems , but such " third sector " activity remained heavily regulated . 
 = = Military = = 
 With 2 @.@ 3 million active troops , the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) is the largest standing military force in the world , commanded by the Central Military Commission ( CMC ) . The PLA consists of the Ground Force ( <unk> ) , the Navy ( PLAN ) , the Air Force ( PLAAF ) , and the People 's Liberation Army Rocket Force ( <unk> ) . According to the Chinese government , China 's military budget for 2014 totalled US $ 132 billion , constituting the world 's second @-@ largest military budget . However , many authorities – including SIPRI and the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense – argue that China does not report its real level of military spending , which is allegedly much higher than the official budget . 
 As a recognized nuclear weapons state , China is considered both a major regional military power and a potential military superpower . According to a 2013 report by the US Department of Defense , China fields between 50 and 75 nuclear ICBMs , along with a number of <unk> . However , compared with the other four UN Security Council Permanent Members , China has relatively limited power projection capabilities . To offset this , it has developed numerous power projection assets since the early 2000s – its first aircraft carrier entered service in 2012 , and it maintains a substantial fleet of submarines , including several nuclear @-@ powered attack and ballistic missile submarines . China has furthermore established a network of foreign military relationships along critical sea lanes . 
 China has made significant progress in modernising its air force in recent decades , purchasing Russian fighter jets such as the Sukhoi Su @-@ 30 , and also manufacturing its own modern fighters , most notably the Chengdu J @-@ 10 , J @-@ 20 and the Shenyang J @-@ 11 , J @-@ 15 , J @-@ 16 , and J @-@ 31 . China is furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous stealth aircraft and numerous combat drones . Air and Sea denial weaponry advances have increased the regional threat from the perspective of Japan as well as Washington . China has also updated its ground forces , replacing its ageing Soviet @-@ derived tank inventory with numerous variants of the modern Type 99 tank , and upgrading its battlefield C3I and <unk> systems to enhance its network @-@ centric warfare capabilities . In addition , China has developed or acquired numerous advanced missile systems , including anti @-@ satellite missiles , cruise missiles and submarine @-@ launched nuclear ICBMs . According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 's data , China became the world 's third largest exporter of major arms in 2010 – 14 , an increase of 143 per cent from the period 2005 – 09 . 
 = = Economy = = 
 As of 2014 , China has the world 's second @-@ largest economy in terms of nominal GDP , totalling approximately US $ 10 @.@ 380 trillion according to the International Monetary Fund . If purchasing power parity ( PPP ) is taken into account , China 's economy is the largest in the world , with a 2014 PPP GDP of US $ 17 @.@ 617 trillion . In 2013 , its PPP GDP per capita was US $ 12 @,@ 880 , while its nominal GDP per capita was US $ 7 @,@ 589 . Both cases put China behind around eighty countries ( out of 183 countries on the IMF list ) in global GDP per capita rankings . 
 = = = Economic history and growth = = = 
 From its founding in 1949 until late 1978 , the People 's Republic of China was a Soviet @-@ style centrally planned economy . Following Mao 's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the Cultural Revolution , Deng Xiaoping and the new Chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more market @-@ oriented mixed economy under one @-@ party rule . Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized , while foreign trade became a major new focus , leading to the creation of Special Economic Zones ( <unk> ) . Inefficient state @-@ owned enterprises ( <unk> ) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright , resulting in massive job losses . Modern @-@ day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership , and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism . The state still dominates in strategic " pillar " sectors such as energy production and heavy industries , but private enterprise has expanded enormously , with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008 . 
 Since economic liberalization began in 1978 , China has been among the world 's fastest @-@ growing economies , relying largely on <unk> and export @-@ led growth . According to the IMF , China 's annual average GDP growth between 2001 and 2010 was 10 @.@ 5 % . Between 2007 and 2011 , China 's economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the G7 countries ' growth combined . According to the Global Growth Generators index announced by Citigroup in February 2011 , China has a very high 3G growth rating . Its high productivity , low labour costs and relatively good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing . However , the Chinese economy is highly energy @-@ intensive and inefficient ; China became the world 's largest energy consumer in 2010 , relies on coal to supply over 70 % of its energy needs , and surpassed the US to become the world 's largest oil importer in September 2013 . In the early 2010s , China 's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles , weakening international demand for Chinese exports and fragility in the global economy . 
 In the online realm , China 's e @-@ commerce industry has grown more slowly than the EU and the US , with a significant period of development occurring from around 2009 onwards . According to Credit Suisse , the total value of online transactions in China grew from an insignificant size in 2008 to around RMB 4 trillion ( US $ 660 billion ) in 2012 . The Chinese online payment market is dominated by major firms such as <unk> , <unk> and China <unk> .

 China is a member of the WTO and is the world 's largest trading power , with a total international trade value of US $ 3 @.@ 87 trillion in 2012 . Its foreign exchange reserves reached US $ 2 @.@ 85 trillion by the end of 2010 , an increase of 18 @.@ 7 % over the previous year , making its reserves by far the world 's largest . In 2012 , China was the world 's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , attracting $ 253 billion . In 2014 , China 's foreign exchange remittances were $ <unk> billion making it the second largest recipient of remittances in the world . China also invests abroad , with a total outward FDI of $ 62 @.@ 4 billion in 2012 , and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies . In 2009 , China owned an estimated $ 1 @.@ 6 trillion of US securities , and was also the largest foreign holder of US public debt , owning over $ 1 @.@ 16 trillion in US Treasury bonds . China 's undervalued exchange rate has caused friction with other major economies , and it has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods . According to consulting firm McKinsey , total outstanding debt in China increased from $ 7 @.@ 4 trillion in 2007 to $ 28 @.@ 2 trillion in 2014 , which reflects 228 % of China 's GDP , a percentage higher than that of some G20 nations . 
 China ranked 29th in the Global Competitiveness Index in 2009 , although it is only ranked 136th among the 179 countries measured in the 2011 Index of Economic Freedom . In 2014 , Fortune 's Global 500 list of the world 's largest corporations included 95 Chinese companies , with combined revenues of US $ 5 @.@ 8 trillion . The same year , Forbes reported that five of the world 's ten largest public companies were Chinese , including the world 's largest bank by total assets , the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China .

 China 's middle @-@ class population ( if defined as those with annual income of between US $ 10 @,@ 000 and US $ 60 @,@ 000 ) had reached more than 300 million by 2012 . According to the <unk> Report , the number of US dollar billionaires in China increased from 130 in 2009 to 251 in 2012 , giving China the world 's second @-@ highest number of billionaires . China 's domestic retail market was worth over 20 trillion yuan ( US $ 3 @.@ 2 trillion ) in 2012 and is growing at over 12 % annually as of 2013 , while the country 's luxury goods market has expanded immensely , with 27 @.@ 5 % of the global share . However , in recent years , China 's rapid economic growth has contributed to severe consumer inflation , leading to increased government regulation . China has a high level of economic inequality , which has increased in the past few decades . In 2012 , China 's Gini coefficient was 0 @.@ 474 .

 In November 2010 , Russia began using the Chinese renminbi in its bilateral trade with China . This was soon followed by Japan , Australia , Singapore , the United Kingdom , and Canada .

 China was a world leader in science and technology until the Ming Dynasty . Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions , such as papermaking , printing , the compass , and gunpowder ( the Four Great Inventions ) , later became widespread in Asia and Europe . Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers . However , by the 17th century , the Western world had surpassed China in scientific and technological development . The causes of this Great Divergence continue to be debated . 
 After repeated military defeats by Western nations in the 19th century , Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self @-@ Strengthening Movement . After the Communists came to power in 1949 , efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union , in which scientific research was part of central planning . After Mao 's death in 1976 , science and technology was established as one of the Four <unk> , and the Soviet @-@ inspired academic system was gradually reformed . 
 = = = Modern era = = = 
 Since the end of the Cultural Revolution , China has made significant investments in scientific research , with $ 163 billion spent on scientific research and development in 2012 . Science and technology are seen as vital for achieving China 's economic and political goals , and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as " techno @-@ nationalism " . Nonetheless , China 's investment in basic and applied scientific research remains behind that of leading technological powers such as the United States and Japan . Chinese @-@ born scientists have won the Nobel Prize in Physics four times , the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine once respectively , though most of these scientists conducted their Nobel @-@ winning research in western nations . 
 China is rapidly developing its education system with an emphasis on science , mathematics and engineering ; in 2009 , it produced over 10 @,@ 000 Ph.D. engineering graduates , and as many as 500 @,@ 000 BSc graduates , more than any other country . China is also the world 's second @-@ largest publisher of scientific papers , producing 121 @,@ 500 in 2010 alone , including 5 @,@ 200 in leading international scientific journals . Chinese technology companies such as Huawei and Lenovo have become world leaders in telecommunications and personal computing , and Chinese supercomputers are consistently ranked among the world 's most powerful . China is furthermore experiencing a significant growth in the use of industrial robots ; from 2008 to 2011 , the installation of multi @-@ role robots in Chinese factories rose by 136 percent . 
 The Chinese space program is one of the world 's most active , and is a major source of national pride . In 1970 , China launched its first satellite , Dong Fang Hong I , becoming the fifth country to do so independently . In 2003 , China became the third country to independently send humans into space , with Yang <unk> 's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5 ; as of 2015 , ten Chinese nationals have journeyed into space , including two women . In 2011 , China 's first space station module , Tiangong @-@ 1 , was launched , marking the first step in a project to assemble a large manned station by the early 2020s . In 2013 , China successfully landed the Chang 'e 3 probe and Yutu rover onto the Moon ; China plans to collect lunar soil samples by 2017 .

 China currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country in the world , with over 1 billion users by February 2012 . It also has the world 's largest number of internet and broadband users , with over 688 million internet users as of 2016 , equivalent to around half of its population . The national average broadband connection speed is 9 @.@ 46 MB / s , ranking China 91st in the world in terms of internet speed . As of July 2013 , China accounts for 24 % of the world 's internet @-@ connected devices . Since 2011 China is the nation with the most installed telecommunication bandwidth in the world . By 2014 , China hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential than the U.S. , the historical leader in terms of installed telecommunication bandwidth ( China : 29 % versus US : 13 % of the global total ) . 
 China Telecom and China Unicom , the world 's two largest broadband providers , accounted for 20 % of global broadband subscribers . China Telecom alone serves more than 50 million broadband subscribers , while China Unicom serves more than 40 million . Several Chinese telecommunications companies , most notably Huawei and <unk> , have been accused of spying for the Chinese military . 
 China is developing its own satellite navigation system , dubbed <unk> , which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012 , and is planned to offer global coverage by 2020 .

 Since the late 1990s , China 's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways . In 2011 China 's highways had reached a total length of 85 @,@ 000 km ( 53 @,@ 000 mi ) , making it the longest highway system in the world . In 1991 , there were only six bridges across the main stretch of the Yangtze River , which bisects the country into northern and southern halves . By October 2014 , there were 81 such bridges and tunnels . 
 China has the world 's largest market for automobiles , having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production . Auto sales in 2009 exceeded 13 @.@ 6 million and may reach 40 million by 2020 . A side @-@ effect of the rapid growth of China 's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents , with poorly enforced traffic laws cited as a possible cause — in 2011 alone , around 62 @,@ 000 Chinese died in road accidents . In urban areas , bicycles remain a common mode of transport , despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – as of 2012 , there are approximately 470 million bicycles in China . 
 China 's railways , which are state @-@ owned , are among the busiest in the world , handling a quarter of the world 's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world 's tracks in 2006 . As of 2013 , the country had 103 @,@ 144 km ( 64 @,@ 091 mi ) of railways , the third longest network in the world . All provinces and regions are connected to the rail network except Macau . The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday , when the world 's largest annual human migration takes place . In 2013 , Chinese railways delivered 2 @.@ 106 billion passenger trips , generating 1 @,@ 059 @.@ 56 billion passenger @-@ kilometers and carried 3 @.@ 967 billion tons of freight , generating 2 @,@ 917 @.@ 4 billion cargo tons @-@ kilometers . 
 China 's high @-@ speed rail ( HSR ) system , built entirely since the early 2000s , had 11 @,@ 028 kilometres ( 6 @,@ 852 miles ) of track in 2013 and was the longest HSR network in the world .

The HSR track network is set to reach approximately 16 @,@ 000 km ( 9 @,@ 900 mi ) by 2020 . The Shanghai Maglev Train , which reaches 431 km / h ( 268 mph ) , is the fastest commercial train service in the world . 
 As of May 2014 , 20 Chinese cities have urban mass transit systems in operation , with a dozen more to join them by 2020 . The Shanghai Metro , Beijing Subway , Guangzhou Metro , Hong Kong MTR and Shenzhen Metro are among the longest and busiest in the world .

 Although a middle @-@ income country by Western standards , China 's rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty since 1978 . Today , about 10 % of the Chinese population lives below the poverty line of US $ 1 per day , down from 64 % in 1978 . Urban unemployment in China reportedly declined to 4 % by the end of 2007 . At present , the urban unemployment rate of China is about 4 @.@ 1 % . 
 With a population of over 1 @.@ 3 billion and dwindling natural resources , the government of China is very concerned about its population growth rate and has attempted since 1979 , with mixed results , to implement a strict family planning policy , known as the " one @-@ child policy . " Before 2013 , this policy sought to restrict families to one child each , with exceptions for ethnic minorities and a degree of flexibility in rural areas . A major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013 , allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child . The government is now dropping the one @-@ child policy in favor of a two @-@ child policy . Data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may now be around 1 @.@ 4 . 
 The policy , along with traditional preference for boys , may be contributing to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth . According to the 2010 census , the sex ratio at birth was 118 @.@ 06 boys for every 100 girls , which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls . The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51 @.@ 27 percent of the total population .

Languages of the Tibeto @-@ Burman branch , including Tibetan , Qiang , <unk> and Yi , are spoken across the Tibetan and Yunnan – Guizhou Plateau . Other ethnic minority languages in southwest China include Zhuang , Thai , Dong and Sui of the Tai @-@ Kadai family , Miao and Yao of the Hmong – Mien family , and Wa of the Austroasiatic family . Across northeastern and northwestern China , minority ethnic groups speak Altaic languages including Manchu , Mongolian and several Turkic languages : Uyghur , Kazakh , Kyrgyz , Salar and Western <unk> . Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea . <unk> , the language of Tajiks in western Xinjiang , is an Indo @-@ European language . Taiwanese aborigines , including a small population on the mainland , speak Austronesian languages . 
 Standard Mandarin , a variety of Mandarin based on the Beijing dialect , is the official national language of China and is used as a lingua franca in the country between people of different linguistic backgrounds . 
 Chinese characters have been used as the written script for the Sinitic languages for thousands of years . They allow speakers of mutually unintelligible Chinese varieties to communicate with each other through writing . In 1956 , the government introduced simplified characters , which have supplanted the older traditional characters in mainland China . Chinese characters are romanized using the Pinyin system . Tibetan uses an alphabet based on an Indic script . Uyghur is most commonly written in a Perseo @-@ Arabic script . The Mongolian script used in China and the Manchu script are both derived from the Old Uyghur alphabet . Modern Zhuang uses the Latin alphabet .

 China has urbanized significantly in recent decades . The percent of the country 's population living in urban areas increased from 20 % in 1980 to over 50 % in 2014 . It is estimated that China 's urban population will reach one billion by 2030 , potentially equivalent to one @-@ eighth of the world population . As of 2012 , there are more than 262 million migrant workers in China , mostly rural migrants seeking work in cities . 
 China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million , including the seven megacities ( cities with a population of over 10 million ) of Chongqing , Shanghai , Beijing , Guangzhou , Tianjin , Shenzhen , and Wuhan . By 2025 , it is estimated that the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants . The figures in the table below are from the 2010 census , and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits ; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations ( which includes suburban and rural populations ) . The large " floating populations " of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult ; the figures below include only long @-@ term residents .

The <unk> , China 's national university entrance exam , is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions . In 2010 , 27 percent of secondary school graduates are enrolled in higher education . Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level . 
 In February 2006 , the government pledged to provide completely free nine @-@ year education , including textbooks and fees . Annual education investment went from less than US $ 50 billion in 2003 to more than US $ 250 billion in 2011 . However , there remains an inequality in education spending . In 2010 , the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled ¥ 20 @,@ 023 , while in Guizhou , one of the poorest provinces in China , only totalled ¥ 3 @,@ 204 .

 As of 2010 , 94 % of the population over age 15 are literate , compared to only 20 % in 1950 . In 2009 , Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the world 's best results in mathematics , science and literacy , as tested by the Programme for International Student Assessment ( <unk> ) , a worldwide evaluation of 15 @-@ year @-@ old school pupils ' scholastic performance . Despite the high results , Chinese education has also faced both native and international criticism for its emphasis on rote memorization and its gap in quality from rural to urban areas . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 The National Health and Family Planning Commission , together with its counterparts in the local commissions , oversees the health needs of the Chinese population . An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s . At that time , the Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign , which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene , as well as treating and preventing several diseases . Diseases such as cholera , typhoid and scarlet fever , which were previously rife in China , were nearly eradicated by the campaign . After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978 , the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition , although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People 's Communes . Healthcare in China became mostly privatized , and experienced a significant rise in quality . In 2009 , the government began a 3 @-@ year large @-@ scale healthcare provision initiative worth US $ 124 billion . By 2011 , the campaign resulted in 95 % of China 's population having basic health insurance coverage . In 2011 , China was estimated to be the world 's third @-@ largest supplier of pharmaceuticals , but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of counterfeit medications . 
 As of 2012 , the average life expectancy at birth in China is 75 years , and the infant mortality rate is 12 per thousand . Both have improved significantly since the 1950s . Rates of stunting , a condition caused by malnutrition , have declined from 33 @.@ 1 % in 1990 to 9 @.@ 9 % in 2010 . Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities , China has several emerging public health problems , such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution , hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers , and an increase in obesity among urban youths . China 's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years , such as the 2003 outbreak of SARS , although this has since been largely contained . In 2010 , air pollution caused 1 @.@ 2 million premature deaths in China . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Over the millennia , Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements . The " three teachings " , including Confucianism , Buddhism , and Taoism , historically have a significant role in shaping Chinese culture . Elements of these three belief systems are often incorporated into popular or folk religious traditions . Freedom of religion is guaranteed by China 's constitution , although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution . 
 Demographically , the most widespread religious tradition is the Chinese folk religion , which overlaps with Taoism , and describes the worship of the shen ( 神 ) , a character that signifies the " energies of generation " . The shen comprises deities of the natural environment , gods representing specific concepts or groups , heroes and ancestors , and figures from Chinese mythology . Among the most popular folk cults are those of <unk> ( goddess of the seas ) , Yellow Emperor ( one of the two divine patriarchs of the Chinese race ) , Guandi ( god of war and business ) , <unk> ( god of prosperity and richness ) , <unk> and many others . China is home to many of the world 's tallest religious statues , including the tallest of all , the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan . 
 The government of the People 's Republic of China is officially atheist . Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the State Administration for Religious Affairs . A 2015 poll conducted by Gallup International found that 61 % of Chinese people self @-@ identified as " convinced atheist . " Scholars have noted that in China there is no clear boundary between religions , especially Buddhism , Taoism and local folk religious practice . According to the most recent demographic analyses , an average 30 — 80 % of the Chinese population practice some form of Chinese folk religions and Taoism . Approximately 10 — 16 % are Buddhists , 2 — 4 % are Christians , and 1 — 2 % are Muslims . In addition to Han people 's local religious practices , there are also various ethnic minority groups in China who maintain their traditional <unk> religions . Various sects of indigenous origin comprise 2 — 3 % of the population , while Confucianism as a religious self @-@ designation is popular among intellectuals . Significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include Tibetan Buddhism and the Islamic religion of the Hui and Uyghur peoples . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Since ancient times , Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism and conservative philosophies . For much of the country 's dynastic era , opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations , which have their origins in the Han Dynasty . The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China , such as the belief that calligraphy , poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama . Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward @-@ looking national perspective . Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today . 
 The first leaders of the People 's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order , but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals . They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture , such as rural land tenure , sexism , and the Confucian system of education , while preserving others , such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state . Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history , while others claim that the Communist Party 's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture , especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s , where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed , having been denounced as " regressive and harmful " or " vestiges of feudalism " . Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture , such as Confucianism , art , literature , and performing arts like Peking opera , were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time . Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted . 
 Today , the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society . With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution , various forms of traditional Chinese art , literature , music , film , fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival , and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide . China is now the third @-@ most @-@ visited country in the world , with 55 @.@ 7 million inbound international visitors in 2010 . It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism ; an estimated 740 million Chinese holidaymakers travelled within the country in October 2012 alone . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Chinese literature is based on the literature of the Zhou dynasty . Concepts covered within the Chinese classic texts present a wide range of thoughts and subjects including calendar , military , astrology , herbology , geography and many others . Some of the most important early texts include the I Ching and the <unk> within the Four Books and Five Classics which served as the Confucian authoritative books for the state @-@ sponsored curriculum in dynastic era . Inherited from the Classic of Poetry , classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty . Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively . Chinese historiography began with the Shiji , the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty @-@ Four Histories , which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore . Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty , Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical , town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin , Romance of the Three Kingdoms , Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber . Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong , it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the East Asian cultural sphere . 
 In the wake of the New Culture Movement after the end of the Qing dynasty , Chinese literature embarked on a new era with written vernacular Chinese for ordinary citizens . Hu Shih and Lu Xun were pioneers in modern literature . Various literary genres , such as misty poetry , scar literature and the <unk> literature , which is influenced by magic realism , emerged following the Cultural Revolution . Mo Yan , a <unk> literature author , was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012 . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Chinese cuisine is highly diverse , drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety , in which the most influential are known as the " Eight Major Cuisines " , including Sichuan , Cantonese , Jiangsu , Shandong , Fujian , Hunan , Anhui , and Zhejiang cuisines . All of them are featured by the precise skills of shaping , heating , <unk> and flavoring . Chinese cuisine is also known for its width of cooking methods and ingredients , as well as food therapy that is emphasized by traditional Chinese medicine . Generally , China 's staple food is rice in the south , wheat based breads and noodles in the north . The diet of the common people in pre @-@ modern times was largely grain and simple vegetables , with meat reserved for special occasions . And the bean products , such as tofu and soy milk , remain as a popular source of protein . Pork is now the most popular meat in China , accounting for about three @-@ fourths of the country 's total meat consumption . While there is also a Buddhist cuisine and an Islamic cuisine . Southern cuisine , due to the area 's proximity to the ocean and milder climate , has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables ; it differs in many respects from the wheat @-@ based diets across dry northern China . Numerous offshoots of Chinese food , such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese food , have emerged in the nations that play host to the Chinese diaspora . 
 = = = Sports = = = 
 China has become a prime sports destination worldwide . The country gained the hosting rights for several major global sports tournaments including the 2008 Summer Olympics , the 2015 World Championships in Athletics and the upcoming 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup . 
 China has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world . There is evidence that archery ( <unk> ) was practised during the Western Zhou Dynasty . <unk> ( <unk> ) and cuju , a sport loosely related to association football date back to China 's early dynasties as well . 
 Physical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture , with morning exercises such as qigong and t 'ai chi ch 'uan widely practised , and commercial gyms and fitness clubs gaining popularity in the country . Basketball is currently the most popular spectator sport in China . The Chinese Basketball Association and the American National Basketball Association have a huge following among the people , with native or ethnic Chinese players such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian held in high esteem . China 's professional football league was established in 2004 , it is the largest football market in Asia . Other popular sports in the country include martial arts , table tennis , badminton , swimming and snooker . Board games such as go ( known as <unk> in Chinese ) , xiangqi , mahjong , and more recently chess , are also played at a professional level . In addition , China is home to a huge number of cyclists , with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012 . Many more traditional sports , such as dragon boat racing , Mongolian @-@ style wrestling and horse racing are also popular . 
 China has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932 , although it has only participated as the PRC since 1952 . China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , where its athletes received 51 gold medals – the highest number of gold medals of any participating nation that year . China also won the most medals of any nation at the 2012 Summer Paralympics , with 231 overall , including 95 gold medals . In 2011 , Shenzhen in Guangdong , China hosted the 2011 Summer Universiade . China hosted the 2013 East Asian Games in Tianjin and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing . 
 = 1933 Cuba – Bahamas hurricane = 
 The 1933 Cuba – Bahamas hurricane was last of six major hurricanes , or at least a Category 3 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale , in the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season . It formed on October 1 in the Caribbean Sea as the seventeenth tropical storm , and initially moved slowly to the north . While passing west of Jamaica , the storm damaged banana plantations and killed one person . On October 3 , the storm became a hurricane , and the next day crossed western Cuba . Advance warning in the country prevented any storm @-@ related fatalities , although four people suspected of looting were shot and killed during a curfew in Havana . The German travel writer Richard Katz witnessed the hurricane while in Havana , and described the experience in his book " Loafing Around the Globe " ( " Ein <unk> um Die Welt " ) . 
 After entering the Florida Straits , the hurricane turned to the northeast , producing tropical storm winds along the Florida Keys . High rainfall caused flooding , while three tornadoes spawned by the storm damaged houses in the Miami area . The hurricane reached peak winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) on October 6 while moving through the Bahamas . It subsequently weakened and became extratropical on October 8 . The former hurricane lashed the coast of Nova Scotia with high winds and rain , leaving about $ 1 million ( 1933 CAD ) in damage . Rough seas sank several ships and killed nine people in the region . The remnants of the hurricane eventually dissipated on October 9 to the south of Newfoundland . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Toward the end of September 1933 , there was a large area of disturbed weather across the southern Caribbean Sea . By September 30 , a low pressure area developed south of San Andrés island . The next day , observations from a station at Cabo Gracias a Dios and a ship indicated a tropical storm had developed off the eastern coast of Honduras . Low atmospheric pressure suggested the system had winds of tropical storm force despite lack of direct observations . Moving northward , the storm gained size as it slowly intensified . Based on observations and interpolation of data , it is estimated the storm became a hurricane early on October 3 while passing west of Jamaica . That day , a station at South <unk> Point that day reported a force 8 on the Beaufort scale , well to the east of the center . While approaching the southern coast of Cuba , the hurricane reached estimated winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . At 0900 UTC on October 4 , the hurricane made landfall on the Zapata Peninsula of Cuba , followed by a second landfall on the Cuban mainland three hours later . Beginning at 1600 UTC that day , the capital , Havana , observed the passage of the eye , where a pressure of 976 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) was reported . 
 The hurricane weakened slightly over land before emerging into the Straits of Florida and re @-@ intensifying . On October 5 , it turned to the northeast while remaining southeast of the Florida mainland , although the strongest winds remained over water . Early on October 6 while the hurricane was moving through the Bahamas , a ship reported a pressure of 958 mbar ( 28 @.@ 3 inHg ) , although it was unknown if it was in the center or the periphery of the storm . Based on the data , the maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) , although the ship estimated winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . The storm maintained peak winds for about 18 hours , after which it weakened while accelerating to the northeast . After passing to the west of Bermuda on October 7 , the hurricane became extratropical the next day while still maintaining hurricane force winds . The storm brushed the coast of Nova Scotia before it was last noted approaching another extratropical storm on October 9 to the south of Atlantic Canada . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Early in its duration , the developing storm brushed the coast of Honduras with light winds . In Jamaica , gusts approached hurricane force , while heavy rainfall damaged transportation in Kingston . The storm wrecked small houses and damaged the local banana industry . There was one death in Jamaica . The hurricane crossed western Cuba with winds estimated at 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . This prompted officials to declare a curfew for the capital in the midst of political upheaval following a coup . A newspaper described the curfew before the storm as " the most peaceful night in a week . " However , the government ordered soldiers in Havana to shoot anyone suspected of looting , and four looters were killed during the storm 's passage . Heavy associated rainfall caused rivers to overflow in three provinces , flooding low @-@ lying areas . In Cienfuegos , the storm destroyed several houses . Offshore northern Cuba , two United States ships took shelter at the port in Matanzas due to rough seas . High tides flooded the Havana waterfront up to 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) deep , and several boats sank at the city 's harbor . Due to advance warning and evacuations , there were no direct deaths in the country , and 20 people were injured . 
 Storm warnings were issued on the west coast of Florida to Boca Grande and on the east coast to Titusville , with hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys . Although the hurricane passed just southeast of the Florida Keys , the highest winds reported in Florida were 44 mph ( 70 km / h ) in Key West . The storm passed closest to Long Key , where winds were estimated at 63 mph ( 102 km / h ) , due to being on the weak side of the storm . Farther north , Miami reported winds of 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) . Rainfall reached over 11 in ( 280 mm ) in 24 hours in Key West . There , the storm knocked over several trees and caused some power outages . Portions of the city were flooded while boats were washed ashore . Elsewhere in Florida , three tornadoes were reported during the hurricane 's passage . In Fort Lauderdale , a tornado injured one person , and another one in Miami knocked down four homes and injured two . The third tornado was in Hollywood , where several houses were damaged . 
 Later as the hurricane moved through the Bahamas , it produced winds of 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) at Hope Town and 91 mph ( 146 km / h ) at Millville , both on Abaco . The outer periphery of the storm brushed Nantucket to the west with winds of 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) and Bermuda to the east with 46 mph ( 75 km / h ) . 
 While moving offshore Atlantic Canada , the former hurricane produced gale force winds , peaking at 52 mph ( 83 km / h ) in Halifax , Nova Scotia . There , the storm also dropped heavy rainfall reaching 9 @.@ 84 in ( 250 mm ) over two days , including 3 @.@ 6 in ( 90 mm ) in 24 hours . Flooding covered streets in the province , causing traffic jams , and farmlands . In Annapolis Valley , the rainfall washed out a bridge while the winds damaged about one @-@ third of the apple crop . The dam at Chocolate Lake overflowed due to the rainfall , and a dam broke in Great Village , destroying a nearby bridge . Many trees fell during the storm , resulting in power outages after some fell onto lines . Outside Nova Scotia , the storm produced winds of 51 mph ( 81 km / h ) in Shediac , New Brunswick , where high waves left coastal damage . In Newfoundland , the storm washed out three bridges , as well as portions of roads and rails , and flooded one house . Throughout Atlantic Canada , high waves washed ashore , sank , or broke at least ten boats from their moorings , killing nine people including seven from an overturned boat sailing from Boston to Yarmouth . Overall damage in Canada was estimated at around $ 1 million ( 1933 CAD ) , including $ 250 @,@ 000 in lost apple crop . 
 = Merv Harvey = 
 Mervyn Roye Harvey ( 29 April 1918 – 18 March 1995 ) was a cricketer who played in one Test match for Australia in 1947 . His younger brother , Neil , was one of Australia 's finest batsmen , and the pair played together for Victoria during the latter part of Merv 's career . 
 Merv Harvey broke into the Victorian state team during the 1940 – 41 season and played in three first @-@ class matches . The highlight of the first phase of his career for Victoria was a rapid 70 in one hour against a New South Wales attack containing Bill O 'Reilly , regarded as the best bowler in the world at the time . However , the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific caused the suspension of top @-@ level cricket and halted Harvey ’ s progress . Harvey then served in the Royal Australian Air Force as an airframe fitter , losing his best cricketing years to the war . 
 An opening batsman , Harvey was described by Neil as " the greatest cricketer of us all " and known for his attacking style and penchant for hooking fast bowlers . He was initially overlooked for Victorian selection after cricket resumed in 1945 – 46 , before being recalled for the final match of the season , and he responded by scoring a career @-@ best 163 . He was a regular member of the Victorian team during the 1946 – 47 season , and although he faced much competition for national selection as Australia had an abundance of quality openers at the time , he was selected for his only Test during the fourth Test of the season against England at the Adelaide Oval when both Bill Brown and Sid Barnes were injured . Harvey made 12 and 31 before being dropped immediately due to Barnes ' recovery . 
 In 1947 – 48 , Harvey played with younger brothers Neil and Ray in two matches for Victoria , captaining the team in the second of these fixtures . However , his own form began to wane and he was dropped from the team mid @-@ way through the season . In 1948 – 49 , Harvey remained outside the first @-@ choice team , and played in only two first @-@ class matches against Tasmania when Victoria fielded a second @-@ string team . He retired at the end of the season , having played only 22 first @-@ class matches in an interrupted career . Harvey captained his state five times during the post @-@ war phase of his career , standing in when regular captain Lindsay Hassett was away on national duty . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Merv Harvey was born in Broken Hill , New South Wales to Horace " Horrie " and Elsie Harvey . Horace worked for BHP driving horse @-@ drawn trailers . Merv was the second child in the family and the oldest son . Five younger brothers were to follow , in chronological order Mick , Harold , Ray , Neil and Brian . The family relocated to Newcastle , a mining town and harbour in New South Wales , before shifting to the inner @-@ Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy , a staunchly working @-@ class , industrial area . Horace secured a job at the confectionery company Life Savers ( Australasia ) Ltd , located next door to their house at 198 Argyle Street . The 19th century two @-@ storey house was owned by the firm and was used as lodgings for the workers ’ families . It no longer exists , having been demolished to make way for a textile factory . 
 The Cornish @-@ descended Horace raised his family as strict Methodists , disallowing gambling , alcohol , tobacco and profanity in his household . An ardent cricketer during his years in New South Wales , he was good enough to hit 196 runs during a match in Newcastle , and he encouraged his children to play sport . He himself played for the Rita Social Club after moving to Fitzroy . 
 As recreational facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy , Merv and his younger brothers played cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house . Here they played cricket with a tennis ball , home made cricket bat and a kerosene tin for a wicket . They were usually joined by other local children , two of whom became elite sportsmen : Allan Ruthven and Harold Shillinglaw . The group also played Australian rules football , kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper . Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers has been attributed to these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway . The surface also had a V @-@ shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane , causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing . As the laneway meant that the playing area was long and narrow , the young boys also had to learn to play the ball straight in accordance with orthodox cricket technique . The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard using a marble instead of a ball , and a miniature bat . This sharpened their reflexes . 
 Merv was the first of the brothers to attend the nearby George Street State School and join the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens . The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year . The successful student would then be given access to all of the club 's facilities . All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal . At Fitzroy , they came under the influence of former Victorian all @-@ rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club ’ s veteran captain Joe Plant . Merv and his younger siblings had no formal coaching , and their father , a regular presence at the club , chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed . Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat , allowing them to formulate their own style and technique . According to the brothers , it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted , in contrast to their reserved father . The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty , and according to them , their parents never showed favouritism . 
 During the winter , they played baseball for Fitzroy Baseball Club , often competing in matches played as curtain raisers to the elite Australian rules football competition , the Victorian Football League . Saturday night entertainment for the family typically consisted of dinner after the day ’ s cricket matches for Fitzroy , and Plant , Liddicut and other cricket club personnel were often invited . Under the influence of Plant and Liddicut , the boys were taught to adopt an aggressive approach , using fast feet movement to attack spin bowling in particular . In 1932 , Harvey captained the Victorian Under @-@ 15 schoolboys team on a tour of Queensland and one of his players was future Victorian and Australian teammate Keith Miller . Harvey graduated to Fitzroy 's first XI in 1933 – 34 . 
 = = First @-@ class beginnings = = 
 During the 1938 – 39 season , Harvey was selected for the Victorian Second XI to play in a match against their counterparts from New South Wales . Harvey was run out for four in the first innings and then made eight as his team succumbed to a 227 @-@ run defeat . As a result , he was not called up into the First XI for the next two years . 
 Harvey made his first @-@ class debut for Victoria against Queensland at the Gabba in 1940 – 41 . In the first innings , he made 25 before being caught by wicket @-@ keeper Don Tallon from the bowling of Jack Ellis as the visitors took first innings points in a drawn match . In the next match , he made an impression . After making 35 in the first innings , he scored 70 in an hour 's batting in the second innings at the SCG against New South Wales . In both innings , he was dismissed by leg spinner Bill O 'Reilly , the leading bowler in the world , but Victoria managed to prevail by 24 runs . The teams met again three weeks later , and this time , New South Wales turned the table , winning by 235 runs . Harvey made 14 in the first innings , bowled by O 'Reilly for the second innings in a row . In the second innings he made 38 before being removed by another leg spinner , Cec Pepper . Harvey ended the season with 182 runs at 36 @.@ 40 . 
 Harvey enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) at Fitzroy on 12 May 1942 and was a member of the 30 Squadron . He served as an airframe fitter during World War II , which severely interrupted his sporting career , and first @-@ class cricket was cancelled after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor prompted the outbreak of hostilities in the Pacific . He was discharged on 25 January 1946 with the rank of aircraftman . According to cricket administrator Bill Jacobs , the war cost Harvey his prime cricketing years . Jacobs believed that Harvey would have been selected for Australia in the period otherwise interrupted by war . 
 = = Post @-@ war resumption and only Test = = 
 After the war ended in 1945 , first @-@ class cricket resumed in 1945 – 46 . Harvey played in a trial match for state selection . Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first @-@ choice state team , he made 82 and 25 . This was not enough to convince the state selectors and Harvey did not get a recall to the Victorian team until the end of the season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval . He responded by striking a career @-@ best 163 to help his team to an innings win . 
 Immediately after the war , Harvey faced a lot of competition for a place as an opening batsman in the Australian team , but a vacancy arose in 1946 – 47 , when Bill Brown , who had captained Australia the previous season and opened for the country in Tests in the 1930s , was sidelined with injury for the whole summer . 
 In the first match of the season , Harvey ’ s Victorians faced the touring England cricket team led by Wally Hammond . In the first innings , Harvey made 21 of the team ’ s 189 before being caught and bowled by leg spinner Doug Wright . He then made 57 before being dismissed by Alec Bedser as the hosts fell for only 204 in pursuit of 449 for victory , losing by 244 runs . 
 This was enough for him to be selected in the Australian XI for a match against the Englishmen , in what was effectively a Test dress rehearsal . Rain curtailed the match , and the game did not reach the second innings ; Harvey made 22 in his only opportunity . 
 There was another match for Victoria against South Australia before the Tests , allowing him another chance to push his claim for national selection . It was also his first Sheffield Shield match ; his previous appearances for Victoria in interstate games were in seasons where the competition was called off due to war and replaced by one @-@ off matches . Harvey could manage only 9 as Victoria amassed 548 in their first innings . They needed 79 runs for victory in 35 minutes on the last afternoon , and with quick scoring required , the more aggressive Keith Miller opened in place of Harvey . When the first wicket fell with the target almost completed , Harvey came in and made three not out by the time the match was over . These performances were not enough for the Australian selectors and Harvey was overlooked for the team for the first two Tests . 
 After this , Harvey had two opportunities to press for selection for the next Test . He made 13 in an innings victory over Queensland and continued to be overlooked . The second match was the Shield clash with arch @-@ rivals New South Wales , which started on Boxing Day at the MCG . After the visitors had made 205 , Harvey opened with Ken Meuleman , who was out at 1 / 31 , bringing Miller to the crease . Miller hammered the bowling and Victoria were 1 / 154 at the end of the day . The next day , the 271 @-@ run partnership ended after just over three hours when Miller fell at 2 / 302 . Harvey went on to make 136 in what was generally regarded as his best innings . He famously hooked leading Australian paceman Ray Lindwall , the fastest in the world at the time , over the fence into the public bar for six . It was one of the few occasions that Lindwall was hit for six in his long career . Victoria declared at 8 / 560 , Test bowlers Lindwall and Ernie Toshack taking the most punishment with figures of 1 / 100 and 0 / 133 from 18 and 21 overs respectively , as Victoria went on to win by an innings and 114 runs . 
 In the return match against Queensland , Harvey made 17 as Victoria took a convincing innings win . In the next match against New South Wales , Harvey played with Neil for the first time at first @-@ class level , and pair played together for their state ’ s two remaining matches of the season , although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in , usually at No. 6 . Merv made 30 and 44 , failing to capitalise on his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning ; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test . 
 Nevertheless , Harvey was selected to play his only Test , the Fourth Test at Adelaide , filling in for the injured Barnes . England batted first and made 460 before being dismissed late on the second day . Harvey opened with Arthur Morris , and made 12 in the first innings before being bowled by Bedser while playing an aggressive shot . With only a few minutes of play left , the Australian captain Don Bradman came in and he too was bowled by Bedser , without scoring a run . Harvey later privately said the Bradman had told him to play cautiously and survive until the end of the day , rather than attack , and that the captain was angry with the resulting two wickets . According to Harvey , Bradman told him that he would never be selected for Australia again . The tourists then declared during the last afternoon and left Australia a target of 314 . The target was not a realistic offer and Morris and Harvey put on an opening stand of 116 before the latter was bowled for 31 by the medium pace of occasional bowler Norman Yardley . The match ended in a draw with Australia on 1 / 215 . 
 Barnes recovered and resumed his position for the Fifth Test . Harvey ended his season by scoring 10 in his only innings of Victoria ’ s second tour match against England , which was drawn , and was 3 not out in the first innings of the Shield match against South Australia when it was washed out . Harvey made his captaincy debut in the latter match as Lindsay Hassett was representing Australia in the Fifth Test , and his bowlers dismissed South Australia for 222 in Victoria ’ s only innings in the field . This washed @-@ out drawn match was the only time in six Shield matches during the season that Victoria did not emerge victorious , and they won the competition . Harvey ended the season with 405 runs at 33 @.@ 75 . 
 = = Final seasons = = 
 By 1947 – 48 , Brown had recovered , so Harvey had to compete with him as well as Morris and Barnes for selection . In the first match of the season against the touring Indians , Harvey made 4 and 35 . The following week , he made 89 in the first innings against South Australia but managed only three in the second innings as the Victorians collapsed to be all out for 182 and lost by nine wickets . Harvey was overlooked for the Australian XI for the Test trial against India the following week . Instead , he played in the match against Queensland , scoring only 13 and 3 . He was subsequently overlooked for the Test selection . During this time , he played alongside Neil in all but the Queensland match , when his younger brother was playing in the Australian XI . However , neither batted together . 
 Neil returned to the Victorian team for the match against New South Wales at the SCG the following week , and Ray was selected to make his first @-@ class debut , so three Harveys were in the state team for the first time . Merv opened , while Neil and Ray batted at Nos. 4 and 7 respectively . Victoria batted first and the brothers again did not form any partnerships . Merv opened and made 45 as Victoria ended with 331 ; the Harvey brothers had scored almost half the runs . New South Wales were forced to follow on , and Victoria were set 51 for victory . After the fall of Fred Freer at 1 / 24 , captain Lindsay Hassett elevated Ray to No. 3 , allowing two Harveys to bat together for the first time at first @-@ class level . Ray and Merv put on an unbeaten partnership of 27 to take Victoria to a nine @-@ wicket win . Merv and Ray ended unbeaten on 12 and 22 respectively . 
 The trio then proceeded to play together in the next match against Western Australia two weeks later and Merv captained the team as Hassett was away on Test duty . Victoria batted first and Neil came in to join Merv with the score at 2 / 102 , and the pair added 173 together before the younger brother fell for 94 . One run later , Merv was out for 141 in what turned out to be his final first @-@ class century ; later , Ray made only 1 . Victoria ended on 370 and Western Australia took a 59 @-@ run lead . In the second innings , Merv made 6 and did not bat with his brothers . He declared the innings at 9 / 304 , setting Western Australia a target of 246 for victory . They reached 5 / 205 and Victoria avoided defeat . A fortnight later , Harvey again captained the team and made a duck in his only innings in a rain @-@ curtailed match . After the Victorians had made 412 , Queensland reached 5 / 144 at the end of the match . Despite being the captain , Harvey was dropped for the next match and was overlooked for the rest of the season , ending with 351 runs at 35 @.@ 10 . 
 After being dropped for the second half of the previous season , Harvey had even less opportunities in 1948 – 49 . His only matches for Victoria came during the Christmas period , when he played consecutive fixtures , both against Tasmania . Although the two games had first @-@ class status , they were effectively Second XI fixtures , as the first @-@ choice team was playing Sheffield Shield matches at the same time . Victoria only batted once in each innings and Harvey made 7 and 36 respectively . Harvey captained the team , and they dominated both matches . The Victorians took a first @-@ innings lead of 171 in the first match , but rain interruptions ended the match with Tasmania at 1 / 100 in their second innings , still 71 runs in arrears . In the second match , Victoria dismissed their opponents for 65 in the first innings to take a lead of 309 runs and they went on to win by an innings and 73 runs . Having seen his previous four matches as captain end in a draw , Harvey ended his first @-@ class career with his only victory as a leader in his final match . 
 Harvey continued playing in the First XI for Fitzroy until 1954 – 55 , and he finished with 6 @,@ 654 runs at 29 @.@ 31 in 207 First XI matches for the club . Harvey was an attacking opening batsman , strong on the drive and fond of hooking fast bowling . His brother Neil called him " the greatest cricketer of us all " . 
 = = Outside cricket = = 
 Harvey worked for more than five decades for the same engineering firm , and lived with his wife Myrtle in the western industrial suburb of Footscray . He had two sons , Jeff and Graeme , both of whom played in first grade for Fitzroy . His grandson Robert Harvey — son of Jeff — was one of the leading Australian rules footballers of the 1990s and the early 21st century . Robert made his Australian Football League debut for St Kilda Football Club in 1988 and played 21 seasons . He was a member of the All @-@ Australian team eight times and won the Brownlow Medal twice , in 1997 and 1998 , for the best and fairest player . Robert played for Victoria at Under @-@ 19 level as a bowler , but he was already playing top @-@ flight football at the time and gave up his cricket career after the national Under @-@ 19 tournament . Another grandson Anthony , the younger brother of Robert , also played for St Kilda and captained Norwood to the 1997 South Australian National Football League ( SANFL ) premiership . 
 = Hiroh Kikai = 
 Hiroh Kikai ( <unk> <unk> , Kikai Hiroo , born 18 March 1945 ) is a Japanese photographer best known within Japan for four series of monochrome photographs : scenes of buildings in and close to Tokyo , portraits of people in the Asakusa area of Tokyo , and rural and town life in India and Turkey . He has pursued each of these for over two decades , and each has led to one or more book @-@ length collections . 
 Although previously a respected name in Japanese photography , Kikai was not widely known until 2003 , when the first edition of his book Persona , a collection of Asakusa portraits , won both the Domon Ken Award and Annual Award of the PSJ . In 2009 , the ICP and Steidl copublished Asakusa Portraits for an international market . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Kikai was born in the village of Daigo ( now part of <unk> , Yamagata Prefecture ) on 18 March 1945 as the seventh and last child ( and fifth son ) of the family . He had a happy childhood , from the age of 11 or so preferring to play by himself in the nature that surrounded the village . He graduated from high school in 1963 and worked in Yamagata for a year , and then went to Hosei University in Tokyo to study philosophy . As a student he was keen on the cinema — he particularly enjoyed the films of Andrzej Wajda , who would later contribute essays to some of his books , and Satyajit Ray — and has said that he would have worked in film production if it did not require writing , a task he has never enjoyed , and money , which he lacked . 
 Immediately after his graduation in 1968 , Kikai worked for two years as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard . Meanwhile , he stayed in touch with his philosophy professor from his university days , Sadayoshi Fukuda , whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi ; he introduced Kikai to its editor , Shōji Yamagishi , who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai . Kikai started to take photographs in 1969 . At that time ( when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥ 40 @,@ 000 per month ) , a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥ 600 @,@ 000 ; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥ 320 @,@ 000 and mentioned this to Fukuda , who immediately lent him the money , with no interest , and no date or pressure for repayment . ( The loan was eventually repaid . ) This Hasselblad <unk> , with its <unk> lens , is what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since . 
 = = Career = = 
 Kikai thought that work on a boat might be photogenic , but , having no experience , could not get a job on one . He was eventually accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port . He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972 , with a stop in Manzanillo ( Mexico ) for provisions . It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published , in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi . In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers ’ Association . But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills , and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo ( 1973 – 76 ) . He became a freelance photographer in 1984 , a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second . 
 Living close to Asakusa ( Tokyo ) , Kikai often went there on his days off , taking photographs of visitors . He stepped up his visits in 1985 ; a number of collections of his portraits taken there have been published . 
 Kikai ’ s other long @-@ term photographic projects are of working and residential neighborhoods in and near Tokyo , and of people and scenes in India and Turkey . All these are black and white . However , his occasional diversions have included color photographs of the Gotō Islands and even of nudes . 
 Unusually in Japan , where photographers tend to join or form groups , Kikai has never been in any group , preferring to work by himself . When not setting out to take photographs , Kikai does not carry a camera with him . He leaves photographing his own family to his wife Noriko , and it is she who has the camera if they go on a trip together . 
 In the early part of his career , Kikai often had to earn money in other ways : after three years ’ work in the darkroom , he returned to manual labor . 
 Kikai taught for some time at Musashino Art University , but he was disappointed by the students ’ lack of sustained effort and therefore quit . 
 = = = Asakusa portraits = = = 
 Kikai had started his Asakusa series of square , monochrome portraits as early as 1973 , but after this there was a hiatus until 1985 , when he realized that an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō @-@ ji . At that time , the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints : the single subject stands directly in front of the camera ( originally a Minolta <unk> TLR , later the Hasselblad ) , looking directly at it , and is shown from around the knees upwards . Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours , hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph , and three or four days may pass without a single photograph ; but he may photograph three people in a single day , and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way . He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole , and as somebody on whom time is marked , without any distracting or limiting specificity . 
 Though Kikai started to photograph in Asakusa simply because it was near where he then lived , he has continued because of the nature of the place and its visitors . Once a bustling and fashionable area , Asakusa long ago lost this status . If it were as popular and crowded as it was before the war , Kikai says , he would go somewhere else . 
 Published in 1987 , Ōtachi no shōzō / Ecce Homo was the first collection of these portraits . It is a large @-@ format book with portraits made in Asakusa in 1985 – 86 . Kikai won the 1988 Newcomer ’ s Award of the Photographic Society of Japan ( PSJ ) for this book and the third Ina Nobuo Award for the accompanying exhibition . 
 In 1995 , a number of portraits from the series were shown together with the works of eleven other photographers in “ Tokyo / City of Photos ” , one of a pair of opening exhibitions for the purpose @-@ made building of the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography . 
 Ya @-@ Chimata , published a year later , has a greater number of portraits printed more cheaply on smaller pages . 
 Persona ( 2003 ) is a further collection of portraits made in Asakusa . A few are from Kikai ’ s earliest work , but most postdate anything in the earlier books . Several of the subjects appear twice or more often , so the reader sees the effect of time . The book format is unusually large for a photograph collection in Japan , and the plates were printed via <unk> . The book won the 23rd Domon Ken Award and 2004 Annual Award of the PSJ . A smaller @-@ format edition with additional photographs followed two years later . 
 Asakusa Portraits ( 2008 ) is a large collection edited by the International Center of Photography ( New York ) , published in conjunction with the ICP ’ s exhibition of recent Japanese photography and art “ Heavy Light ” . Kikai ’ s contribution to this exhibition was well received , and Asakusa Portraits won praise for its photography and also ( from Paul Smith ) for the vernacular fashion of those photographed . 
 = = = Portraits of spaces = = = 
 Kikai has said that people and scenery are two sides of the same coin . When tired of waiting ( or photographing ) in Asakusa , he walks as far as 20 km looking for urban scenes of interest where he can make “ portraits of spaces ” . A day ’ s walk might take two or three hours for less than a single roll of 120 film . He generally photographs between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. , and avoids photographing when people are outside as their presence would transform the photographs into mere snapshots , easily understood ; even without people , they are the images or reflections of life . Kikai may find a scene that he wants to photograph and then wait there and only photograph it when something unexpected occurs in the frame . After development , he does not bother with contact prints , instead judging a photograph by the negative alone . 
 Samples from this series have appeared in various magazines from at least as early as 1976 . Each photograph is simply captioned with the approximate address ( in Japanese script ) and year . 
 Tōkyō meiro / Tokyo Labyrinth ( 1999 ) presents portraits of <unk> spaces in Tokyo ( and occasionally the adjacent town of Kawasaki ) . There are individual <unk> , rows of shops and residential streets . Most of the buildings are unpretentious . Like the Asakusa series , these portraits are monochrome and square , taken via a standard lens on 120 film . 
 Tōkyō mutan / Labyrinthos ( 2007 ) — based on an essay / photograph series that ran in the monthly Sōshi ( <unk> ) from March 2004 to July 2005 and then in the web series “ Tokyo Polka ” — presents more of the same . Between a single nude in a shopfront display from 1978 and a very young boy photographed in December 2006 ( the latter appearing to share the Sensō @-@ ji backdrop of Persona ) , are square monochrome views of Tokyo and Kawasaki , compositions that seem casual and rather disorderly , mostly of <unk> scenes showing signs of intensive and recent use . The book also has Kikai ’ s essays from “ Tokyo Polka ” , essays that dwell on the inhabitants of Tokyo as observed during walks or on the train . 
 Tokyo View ( 2016 ) is a large @-@ format collection , mostly of photographs that also appear in one or other of the earlier books ( or Tōkyō pōtoreito / Tokyo Portraits ) . 
 = = = India = = = 
 Kikai has said that going to India feels like a return to the Yamagata of his youth , and a release from life in Tokyo . His photography there is much less planned or formal than his portraits of people or places in Tokyo : after an early start with color 120 film , he uses black and white 35mm film in India — and has laughingly said that he would use 35mm in Tokyo if the city were more interesting and didn ’ t make him feel unhappy . 
 India , a large @-@ format book published in 1992 , presents photographs taken in India ( and to a much lesser extent Bangladesh ) over a period totalling rather more than a year and ranging from 1982 to 1990 . It won high praise from the critic Kazuo <unk> , who commented that the India of Kikai ’ s work seems perpetually overcast , and that in their ambiguity his photographs seem to benefit from the work done in the Asakusa portrait series . The book won Kikai the 1993 Society of Photography Award . 
 Shiawase / Shanti ( 2001 ) is a collection of photographs that concentrates on children , most of which were taken in Allahabad , Benares , Calcutta , Puri and Delhi in 2000 . It won the Grand Prix of the second Photo City <unk> Festival . 
 = = = Turkey = = = 
 Wanting to explore somewhere that ( in contrast to India ) was cold , as well as a Muslim land where Asian and European cultures meet , in 1994 Kikai made the first of six visits to Turkey , where he has stayed for a total of nine months . His monochrome photographs of Turkey appeared in the magazine Asahi Camera , and his colour photographs on its website , before the publication in January 2011 of his large book Anatolia , a compilation of his monochrome work . 
 = = = Photography elsewhere = = = 
 Kikai was one of thirteen Japanese photographers invited by EU – Japan Fest to photograph the twenty @-@ six nations of the European Union ; he spent twenty @-@ one days in Malta in September 2005 and a short period in Portugal in October 2004 , travelling widely in both countries . In color , these photographs are a departure from his earlier work . Most are more or less candid photographs of people . A collection was published as the eighth in a series of fourteen volumes , In @-@ between . 
 Series of color photographs from short visits to Cuba ( 2007 ) and Taiwan ( 2013 ) have appeared in Asahi Camera . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Kikai 's essays have appeared in periodicals and within some of his own <unk> . They have also been collected in four books , in which they are illustrated by reproductions of relevant photographs . 
 Indo ya Gassan ( “ India and Gassan ” , 1999 ) is a collection about and photographs of India . Gassan is a mountain in central Yamagata close to where Kikai was brought up ; Kikai muses on India and compares it with the Yamagata of his youth . 
 Me to kaze no <unk> ( “ Memories of the eye and the wind ” , 2012 ) collects essays published in Yamagata Shinbun ( <unk> ) since 2006 ; Dare <unk> <unk> <unk> ni naru hi : <unk> <unk> ( “ Days when you come to like anyone a little : An image @-@ turning aide @-@ <unk> ” , 2015 ) collects essays published in <unk> ( <unk> ) since 2011 ; <unk> no <unk> ( “ Ways to wear down shoe rubber ” , 2016 ) is a fourth collection .

 = Casimir Pulaski = 
 Kazimierz Michał Władysław Wiktor Pułaski of <unk> coat of arms ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; English : Casimir Pulaski ; March 6 , 1745 – October 11 , 1779 ) was a Polish <unk> , soldier and military commander who has been called with his fellow Hungarian friend Michael Kovats de <unk> " the fathers of the American cavalry " . 
 Born in Warsaw and following in his father 's footsteps , he became interested in politics at an early age and soon became involved in the military and the revolutionary affairs in Poland ( the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth ) . Pulaski was one of the leading military commanders for the Bar Confederation and fought against Russian domination of the Commonwealth . When this uprising failed , he was driven into exile . Following a recommendation by Benjamin Franklin , Pulaski emigrated to North America to help in the cause of the American Revolutionary War . He distinguished himself throughout the revolution , most notably when he saved the life of George Washington . Pulaski became a general in the Continental Army , created the Pulaski Cavalry Legion and reformed the American cavalry as a whole . At the Battle of Savannah , while leading a daring charge against British forces , he was gravely wounded , and died shortly thereafter . 
 Pulaski has been remembered as a hero who fought for independence and freedom both in Poland and in the United States . Numerous places and events are named in his honor , and he is commemorated by many works of art . Pulaski is one of only eight people to be awarded honorary United States citizenship . He never married and had no descendants . Despite his fame , there have been uncertainties and controversies surrounding both his place and date of birth and burial . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Pulaski was born on March 6 , 1745 , in the manor house of the Pułaski family in Warsaw , <unk> Casimir was the eldest son of Marianna <unk> and Józef Pułaski , who was an <unk> at the Crown Tribunal , the Starost of Warka , and one of the town 's most notable inhabitants . He was a brother of Franciszek Ksawery Pułaski and Antoni Pułaski . His family bore the <unk> coat of arms . The Pułaski family was Roman Catholic and early in his youth , Casimir Pulaski attended an elite college run by <unk> , a male religious order of the Catholic Church in Warsaw , but did not finish his education . 
 There is some circumstantial evidence that Pulaski was a Freemason . When Gilbert du Motier , Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the monument erected in Pulaski 's honor in Savannah in 1824 , a full Masonic ceremony took place with Richard T. Turner , High Priest of the Georgia chapter , conducting the ceremony . Other sources claim Pulaski was a member of the Masonic Army Lodge in Maryland . A Masonic Lodge in Chicago is named Casimir Pulaski Lodge , <unk> and a brochure issued by them claims he obtained the degree of Master Mason on June 19 , 1779 , and was buried with full Masonic honors . To date no surviving documents of Pulaski 's actual membership have been found . 
 = = Military career = = 
 In 1762 , Pulaski started his military career as a page of Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony , Duke of Courland and vassal of the Polish king . He spent six months at the ducal court in Mitau , during which the court was interned in the palaces by the Russian forces occupying the area . He then returned to Warsaw , and his father gave him the village of <unk> in Podole ; from that time Pulaski used the title of Starost of <unk> . 
 = = = Bar Confederation = = = 
 With his family , he took part in the 1764 election of the new Polish monarch , Stanisław II August . In December 1767 , Pulaski and his father became involved with the Bar Confederation , which saw King Stanisław as a Russian puppet and sought to curtail Russian hegemony over the Commonwealth . The confederation was actively opposed by the Russian forces stationed in Poland . Pulaski recruited a unit and on February 29 , 1768 , signed the act of the confederation , thus declaring himself an official supporter of the movement . On March 6 , he received the rank of a pułkownik and commanded a <unk> of cavalry . In March and April he agitated among the Polish military , successfully convincing some forces to join the Confederates . He fought his first battle on April 20 near <unk> ; it was a victory , as was another on April 23 near Starokostiantyniv . An engagement at <unk> on April 28 resulted in a defeat . In early May he garrisoned <unk> , but was forced to retreat when allied reinforcements were defeated . He retreated to a monastery in <unk> , which he defended during a siege by royalist forces for over two weeks until June 16 . Eventually he was forced to surrender and was taken captive by the Russians . On June 28 , he was released in exchange for a pledge that he would not again take up arms with the Confederates , and that he would lobby the Confederates to end hostilities . However , Pulaski considered the pledge to be non @-@ binding , and made a public declaration to that effect upon reaching a camp of the Confederates at the end of July . Agreeing to the pledge in the first place weakened his authority and popularity among the Confederates , and his own father considered whether or not he should be court @-@ martialed ; some heated debates followed and Pulaski was reinstated to active duty only in early September . 
 In 1769 , Pulaski 's unit was again besieged by numerically superior forces , this time in the old fortress of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has served as his base of operations since December the previous year . However , after a staunch defense , he was able to break the Russian siege . On April 7 , he was made the regimentarz of the Kraków Voivodeship . In May and June he operated near Przemyśl , but failed to take the town . Criticized by some of his fellow Confederates , Pulaski departed to Lithuania with his allies and a force of about 600 men on June 3 . There , Pulaski attempted to incite a larger revolt against Russia ; despite no decisive military successes , he was able to assemble a 4 @,@ 000 @-@ strong army and deliver it back to a Confederate staging point . This excursion received international notice and gained him a reputation as the most effective military leader in the Bar Confederation . Next , he moved with his unit towards Zamość and after some skirmishes was defeated at the Battle of <unk> on September 15 . He spent the rest of the year rebuilding his unit in the region of <unk> . 
 In February 1770 , Pulaski moved near Nowy Targ , and in March , helped to subdue the mutiny of Józef <unk> . Based in <unk> , he subsequently operated in southern Lesser Poland and on May 13 his force was defeated at the Battle of <unk> . Around June 9 – 10 in <unk> , in a conference with other Confederate leaders , he met Joseph II , Holy Roman Emperor , who complimented Pulaski on his actions . On July 3 – 4 , Pulaski 's camp was captured by Johann von Drewitz , and he was forced to retreat into Austria . Early in August he met with the French emissary , Charles François Dumouriez . He disregarded an order to take <unk> and instead cooperated with Michał Walewski in a raid on Kraków on the night of August 31 . He then departed for Częstochowa . On September 10 , along with Walewski , he used subterfuge to take control of the Jasna Góra monastery . On September 18 he met <unk> z <unk> , an aristocrat from the Krasiński family and the wife of Charles of Saxony , Duke of Courland ; he impressed her and she would become one of his protectors . Around September 22 – 24 Walewski was made the commandant of Jasna Góra , which slighted Pulaski . Nonetheless he continued as the de facto commander of Confederate troops stationed in and around Jasna Góra . Between September 10 , 1770 , and January 14 , 1771 , Pulaski , Walewski and Józef Zaremba commanded the Polish forces during the siege of Jasna Góra monastery . They successfully defended against Drewitz in a series of engagements , the largest one on November 11 , followed by a siege from December 31 to January 14 . The defense of Jasna Góra further enhanced his reputation among the Confederates and abroad . A popular Confederate song taunting Drewitz included lyrics about Pulaski and Jasna Góra . Pulaski intended to pursue Drewitz , but a growing discord between him and Zaremba prevented this from becoming a real option . 
 In February 1771 , Pulaski operated around Lublin ; on February 25 he was victorious at <unk> and on the night of February 28 and March 1 , his forces besieged <unk> . In March that year he became one of the members of the Confederates ' War Council . Dumouriez , who became a military adviser to the Confederates , at the time described him as " spontaneous , more proud than ambitious , friend of the prince of Courland , enemy of the Potocki family , brave and honest " as well as popular among other commanders . This was due to his refusal to follow orders and adhere to discipline . Jędrzej <unk> who met him as well around that time described him as short and thin , pacing and speaking quickly , and uninterested in women or drinking . Furthermore , he enjoyed fighting against the Russians above everything else , and was daring to the extent he forgot about his safety in battles , resulting in his many failures on the battlefield . 
 In May 1771 , Pulaski advanced on Zamość , refusing to coordinate an operation with Dumouriez against Alexander Suvorov ; without Pulaski 's support , the Confederates were defeated at the Battle of <unk> . Pulaski 's forces were victorious at the Battle of <unk> , and briefly besieged Zamość , but it was relieved by Suvorov . He retreated , suffering major losses , towards Częstochowa . On July 27 , pressured by <unk> z <unk> , he declared he would from then on strictly adhere to orders from the Confederacy that he had previously habitually disregarded . In October his responsibilities in the War Council were increased , and the same month he became involved with the plan to kidnap King Poniatowski . Pulaski was initially opposed to this plan but later supported it on the condition that the king would not be harmed . The attempt failed , weakening the international reputation of the Confederates , and when Pulaski 's involvement with the attempted kidnapping became known , the Austrians expelled him from their territories . He spent the following winter and spring in Częstochowa , during which time several of his followers were defeated , captured or killed . 
 On May 31 , 1772 , Pulaski , increasingly distanced from other leaders of the Confederation , left the Jasna Góra monastery and went to Silesia in Prussia . In the meantime , the Bar Confederation was defeated , with most fighting ending around the summer . Overall , Pulaski was seen as one of the most famous and accomplished Confederate leaders . " At the same time , he often acted independently , disobeying orders from Confederate command , and among his detractors ( which included Dumouriez ) had a reputation of a " loose cannon " . 
 Leaving Prussia , Pulaski sought refuge in France , where he unsuccessfully attempted to join the French Army . In 1773 , his opponents in Poland accused him of attempted regicide , and proceedings began at the Sejm Court on June 7 . 
 Poniatowski himself warned Pulaski to stay away from Poland , or risk death . The court verdict , declared in absentia in July , stripped Pulaski of " all dignity and honors " , demanded that his possessions be confiscated , and sentenced him to death . He attempted to recreate a Confederate force in the Ottoman Empire during the Russo @-@ Turkish War , but before he could make any progress , the Turks were defeated , and he barely escaped by sea to Marseilles , France . He found himself in debt and unable to find an army that would enlist him . He spent the year of 1775 in France , imprisoned at times for debts , until his allies gathered enough funds to arrange for his release . Around that time , due to the efforts of his friend Claude @-@ Carloman de <unk> , he was recruited by the Marquis de Lafayette and Benjamin Franklin ( whom he met in spring 1777 ) for service in the American Revolutionary War .

 Franklin was impressed by Pulaski , and wrote of him : " <unk> Pulaski of Poland , an officer famous throughout Europe for his bravery and conduct in defence of the liberties of his country against the three great invading powers of Russia , Austria and Prussia ... may be highly useful to our service . " He subsequently recommended that General George Washington accept Pulaski as a volunteer in the Continental Army cavalry and said that Pulaski " was renowned throughout Europe for the courage and bravery he displayed in defense of his country 's freedom . " Pulaski departed France from Nantes in June , and arrived in Marblehead , Massachusetts , near Boston , on July 23 , 1777 . After his arrival , Pulaski wrote to Washington , " I came here , where freedom is being defended , to serve it , and to live or die for it . " 
 On August 20 , he met Washington in his headquarters in Neshaminy Falls , outside Philadelphia . He showed off riding stunts , and argued for the superiority of cavalry over infantry . Because Washington was unable to grant him an officer rank , Pulaski spent the next few months traveling between Washington and the US Congress in Philadelphia , awaiting his appointment . His first military engagement against the British occurred before he received it , on September 11 , 1777 , at the Battle of Brandywine . When the Continental Army troops began to yield , he reconnoitered with Washington 's bodyguard of about 30 men , and reported that the enemy were endeavoring to cut off the line of retreat . Washington ordered him to collect , as many as possible , the scattered troops who came his way , and employ them according to his discretion to secure the retreat of the army . His subsequent charge averted a disastrous defeat of the Continental Army cavalry , earning him fame in America and saved the life of George Washington . As a result , on September 15 , 1777 , on the orders of Congress , Washington made Pulaski a brigadier general in the Continental Army cavalry . At that point , the cavalry was only a few hundred men strong organized into four regiments . These men were scattered among numerous infantry formations , and used primarily for scouting duties . Pulaski immediately began work on reforming the cavalry , and wrote the first regulations for the formation . 
 On September 16 , while on patrol west of Philadelphia , Pulaski spotted significant British forces moving toward the Continental position . Upon being informed by Pulaski , Washington prepared for a battle , but the encounter was interrupted by a major storm before either side was organized . On October 4 , Pulaski took part in the Battle of Germantown . He spent the winter of 1777 to 1778 with most of the army at Valley Forge . Pulaski argued that the military operations should continue through the winter , but this idea was rejected by the general staff . In turn , he focused on reorganizing the cavalry force , mostly stationed in Trenton . While at Trenton his assistance was requested by General Anthony Wayne , whom Washington had dispatched on a foraging expedition into southern New Jersey . Wayne was in danger of encountering a much larger British force sent to oppose his movements . Pulaski and 50 cavalry rode south to Burlington , where they skirmished with British sentries on February 28 . After this minor encounter the British commander , Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Stirling , was apparently convinced that he was facing a much larger force than expected , and prepared to withdraw his troops across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania at Cooper 's Ferry ( present @-@ day Gloucester City ) . Pulaski and Wayne joined forces to attack Stirling 's position on February 29 while he awaited suitable weather conditions to cross . In the resulting skirmish ( which only involved a few hundred men out of the larger forces on either side ) , Pulaski 's horse was shot out from under him and a few of his cavalry were wounded . 
 American officers serving under Pulaski had difficulty taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas of discipline and tactics differed enormously from those to which they were accustomed . This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers . There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay , and Pulaski 's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers , superiors , and subordinates . Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied . Despite a commendation from Wayne , these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778 , and return to Valley Forge . 
 Pulaski went to Yorktown , where he met with General Horatio Gates and suggested the creation of a new unit . At Gates ' recommendation , Congress confirmed his previous appointment to the rank of a brigadier general , with a special title of " Commander of the Horse " , and authorized the formation of a corps of 68 lancers and 200 light infantry . This corps , which became known as the Pulaski Cavalry Legion , was recruited mainly in Baltimore , where it was headquartered . Henry Wadsworth Longfellow would later commemorate in verse the consecration of the Legion 's banner . By August 1778 , it numbered about 330 men , both Americans and foreigners . General Charles Lee commented on the high standards of the Legion 's training . The " father of the American cavalry " demanded much of his men and trained them in tested cavalry tactics . He used his own personal finances when money from Congress was scarce , in order to assure his forces of the finest equipment and personal safety . However , later that year a controversy arose related to the Legion 's finances , and its requisitions from the local populace . His troubles with the auditors continued until his death ; Pulaski complained that he received inadequate funds , was obstructed by locals and officials , and that he was forced to spend his own money . He was not cleared of these charges until after his death . 
 In the autumn Pulaski was ordered to Little Egg Harbor , where in the engagement on October 15 , known as The Affair at Little Egg Harbor , the legion suffered heavy losses . During the following winter Pulaski was stationed at Minisink , at that time in New Jersey . Ordered to take part in a punitive Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois , he was dissatisfied with this command , and intended to leave the service and return to Europe , but instead asked to be reassigned to the Southern front . On February 2 , 1779 Washington instead ordered him to South Carolina . 
 = = = = Southern front = = = = 
 Pulaski arrived in Charleston on May 8 , 1779 , finding the city in crisis . General Benjamin Lincoln , commander of the southern army , had led most of the army toward Augusta , Georgia , in a bid to recapture Savannah , which had been captured by the British in late 1778 . The British commander , Brigadier General Augustine Prevost , responded to Lincoln 's move by launching a raiding expedition from Savannah across the Savannah River . The South Carolina militia fell back before the British advance , and Prevost 's force followed them all the way to Charleston . Pulaski arrived just as military leaders were establishing the city 's defenses . When the British advanced on May 11 , Pulaski 's Legion engaged forward elements of the British force , and was badly mauled in the encounter . The Legion infantry , numbering only about 60 men before the skirmish , was virtually wiped out , and Pulaski was forced to retreat to the safety of the city 's guns . Although some historians credit this action with Prevost 's decision to withdraw back toward Savannah the next day ( despite ongoing negotiations of a possible surrender of Charleston ) , that decision is more likely based on news Prevost received that Lincoln 's larger force was returning to Charleston to face him , and that Prevost 's troops had gone further than he had originally intended . One early historian criticized Pulaski 's actions during that engagement as " ill @-@ judged , ill @-@ conducted , disgraceful and disastrous " . The episode was of minor strategic consequence and did little to enhance the reputation of Pulaski 's unit . 
 Although Pulaski frequently suffered from malaria while stationed in Charleston , he remained in active service . At the beginning of September Lincoln prepared to launch an attempt to retake Savannah with French assistance . Pulaski was ordered to Augusta , where he was to join forces with General Lachlan McIntosh . Their combined forces were to serve as the forward elements of Lincoln 's army . Pulaski captured a British outpost near Ogeechee River . His units then acted as an advance guard for the allied French units under Admiral Charles Hector , comte d 'Estaing . He rendered great services during the siege of Savannah , and in the assault of October 9 commanded the whole cavalry , both French and American . 
 = = = Death and burial = = = 
 While attempting to rally fleeing French forces during a cavalry charge , Pulaski was mortally wounded by grapeshot . The reported grapeshot is on display today at the Georgia Historical Society in Savannah ; The Charleston Museum also has a grapeshot reported to be from Pulaski 's wound . A wounded Pulaski was carried from the field of battle and taken aboard the South Carolina merchant brig privateer Wasp under the command of Captain Samuel Bulfinch , where he died two days later , having never regained consciousness . His death , perceived by American Patriot supporters as heroic , further boosted his reputation in America . 
 The historical accounts for Pulaski 's time and place of burial vary considerably . According to several contemporary accounts there were witnesses , including Pulaski 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp , that Pulaski received a symbolic burial in Charleston on October 21 , sometime after he was buried at sea . Other witnesses , including Captain Samuel Bulfinch of the Wasp however , claimed that the wounded Pulaski was actually later removed from the ship and taken to the Greenwich plantation in the town of Thunderbolt , near Savannah , where he died and was buried . 
 In March 1825 , during his grand tour of the United States , Lafayette personally laid the cornerstone for the Casimir Pulaski Monument in Savannah , Georgia . Remains at Monterey Square in that city , alleged to be Pulaski 's , were exhumed in 1996 and examined in a forensic study . The eight @-@ year examination , including DNA analysis , ended inconclusively , although the skeleton is consistent with Pulaski 's age and occupation . A healed wound on the skull 's forehead is consistent with historical records of an injury Pulaski sustained in battle , as is a bone defect on the left cheekbone , believed to have been caused by a benign tumor . The remains were reinterred with military honors in 2005 . 
 = = Tributes and commemoration = = 
 The United States has long commemorated Pulaski 's contributions to the American Revolutionary War , and already on October 29 , 1779 , the United States Congress passed a resolution that a monument should be dedicated to him , but the first monument to him was not built until 1854 . A bust of Pulaski was added to a collection of other busts of American heroes at United States Capitol in 1867 . On May 11 , 1910 , US President William Taft revealed a Congress @-@ sponsored General Casimir Pulaski statue . In 1929 , Congress passed another resolution , this one recognizing October 11 of each year as " General Pulaski Memorial Day " , with a large parade held annually on Fifth Avenue in New York City . Separately , a Casimir Pulaski Day is celebrated in Illinois and some other places on the first Monday of each March . After a previous attempt failed , Congress passed a joint resolution conferring honorary U.S. citizenship on Pulaski in 2009 , sending it to President Barack Obama for approval . He duly signed it on November 6 , 2009 , making Pulaski the seventh person so honored . 
 In Poland , in 1793 Pulaski 's relative , Antoni Pułaski , obtained a cancellation of his brother 's sentence from 1773 . He has been mentioned in the literary works of numerous Polish authors , including Adam Mickiewicz , Juliusz Słowacki and Józef Ignacy Kraszewski . Adolf <unk> wrote a drama " Pułaski w <unk> " ( Pulaski in America ) in 1917 . A museum dedicated to Pulaski , the Kazimierz Pułaski Museum , opened in Warka in 1967 . 
 Throughout Poland and the United States , people have celebrated anniversaries of Pulaski 's birth and death , and there exist numerous objects of art such as paintings and statues of him . In 1879 , to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his death , Henri Schoeller composed " A Pulaski March " . Twenty years earlier , Eduard <unk> composed his opera , " <unk> " , about the last days of Pulaski 's life . Commemorative medals and stamps of Pulaski have been issued . Several towns and counties in United States are named after him , as are numerous streets , parks and structures , such as the Pulaski Bridge or the Pulaski Skyway . There is also a number of educational , academic , and Polish @-@ American institutions named after him . A US Navy submarine , USS Casimir Pulaski , has been named for him , as was a 19th @-@ century United States Revenue Cutter Service cutter . A Polish frigate , ORP Generał Kazimierz Pułaski , is also named after Pulaski . Fort Pulaski , active during the American Civil War , is named in honor of Casimir Pulaski . A statue commemorating Pulaski titled General Casimir Pulaski stands at the eastern end of Freedom Plaza in Washington , D.C. There is an equestrian statue of Pulaski in Roger Williams Park in Providence , Rhode Island . A statue by Granville W. Carter depicting Pulaski on a rearing horse signaling a forward charge with a sword in his right hand is erected in Hartford , Connecticut . 
 Polish historian Władysław Konopczyński , who wrote a monograph on Pulaski in 1931 , noted that he was one of the most accomplished Polish people , grouping him with other Polish military heroes such as Tadeusz Kościuszko , Stanisław Żółkiewski , Stefan Czarniecki , and Prince Józef Poniatowski . 
 " The Mysterious Stranger " , a 1959 episode of the ABC / Warner Brothers western television series Sugarfoot , features Adam West as Frederick Pulaski , a declared descendant of the Casimir Pulaski . However , Pulaski never married or had direct heirs . In the story line , Frederick Pulaski is a concert pianist who defends oppressed Polish miners in a western town . Series character Tom " Sugarfoot Brewster ( Will Hutchins ) , befriends Pulaski in a legal hearing and reconciles him with the young woman to whom both are smitten , Kathy O 'Hara ( Sue Randall ) , who is also studying to be a concert pianist . Karl Swenson appears in this episode as Kathy 's wealthy Irish father , Dennis O 'Hara .

 = 6th Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 6th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army . Originally formed in 1914 for service during the First World War , the battalion fought at Gallipoli and on the Western Front . The battalion was disbanded in 1919 but was re @-@ raised in 1921 as part of the Citizens Force , and adopted the title of " Royal Melbourne Regiment " in 1935 . The battalion did not serve overseas during the Second World War and was eventually disbanded in 1944 . It was re @-@ raised in 1948 and remained in existence until 1960 when it was absorbed into the Royal Victoria Regiment . Today its honours and traditions are maintained by the 5th / 6th Battalion , Royal Victoria Regiment .

 = = = First World War = = = 
 Following the outbreak of the First World War , the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force outside of the existing Citizens Force units for overseas service known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) . The 6th Battalion was completely recruited from Victoria , drawing from Melbourne and the surrounding suburbs to the north where four Citizens Force battalions — the 55th , 56th , 63rd and 64th Infantry — were headquartered . Raising was complete within a fortnight of the outbreak of the war in August 1914 and less than two months later the battalion embarked for overseas on the troop transport Suffolk , forming part of the 2nd Brigade , 1st Division . 
 The battalion proceeded to Egypt , arriving on 2 December and after a period of training it took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 , where it went ashore as part of the second wave . Shortly after the landing the 2nd Brigade was transferred from Anzac Cove to Cape Helles to assist in the attack on Krithia . During the unsuccessful attack , the 6th Battalion suffered heavy casualties , losing 133 men killed or died of wounds . Afterwards , they returned to Anzac Cove , arriving there on 17 May , to take part in defending the beachhead that had been established . In August , when the Allies attempted a break out , the battalion took part in the attack on Lone Pine . In September they were withdrawn for a period of rest to Lemnos . They returned in November and resumed defensive duties . By that time , due to the failure of August Offensive , the campaign evolved into a stalemate . They remained in the line December , when the Allies carried out a successful evacuation . During the campaign they lost 22 officers and 398 other ranks killed . 
 After the withdrawal from Gallipoli , the battalion returned to Egypt where they received reinforcements and carried out defensive duties . During this time the AIF was reorganised and expanded as fresh divisions were raised . In order to spread experience across the new units , the existing units were split up and the 6th Battalion provided half its experienced officers and non @-@ commissioned officers ( NCOs ) to the 58th Battalion . In March 1916 , it sailed to France and deployed to the Somme , where it was sent to a quiet sector near Fleurbaix . Its first combat came on 12 June when the battalion launched a trench raid on the Germans opposite their position . Their first major action in France came later , however , at Pozières in July 1916 , during which time they lost 102 men killed . Later the battalion fought at Ypres , in Belgium , before returning to the Somme in winter , during which time they undertook defensive duties as well as patrols into no man 's land . After this the battalion took part in the Second Battle of Bullecourt , before taking part in the Battle of Menin Road in September 1917 , when Lieutenant Frederick Birks earned the 6th Battalion 's only Victoria Cross . 
 In March and April 1918 , the battalion took part in the defensive actions in response to the German spring offensive , before subsequently taking part in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive , launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918 . The 6th Battalion joined the advance the following day , striking out from Villers @-@ Bretonneux and taking part in the capture of Lihons . The battalion continued operations to late September 1918 , taking part in the advance towards <unk> , but was then withdrawn from the line for rest and reorganisation and did not see any further combat . In November , the members of the battalion began being repatriated back to Australia as the demobilisation process began . The process was undertaken gradually based upon length of service and as the battalion 's numbers began to dwindle it was amalgamated with the 7th Battalion in March 1919 . Later , this battalion was also amalgamated with the 5th and 8th Battalions , to form the 2nd Brigade Battalion . 
 During the war the 6th Battalion lost 1 @,@ 066 killed and 2 @,@ 017 wounded . Members of the battalion received the following decorations : one Victoria Cross , one Order of St Michael and St George , five Distinguished Service Orders with one bar , 31 Military Crosses with two bars , 34 Distinguished Conduct Medals , 127 Military Medals with nine bars , nine Meritorious Service Medals , 48 Mentioned in Despatches and 13 foreign awards .

 In 1921 , the decision was made to perpetuate the numerical designations and battle honours of the AIF by re @-@ raising the AIF units as part of the Citizens Force . This was done by reorganising the existing Citizens Forces units so that they would adopt the identity of the AIF units that had been recruited within their regions and in which many of the pre @-@ war citizen soldiers had served . This was designed so as to maintain the regional identity of the Citizens Forces units , as well as the honours and traditions of the AIF units . In this time the 6th Battalion was re @-@ raised from personnel drawn from six existing units : all of the 2nd Battalion , 6th Infantry Regiment ; as well as part of the 29th Light Horse Regiment ; the 2nd Battalion , 46th Infantry Regiment ; the 2nd Battalion , 60th Infantry Regiment ; the 5th Battalion , 5th Infantry Regiment and the 5th Battalion , 21st Infantry Regiment . Through these units , the battalion gained a complex lineage , including that of the 64th Infantry , a unit that could trace its lineage back to 1854 and claimed to be the oldest infantry unit in Australia . 
 Initially attached to the 2nd Infantry Brigade , 4th Division , in 1927 , when territorial titles were adopted by the Army , the battalion adopted the title of 6th Battalion , City of Melbourne Regiment . It also adopted the motto Semper <unk> at this time . In 1929 , following the election of the Scullin Labor government , the compulsory training scheme was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Citizens Forces would be maintained on a part @-@ time , voluntary basis only . It was also renamed the " Militia " at this time . The decision to suspend compulsory training , coupled with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower of many Militia units dropped considerably and as a result the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units . Nevertheless , the 6th Battalion was not affected by this decision and in 1931 it formed an alliance with the Royal Fusiliers . In 1935 , the battalion was re @-@ designated as the " Royal Melbourne Regiment " . This title was officially approved on King George V 's jubilee and was a unique honour , as the battalion was at the time the only Australian infantry unit to carry the Royal prefix . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 At the outset of the Second World War , due to the provisions of the Defence Act ( 1903 ) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory , The decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas — initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East , France and later possibly England — while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia 's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training . During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their readiness and undertook garrison duties in Australia . In 1944 , however , the decision was made to disband the unit , as the Australian government sought to reallocate resources to the economy and began the demobilisation process early . Later , in January 1945 , the battalion 's parent unit , the 2nd Brigade was also disbanded . 
 = = = Post Second World War = = = 
 In 1948 , with the completion of the demobilisation process , the Citizens Force was re @-@ raised as the Citizens Military Force ( CMF ) , which was established on a restricted establishment of two divisions . As a part of this force , it was announced on 1 May 1948 that the 6th Battalion , Royal Melbourne Regiment would be re @-@ raised . Two companies were formed in Melbourne along with battalion headquarters , while depots were located at Carlton and Preston . It was also decided that the battalion would perpetuate the battle honours of the 2 / 6th Battalion , which had fought in North Africa , Greece and New Guinea during the war . Waltzing Matilda was approved as the battalion 's regimental march in 1953 . 
 In mid @-@ 1960 , the Australian Army adopted the Pentropic divisional structure , which was based on the establishment of five @-@ company battalions . The result of this was a reduction in the number of CMF units , many of which were merged to form new units on the Pentropic establishment . At the same time , it was decided to amalgamate the old local and regional regiments that had existed into six new multi @-@ battalion state @-@ based regiments , such as the Royal Victoria Regiment . As a result of these changes , in July the 6th Battalion was merged with the 5th Battalion and the 58th / 32nd Battalion to form the 1st Battalion , Royal Victoria Regiment ( 1 RVR ) ; within this organisation the 6th Battalion 's identity was maintained by ' C ' ( Melbourne ) Company . Prior to this , in March , the battalion had received the Freedom of the City from the City of Melbourne . 
 In 1965 , the Pentropic system was abandoned and a further re @-@ organisation of the CMF was undertaken as existing battalions were reduced and additional battalions were raised in the more populous areas , namely in Queensland , Victoria and New South Wales . At the same time , the concerns about the regional identity of these units were addressed by reintroducing the old numerical designations . As a result , the large Pentropic battalions were split up once again and the 6th Battalion once again was raised as a full battalion , known as the 6th Battalion , Royal Victoria Regiment . In July 1975 , due to declining troop numbers further reorganisation resulted in the amalgamation of the 5th and 6th Battalions once more , albeit under the guise of the 1st Battalion , Royal Victoria Regiment ( 1 RVR ) . This lasted until August 1982 when due to concerns about the strategic situation following the Russian invasion of Afghanistan , the Australian government announced the expansion of the CMF and decided to raise another battalion in Victoria . This battalion was the 5th / 6th Battalion , Royal Victoria Regiment ( 5 / 6 RVR ) and by mid @-@ 1981 , 1 RVR had reached peak strength and the following year the battalion was split to form the new 5 / 6 RVR , a unit which remains in existence today and maintains the battle honours and traditions of its predecessor AIF and Militia units .

 = Henry Cornelius Burnett = 
 Henry Cornelius Burnett ( October 25 , 1825 – October 1 , 1866 ) was a U.S. Representative from the state of Kentucky and a Confederate States senator . A lawyer by profession , Burnett had held only one public office — circuit court clerk — before being elected to Congress . He represented Kentucky 's 1st congressional district immediately prior to the Civil War . This district contained the entire Jackson Purchase region of the state , which was more sympathetic to the Confederate cause than any other area of Kentucky . Burnett promised the voters of his district that he would have President Abraham Lincoln arraigned for treason . Unionist newspaper editor George D. Prentice described Burnett as " a big , burly , loud @-@ mouthed fellow who is forever raising points of order and objections , to embarrass the Republicans in the House " . 
 Besides championing the Southern cause in Congress , Burnett also worked within Kentucky to bolster the state 's support of the Confederacy . He presided over a sovereignty convention in Russellville in 1861 that formed a Confederate government for the state . The delegates to this convention chose Burnett to travel to Richmond , Virginia to secure Kentucky 's admission to the Confederacy . Burnett also raised a Confederate regiment at Hopkinsville , Kentucky , and briefly served in the Confederate States Army . Camp Burnett , a Confederate recruiting post two miles west of Clinton in Hickman County , Kentucky , was named after him . 
 Burnett 's actions were deemed treasonable by his colleagues in Congress , and he was expelled from the House in 1861 . He is one of only five members of the House of Representatives ever to be expelled . Following his expulsion , Burnett served in the Provisional Confederate Congress and the First and Second Confederate Senates . He was indicted for treason after the war , but never tried . He returned to the practice of law , and died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40 . 
 = = Early life and political career = = 
 Henry Cornelius Burnett was born to Dr. Isaac and Martha F. ( Garrett ) Burnett on October 25 , 1825 , in Essex County , Virginia . In his early childhood , he moved to Cadiz , Kentucky , with his family . He was educated in the common schools of the area and at an academy in Hopkinsville , Kentucky . Following this , he studied law , was admitted to the bar in 1847 , and commenced practice at Cadiz . He was a member of the Cadiz Christian Church . 
 On April 13 , 1847 , Burnett married Mary A. Terry , the daughter of a prominent Cadiz merchant . They had four children : John , Emeline , Henry , and Terry ( who died shortly after birth ) . The younger Henry Burnett became a successful lawyer in Paducah and , later , Louisville . 
 In the first election following the ratification of the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 , Burnett was elected clerk of the circuit court of Trigg County , Kentucky , defeating James E. Thompson . He resigned in 1853 to run for Congress . Later that year , he was elected as a Democrat to the 34th Congress , succeeding Speaker of the House Linn Boyd . He was re @-@ elected to the three succeeding Congresses ; during the 35th Congress , he chaired the Committee of Enquiry regarding the sale of Fort Snelling and served on the Committee on the District of Columbia . 
 = = <unk> of the Civil War = = 
 Burnett supported fellow Kentuckian John C. Breckinridge for president in the 1860 presidential election , but Breckinridge lost to Abraham Lincoln . Lincoln had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed . His victory in the election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their secession from the Union . Despite this , most Americans believed the Union could still be saved . Burnett , however , disagreed . In the January 7 , 1861 issue of Paducah 's Tri @-@ Weekly Herald , he declared , " There is not the slightest hope of any settlement or adjustment of existing troubles . " Despite his pessimism , Burnett endorsed the ill @-@ fated Peace Conference of 1861 . 
 Following the rapid secessions of Mississippi , Florida , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Texas , Congress began preparing the nation for war , including by strengthening the army and navy and raising funds for the treasury . Burnett attempted to circumvent these measures by proposing an amendment stipulating that none of these new appropriations could be used to subdue or make war against any of the southern states , but the amendment was defeated . 
 To avert war then , the Kentucky General Assembly called for a meeting of border states to convene in Frankfort on May 27 . Kentucky 's twelve delegates to the convention were to be chosen by special election on May 4 . However , after the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter on April 12 , the secessionist candidates withdrew from the election . Expressing the view of the majority of these delegates , Burnett opined in the Tri @-@ Weekly Herald that the convention would not occur . He was wrong ; the convention was held as scheduled , but it failed to accomplish anything of significance . 
 = = Special congressional elections of 1861 = = 
 President Lincoln called for special congressional elections to be held in Kentucky in June 1861 . The voters of the First District 's Southern Rights party called a meeting to be held May 29 , 1861 at the Graves County courthouse in Mayfield . The purpose of the meeting was ostensibly to re @-@ nominate Burnett for his congressional seat , but some Unionists believed an ulterior motive was in play . George D. Prentice , editor of the Unionist Louisville Journal , wrote on May 21 , 1861 that " the object of [ the Mayfield Convention ] , though not officially explained , is believed to be the separation of the First District from Kentucky if Kentucky remains in the Union , and its annexation to Tennessee " . 
 Most of the records of the Mayfield Convention were lost , presumably in a fire that destroyed the courthouse in 1864 . The most extensive surviving record comes from the notes of James <unk> , a Unionist observer of the proceedings . After a number of speeches were delivered , a majority committee chaired by Paducah circuit judge James Campbell presented a report containing seven resolutions . The resolutions declared the region 's sympathy with the South , although it pledged to abide by Kentucky 's present policy of neutrality . It condemned President Lincoln for waging an unjust war , and praised Governor Beriah Magoffin for refusing Lincoln 's call for troops . The report also condemned the federal government for arming Union sympathizers in the state with so @-@ called " Lincoln guns " . A minority committee report was given by Ballard County resident and future U.S. Representative Oscar Turner . This report called Kentucky 's neutrality " futile " and " cowardly , " promised to fight off any invasion by the North , and recommended calling for aid from Tennessee and the Confederate States in the event of such an invasion . It further warned that if the entire state did not adopt this position , the Purchase region would secede and align itself with Tennessee . 
 Burnett , along with Lyon County 's Willis B. Machen and Union County 's Benjamin P. <unk> , initially endorsed Campbell 's majority report . After some debate , Burnett proposed four resolutions in lieu of both reports . The resolutions condemned President Lincoln for the war against the South and the federal government for the provision of the " Lincoln guns " . They also praised Governor Magoffin for rebuffing Lincoln 's call for troops and encouraged him to drive away any Union invasion of the state . Burnett 's resolutions were passed by large margins in preference to both the majority and minority reports . 
 Finally , the convention turned to the issue of nominating Burnett . Four others , including Turner , Machen , and <unk> , were also offered as nominees . Burnett received 124 of 155 votes on the first ballot and was chosen unanimously on the second ballot . In his acceptance speech , Burnett declared that he was undecided as to whether he would take the oath of office if elected . This statement alluded to an earlier comment by Turner that " no man who is engaged in the cause of the South could go to Congress and take the oath of office without perjuring himself . " Burnett promised that if he did assume his seat , he was determined to arraign President Lincoln for treason . 
 In the special elections , Burnett defeated Lawrence Trimble of Paducah . He was the only states ' rights candidate elected in the statewide canvass . He won handily in the Jackson Purchase region , which was by far the most pro @-@ Southern area of the state . However , outside the Purchase , he won only his home county of Trigg , and that by a slim margin of 20 votes . ( Besides the Purchase counties , the First District also included Caldwell , Crittenden , Hopkins , Livingston , Lyon , Trigg , Union , and Webster counties . ) 
 Burnett took his seat in the 37th Congress ; sources make no mention of his making good on his threat not to take the oath of office . Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run , Burnett 's fellow Kentuckian , John J. Crittenden proposed a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war 's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states . Burnett asked that the question be divided . His request was granted , but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war . 
 = = Confederate military service and expulsion = = 
 After Congress adjourned on August 6 , 1861 , Burnett returned home to Cadiz and spoke at a number of pro @-@ Southern rallies . On September 4 , 1861 , Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk violated Kentucky 's neutrality by ordering Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow to occupy Columbus . In response , Ulysses S. Grant captured Paducah on September 6 , 1861 . With neutrality no longer a tenable option , Burnett presided over a conference of Kentucky 's Southern sympathizers that occurred at Russellville between October 29 and October 31 , 1861 . The self @-@ appointed delegates to this conference called for a sovereignty convention on November 18 , 1861 for the purpose of establishing a Confederate government for the state . 
 In the interim between the two conventions , Burnett traveled to Hopkinsville , where he and Colonel <unk> Breckinridge raised a Confederate regiment dubbed the 8th Kentucky Infantry . On November 11 , 1861 , Burnett himself enlisted in the Confederate States Army at Camp Alcorn ; he was chosen as colonel of the 8th Kentucky , but never took command . 
 The sovereignty convention gathered at the William Forst House in Russellville as scheduled on November 18 , 1861 . Burnett also presided over this convention . Fearing for the safety of the delegates , he first proposed postponing proceedings until January 8 , 1862 , but Scott County 's George W. Johnson convinced the majority of the delegates to continue . By the third day , the military situation was so tenuous that the entire convention had to be moved to a tower on the campus of Bethel Female College , a now @-@ defunct institution in Russellville . 
 The convention passed an ordinance of secession and established a provisional Confederate government for Kentucky . Burnett , William Preston of Fayette County and William E. Simms of Bourbon County were chosen as commissioners for the provisional government and were dispatched to Richmond , Virginia to negotiate with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to secure Kentucky 's admission to the Confederacy . For reasons unexplained by the delegates , Dr. Luke P. Blackburn , a native Kentuckian living in Mississippi , was invited to accompany the commissioners . Despite the fact that Kentucky 's elected government in Frankfort had opposed secession , the commissioners convinced Davis to recommend Kentucky 's admission to the Confederacy ; the Confederate Congress officially admitted Kentucky on December 10 , 1861 . 
 Following his successful mission to Richmond , Burnett joined the 8th Kentucky at Fort Donelson . On February 16 , 1862 , Ulysses S. Grant led a combined Federal army @-@ navy attack against the fort . Most of the Confederate garrison was captured , including the 8th Kentucky , but Burnett escaped in General John B. Floyd 's retreat following the defeat . This battle ended Burnett 's military service . 
 Burnett 's subversive activities did not go unnoticed by his colleagues in Congress . He was absent when the body reconvened December 2 , 1861 . The following day , Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to expel Burnett from Congress . The resolution passed easily , removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855 . 
 = = Confederate political service = = 
 Burnett represented Kentucky in the Provisional Confederate Congress from November 18 , 1861 to February 17 , 1862 , and served as a member of that body 's Finance Committee . He was then elected as a senator to the First and Second Confederate Congresses , serving from February 19 , 1862 to February 18 , 1865 . In the Confederate Senate , he served on the <unk> and Enrollment and Military Affairs Committees . 
 On March 29 , Confederate president Jefferson Davis called on the Confederate Congress to pass a conscription bill . The bill would require a three @-@ year term of service for all able @-@ bodied white men between the ages of 18 and 35 . At first , the bill was unpopular , but as the military situation grew more desperate for the Confederacy , both houses quickly passed it . Still , the measure caused some to question Davis ' military decisions ; among them was Burnett , usually one of Davis ' staunchest allies . In an April 19 , 1862 address to the legislature , Burnett denounced Davis ' preference for those who were , like Davis himself , graduates of West Point . The speech drew such a vigorous positive response from the gallery that some of the most zealous had to be removed . 
 Following the conclusion of the Civil War , Burnett sought an audience with President Andrew Johnson , an old congressional colleague , but Johnson told him to go home . Burnett was indicted for treason at Louisville , but released on bond and never prosecuted . He partnered with Judge John R. Grace and resumed the practice of law in Cadiz . He died of cholera in Hopkinsville on September 28 , 1866 . Initially buried in the Old Cadiz Cemetery , he was moved to the East End Cemetery in Cadiz . His tombstone bears no mention of his Confederate service . 
 = Business routes of U.S. Route 127 in Michigan = 
 There have been 10 business routes of US Highway 127 in the state of Michigan . The business routes are all sections of state trunkline highway that run through the central business districts of their respective towns connecting them to the mainline highway outside of those downtown areas . These various business routes were formerly part of the routing of US Highway 127 ( US 127 ) or its predecessor in Central Michigan , US 27 before the construction of highway bypasses . The southern two , in Jackson and Mason were previously parts of US 127 , while seven of the northern eight ( Lansing , St. Johns , Ithaca , St. Louis , Mount Pleasant , Clare and Harrison ) were originally part of US 27 , a highway which was replaced on its northern end by US 127 in 2002 . The business loop through Alma was once numbered US 27A . 
 In the late 1920s , US 27 was shifted to run through St. Louis instead of Alma , and the former route was renumbered US 27A . US 127 was realigned near Mason in the mid @-@ 1940s , and a business loop was created out of the former routing there . A similar bypass of Jackson in the late 1950s also spawned a business loop . In the early 1960s , a new expressway ( later freeway ) for US 27 through Central Michigan led to the creation of several business loops . Other bypasses opened in the 1980s and 1990s and created the last two business loops . The 2002 extension of US 127 to replace US 27 also led to the redesignation of business loops to their current monikers .

 Business US Highway 127 ( Bus . US 127 ) is a business loop of US 127 through Jackson that is wholly concurrent with M @-@ 50 . Its southern end is at an interchange in a rural section of Summit Township . From exit 34 on US 127 , the business loop runs north and northwesterly , crossing the Grand River . North of the river , the roadway is bounded by businesses as it runs along Cooper Street through residential areas on the southeastern side of Jackson . In the downtown area , Bus . US 127 / M @-@ 50 merges with Business Loop Interstate 94 ( BL I @-@ 94 ) and splits to follow a one @-@ way pairing of streets that form a loop through downtown . Northbound traffic continues along the eastern side of this loop on Cooper Street and crosses the Grand River again . At the intersection with Michigan Avenue , BL I @-@ 94 / Bus . US 127 / M @-@ 50 turns westward onto Louis Glick Highway around the northern side of downtown . The business loop crosses the Grand River a third and final time along Louis Glick . On the western side of downtown , the business loop angles southwesterly as Louis Glick Highway merges into Michigan Avenue . ( At the same time , the southern half of the one @-@ way loop , Washington Street , also splits from Michigan Avenue . ) BL I @-@ 94 / Bus . US 127 / M @-@ 50 follows Michigan Avenue westward through residential neighborhoods to an intersection with West Avenue , where Bus . US 127 / M @-@ 50 turns northward , separating from BL I @-@ 94 ( Michigan Avenue ) . As the business loop approaches its parent highway , it transitions into a commercial area . The northern terminus of Bus . US 127 is at the same interchange northwest of Jackson in Blackman Township where the US 127 and I @-@ 94 freeways merge . 
 Jackson was first bypassed on its eastern side around 1959 with a new US 127 freeway . At that time , the former routing of US 127 through downtown was redesignated Bus . US 127 . In 1964 , several changes were made to the business routes in downtown Jackson . Southbound Bus . US 127 traffic was shifted off Michigan Avenue along Blackstone Street to Washington Avenue , and from there it ran along Washington to Francis Street and back to Michigan Avenue . The northbound traffic was shifted north at Mechanic Street to Pearl Street , continuing until turning south at Blackstone back to Michigan Avenue . The eastern end was updated further in 1968 to use Louis Glick Highway to connect to the northern half of the loop around downtown to Michigan Avenue . A set of connector streets on the western side of the downtown loop opened in November 1969 to streamline the flow of traffic further resulting in the last changes to the BL I @-@ 94 routing in Jackson . Southbound traffic was redirected to the connector on Michigan Avenue just east of Third Street . This connector curved south then east to Washington Avenue near First Street . Louis Glick Highway was extended west from Blackstone curving south to merge into Michigan .

 Business US Highway 127 ( Bus . US 127 ) was a business loop that ran through downtown Mason . It started at an intersection on the southern edge of the city where US 127 split from Hull Road to bypass downtown Mason to the west . From there , the business loop ran northward along Hull Road , becoming Jefferson Street . At the intersection with M @-@ 36 ( Ash Street ) , Bus . US 127 turned westward and ran concurrently with M @-@ 36 . After four blocks and a crossing of the Sycamore Creek , Bus . US 127 / M @-@ 36 turned northward on Cedar Street to Columbia Avenue and then turned westward along Columbia to an intersection with US 127 west of downtown . 
 The state bypassed Mason around 1946 , building a new highway to the west of downtown , and the former route of US 127 through downtown was redesignated Bus . US 127 . This business loop existed until 1964 . At that time , the bypass around Mason was upgraded to a full freeway with an interchange at Cedar Street northwest of downtown . Two segments of highway were turned over to local control at this time : the southern half of Bus . US 127 along Hull Road and Jefferson Street as well as the section of Bus . US 127 / M @-@ 36 along Columbia Avenue . M @-@ 36 was extended northward along Cedar Street to the new interchange , and the Bus . US 127 designation was decommissioned .

Marked as Old US 27 on maps , the business route follows Cedar Street northeasterly and transitions onto East Street . The highway runs through residential areas on the north side of Lansing . Along the route of Bus . US 127 , the highway is immediately bounded by some commercial businesses . At Sheridan Road , the highway crosses from Ingham County into Clinton County and continues as a road named Old US 27 . Bus . US 127 continues through suburban southern Clinton County , still bordered by businesses and residential neighborhoods , northward to an interchange with I @-@ 69 in DeWitt Township . 
 In 1984 , part of the northern freeway bypass of Lansing opened as I @-@ 69 . At that time , US 27 was rerouted to follow the new freeway . The former routing of US 27 through downtown Lansing was redesignated Bus . US 27 as a business loop along Lansing Road , I @-@ 496 and BL I @-@ 96 at this time . Eight years later , the last section of I @-@ 69 was completed in Michigan . Afterwards , Bus . US 27 was truncated to the interchange between BL I @-@ 96 / Capitol Loop and I @-@ 496 , and the state reconfigured it into a business spur into downtown Lansing from the north . 
 In 1999 , MDOT petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to decommission the US 27 designation in the state ; the change was approved on April 16 , 1999 . The state waited until 2002 to make the change . After the change was implemented , Bus . US 27 was renumbered to Bus . US 127 as with all of the other similar business routes in the state .

 = Joel Brand = 
 Joel Brand ( 25 April 1906 – 13 July 1964 ) was a rescue worker , born in Transylvania and raised in Germany , who became known during the Holocaust for his efforts to save Hungary 's Jews from deportation to Auschwitz , after the German invasion of that country in March 1944 . 
 A leading member of Budapest 's Aid and Rescue Committee , which smuggled Jews out of occupied Europe , Brand was approached in April 1944 by Adolf Eichmann , the German Schutzstaffel ( SS ) officer in charge of the deportations . Eichmann proposed that Brand broker a deal between the SS and the United States or Britain , in which the Nazis would exchange one million Jews for 10 @,@ 000 trucks for the Eastern front and large quantities of tea and other goods . It was the most ambitious of a series of such deals between Nazi and Jewish leaders ; Eichmann called it " Blut gegen <unk> " ( " blood for goods " ) . 
 Nothing came of the proposal , which the London Times called one of the most loathsome stories of the war . Historians believe that the SS , including its commander , Heinrich Himmler , intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and perhaps even Adolf Hitler . Whatever its purpose , the proposal was thwarted by the British government . They arrested Brand in Aleppo ( then under British control ) , where he had gone to propose Eichmann 's offer to the Jewish Agency , and put an end to it by leaking details to the media . 
 The failure of the proposal , and the wider issue of why the Allies were unable to save the 435 @,@ 000 Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz between May and July 1944 , became the subject of bitter debate for many years . In 1961 Life magazine called Brand " a man who lives in the shadows with a broken heart . " He told an interviewer shortly before his death in 1964 : " An accident of life placed the fate of one million human beings on my shoulders . I eat and sleep and think only of them . " 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 One of seven children , Brand was born to a Jewish family in <unk> , Siebenbürgen ( Transylvania ) , then part of Austria @-@ Hungary , now <unk> , Romania . His mother was from <unk> , the daughter of a banker , and his father was the founder of the Budapest telephone company . Brand 's paternal grandfather , also Joel Brand , had owned the post office in <unk> . 
 The family moved to Erfurt in Germany when Brand was four . Brand attended school until 1923 and said he had completed his Abitur . When he was 19 he went to stay with an uncle in New York , then worked his way across the United States , washing dishes and working on roads and in mines . He joined the Communist Party , worked for the Comintern as a sailor , and sailed to Hawaii , the Philippines , South America , China and Japan . In or around 1930 he returned to Erfurt , where his father had founded another telephone company . Brand took a job with the company and became a functionary with the Thuringian KPD ( Communist Party of Germany ) . 
 He was living in Germany on 30 January 1933 when Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor , and as a communist was arrested just before the Reichstag fire on 27 February that year . Released in 1934 , he settled in Budapest where he worked again for his father 's company . He joined the <unk> Zion , a Marxist @-@ Zionist party , became a vice @-@ president of the Budapest Palestine Office , which organized Jewish emigration to Palestine , and sat on the governing body of the Jewish National Fund . 
 = = = Aid and Rescue Committee = = = 
 In 1935 Brand married <unk> " Hansi " Hartmann and together they opened a knitwear and glove factory on Rozsa Street , Budapest , which after a few years had a staff of over 100 . The couple had met as members of a <unk> , a group of Jews preparing to move to Palestine to work on a kibbutz , but Brand 's plans changed when his mother and three sisters fled to Budapest from Germany and he had to support them . 
 Brand 's involvement in smuggling Jews into Hungary began in July 1941 , when Hansi Brand 's sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law were caught up in the Kamianets @-@ Podilskyi deportations . The Hungarian government sent 18 @,@ 000 Jews to German @-@ occupied Ukraine because they were unable to prove they were Hungarian citizens ; 14 @,@ 000 – 16 @,@ 000 of them were shot by the SS . Brand paid a Hungarian counter @-@ espionage officer to bring his wife 's relatives back safely . 
 Through the <unk> Zion party , the Brands joined other Zionists engaged in rescue work , including Rezső Kasztner , a lawyer and journalist from Kolozsvár ( Cluj ) , and Ottó Komoly , an engineer , and in January 1943 the group set up the Aid and Rescue Committee with Komoly as chairperson . The committee raised money , forged documents , maintained contacts with intelligence agencies and ran safe houses . Brand testified during Adolf Eichmann 's trial that , between 1941 and the invasion in March 1944 , they had helped 22 @,@ 000 – 25 @,@ 000 Jews reach Hungary . 
 Oskar Schindler became one of the committee 's contacts , smuggling letters and money into the Kraków ghetto on their behalf . During a visit by Schindler to Budapest in November 1943 , they learned that he had been bribing Nazi officers to let him bring Jewish refugees into his factory in Poland , which he ran as a safe haven . This further encouraged the committee , after the invasion of Hungary , to try negotiating with the SS . 
 = = March – May 1944 = = 
 = = = Invasion of Hungary = = = 
 The Germans invaded Hungary on Sunday , 19 March 1944 , meeting no resistance . Following Hungary 's annexation in 1941 of parts of Romania , Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia , there were 725 @,@ 000 Jews in the country , as well as over 60 @,@ 000 Jewish converts to Christianity and others the Nazis counted as Jews , according to Yehuda Bauer . Most were liberal Jews and fully assimilated , nearly 30 percent were Orthodox , and a small minority were Zionists . 
 Restrictions on Jews were already in place before the invasion , including a prohibition on marrying Christians . After the invasion , Randolph Braham writes , the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews from the rest of the community . From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3 @.@ 8 x 3 @.@ 8 inch ( 10 x 10 cm ) yellow badge . They were forbidden from using telephones , owning cars or radios , travelling or moving home , and had to declare the value of their property . Jewish civil servants , journalists and lawyers were sacked , non @-@ Jews could not work in Jewish households . Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published . 
 Brand was hidden in a safe house by Josef <unk> , a courier for German military intelligence , who had been selling Brand information about Jewish refugees ; Kasztner and Komoly also went into hiding . The committee wanted to establish contact with the Germans and offered a go @-@ between $ 20 @,@ 000 to arrange a meeting with SS Hauptsturmführer Dieter Wisliceny , one of Eichmann 's assistants . 
 David Crowe writes that the SS had become an economic force in its own right by 1944 , thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps . Jewish rescue workers made several attempts to exploit SS corruption . <unk> Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl paid Dieter Wisliceny $ 20 @,@ 000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation of Jews from Slovakia , though whether the bribe was the reason for the suspension is debatable . 
 Fleischmann and Weissmandl 's rescue group , the Working Group , devised a more ambitious proposal in November that year . Known as the Europa plan or <unk> , the aim was to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas , primarily the United States , to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland . Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this , including $ 2 – 3 million . Nothing came of it , reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943 . 
 The Aid and Rescue Committee decided to ask Wisliceny whether the SS were , as Kasztner wrote in a later report , " prepared to negotiate with the illegal Jewish rescue committee on an economic basis about the moderation of the anti @-@ Jewish measures . " Brand and Kasztner met Wisliceny on 5 April . They told him they were in a position to continue Fleischmann 's negotiations and could offer $ 2 million with a down payment of $ 200 @,@ 000 . They asked that there be no deportations , mass executions or pogroms in Hungary , no ghettos or camps , and that Jews who held immigration certificates for Palestine ( issued by the British mandatory government ) be allowed to leave . Wisliceny accepted the $ 200 @,@ 000 , but indicated that $ 2 million might not be enough . He said there would be no deportations and no harm to the Jewish community while negotiations continued , and arranged for Aid and Rescue Committee exemptions from anti @-@ Jewish laws to allow its members to travel and use cars and telephones . 
 = = = First meeting with Eichmann = = = 
 Following the contact with Wisliceny , Brand received a message on 25 April that SS Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann wanted to see him . Eichmann had arrived in Budapest as head of the <unk> overseeing the deportation of the Jews . Brand was told to wait in the Opera <unk> and from there was driven by the SS to Eichmann 's headquarters at the Hotel Majestic . 
 SS <unk> Kurt Becher , an emissary of Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler , was also at the meeting . In a tone that Brand compared to the " clatter of a machine gun , " Eichmann offered to sell him one million Jews , not for money , but for goods from overseas : 
 I have already made investigations about you and your people and I have verified your ability to make a deal . Now then , I am prepared to sell you one million Jews ... Goods for blood – blood for goods . You can take them from any country you like , wherever you can find them – Hungary , Poland , the Ostmark , from Theresienstadt , from Auschwitz , wherever you like . 
 Eichmann said he would discuss the proposal with Berlin , and that in the meantime Brand should decide what kinds of goods he was in a position to offer . Brand asked how the committee was supposed to obtain these goods . Eichmann said he should open negotiations with the Allies overseas and that Eichmann would arrange a travel permit . Brand suggested Istanbul , where another committee member had a Jewish Agency contact . He testified years later that on leaving the hotel he felt like a " stark madman . " 
 = = = Further meetings = = = 
 Eichmann sent for Brand again a few days later . Eichmann was accompanied this time by Gerhard Clages , also known as Otto Klages , chief of Himmler 's Sicherheitsdienst ( security service ) in Budapest . Clages ' presence meant that three of Himmler 's senior officers – Eichmann , Becher and Clages – had involved themselves with the Brand proposal . Clages handed Brand $ 50 @,@ 000 and 270 @,@ 000 Swiss francs that the Germans had intercepted , sent to the Aid and Rescue Committee by rescue workers in Switzerland via the Swedish Embassy in Budapest . 
 Eichmann told Brand that he wanted 10 @,@ 000 new trucks for the Waffen @-@ SS to use on the Eastern front , one truck for every 100 Jews , as well as 200 tons of tea , 200 tons of cocoa , 800 tons of coffee and 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cases of soap . If Brand returned from Istanbul with confirmation that the Allies had accepted the proposal , Eichmann said he would release 10 percent of the one million . The deal would proceed with 100 @,@ 000 Jews released for every 1 @,@ 000 trucks . 
 It remains unclear whether Eichmann told Brand to return to Budapest by a particular date . According to Bauer , Brand said at various points that he was advised he could " take [ his ] time " or given one , two or three weeks . Hansi Brand testified during Eichmann 's trial that in the meantime she and her children had to remain in Budapest , effectively as hostages . Brand and Eichmann met several more times , the final time on 15 May , the day the deportations began . Between then and 8 July 1944 , 437 @,@ 402 Jews , almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside , are recorded as having been deported to Auschwitz on 147 trains , a rate of around 12 @,@ 000 a day . Most were gassed .

 Brand secured a letter of recommendation for the Jewish Agency from the Hungarian Jewish Council . He was told he would be travelling with Bandi Grosz ( real name , Andor Gross ) , a Hungarian who had worked for Hungarian and German military intelligence ; Grosz would travel to Istanbul as the director of a Hungarian transport company . The SS drove the men from Budapest to Vienna on 17 May , where they stayed the night in a hotel reserved for the SS . 
 Grosz later testified that Brand 's mission had been a cover for his own . He said he had been told by Clages to arrange a meeting in a neutral country between senior German and American officers , or British if necessary , to broker peace between the German Sicherheitsdienst and the Western Allies . 
 = = = Meeting with Jewish Agency = = = 
 In Vienna Brand was given a German passport in the name of Eugen Band . He cabled the Jewish Agency in Istanbul to say he was on his way , and arrived by German diplomatic plane on 19 May . Paul Rose writes that Brand had no idea at this point that the deportations to Auschwitz had already begun . 
 Brand had been told by the Jewish Agency by return cable that " Chaim " would meet him in Istanbul . Convinced of the importance of his mission , he believed this was Chaim Weizmann , president of the World Zionist Organization , later the first president of Israel . In fact the man who had arranged to meet him was Chaim <unk> , head of the Istanbul group of Zionist emissaries . Not only was <unk> not there , but there was no entry visa waiting for Brand , and he was threatened with arrest and deportation . Brand saw this as the first betrayal by the Jewish Agency . Bauer argues that Brand , then and later , failed to grasp that the Jewish Agency was powerless . That his passport was in the name of Eugen Band would have been enough to cause the confusion . 
 The visa situation was sorted out by Bandi Grosz and the men were taken to a hotel , where they met the Jewish Agency delegates . Brand was furious that no one sufficiently senior was available to negotiate a deal . The Jewish Agency agreed to arrange for Moshe Sharett ( previously <unk> ) , head of its political department and later second prime minister of Israel , to travel to Istanbul to meet him . Brand passed them a plan of Auschwitz ( probably from the Vrba @-@ Wetzler report ) and demanded that the gas chambers , crematoria and railways lines be bombed . The discussions left him discouraged and depressed . He wrote that the delegates lacked any sense of urgency and were focused more on internal politics and Jewish emigration to Palestine , rather than the slaughter in Europe : " [ They ] were undoubtedly worthy men ... But they lacked any awareness of how critical was the period of history in which they were living . They had not looked death in the face day after day , as we had in Budapest ... " 
 = = = Interim agreement = = = 
 Ladislaus <unk> writes that proposals and counter @-@ proposals flew between Istanbul , London and Washington . The Jewish Agency and Brand wanted the Allies to string the Germans along in the hope of slowing the deportations . 
 The Agency gave Brand a document , dated 29 May 1944 , that offered $ 400 @,@ 000 for every 1 @,@ 000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine , one million Swiss francs per 10 @,@ 000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain , and 10 @,@ 000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop . If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food , clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps , the Nazis would be supplied with the same . Rose writes that the agreement was intended only to give Brand something to take back to Budapest . 
 Brand cabled his wife on 29 and 31 May to tell her ( and thereby Eichmann ) about the agreement , but there was no response . Rezső Kasztner and Hansi Brand had been held in Budapest between 27 May and 1 June by the Hungarian Arrow Cross . They received the telegrams when they were released , but Eichmann refused to halt the deportations . 
 = = = Arrested by British = = = 
 In Istanbul Brand was told that Moshe Sharett was unable to obtain a visa for Turkey . The Jewish Agency asked Brand to meet him instead in Aleppo on the Syrian @-@ Turkish border . He was reluctant ; the area was under British control and he was afraid they would want to question him , but the Agency told him it would be safe and he left by train with two of its delegates . 
 While on the train , Brand was approached by two representatives of Zeev <unk> 's <unk> ( Revisionist Zionist ) party and the World Agudath Israel Orthodox religious party . They told him the British were going to arrest him in Aleppo : " Die <unk> sind in dieser Frage nicht <unk> <unk> " ( " the British are not our allies in this matter " ) . As soon as he arrived at the Aleppo train station on 7 June , he was stopped by a British man in plain clothes and pushed into a Jeep that was waiting with its engine running . 
 The British drove him to a villa , where for four days they tried to stop Moshe Sharett from meeting him . Sharett " fought a battle of telephones and cables , " Bauer writes , and on 11 June he and the Jewish Agency intelligence group were finally introduced to Brand . The discussion lasted several hours . Sharett wrote in a report of 27 June : " I must have looked a little incredulous , for he said : ' Please believe me : they have killed six million Jews ; there are only two million left alive . ' " At the end of the meeting , Sharett broke the news that the British were insisting Brand not return to Budapest . Brand became hysterical . 
 = = = Proposal rejected = = = 
 Brand was taken to Cairo , where he was questioned by the British for weeks . On 22 June he was interviewed by Ira <unk> of the American War Refugee Board ; <unk> wrote a positive report about Brand , but his influence was limited . Brand went on hunger strike for 17 days in protest at his detention . 
 The British , Americans and Soviet Union discussed the proposal . British Foreign Secretary ( later Prime Minister ) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options . The British were convinced they were dealing with a Himmler trick , perhaps an attempt to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union . If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe , Allied airborne and possibly land @-@ based military operations might have had to stop . Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler 's motive – to turn the Jews into human shields – because it would have allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army . 
 The Americans were more open to negotiating . A rift developed between them and the British who , Bauer writes , were worried about large @-@ scale Jewish immigration to Palestine , then under British control . There was also concern about the effect of Jewish immigration to the UK or US . 
 Eden did suggest a counter @-@ proposal on 1 July , but it was reduced , Bauer writes , to a ridiculous minimum . He told the American government that the British would allow Brand to return to Budapest with a message for Eichmann suggesting that 1 @,@ 500 Jewish children be given safe passage to Switzerland , 5 @,@ 000 from Bulgaria and Romania be allowed to leave for Palestine , and that Germany guarantee safe conduct for ships carrying Jewish refugees . He did not say what he would offer in return . On 11 July Prime Minister Winston Churchill put an end to the idea when he told Eden that the murder of the Jews was " probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed , " and that there should be " no negotiations of any kind on this subject . " Of Brand 's mission he wrote : " The project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of the most nondescript character . I would not take it seriously . " 
 = = = Leak to media = = = 
 The British leaked details of Eichmann 's proposal to the media . On 19 July 1944 – the day before the 20 July plot , the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler – the New York Herald Tribune ( dateline London , 18 July ) reported that two Hungarian government emissaries in Turkey had proposed that Hungarian Jews be given safe passage in exchange for British and American pharmaceuticals and transport for the Germans . The London Times called it " one of the most loathsome " stories of the war , an attempt to " blackmail , deceive and split " the Allies , and a " new level of fantasy and self @-@ deception . " 
 The mass deportation of Hungarian Jews had already stopped by the time of the leak . Following publication in mid @-@ June of parts of the Vrba @-@ Wetzler report , describing the use of gas chambers inside Auschwitz , the Jewish Agency in Geneva had cabled London asking that Hungarian ministers be held personally responsible for the killings . The cable was intercepted and passed to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy , who ordered an end to the deportations on 7 July . 
 The British released Brand on 5 October 1944 . Brand said they would not allow him to return to Hungary and forced him to travel to Palestine . Bauer disputes this , writing that Brand was simply afraid of returning to Budapest , convinced the Germans would murder him . 
 = = = Himmler 's involvement = = = 
 Germany 's Foreign Minister , Joachim von Ribbentrop , had apparently known nothing about the proposal . He cabled Brigadeführer Edmund Veesenmayer of the SS on 20 July 1944 to ask about it , and was told on 22 July that Brand and Grosz had been sent to Turkey on the orders of Heinrich Himmler , head of the SS . Eichmann himself said during interrogation after the war that the order had come from Himmler , as did SS officer Kurt Becher : " Himmler said to me : ' Take whatever you can from the Jews . Promise them whatever you want . What we will keep is another matter . ' " 
 Bauer writes that the " clumsiness of the approach has been a wonderment to all observers . " He argues that Eichmann wanted to murder Jews , not sell them , but was forced instead to act as Himmler 's reluctant messenger . On the day Brand left Germany for Istanbul in May 1944 , Eichmann was in Auschwitz checking that it was ready for the trainloads of Jews about to arrive from Hungary . The camp 's commander , Obersturmbannführer Rudolf Höss , said it would be difficult to process such large numbers , whereupon Eichmann ordered that new arrivals be gassed immediately rather than going through " selection . " This does not suggest that he was going to halt the killing until Brand returned from Istanbul . 
 In Bauer 's view , the presence at one of the meetings of Gerhard Clages of the SS signals that Himmler was focusing on secret peace talks . Brand and Grosz arrived in Istanbul just two months before the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944 . Himmler knew that attempts might be made on Hitler 's life , though not where and when . It is possible that he wanted to broker for peace in case Hitler did not survive , using low @-@ level agents for plausible deniability , and if Hitler did survive , Bauer argues , Himmler could offer him a peace deal with the West that excluded the Soviet Union . 
 Brand himself came to believe that the proposal had been designed to drive a wedge between the Allies . Two months before his death in 1964 , at the trial in Germany of Eichmann 's deputies Hermann Krumey and Otto <unk> , he said he had " made a terrible mistake in passing this on to the British . It is now clear to me that Himmler sought to sow suspicion among the Allies as a preparation for his much desired Nazi @-@ Western coalition against Moscow . " 
 = = = Kasztner train = = = 
 Brand 's failure to return to Budapest was a disaster for the Aid and Rescue Committee . On 27 May Hansi Brand , who at some point during this period had become Kasztner 's lover , was arrested and beaten by the Hungarian Arrow Cross . Kasztner wrote that on 9 June that Eichmann told him : " If I do not receive a positive reply within three days , I shall operate the mill at Auschwitz " ( " die <unk> laufen <unk> " ) . Hansi Brand told Claude <unk> : 
 We ... [ lived ] between fear and despair and hope . And that formed itself into such a heap of stuff , that I can 't really describe it – how it was and what it was . Every evening , we went to pieces and during the night , we tried to build ourselves up again , so we could go into the street ... and look like human beings again ... And [ it ] was like being in a windmill ; it turned and moved . 
 Bauer argues that the Aid and Rescue committee made the mistake of almost adopting the anti @-@ Semitic belief in unlimited Jewish power , that Jewish leaders could move around freely and persuade the Allies to act , and that American Jews had easy access to money and goods . The committee had similar trust in the Allies , but the latter were preparing for the invasion of Normandy , which began on 6 June 1944 . " At that crucial moment , " writes Bauer , " to antagonize the Soviets because of some hare @-@ brained Gestapo plan to ransom Jews was totally out of the question . " 
 Despite the setbacks , Kasztner , Hansi Brand and the rest of the committee secured the release of around 1 @,@ 684 Jews , including 273 children , who were allowed to leave Budapest for Switzerland by train on 30 June 1944 . The committee paid SS officer Kurt Becher $ 1000 per person in foreign currency , shares , jewellery and gold , raised from the wealthier passengers to cover the cost of the rest . After an unexplained detour to the Bergen @-@ Belsen concentration camp , the passengers arrived in Switzerland in two batches in August and December that year . Joel Brand 's mother , sister and niece were on the train , as were 10 members of Kasztner 's family and 388 people from the Kolozsvár ghetto in his home town . Kastner 's relationship with these passengers led to the criticism that his negotiations with Becher had focused on saving people he knew , an allegation that led to his assassination in 1957 . 
 = = Later life = = 
 = = = Move to Israel = = = 
 Bauer concludes that Brand was a courageous man who had passionately wanted to help the Jewish people , but his life was plagued after the mission by suspicion , including from other members of the Aid and Rescue Committee , because of his failure to return to Budapest . After the British released him , he joined the Stern Gang , who were fighting to remove the British from Palestine . He and Hansi Brand lived for the rest of their lives in Israel , at first moving to the Givat Brenner kibbutz , then Tel Aviv , with their two sons . 
 Ronald Florence writes that Brand seemed to live only to set the record straight . He offered testimony about the blood @-@ for @-@ goods proposal during several trials , including that of Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1961 and Eichmann 's assistant Hermann Krumey in Frankfurt in 1964 . 
 = = = Kasztner assassination = = = 
 Brand testified in 1954 at the controversial libel trial in Jerusalem of <unk> Gruenwald , who was sued by the Israeli government on behalf of Rezső Kasztner . Gruenwald was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who had moved to Israel after the war . In a self @-@ published pamphlet in 1952 he accused Kasztner , by then an Israeli civil servant , of having collaborated with the Nazis by dealing with Eichmann . Brand testified for Kasztner , but instead of defending him took the opportunity to accuse the Jewish Agency , whose officials became the first Israeli government , of having helped the British scupper the blood @-@ for @-@ goods proposal . 
 After a trial that lasted 18 months , the judge concluded that , by negotiating with Eichmann , failing to warn the many to save the few on the Kasztner train , and writing an affidavit after the war for Kurt Becher , Kasztner had " sold his soul to the devil . " It was because of Kasztner 's support for Becher that the Americans decided not to prosecute Becher at Nuremberg . Kasztner also wrote affidavits for Hans Jüttner , Dieter Wisliceny and Hermann Krumey . 
 The judge said that Kasztner 's failure to do more to warn the community that they were being sent to the gas chambers , and not resettled , had helped Eichmann maintain order , and that the Kasztner train had been a payoff . Tom Segev called the ruling " one of the most heartless in the history of Israel , perhaps the most heartless ever . " The Supreme Court of Israel overturned most of the verdict in January 1958 , ruling that the lower court had " erred seriously , " but Kasztner was assassinated in 1957 as a result of the earlier judgment . 
 = = Death = = 
 Brand was never able to put behind him the idea that he might have saved a million lives . In 1961 Life magazine called him " a man who lives in the shadows with a broken heart . " He died of a heart attack , aged 58 , during a visit to Germany in July 1964 , telling an interviewer shortly before his death : " An accident of life placed the fate of one million human beings on my shoulders . I eat and sleep and think only of them . " 
 Over 800 mourners attended his funeral in Tel Aviv , including Colonel Arieh Baz on behalf of Israel 's President Zalman <unk> and Teddy Kollek , director @-@ general of the prime minister 's office , on behalf of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol . The eulogy was delivered by Gideon Hausner , the attorney general who prosecuted Adolf Eichmann . 
 = Acid2 = 
 Acid2 is a test page published and promoted by the Web Standards Project to expose web page rendering flaws in web browsers and other applications that render HTML . Named after the acid test for gold , it was developed in the spirit of Acid1 , a relatively narrow test of compliance with the Cascading Style Sheets 1 @.@ 0 ( <unk> ) standard , and was released on 13 April 2005 . As with Acid1 , an application passes the test if the way it displays the test page matches a reference image . 
 Acid2 tests aspects of HTML markup , CSS 2 @.@ 1 styling , PNG images , and data URIs . The Acid2 test page will be displayed correctly in any application that follows the World Wide Web Consortium and Internet Engineering Task Force specifications for these technologies . These specifications are known as web standards because they describe how technologies used on the web are expected to function . 
 Acid2 was designed with Microsoft Internet Explorer particularly in mind . The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that Internet Explorer did not follow web standards . It was prone to display web pages differently from other browsers , causing web developers to spend time tweaking their web pages . Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet Explorer comply with web standards . 
 Acid2 was released on 13 April 2005 . On 31 October 2005 , Safari 2 @.@ 0 @.@ 2 became the first browser to pass Acid2 . Opera , <unk> , Firefox , and others followed . With the release of Internet Explorer 8 on 19 March 2009 , the latest versions of all major desktop web browsers now pass the test , until <unk> was released , which fails the test , and its successor , Microsoft Edge , has never been able to render it ( as of writing ) . Acid2 was followed by Acid3 . 
 The test fails when browsers become compliant with current CSS collapse and margin standards . 
 = = History = = 
 Acid2 was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie , chief technical officer of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard . In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET , Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely <unk> with other browsers . He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7 , then in development , to achieve a greater degree of standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer . The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment ; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same . 
 Lie and a colleague , Ian Hickson , had created the first draft of the test in February 2005 . Ian Hickson coded the final test in collaboration with the Web Standards Project and the larger web community . It was officially released on 13 April 2005 and at that time , every web browser failed it spectacularly . 
 On 23 April 2005 , Acid2 was updated to fix a bug that made the mouth appear too close to the nose . After several complaints , the test was again updated in January 2006 to remove a test for unpopular <unk> @-@ style comments that were never widely implemented . In browsers that do not implement <unk> @-@ style comments , the original test displayed the word " <unk> " on the bottom part of the face . 
 In March 2008 , Ian Hickson released Acid3 as a follow @-@ up to Acid2 . While Acid2 primarily tests CSS , Acid3 focuses more on JavaScript and other " Web 2 @.@ 0 " technologies . 
 = = Microsoft 's response = = 
 In July 2005 , Chris Wilson , the Internet Explorer Platform Architect , stated that passing Acid2 was not a priority for Internet Explorer 7 , describing the test as a " wish list " of features rather than a true test of standards compliance . In December 2007 , Microsoft announced that all the changes required to pass Acid2 would be made available in Internet Explorer 8 , but that the changes would not be turned on by default , meaning that IE8 would not actually pass the test . The concern was that switching to a new behavior would cause too many problems in web pages expecting Internet Explorer 's old , non @-@ compliant behavior . Then in March 2008 Microsoft released IE8 beta 1 and turned on the changes by default after all . James Pratt , product manager for IE8 , explained that this decision was made so that " developers can spend more time building features and cool stuff , and less time just trying to tweak their sites across different browsers . " 
 Unfortunately , another unresolved standards compliance issue caused IE8 beta 1 to fail if not all elements of the test were hosted from the same server . In August 2008 Microsoft released IE8 beta 2 , which resolved the issue . As of that beta , however , standards mode is not turned on by default for pages loaded in the " <unk> Zone " . This zone is active for pages loaded via UNC paths , named addresses without dots ( like http : / / <unk> / ) , and sites that bypass the proxy settings . As such , IE8 will not pass the Acid2 test if loaded in these cases . 
 = = Overview of standards tested = = 
 Acid2 tests a variety of web standards published by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Internet Engineering Task Force . With the exception of CSS 2 @.@ 1 , all web standards tested were codified before the year 2000 . CSS 2 @.@ 1 was a candidate recommendation at the time of Acid2 's release , and was still a candidate recommendation as of 23 April 2009 . 
 Specifically , Acid2 tests : 
 Alpha transparency in PNG @-@ format images : The eyes of the smiley face use alpha transparency , which is part of the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification . Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly . This was a significant issue because Internet Explorer 6 , the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released , did not support alpha transparency . This deficiency was rectified in Internet Explorer 7 , bringing Internet Explorer in line with other web browsers in this regard . 
 The object element : The eyes also test support of the HTML object element . The object element has been a part of HTML since HTML 4 was released in 1998 , yet by 2005 it still was not completely supported in all web browsers . The creators of Acid2 considered object element support important because it allows for content fallback — if an object fails to load , then the browser can display alternative ( generally simpler , more reliable ) content in its place . 
 Data URIs : The actual images that form the eyes are encoded as data URIs , which allow multimedia to be embedded in web pages rather than stored as a separate file . Acid2 tests the most common case , where a binary image is <unk> @-@ encoded into text and then that encoded text is included in a data URI in the web page . Although the <unk> published the data URI specification in 1998 , they never formally adopted it as a standard . Nonetheless , the HTML 4 @.@ 01 specification references the data URI scheme , and data URI support has now been implemented in most browsers . 
 Absolute , relative , and fixed CSS positioning : Absolute positioning means that the web developer specifies the exact X and Y coordinates where an element is to be placed into the page . Relative positioning means that the web developer specifies an X and Y offset from the usual position of the element . Fixed positioning means that the element is placed relative to the browser window , and scrolls with the window rather than with the rest of the page . 
 The CSS box model : This feature allows the web designer to specify dimensions , padding , borders , and margins , and was the focus of the original Acid1 test . Acid2 not only <unk> margin support but also tests minimum and maximum heights and widths , features new to CSS 2 @.@ 0 . 
 CSS table formatting : This part of CSS allows the web designer to apply table formatting without traditional HTML table markup . 
 CSS generated content : Using CSS generated content , web developers can add decorations and annotations to specified elements without having to add the content to each one individually . 
 CSS parsing : A number of illegal CSS statements are present in Acid2 to test error handling . Standards @-@ compliant browsers are expected to handle these errors as the CSS specification directs . This helps ensure cross @-@ browser compatibility by making all browsers treat CSS with the same level of strictness , so that what works in one browser should not cause errors in another . 
 Paint order : Acid2 requires that the browser has standard paint order . That is , overlapping elements should be placed or painted on top of each other in the correct order . 
 Hovering effects : When the user moves his or her mouse over the smiley face 's nose , it turns blue . This is called a hovering effect , and while it has traditionally been used for hyperlinks , it should work on a wide variety of HTML elements . 
 Because Acid2 is not a comprehensive test , it does not guarantee total conformance to any particular standard . A variant of the Acid2 test that does not test for data URI support is also available from the Web Standards Project . 
 = = Passing conditions = = 
 A passing score is only considered valid if the browser 's default settings were used . Actions such as changing font sizes , zoom level , and applying user <unk> can break the display of the test . This is expected and is not relevant to a browser 's compliance . 
 The following browser settings and user actions invalidate the test : 
 Scrolling 
 Resizing the browser window 
 <unk> in or out 
 <unk> images 
 Using Opera 's Fit to width or Small Screen Rendering modes 
 Applying custom fonts , colors , styles , etc .

 If rendered correctly , Acid2 will appear as a smiley face below the text " Hello World ! " in the user 's browser , with the nose turning blue when the mouse cursor hovers over it .

 = Radstock = 
 Radstock is a town in Somerset , England , 9 miles ( 14 km ) south west of Bath , and 8 miles ( 13 km ) north west of Frome . It is within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset and had a population of 5 @,@ 620 according to the 2011 Census . Since 2011 Radstock has been a town council in its own right . 
 Radstock has been settled since the Iron Age , and its importance grew after the construction of the Fosse Way , a Roman road . The growth of the town occurred after 1763 , when coal was discovered in the area . Large numbers of mines opened during the 19th century including several owned by the Waldegrave family , who had been Lords of the Manor since the English Civil War . Admiral Lord Radstock , brother of George , fourth Earl Waldegrave , took the town 's name as his title when created a Baron . 
 The spoil heap of Writhlington colliery is now the Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest , which includes 3 @,@ 000 tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1 @,@ 400 insect fossil specimens have been recovered . The complex geology and narrow seams made coal extraction difficult . Tonnage increased throughout the 19th century , reaching a peak around 1901 , when there were 79 separate collieries and annual production was 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 tons per annum . However , due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages output declined and the number of pits reduced from 30 at the beginning of the 20th century to 14 by the mid @-@ thirties ; the last two pits , Kilmersdon and Writhlington , closed in September 1973 . The Great Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Railway both established stations and marshalling yards in the town . The last passenger train services to Radstock closed in 1966 . Manufacturing industries such as printing , binding and packaging provide some local employment . In recent years , Radstock has increasingly become a commuter town for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol . 
 Radstock is home to the Radstock Museum which is housed in a former market hall , and has a range of exhibits which offer an insight into north @-@ east Somerset life since the 19th century . Many of the exhibits relate to local geology and the now disused Somerset coalfield and geology . The town is also home to Writhlington School , famous for its Orchid collection , and a range of educational , religious and cultural buildings and sporting clubs . 
 = = History = = 
 Radstock has been settled since the Iron Age . Its importance grew with the construction of the Fosse Way , the Roman road that ran along what is now part of the <unk> in Radstock . As a result , the town was known as <unk> at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086 , meaning the stockade by the Roman road , from the Old English <unk> . The rad part of the name is believed to relate to red ; the soil locally is reddish marl . The parish of Radstock was part of the Kilmersdon Hundred , 
 The Great Western Railway , and the Somerset and Dorset Railway , established stations and marshalling yards in the town . Radstock was the terminus for the southern branch of the Somerset Coal Canal , which was turned into a tramway in 1815 . It then became a central point for railway development , with large coal depots , wash houses , workshops and a gas works . As part of the development of the Wiltshire , Somerset and Weymouth Railway , an 8 @-@ mile ( 13 km ) line from Radstock to Frome was built to carry the coal . In the 1870s the broad @-@ gauge line was converted to standard gauge and connected to the Bristol and North Somerset Line which linked the town to the Great Western Railway . The Radstock Railway Land covers the old marshalling yards and sheds and comprises an area of approximately 8 @.@ 8 hectares of land which is the subject of ongoing planning and development applications to redevelop the area . 
 The town is close to the site of the Radstock rail accident , a rail crash that took place on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway , on 7 August 1876 . Two trains collided on a single track section , resulting in the deaths of 15 passengers . 
 The last passenger train services in Radstock closed in 1966 , and the last coal mines closed in 1973 . Manufacturing industries such as printing , binding and packaging provide some local employment . More recently Radstock has become a commuter town for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol , leading to traffic problems at peak hours . 
 = = = Coal mining = = = 
 In 1763 , coal was discovered in Radstock and mining began in the area . In , 1896 the pits were owned by the Trustee of Frances , late Countess of Waldegrave . The Waldegrave family had been Lords of the Manor of Radstock since the English Civil War . Between 1800 and 1850 , <unk> , Middle Pit , Old Pit , <unk> , <unk> , and Wellsway mines opened . There were also a series of pits east of the town at Writhlington and under different ownership . In 1896 , they were owned by Writhlington , Huish and Foxcote Colliery Co . ; however , following an acrimonious dispute about the terms and conditions of the miners in 1899 , a new company , Writhlington Collieries Co . , was set up to run the mines . The Upper and Lower Writhlington , Huish and Foxcote were all merged into one colliery . The spoil heap is a now Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest . The site and includes 3 @,@ 000 tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1 @,@ 400 insect fossils have been recovered . These include <unk> , and <unk> and the world 's earliest known Damselfly . It is a Geological Conservation Review Site . 
 The complex geology and narrow seams made the coal extraction difficult ; three underground explosions , in 1893 , 1895 and 1908 , were amongst the first attributable solely to airborne coal dust . 
 Tonnage increased throughout the 19th century , reaching a peak around 1901 , when there were 79 separate collieries and annual production was 1 @.@ 25 million tons per annum . However , due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages , decline soon took hold and the number of pits reduced from 30 at the beginning of the 20th century to 14 by the mid @-@ thirties , 12 at nationalisation to create National Coal Board on 1 January 1947 , 5 by 1959 and none after 1973 . Narrow seams made production expensive , limiting profit and investment , and a reduced national demand together with competition from more economical coalfields led to the closure of the last two pits in the coalfield , Kilmersdon and Writhlington , in September 1973 . 
 = = Governance = = 
 As of 2011 , Radstock became a town council in its own right . Until then , the town was part of the Norton Radstock civil parish , which was created in 1974 as a successor to the Norton @-@ Radstock Urban District , itself created in 1933 by the merger of Midsomer Norton and Radstock urban districts , along with part of Frome Rural District . Under the Local Government Act 1972 it became a successor parish to the urban district . 
 Radstock is governed by the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset and by Radstock Town Council . There is one electoral ward in Radstock with the same area and population as is quoted above . 
 It was also part of the Wansdyke constituency , which elects a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . At the 2010 general election this constituency changed to North East Somerset . It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The main geological feature in this area of the Mendip Hills south of Hallatrow consists of Supra @-@ Pennant Measures which includes the upper coal measures and outcrops of sandstone . The southern part of the Radstock Syncline have coals of the Lower and Middle Coal Measures been worked , mainly at the Newbury and Vobster collieries in the southeast and in the New Rock and Moorewood pits to the southwest . The Hercynian orogeny caused shock waves in the rock as the Mendip Hills were pushed up , forcing the coal measures to break along fractures or faults . Along the Radstock Slide Fault the distance between the broken ends of a coal seam can be as much as 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 457 m ) . 
 Radstock lies on the Wellow Brook which then runs through Wellow to join the Cam Brook at Midford to form Midford Brook before joining the River Avon close to the Dundas Aqueduct and the remains of the Somerset Coal Canal . The base of the valley is of alluvium deposits . Above this on both sides of all of the valley is a band of shales and clays from the Penarth Group . These rocks are from the Triassic period . The majority of the remaining upland around Radstock is Lias Limestone ( white and blue ) while the very highest part above 130 m , south of Haydon , is a small outcrop of Inferior Oolitic Limestone . All these limestones are from the Jurassic period . The steepest slopes of both the Kilmersdon and Snail ’ s Bottom valleys have frequently slipped . Below all of the area is the coal bearing Carboniferous strata . Haydon is an outlier of Radstock and was built to house the miners for the local pit . The disused railway line and inclined railway at Haydon form important elements within the Kilmersdon valley east of Haydon . The modern landscape has a less maintained and " rougher " character and texture than neighbouring agricultural areas . This is caused in the main by the remnants of the coal industry and its infrastructure and changes in agricultural management . The disturbance caused by coal mining and the railways and the subsequent ending of mining and disuse of the railways has created valuable habitats of nature conservation interest . 
 Along with the rest of South West England , Radstock has a temperate climate , which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England . The annual mean temperature is about 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) with seasonal and diurnal variations , but because of the modifying effect of the sea , the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom . January is the coldest month , with mean minimum temperatures between 1 ° C ( 34 ° F ) and 2 ° C ( 36 ° F ) . July and August are the warmest months in the region , with mean daily maxima around 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) . In general , December is the dullest month and June the sunniest . The southwest of England enjoys a favoured location , particularly in summer , when the Azores High extends its influence north @-@ eastwards towards the UK . 
 Cloud often forms inland , especially near hills , and reduces exposure to sunshine . The average annual sunshine is about 1 @,@ 600 hours . Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection . In summer , convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds , and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at that time of year . Average rainfall is 800 – 900 mm ( 31 – 35 in ) . About 8 – 15 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , and June to August having the lightest . The predominant wind direction is from the southwest .

 Radstock was the terminus for the southern branch of the Somerset Coal Canal , which was turned into a tramway in 1815 and later incorporated into the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway . It then became a central point for railway development with large coal depots , warehouses , workshops and a gas works . As part of the development of the Wilts , Somerset and Weymouth Railway an 8 @-@ mile ( 13 km ) line from Radstock to Frome was built to carry the coal . In the 1870s the broad @-@ gauge line was converted to standard gauge and connected to the Bristol and North Somerset Line connecting it to the Great Western Railway at Bristol ; the GWR also took over the Wiltshire , Somerset and Weymouth Railway in 1876 . The Bristol and North Somerset line closed to passenger traffic in 1959 . The line is now the route of National Cycle Route 24 , otherwise known as the Colliers ' Way , a national cycle route which passes many landmarks associated with the coal field ; other local roads and footpaths follow the tramways developed during the coal mining years . The cycle route currently runs from Dundas Aqueduct to Frome via Radstock , although it is intended to provide a continuous cycle route to Southampton and Portsmouth . 
 Radstock had a second railway station on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway extension to Bath , which closed to passengers in 1966 . The stations were adjacent to each other in the centre of the town , and each had level crossings across the busy <unk> road , causing long tailbacks at busy periods . The S & D line also carried substantial coal traffic . A spur from the Great Western line on to the S & D and continuing to Writhlington Colliery remained open for a few years after the railway 's closure to passenger traffic , until the colliery closed in 1973 . 
 = = Memorial Gardens = = 
 Since the closure of the railways the railway land in the centre of the town stood empty for many years . Most prominent was a green space between the museum and brook which housed a dis @-@ used pit wheel on a low steel frame , which many passers @-@ by mistook for a spinning wheel . There had long been an aspiration to develop a memorial park or garden on the site to commemorate both the mining history of the town and to provide a new setting for the town 's war memorial . 
 In 2001 a local practice of landscape architects , New Leaf Studio were commissioned by Bath & North East Somerset Council to develop proposals for the land . The first phase of the park , the Memorial gardens were then built for the Norton Radstock Town Council in 2005 to New leaf Studio 's designs incorporating a new sculptural base for the old mine wheel by artist Sebastien Boyesen . 
 The new Memorial Gardens incorporate the war memorial which was moved from Victoria Square as part of the project . The planting employs a naturalistic style with broad drifts of herbaceous perennials and grasses providing colour through a long season , extending through the winter with dry stems and seed heads .

 The Radstock Museum is housed in the town 's former market hall . The museum has a range of exhibits which offer an insight into north @-@ east Somerset life since the 19th century . The museum was originally opened in 1989 in barns in Haydon , and moved to its current site in the restored and converted Victorian Market Hall , a grade II listed building dating from 1897 which was opened on 10 July 1999 by Loyd Grossman . Many of the exhibits relate to the now disused local Somerset coalfield and geology . Other areas include aspects of local history including the school and shops , a forge , carpenter 's shop and exhibits relating to agriculture . Artefacts and memorabilia of the Somerset Coal Canal , Somerset and Dorset and Great Western Railways are also on display .

 = Effects of Hurricane Wilma in The Bahamas = 
 The effects of Hurricane Wilma in The Bahamas were generally unexpected and primarily concentrated on the western portion of Grand Bahama . Hurricane Wilma developed on October 15 , 2005 in the Caribbean Sea , and after initially organizing slowly it explosively deepened to reach peak winds of 185 mph ( 295 km / h ) and a record @-@ low pressure of 882 mbar ( hPa ) . It weakened and struck eastern Mexico as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale , and accelerated northeastward to make landfall on southwestern Florida on October 24 . After crossing the state , Wilma briefly restrengthened in the open Atlantic Ocean , moving north of The Bahamas before weakening and later becoming an extratropical cyclone . 
 On October 24 , Hurricane Wilma made its closest approach to The Bahamas , passing about 150 km ( 90 mi ) north @-@ northwest of Freeport . While passing the archipelago , Wilma produced hurricane @-@ force winds and powerful storm surge , flooding southwestern coastal areas of Grand Bahama and destroying hundreds of buildings . Damage totaled about $ 100 million ( 2005 USD ) , almost entirely on the western half of the island . Central Grand Bahama , including the Freeport area , reported minor to moderate damage , while the eastern end received little to no damage . One child died on the island from the flooding . Elsewhere in the Bahamas , moderate damage occurred on Abaco and Bimini , while islands further to the south reported minimal wind damage 
 = = Preparations = = 
 At 1200 UTC on October 23 , about 24 hours before Wilma made its closest approach to the archipelago , the government of The Bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern portion of the territory , including the <unk> , Andros Island , Berry Islands , Bimini , Eleuthera , Grand Bahama , and New Providence . The government of The Bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion , though many failed to fully prepare , believing Wilma would pass through the region as a tropical storm . Many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane shutters , as well . Officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of Grand Bahama island , and established multiple shelters on the island . Evacuations were minimal ; it is estimated that between 300 and 1 @,@ 000 people left . As most people failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane , hardware stores and food markets were generally well @-@ stocked . 
 = = Impact = = 
 On Grand Bahama Island , Wilma produced sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 95 mph ) and a gust of 178 km / h ( 111 mph ) . The hurricane also produced a storm surge of over 3 @.@ 7 m ( 12 ft ) , reportedly as high as 6 @.@ 1 m ( 20 ft ) along the southwestern portion of the island . The surge , which moved about 305 m ( 1 @,@ 000 ft ) inland , caused large @-@ scale flooding that washed away or destroyed about 800 homes . Damage was estimated at $ 100 million ( 2005 USD ) on the western portion of the island . Excluding the southwestern region of Grand Bahama , the majority of the island reported minor wind damage , and the eastern end of the island reported little , or no , damage . Over 7 @,@ 000 people on the island were directly affected by the hurricane , many of whom had not fully recovered from hurricanes Frances and Jeanne during the previous year . 
 Significant damage was reported in coastal areas of Grand Bahama Island , with widespread destruction of roofs and vehicles , along with downed poles and trees . Power and telephone services were disrupted throughout the island . A total of 400 structures sustained damage , of which about 200 commercial buildings were severely damaged and recommended by engineers not to be repaired . Among the destroyed buildings were a police station on the western end and several buildings in Freeport . More than 500 automobiles were flooded , including five police cars . The storm surge also raised 54 corpses in five graveyards on the island . Several resorts were closed for an extended period of time , all on the western portion of the island . One hotel , the Xanadu Beach and Marine Resort , reported about $ 3 @.@ 5 million in damage ( 2005 USD ) , including numerous destroyed windows designed to withstand hurricane @-@ force winds . Further to the east , numerous houses and commercial buildings lost their roofs in the city of Freeport . One serious traffic accident occurred when the winds overturned a bus , inflicting injuries on the driver . Several other traffic accidents were reported in the area , although none were severe . During the passage of the hurricane , five cases of looting were reported , of which one person was caught in the process . Storm surge from the hurricane killed one child , the only casualty directly related to Wilma in the archipelago . 
 Damage was also heavy on Bimini island , where heavy rainfall and powerful storm surge damaged homes , trees , and utility poles . On the island , the hurricane severely damaged a hotel and eight waterfront homes . On Abaco , eight homes and a governmental clinic were destroyed . The storm surge destroyed a government dock and caused flooding and beach erosion near the coast . New Providence and the Berry Islands also reported minor wind damage from Wilma , primarily to downed trees and power lines . Throughout the Bahamas , Wilma damaged public infrastructure such as schools , roads , health clinics , and electrical systems . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 By about two days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma , 800 residents on Grand Bahama remained in shelters , including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport . On Bimini , most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane . The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini , and successfully requested to be included under the federation 's hurricane appeal for Central America . Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected . The Bahamian Red Cross began a three @-@ month program to distribute food and other items to 1 @,@ 000 of the 3 @,@ 500 affected families , primarily on Grand Bahama ; the remaining 2 @,@ 500 families received assistance from the government and other organizations . Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected . In Nassau , the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items , blankets , health kits , tarpaulins and water . About a week after the hurricane , the United States Agency for International Development began providing $ 50 @,@ 000 ( 2005 USD ) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies . The agency also provided $ 9 @,@ 000 ( 2005 USD ) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas . Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided hygienic kits , plastic sheeting , blankets , and jerry cans . 
 Electricians had power restored to the Freeport area by the day after the storm , and had power restored to most of the western portion of the island within three weeks after the hurricane . Work crews quickly removed road debris and tree limbs , and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared . The passage of the hurricane left 1 @,@ 000 – 4 @,@ 000 people and hundreds of animals homeless . In response , the Grand Bahama Humane Society distributed about 340 kg ( 750 lb ) of dog food and treated or euthanized injured animals , depending on their condition . The earlier effects of Wilma on Mexico left many tourist areas in that country closed , leading to a 10 % increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005 . By about three weeks after the hurricane , the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened , and all but one resort were also reopened ; the remaining resort was reopened about two months after the hurricane . 
 = SMS Viribus Unitis = 
 SMS Viribus Unitis was the first Austro @-@ Hungarian dreadnought battleship of the Tegetthoff class . Its name , meaning " Joint Forces " , was the personal motto of Emperor Franz Joseph I. 
 Viribus Unitis was ordered by the Austro @-@ Hungarian navy in 1908 . As the first of the newly created Tegetthoff @-@ class battleships , she was laid down in Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste on 24 July 1910 . Viribus Unitis was launched from the shipyard on 24 June 1911 and was formally commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 5 December 1912 . 
 During World War I , Viribus Unitis took part in the flight of the German warships SMS Goeben and Breslau . In May 1915 , she also took part in the bombardment of the Italian port city of Ancona . Viribus Unitis was sunk by a limpet mine planted by frogmen of the Italian Regia Marina on 1 November 1918 .

 = = = Construction = = = 
 Viribus Unitis was ordered in 1908 as the first of a class of four , the first dreadnoughts to be built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . Initially intended to be named Tegetthoff , she was renamed on the personal order of Emperor Franz Josef ; following this , the second ship of the class was named Tegetthoff . The ship was laid down in the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste on 24 July 1910 . Following eleven months of construction , Viribus Unitis was launched on 24 June 1911 . Following her fitting out , she was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 5 December 1912 . 
 = = = Characteristics = = = 
 Viribus Unitis had an overall length of 152 metres ( 498 ft 8 in ) , a beam of 27 @.@ 9 metres ( 91 ft 6 in ) , and a draught of 8 @.@ 7 metres ( 28 ft 7 in ) at deep load . She displaced 20 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 19 @,@ 684 long tons ) at load and 21 @,@ 689 tonnes ( 21 @,@ 346 long tons ) at deep load . 
 Viribus Unitis had four Parsons steam turbines , each of which was housed in a separate engine @-@ room . The turbines were powered by twelve Babcock & Wilcox boilers . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 27 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 20 @,@ 134 kW ) , which was theoretically enough to attain her designed speed of 20 knots ( 23 mph ; 37 km / h ) , but no figures from her speed trials are known to exist . She carried 1 @,@ 844 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 815 @.@ 4 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 267 @.@ 2 tonnes ( 263 @.@ 0 long tons ) of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , she could steam for 4 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 800 km ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 12 mph ; 19 km / h ) . 
 Viribus Unitis mounted twelve 305 @-@ millimetre ( 12 in ) / 45 @-@ caliber K 10 guns in four triple turrets . Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 @-@ centimetre ( 5 @.@ 91 in ) / 50 K 10 guns mounted in casemates amidships . Twelve 66 @-@ millimetre ( 3 in ) / 50 K 10 guns were mounted on open pivots on the upper deck above the casemates . Three more 66 @-@ mm K 10 guns were mounted on the upper turrets for anti @-@ aircraft duties .

 Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria traveled aboard Viribus Unitis in late June 1914 en route to Bosnia to observe military maneuvers . On 25 June , he boarded the ship in Trieste Harbor and travelled to the mouth of the Neretva River , where he transferred to another vessel . On 30 June , two days after Ferdinand and his wife were killed by Gavrilo Princip in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo , Viribus Unitis transported their bodies back to Trieste . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Prior to the war , Viribus Unitis was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . During World War I , the battleship saw limited service due to the Otranto Barrage which prohibited Austro @-@ Hungarian battleships from leaving the Adriatic sea . As a result , she hardly ever left Pola . 
 Viribus Unitis , along with her sister ships Tegetthoff , Prinz Eugen and the remainder of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , was mobilized on the eve of World War I to support the flight of SMS Goeben and Breslau . The two German ships were stationed in the Mediterranean and were attempting to break out of the strait of Messina , which was surrounded by British troops and vessels and make their way to Turkey . After the Germans successfully broke out of Messina , the navy was recalled . The fleet had by that time advanced as far south as Brindisi in south eastern Italy . Viribus Unitis also participated in the bombardment of the Italian city of Ancona in May 1915 . Following these operations Viribus Unitis remained in Pola for most of the remainder of the war . 
 Her tenure in Pola was livened up by a visit from the new Emperor Charles I on 15 December 1916 and another by Kaiser Wilhelm II on 12 December 1917 during his inspection of the German submarine base there . The Italians conducted no less than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 . 
 = = = The Otranto Raid = = = 
 By 1918 , the new commander of the Austrian fleet , Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy , decided to conduct another attack on the Otranto Barrage to allow more German and Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boats to safely get through the heavily defended strait . During the night of 8 June , Horthy left the naval base of Pola with Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen . The other two dreadnoughts , Szent István and Tegetthoff , along with one destroyer and six torpedo boats departed Pola on 9 June . At about 3 : 15 on the morning of 10 June , two Italian MAS boats , MAS 15 and MAS 21 , spotted the Austrian fleet . The MAS platoon was commanded by Capitano di fregata Luigi Rizzo while the individual boats were commanded by Capo timoniere Armando Gori and Guardiamarina di complemento Giuseppe Aonzo respectively . Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts . MAS 21 attacked Tegetthoff , but her torpedoes failed . MAS 15 managed to hit Szent István with her torpedoes at about 3 : 25 am . Both boats were then chased away from the scene by the Austrian escort vessels . 
 Despite attempts to take the crippled Szent István into tow by Tegetthoff , the ship continued to sink and the attempt was abandoned . A few minutes after 6 : 00 am Szent István sank . Admiral Horthy , commander of the proposed attack , soon canceled the attack because he thought that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola . On the contrary , the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there . This was the last military operation that the Viribus Unitis was to take part in and she spent the rest of her career at port in Pola . 
 = = = Italian sabotage and sinking = = = 
 After it was clear that Austria @-@ Hungary had lost World War I , the Austrian government decided to give the ship , along with much of the fleet , to the newly formed State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs . This move would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies , since the new state had declared neutrality . Following the transfer of Viribus Unitis to the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs , she was renamed Jugoslavija . 
 On 1 November 1918 , two men of the Regia Marina , Raffaele <unk> and Raffaele Rossetti , rode a primitive manned torpedo ( nicknamed <unk> or " leech " ) into the Austro @-@ Hungarian naval base at Pola . Using limpet mines , they then sank Viribus Unitis now wearing the Croatian flag on its mast as well as the freighter Wien . It is not clear if the Italians participating in the action knew that the ship no longer belonged to Austria @-@ Hungary . 
 Traveling down the rows of Austrian battleships , the two men encountered Viribus Unitis at around 4 : 40 am . Rossetti placed one canister of TNT on the hull of the battleship , timed to explode at 6 : 30 am . He then flooded the second canister , sinking it on the harbor floor close to the ship . This second canister exploded close to the Austrian freighter Wien , resulting in her sinking . The men had no breathing sets , and therefore had to keep their heads above water . They were discovered and taken prisoner just after placing the explosives under the battleship 's hull . The two @-@ man team were captured and taken aboard Viribus Unitis , where they informed the new captain of the battleship what they had done but did not reveal the exact position of the explosives . Admiral Vuković then arranged for the two prisoners to be taken safely to the sister ship Tegetthoff , and ordered the evacuation of the ship . The explosion did not happen at 6 : 30 as predicted and Vuković returned to the ship with many sailors ( believing mistakenly that the Italians had lied ) . He therefore remained on his ship and went down with her and 300 – 400 of her crew when the mines exploded shortly afterwards at 6 : 44 . Following the explosion , the battleship sank in 15 minutes . 
 The two Italian crew were interned for a few days until the end of the war and were honored by the Kingdom of Italy with the Gold Medal of Military Valor . 
 = = Commemorations = = 
 SMS Viribus Unitis was selected as the main motif of a high value collectors ' coin : the Austrian SMS Viribus Unitis commemorative coin , minted on 13 September 2006 . The obverse side shows the flagship Viribus Unitis as seen from the deck of an accompanying ship in the fleet . Two other ships of an older class can be seen in the background . The reverse of the coin is a tribute to the old Austro @-@ Hungarian Imperial Navy , showing the SMS Viribus Unitis from a front angle . A naval biplane circles overhead and a submarine surfaces in the foreground . The coin commemorates not only the ship Viribus Unitis , but also the three main arms of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy in the First World War . The coin was the last of the series " Austria on the High Seas " . 
 There is a cutaway model of Viribus Unitis in the Museum of Military History in Vienna . The model is at a scale of 1 : 25 and has a total length of 6 metres . It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight craftsmen of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino . The model is true to the original in structure , layout , and engine system . It is accurate to the point that , for instance , the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly replicates the original not only in subject but also in the painting technique ( oil on canvas ) . 
 = Coat of arms of Singapore = 
 The National Coat of Arms of Singapore is the heraldic symbol representing the Southeast Asian island nation of Singapore . It was adopted in 1959 , the year Singapore became self @-@ governing within the British Empire . The committee that created it , headed by then Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye , was also responsible for the national flag and the national anthem of Singapore . 
 At the centre of the emblem is a red shield bearing a white crescent ( a new moon , representing a rising young nation ) and five white stars ( representing various national ideals including multiculturalism ) , supported by a lion and a tiger ( representing Singapore and Malaysia respectively ) ; below them is a blue ribbon inscribed with Majulah Singapura in gold , Malay for " Onward Singapore " . While the use of the coat of arms is restricted to the government , the symbol enjoys wide use on the national currency and state decorations , and appears on the cover of the national passport . 
 = = History = = 
 When Singapore became self @-@ governing in 1959 Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew was determined to create for the new state a coat of arms , among other symbols , to replace the coat of arms of the United Kingdom that had been in use until then . A committee was formed to design the state symbols , headed by the deputy prime minister Toh Chin Chye , who wanted both the arms and flag of Singapore to represent the country 's united , multi @-@ ethnic society . 
 The coat of arms and the flag were created over a span of two months by Toh and his committee . A law establishing the state symbols of Singapore was presented to the National Assembly by the Minister of Culture , S Rajaratnam , and approved in November 1959 . On 3 December 1959 , the state coat of arms , flag and anthem were presented to the people of Singapore for the first time . 
 Toh said in a 1989 interview that when tasked with the creation of the state symbols , " apart from the anthem we have to produce the flag and the crest " , and he felt that the new flag of Singapore should be flying next to the Union Jack . Toh further stated : 
 In the case of the state crest , again we got the five stars and the new moon ... A lion next to the tiger . Tiger of course is a more local animal than the lion . The old City Council had a lion . It did merge with our own ideas of self governing of Singapore . 
 = = Symbolism = = 
 The central emblem of the coat of arms is a red shield with five white stars resting above a white crescent , similar to the crescent and stars used on the Singapore flag and such other national symbols as the national ensign for civilian ships . Red symbolises " universal brotherhood and equality of man " and white " pervading and everlasting purity and virtue " . The crescent represents a new moon , which reflects " a young nation on the ascendant " , while the five @-@ pointed stars " stand for the nation 's ideals of democracy , peace , progress , justice and equality " . 
 The supporters of the shield are a lion and a tiger : the tiger symbolises the nation 's historical and close connections to Malaysia ( which Singapore was a state of from 1963 to 1965 ) while the lion represents Singapore itself . Below the supporters is a blue ribbon on which the national motto , Majulah Singapura , is written in gold . Majulah Singapura is also the title of the national anthem ; it means " Onward Singapore " in Malay , the national language of Singapore . 
 = = Uses = = 
 In 1985 the Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) began to issue their second series of coins . The coat of arms is displayed on the obverse side of these coins , surrounded by an inscription comprising the name of Singapore in the four official languages ( Chinese , Malay , Tamil and English ) and the year of minting . In 1987 the dollar coin entered circulation with this same pattern . 
 According to the MAS , the coat of arms has also appeared on all Singaporean banknotes since the " Orchid " series of 1967 . State decorations of Singapore also depict the coat of arms on the medallions . For example , the medallions of the Darjah Utama Temasek and the Sijil <unk> use the full achievement of arms , while the Darjah Utama Bakti <unk> medal displays the shield . 
 = = Guidelines = = 
 According to the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules , the use of the coat of arms is restricted to the government . Without explicit permission from the Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts ( MICA ) , no person or group is permitted to physically print , manufacture , display or sell anything depicting the coat of arms , or to allow such actions to happen . It is also forbidden to use any symbol that can be easily mistaken for the coat of arms . Persons who wish to use the coat of arms in a literary work must also obtain prior permission from MICA . The only exception provided by the Rules is that the arms can be used by government officials and ministries on their building 's exteriors and on printed documents .

He was placed on the black list of Kuomintang and was not allowed to return to Taiwan until 1990 . 
 When Hsu returned to Taiwan , he joined the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) . Having been elected legislator three times , Hsu is considered a privy councilor to the DPP in the field of economics . He was nominated to run for the mayor of Tainan and was elected in 2001 . During his terms as mayor , Hsu worked on public projects and encouraged tourism . For example , a police unit was established to facilitate tourists in 2007 , and he also improved the environment of the city . 
 In 2009 , Hsu worked with the Tainan County government to push for a merger that would form a special municipality . The merger was set to take effect in December 2010 , giving Hsu one additional year in his mayoral term . During the DPP primary election for the nomination of a new Tainan mayor in May , he lost to William Lai by 12 % of the <unk> Lai elected mayor , Hsu later run for Lai 's seat as member of Legislative Yuan and finally elected .

He then attended the Cheng Kung Senior High School . In 1976 , Hsu got his Master of Economics degree from the Chinese Culture University and started teaching banking the next year at the same school . 
 In 1982 , Hsu went to the United States as a Columbia University exchange scholar . In the same year , he joined the World United Formosans for Independence , and he also served as the literary editor for the Taiwan Tribune . As a result , he was placed on the Kuomintang 's black list and was unable to return to Taiwan . He then earned his PhD candidacy from New School for Social Research .
