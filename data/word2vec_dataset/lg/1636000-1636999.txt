 Compared with other BBC series broadcast in the 1960s , Doctor Who is well @-@ represented in surviving episodes . Of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s , 156 still exist – mainly due to copies produced for overseas sales . For example , Seasons 1 and 2 , the most widely @-@ sold abroad of the 1960s era , are missing only 9 and 2 episodes , respectively . By contrast , the less well @-@ sold Seasons 4 and 5 respectively have no , and only 2 , complete serials ( The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World ) . Doctor Who 's popularity and high profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes which , for other less well @-@ remembered programmes , might never have occurred . 
 Of all ongoing BBC series from the 1960s , only Steptoe and Son has a better survival record , with all episodes existing in some form . Other long @-@ running programmes have few or no surviving episodes ; for example , the soap operas Compact ( 6 out of 43 episodes surviving ) , The Newcomers ( 2 out of 375 ) , and United ! ( 0 out of 147 ) . 
 Doctor Who is also comparatively rare amongst contemporaries in that all of its 1970s episodes exist as masters or telerecordings , while other series such as Z @-@ Cars and Dixon of Dock Green are missing episodes from as late as 1975 . 
 = = List of missing episodes = = 
 As of October 2013 , 97 episodes are unaccounted for . The missing episodes span 26 serials , including 10 full serials . Most of the gaps are from seasons 3 , 4 , and 5 , which currently lack a total of 79 episodes across 21 ( out of 26 ) serials . By contrast , seasons 1 , 2 , and 6 are missing a total of just 18 episodes , across 5 ( out of 25 ) serials . Of the missing stories , all but three – Marco Polo , " Mission to the Unknown " , and The Massacre of St Bartholomew 's Eve – have surviving clips . All episodes also have full surviving audio tracks . 
 While the Patrick Troughton era is missing more episodes ( 53 as compared to 44 for William Hartnell ) , there are more Hartnell stories completely missing ( 6 as compared to 4 ) . Serials highlighted in red are missing all episodes . Serials highlighted in yellow are missing more than half of their episodes . All others listed are missing at least one , but no more than half , of their episodes . 
 = = = Orphaned episodes = = = 
 Serials that are over 50 % complete ( e.g. , The Reign of Terror , The Tenth Planet ) are issued as standalone releases , with the missing episodes bridged using animation , visual reconstructions , or narration to the camera . Surviving episodes which form 50 % or less of a complete story – referred to as " orphaned " episodes – have been released by the BBC in compilations ( e.g. , Lost in Time ) , or as extras on releases of complete serials . A few four @-@ episode serials of which 50 % remain ( e.g. , The Underwater Menace , The Moonbase ) have also been issued as standalone releases . 
 = = = Unaired missing episodes = = = 
 In addition to the official list of missing episodes , also missing is the original Episode 1 of The Daleks . At some point after the recording , it was discovered that a technical problem had caused backstage voices to be heard on the resulting videotape ; in early December 1963 , the episode was remounted with a different costume for Susan . The only surviving portion is the reprise at the beginning of Episode 2 . 
 Planet of Giants is another odd example , having originally been recorded as four episodes , with the first three directed by Mervyn Pinfield , and the last one by Douglas Camfield . To create a faster @-@ paced climax , Episodes 3 & 4 were combined and reduced to form a single episode , which was credited to Camfield only . This decision , made by then @-@ Head of Drama Sydney Newman , resulted in a one @-@ episode gap at the end of the second production block ( leading to the creation of " Mission to the Unknown " ) ; the unused portions of Episodes 3 and 4 are believed to have been destroyed . 
 The serial 's 2012 DVD release features a reconstruction of the original episodes , directed by Ian Levine . The production rebuilds the deleted scenes using CGI , footage from elsewhere in the serial , and re @-@ recorded dialogue from Carole Ann Ford , William Russell , and actors impersonating the rest of the cast . 
 = = Recovery = = 
 When the BBC 's complete holdings ( both the BBC Film & Videotape Library and BBC Enterprises ) were first audited in 1978 , the following 50 episodes were absent from their collective archives , but have subsequently been returned to the Corporation through various methods . The nine stories highlighted have all episodes existing as a result . Except where indicated , all episodes were returned as 16 mm telerecording negatives or prints . 
 = = = = BBC holdings = = = = 
 = = = = = Film Library oddities = = = = = 
 When the BBC audited its Film Library in 1977 , 47 episodes were found to exist . These Film Library copies were a random sampling of viewing prints for various episodes , along with seven of the nine episodes that had originally been telerecorded onto film for editing and / or transmission , rather than recorded to videotape . These film @-@ originated masters were stored in the Film Library , rather than in the Engineering Department with the videotapes . The presence of the viewing prints is less easily explained . 
 The Film Library 's remit covers material originated on film , not on videotape – yet it lacked two of the film @-@ originated episodes of Doctor Who , while it held such unexplained material as 16 mm copies of The Tenth Planet Episodes 1 – 3 , presumably viewing prints which were mistakenly returned to them at some point instead of BBC Enterprises . Most surprisingly of all , they also retained a 16 mm telerecording copy of the original <unk> pilot , presumably a viewing print made in 1963 and subsequently lodged at the Library . 
 The Film Library also held high @-@ quality original film sequences made for insertion into videotaped episodes . Some of these , such as those from Episodes 1 – 2 of The Daleks ' Master Plan , survive to this day . Other junked sequences were mistakenly entered into a film library computer system , leading to an impression that they had existed for years afterward , and inaccurate speculation that the BBC was still destroying clips well into the early 1980s . 
 = = = = = Engineering Department = = = = = 
 Following the establishment of the Film and Videotape Library , an audit of the Engineering Department found 60 of the 128 Third Doctor episodes starring Jon Pertwee , which in addition to the Film Library 's copies of the film @-@ originated Spearhead from Space , brought that Doctor 's episode count up to 64 out of 128 . 
 = = = = = Villiers House = = = = = 
 In 1978 , Ian Levine located another 65 episodes from the show 's first six seasons ( plus fourteen previously existing episodes ) , at the BBC Enterprises film vault at Villiers House in London . The episodes comprise 17 full serials , mostly from seasons 1 and 2 . According to Levine , many of the prints were flagged to be junked that very day . 
 Levine alerted the new Film and Videotape Library 's archive selector , Sue Malden , who paid her own visit to Villiers House and found every remaining Jon Pertwee episode ( albeit as a 16 mm black @-@ and @-@ white telerecording ) , except for two from his final season : Death to the Daleks and Invasion of the Dinosaurs , Episodes 1 . 
 In August 1988 , ten years after Levine 's and Malden 's visits , Episodes 1 and 4 – 6 of the six @-@ part story The Ice Warriors , were discovered in a cupboard at Villiers House when the Corporation was in the process of moving out of the building . 
 = = = = National Film and Television Archive = = = = 
 Shortly after the junking process was halted and the BBC established its Film and Videotape Library for the purpose of storage and preservation , archive selector Sue Malden began to audit what material remained in the BBC 's stores . When investigations revealed large gaps in the collection , Malden turned her inquiries to the National Film and Television Archive – which promptly returned three full Second Doctor serials – The Dominators , The Krotons , and The War Games , adding seven more episodes and completing two of those serials . These all were standard 16 mm film telerecordings with the exception of The Dominators Episode 3 , which was a 35 mm print . 
 Episodes 4 and 5 of The Dominators originated from a foreign broadcaster , and had been slightly edited ; the missing footage was restored later , through a mix of censor clips and more complete prints held by private collectors . 
 = = = = Overseas broadcasters that purchased missing episodes = = = = 
 An appeal to broadcasters in other countries who had shown the programme ( notably Australia and African nations such as Nigeria ) produced " lost " episodes from the archives of their television companies . The Tomb of the Cybermen , for example , was recovered in this manner from Rediffusion Television in Hong Kong in 1992 . Of the 50 episodes recovered since the original BBC audit of its holdings , 25 have been returned from overseas broadcasters : 
 Note that on occasion some broadcasters purchased Doctor Who telerecordings ( usually 16 mm ) but subsequently cancelled the order . 
 Nigerian television has been a particularly fruitful source for episode recovery ; a total of 15 out of the 50 episodes recovered since 1978 have been reclaimed from Nigeria , leading to the completion of three full serials ( The Time <unk> , The War Machines , and The Enemy of the World ) .

 Several episodes have been returned by private film collectors , who at some point acquired 16 mm film prints intended for sale to foreign broadcasters .

 Roger Stevens was working for the BBC as a film editor in the 1980s , and one morning , as he was travelling to work by train , he bumped into a BBC co @-@ worker and they began to talk about Doctor Who episodes . The BBC projectionist mentioned that he had nine episodes of Doctor Who that Stevens could buy for £ 25 . In the summer of 1981 , Stevens bought The Space Museum episode one , The Abominable Snowmen episode two , The Moonbase episode four , Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one , and three episodes of Carnival of Monsters . Stevens then contacted Ian Levine to find out what was missing from the BBC archive ; Levine confirmed that The Abominable Snowmen episode two and Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one were currently missing . 
 Stevens gave these prints to Levine , who returned The Abominable Snowmen to the BBC in February 1982 , although he held back Invasion of the Dinosaurs from the BBC for a while . This was later returned to the BBC by Levine in June 1983 , who then made a copy and returned the original to Levine .

 The Reign of Terror was recovered by Bruce Campbell when he attended a film fair in the 1980s and began chatting to a stall holder who informed him that one of his regular customers had in their possession The Reign of Terror episode six . Campbell got in contact with the customer , bought the missing episode for £ 50 , and then , in May 1982 , donated it to the BBC through Ian Levine .

 The Doctor Who Magazine ( April 1984 , issue 87 ) ran a story about a rumour of a missing Doctor Who episode that was in Portsmouth ; this led to The Wheel in Space episode three being returned to the BBC in April 1984 by David Stead to allow for a copy to be made . The original was returned to Stead and released on VHS in 1992 with poor results . Later the print was borrowed again and a new copy made using D3 videotape . Stead recollects that he purchased the episode for £ 15 . 
 = = = = = The Faceless Ones and The Evil of the Daleks = = = = = 
 In 1982 , novice film collector Gordon Hendry purchased 16 mm copies of The Faceless Ones , episode 3 , and The Evil of the Daleks , episode 2 , from a film fair in Buckingham . At that time Hendry was unaware of the episodes ' value ( only one episode of The Faceless Ones and none of The Evil of the Daleks were known to exist ) . 
 In 1985 , a cinema owner in Brighton persuaded Hendry to lend him the films , so as to screen the episodes for profit during Panopticon VI . <unk> Marham , an associate of Hendry 's , visited Panopticon to generate interest in the showing , only to be dismissed as a <unk> . 
 After the event , Paul Vanezis spent 15 months attempting to retrieve the episodes from Marham . Eventually in 1987 , a charity fundraising convention called <unk> aired The Faceless Ones , episode 3 , in tribute to the recently deceased Patrick Troughton . 
 In the following weeks , Vanezis and Ian Levine negotiated the return of both episodes to the BBC archive . 
 = = = = = The Crusade = = = = = 
 Although the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation received copies of The Crusade , it never broadcast the story due to a prohibitive rating from the censor board . After rejecting the serial , <unk> never returned its film prints to the BBC or actively destroyed them . 
 In 1998 collector Bruce Grenville purchased a 16 mm copy of The Crusade episode 1 from a stall at a New Zealand film fair , containing various material previously rescued from a rubbish tip . Through a series of chance meetings , the episode eventually was returned to the BBC in January 1999 .

 In 1975 , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation returned all eight broadcast prints of Galaxy 4 and The Underwater Menace to the BBC to be disposed of . In the mid @-@ 1980s , former ITV engineer Terry Burnett purchased episode 3 of Galaxy 4 and episode 2 of The Underwater Menace from another collector , unaware of their value ( the only extant episode of the former serial , and one of just two from the latter ) . In December 2011 , after a chance encounter with Doctor Who Restoration Team member Ralph Montagu , Burnett returned the episodes to the BBC .

 The Daleks ' Master Plan never was sold abroad ; only Australia requested viewing copies ( excepting Episode 7 , " The Feast of Steven " ) , and eventually declined to purchase the serial . The fate of these viewing prints is currently unknown . 
 Nevertheless , three out of the serial 's twelve episodes have been recovered . 16 mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were returned in the early 1980s , under unclear circumstances ( with rumour claiming they were found in the basement of a Mormon church ) . Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson . He had come across the film in the 1970s , while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC 's Ealing Studios . Instead of disposing of the film as instructed , he brought it home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material . 
 = = = = = The Enemy of the World and The Web of Fear = = = = = 
 Following months of rumours , in October 2013 a BBC press conference announced the return of a total of 11 episodes ( two previously existing ) from a television relay station in the city of Jos , Nigeria . In the course of his work abroad , Philip Morris of Television International Enterprises Archives had discovered episodes 1 @-@ 6 of The Enemy of the World and episodes 1 @,@ 2 @,@ 4 @,@ 5 @,@ 6 of The Web of Fear . The return of the nine missing episodes was the single largest recovery of Doctor Who episodes in 25 years , resulting in only the second full serial from Troughton 's first two seasons to be restored to the BBC . 
 Both serials were promptly released on iTunes , with DVD releases following over the next few months . Both on the iTunes and the DVD release , episode 3 of The Web of Fear was represented by a tele @-@ snap reconstruction , edited by John Kelly . Later , in September 2015 , Morris revealed that episode 3 had been part of the same find , but that by the end of protracted negotiations for the return of the film cans , the episode had disappeared from the cache ; he presumes it was sold to a private collector .

 Of the 50 recovered episodes , several are missing short segments – due either to overseas censorship or to damage to the surviving film print . The following table shows all affected episodes , and the total duration of missing material . 
 = = = Clips = = = 
 Of the 97 missing episodes , 36 are represented by short " orphan " clips , recovered from various sources . These clips span 17 of the 26 serials affected by missing episodes , 7 of which are otherwise completely missing . The only serials lacking any footage whatsoever are Marco Polo , " Mission to the Unknown " , and The Massacre of St Bartholomew 's Eve . The following table shows all recovered excerpts , together with which pertinent episodes , format of the clips , and the source of recovery . Otherwise missing serials are highlighted in red . 
 = = = = = <unk> clips = = = = = 
 Some overseas viewing prints were physically edited for content by local censor boards , prior to transmission . Hence , episodes recovered from these sources ( Australia , New Zealand ) are missing these segments . 
 Later discoveries turned up a large number of excised clips , held by interested parties as proof of the edits . In October 1996 , Australian Doctor Who fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in the records of the National Archives of Australia , provided as evidence by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board ( now the Classification Board ) . These clips include The Smugglers , episodes 1 , 3 @-@ 4 ; The Highlanders , episode 1 ; The Underwater Menace , episodes 2 , 4 ; The Macra Terror , episode 3 ; Fury From The Deep , episodes 2 , 4 @-@ 5 ; and The Wheel In Space , episode 4 . 
 The clips from The Underwater Menace , episode 2 were later found to precisely match the edits to the print discovered in late 2011 , suggesting that the recovered episode was exactly the same print that had been censored decades before . 
 In an interview for the fanzine The Disused Yeti , Shanahan stated that although he and Parry had found paper records relating to the censoring of early to mid William Hartnell stories , the excised portions for all stories from An Unearthly Child to The Gunfighters had been destroyed some time prior to Shanahan and Parry 's investigation . 
 In 2002 , New Zealand fan Graham Howard uncovered excised clips from The Web of Fear and The Wheel in Space , episode 5 .

 A fan in Australia has returned small excerpts of off @-@ screen footage , recorded from repeat showings using an 8mm cine film camera .

 = = = = = From other Doctor Who episodes = = = = = 
 Due to the show 's habit of repeating cliffhanger footage , sometimes missing episode material can be found in surviving neighbor episodes . Episode 2 of The Daleks uses a <unk> reprise from the original recording of Episode 1 , which later had to be remounted ; the original version of Episode 1 is presumed to have been destroyed . 
 A brief clip from Episode 4 of The Crusade exists at the very start of The Space Museum . Episode 1 of the latter serial begins with the characters in period costume , briefly frozen in place . An off @-@ camera cough heard on both soundtracks shows that the clip was a filmed insert from the previous ( and currently missing ) episode . 
 In its lead @-@ in to an upcoming repeat , The Wheel in Space episode 6 contains a short three @-@ frame clip from The Evil of the Daleks episode 1 , alongside a reprise from the existing episode 2 of that serial . 
 Other episodes contain straight excerpts from earlier serials , such as episode 10 of The War Games , which employs model shots from the first episodes of Fury from the Deep and The Wheel in Space . 
 = = = = = From other television programmes = = = = = 
 Clips from some missing episodes also survive due to their use in other surviving programmes . For example , excerpts from Episode 4 of The Daleks ' Master Plan were used in a 1973 edition of Blue Peter , and scenes from The Power of the Daleks in an Australian programme called Perspective : C for Computer . 
 In 2005 , two further short clips from The Power of the Daleks – along with a higher @-@ quality version of one of the extant scenes – were discovered in a 1966 episode of the BBC science series Tomorrow 's World . The clips , lasting less than 10 seconds each and on film ( as opposed to film recordings ) , came to light when the Tomorrow 's World segment was broadcast as part of the 11 September 2005 edition of the clip @-@ based nostalgia show Sunday Past Times on BBC Two . After being alerted to the footage , Paul Vanezis of the Doctor Who Restoration Team tracked down the uncut version of the clip . 
 The 1977 documentary Whose Doctor Who indirectly led to a lengthy excerpt from " Four Hundred Dawns , " episode 1 of the 1965 serial Galaxy 4 . The film 's producers used an excerpt from a viewing print of the episode , which they further cut down in the editing . Rather than discard the unused portion , the film 's advisor Jan Vincent @-@ Rudzki asked to keep the film trims . Later in the 1990s , Vincent @-@ Rudzki returned the clip to the archives . At a total of 5m 53s , this clip is the longest piece of surviving footage from an otherwise missing episode , accounting for a quarter of the total running time . 
 Apart from actual episode footage , rare behind @-@ the @-@ scenes material also was discovered for The Smugglers , The Evil of the Daleks , The Abominable Snowmen , and Fury from the Deep . Also from the latter serial exists some raw footage from the filming of Episode 6 , featuring some alternate camera angles from what was eventually broadcast . 
 = = = Audio soundtracks = = = 
 Though numerous episodes are still missing , full @-@ length audio soundtracks for all missing episodes are held by the BBC . These come from off @-@ air recordings made by fans , often made by use of a microphone attached to a tape recorder placed close to the television set . While the quality of these off @-@ air recordings varies greatly , multiple fan recordings exist for every episode . 
 Starting in the early 1990s , the BBC began to release existing audio of serials with missing episodes , with linking narration provided by former series actors such as Jon Pertwee , Tom Baker , Colin Baker , Peter Purves , and Frazer Hines . By December 2005 , the soundtracks for all of the missing episodes had been released , albeit with copyright @-@ uncleared music replacements where necessary ( e.g. , a Beatles song in Evil of the Daleks ) , slightly <unk> sequences for reasons of clarity , and with overdubbed narration . 
 Between 2010 – 12 BBC Audiobooks collected the individual narrated soundtracks in a series of five CD box sets , entitled " Doctor Who : The Lost TV Episodes . " For the sets , some serials ( such as The Evil of the Daleks ) were re @-@ released with improved audio restoration , changed linking narration , and in some instances with scenes unavailable in the first release . In addition to the soundtracks , the sets include special features such as the Archive on 4 documentary , " Doctor Who - The Lost Episodes " and high @-@ quality scans of the original camera scripts in PDF format . 
 For more information , see List of Doctor Who audio releases . 
 = = Restoration = = 
 For the first eleven seasons of Doctor Who , often the surviving materials are in a very different format or condition from their original broadcast masters . Surviving 1960s material is recorded on film stock of varying quality , while early 1970s material is available in a patchwork of professional and consumer formats . To present the material in a form approximating its original broadcast masters requires extensive technical work , and a certain amount of invention . 
 = = = Motion restoration = = = 
 In its original form , the videotape used to record Doctor Who captures images at 50 interlaced fields per second , resulting in a smooth , " live " feel to motion . To transfer the episodes to film , the film camera is timed to combine two video fields in each frame , converting 50 fields to 25 frames per second ; on playback , the omission of in @-@ between images results in a choppier " film " style motion . To recreate the original " live " video feel , early telerecorded episodes are processed through a digital tool known as <unk> , which approximates the missing motion between film frames . 
 In addition to the telerecorded material , some early 1970s material survives only , or in color only , on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission ( e.g. , TV Ontario and <unk> in Vancouver ) . NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video , and has a different number of scanlines . The conversion process used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards , resulting in a noticeable amount of picture and motion loss . Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts , creating a blurry picture and juddering motion . To rectify the problem , in 2005 a new Reverse Standards Conversion process , which attempts to <unk> the original video conversion , was introduced for the DVD release of The Claws of Axos . 
 = = = Colour restoration = = = 
 Several early 1970s colour serials , starring Jon Pertwee , were retained only as black @-@ and @-@ white film prints . In addition to the motion issue shared by all telerecorded episodes , for years the loss of colour presented a major challenge for restoration . 
 Some of the telerecorded Pertwee episodes also survive on NTSC colour videotapes , recorded over @-@ air on consumer hardware . In the early 1990s , an early form of the Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low @-@ resolution colour signal from these sources with the high @-@ resolution black @-@ and @-@ white signal from the black @-@ and @-@ white film recordings . In this way , several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour : Doctor Who and the Silurians , Terror of the Autons , and The Dæmons . Off @-@ air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death , but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration . 
 = = = = Colour recovery = = = = 
 In 2007 , BBC archive specialist James <unk> established the Colour Recovery Working Group , an online project to find new ways of restoring black @-@ and @-@ white telerecordings to colour . In 2008 , Reverse Standards Conversion inventor Richard Russell , developed a technique involving the use of chroma dots embedded in the black @-@ and @-@ white signal to recreate the missing color . The technique was pioneered , enhanced by traditional computer colourisation , on episode 3 of Planet of the Daleks . 
 Subsequently , chroma dots were used to restore the colour to Episodes 2 – 4 , 6 , and 7 of The Ambassadors of Death and episodes 2 – 5 of The Mind of Evil . Episode 1 of Invasion of the Dinosaurs presented a unique challenge , in that the chroma dots only contained red and green colour information , requiring that blue be added manually . Given the rough result , the DVD includes both the reconstructed colour and the black @-@ and @-@ white version . 
 Unfortunately , episode 1 of The Mind of Evil contains no colour information . In principle , BBC engineers were supposed to filter out the chroma dots upon telerecording , to create a cleaner picture . In most cases they failed to do so , allowing the colour recovery process to work . For this one episode , the filter had been correctly applied – so there was no colour to recover . To complete the serial for DVD , the episode was manually colourised by Stuart <unk> and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation . 
 = = = Reconstruction = = = 
 In addition to short video clips and audio soundtracks , for many episodes off @-@ screen photographs − known as " tele @-@ snaps " − exist , taken by photographer John Cura . From the 1940s to the 1960s , Cura was hired by various interested parties to document the transmission of many popular TV programmes , including Doctor Who . Typically the photographs were used for promotion , or as keepsakes for cast and crew in the days before home video recorders . In many cases , they form the only remaining visual record of missing television programmes . 
 Since the late 1990s , fan groups such as Loose Cannon Productions have reconstructed the missing episodes , using original camera scripts to match Cura 's tele @-@ snaps and other visual material to the surviving audio tracks . Although technically infringing copyright , these " <unk> " generally have been tolerated by the BBC , provided they are not sold for profit . 
 " Official " high @-@ quality <unk> have also been used on commercial releases , including cut @-@ down reconstructions – The Ice Warriors VHS ( a 12 @-@ minute " highlights " reconstruction bridging the missing Episodes 2 and 3 ) ; and Marco Polo ( a 30 @-@ minute reconstruction on The Beginning DVD box set ) – and full @-@ length presentations , including The Tenth Planet VHS ( containing a full reconstruction of the missing Episode 4 ) ; Galaxy 4 ( a reconstruction of the three missing episodes to accompany the recently recovered episode 3 , " Air Lock , " presented on The Aztecs Special Edition DVD ) ; The Web of Fear digital and DVD releases ( containing a reconstruction of Episode 3 , alongside the rest of the newly rediscovered serial ) . 
 In June 2005 , BBC Audio released a reconstruction of The Power of the Daleks as part of their " MP3 CD " line . When played on a home PC , the disc contained the same audio content as the previous audio CD release , synchronized with a Macromedia Flash slideshow of tele @-@ snaps and publicity photographs . For technical reasons , the surviving clips could not be included . Due to poor sales , future planned releases in this format were abandoned . 
 = = = = Animated episodes = = = = 
 In several cases , to " complete " serials with only one or two missing episodes , producers of the Doctor Who DVD range have commissioned original black @-@ and @-@ white animation , synced to the programme 's original audio tracks . 
 The first such effort , Cosgrove Hall 's animation of The Invasion episodes 1 and 4 , was released to DVD alongside the surviving episodes in November 2006 . The animation had been paid for by an earlier surplus in the Doctor Who website budget , allowing it to be used in the DVD release as a test for the concept , at no extra cost . Despite the DVD 's success , the sales were not high enough to offset the animation cost for any future collaboration . Eventually other animation studios were commissioned to continue the reconstruction . In June 2011 , 2 Entertain announced that the missing episodes 4 and 5 of The Reign of Terror would be animated by Planet 55 Studios , using the " <unk> " process . The serial was released on DVD in January 2013 . Planet 55 would later go on to animate Episode 4 of The Tenth Planet ( November 2013 ) , and episodes 1 and 3 of The Moonbase ( January 2014 ) . 
 In August 2013 , BBC Worldwide announced that episodes 2 and 3 of The Ice Warriors would be animated by <unk> Entertainment for a DVD release later that month . 
 In December 2013 , 2 Entertain commissioning editor Dan Hall mentioned that Planet 55 had again been commissioned to complete The Underwater Menace , for what he hoped would be an early 2014 release . However , in September 2015 Doctor Who Magazine confirmed that the much @-@ delayed DVD , now scheduled for October 26 , was instead to contain tele @-@ snap reconstructions of the missing episodes 1 and 4 . 
 = = = = = Unreleased and unofficial animations = = = = = 
 In 2008 , after future collaboration with Cosgrove Hall had been rejected due to expense , 2 Entertain was approached by David Busch of US animation studio Titmouse , Inc . , who offered to do the work more cheaply as a result of the favourable exchange rate between the UK and the US , and put together a test trailer of scenes animated from various missing serials , including The Power of the Daleks , The Moonbase , The Macra Terror , The Web of Fear , and Fury from the Deep . While 2 Entertain decided not to commission anything from Titmouse , the trailer was eventually seen by Ian Levine , who offered to try and raise the money for a full episode reconstruction to serve as a prototype . The episode chosen was " Mission to the Unknown " , as it was a self @-@ contained episode featuring the Daleks with a limited number of characters and sets , thus keeping the budget down . Although completed , the animated version of " Mission to the Unknown " has never been officially released , although it has been posted on various video streaming sites . 
 With the advent of ever @-@ more @-@ powerful home computers and more specialist programs for them , many fans are also working on unofficial animations of the missing episodes , and this is widespread with many clips being shown on @-@ line . 
 = = = = Narrated links = = = = 
 In some cases missing episodes are bridged by narration to the camera – often by a surviving actor from the serial , occasionally in @-@ character . For their VHS releases , The Reign of Terror and The Crusade were presented by actors Carole Ann Ford and William Russell – while Episodes 1 and 4 of The Invasion were bridged by Nicholas Courtney . 
 Although not strictly a missing serial , production of the 1979 Tom Baker story Shada was curtailed by a technician 's strike partway through recording . To prevent the half @-@ finished material from being junked , incoming Doctor Who producer John Nathan @-@ Turner placed a preservation order on it with an intention to later finish the production . Although repeated attempts to remount the serial failed , a clip from Episode 1 was later used in the 1983 story The Five Doctors after Tom Baker declined to reprise his role . 
 Eventually in 1992 , the surviving material was released on home video , accompanied by in @-@ camera narration by Tom Baker to bridge the unrecorded content . In later years , Shada was reinterpreted in several forms including an audio play featuring Eighth Doctor Paul McGann ( also presented on the Web , accompanied by basic Flash animation ) and a novelization by Gareth Roberts .

 Although the BBC has invested in the reconstruction of episodes using animation , it has never attempted to do anything in the way of complete re @-@ staging of missing episodes ; the closest that it has come to this was the recreation of parts of various serials , including the completely missing Marco Polo , in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013 . However , in 2012 a reimagined version of The Power of the Daleks , written by , directed by , and starring Nick Scovell , was released on YouTube in three parts prior to being shown in its entirety at the Power : <unk> convention in September 2012 .

 = Battle of Tabu @-@ dong = 
 The Battle of Tabu @-@ dong was an engagement between United Nations ( UN ) and North Korean ( NK ) forces early in the Korean War from September 1 to September 18 , 1950 , in the vicinity of Tabu @-@ dong , north of Taegu in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack . 
 Holding positions north of the crucial city of Taegu , the US Army 's 1st Cavalry Division stood at the center of the Pusan Perimeter defensive line , tasked with keeping the United Nations Command headquarters secured from attacks from the North Korean People 's Army . On September 1 , the NK 3rd Division attacked as part of the Great Naktong Offensive . 
 What followed was a two @-@ week battle around Tabu @-@ dong and Waegwan in which the North Koreans were able to gradually push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines . However , the North Koreans were not able to force the US troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu . When the UN counterattacked at Inchon , the North Koreans were forced to abandon their attack on Tabu @-@ dong . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Pusan Perimeter = = = 
 From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . 
 When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the NK 6th Division , and later the NK 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan , initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam @-@ ni and Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of Masan , the NK 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area . In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the NK 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In the Taegu region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu . Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the NK 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P 'ohang @-@ dong during the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong . All along the front , the North Korean troops were reeling from these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were not working . 
 = = = September push = = = 
 In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible due to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu . 
 On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ prong attack against the UN lines . These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back . Five battle groupings were ordered . The center attack called for the NK 3rd Division , NK 13th Division , and NK 1st Division break through the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Division to Taegu . 
 = = Battle = = 
 While four divisions of the NK II Corps attacked south in the P 'ohang @-@ dong , Kyongju , and Yongch 'on area , the remaining three divisions of the corps @-@ the 3rd , 13th , and 1st conducted their converging attack on Taegu from the north and northwest . The NK 3rd Division was to attack in the Waegwan area northwest of Taegu , the NK 13th Division down the mountain ridges north of Taegu along and west of the Sangju @-@ Taegu road , and the NK 1st Division along the high mountain ridges just east of the road . 
 Defending Taegu , the US 1st Cavalry Division had a front of about 35 miles ( 56 km ) . Division Commander Major General Hobart R. Gay <unk> the main avenues of entry into his zone and kept his three regiments concentrated behind the outposts . At the southwestern end of his line Gay initially controlled the US 3rd Battalion , 23rd Infantry Regiment , 2nd Infantry Division , which had been attached to the 1st Cavalry Division . On September 5 the British 27th Commonwealth Brigade , in its first commitment in the Korean War , replaced that battalion . Next in line northward , the US 5th Cavalry Regiment defended the sector along the Naktong around Waegwan and the main Seoul highway southeast from there to Taegu . Eastward , the US 7th Cavalry Regiment was responsible for the mountainous area between that highway and the hills bordering the Sangju road . The US 8th Cavalry Regiment , responsible for the latter road , was astride it and on the bordering hills . 
 = = = Hill 518 = = = 
 Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to attack north on September 1 in an effort to divert some of the North Korean strength from the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions in the south . Gay 's initial decision upon receipt of this order was to attack north up the Sangju road , but his staff and regimental commanders all joined in urging that the attack instead be against Hill 518 in the US 7th Cavalry zone . Only two days before , Hill 518 had been in the ROK 1st Division zone and had been considered a North Korean assembly point . The US 1st Cavalry Division , accordingly , prepared for an attack in the 7th Cavalry sector and for diversionary attacks by two companies of the 3rd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , on the 7th Cavalry 's right flank . This left the 8th Cavalry only one infantry company in reserve . The regiment 's 1st Battalion was on the hill mass to the west of the Bowling Alley and north of Tabu @-@ dong ; its 2nd Battalion was astride the road . 
 This planned attack against Hill 518 coincided with the defection of NK Major Kim Song Jun of the NK 19th Regiment , NK 13th Division . He reported that a full @-@ scale North Korean attack was to begin at dusk that day . The NK 13th Division , he said , had just taken in 4 @,@ 000 replacements , 2 @,@ 000 of them without weapons , and was now back to a strength of approximately 9 @,@ 000 men . Upon receiving this intelligence , Gay alerted all front @-@ line units to be prepared for the attack . 
 <unk> with Eighth Army 's order for a spoiling attack against the North Koreans northwest of Taegu , Gay ordered the 7th Cavalry to attack on September 2 and seize Hill 518 . Hill 518 , also called <unk> @-@ san , is a large mountain mass 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northeast of Waegwan and 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of the Naktong River . It curves westward from its peak to its westernmost height , Hill 346 , from which the ground drops abruptly to the Naktong River . Situated north of the lateral Waegwan @-@ Tabu – dong road , and about midway between the two towns , it was a critical terrain feature dominating the road between the two places . After securing Hill 518 , the 7th Cavalry attack was to continue on to Hill 314 . Air strikes and artillery preparations were to precede the infantry attack . 
 On the morning of September 2 the US Air Force delivered a 37 @-@ minute strike against Hills 518 and 346 . The artillery then laid down its concentrations on the hills , and after that the planes came over again with napalm , leaving the heights on fire . Just after 10 : 00 , and immediately after the final napalm strike , the 1st Battalion , US 7th Cavalry , attacked up Hill 518 . The heavy air strikes and the artillery preparations had failed to dislodge the North Koreans . From their positions they delivered mortar and machine gun fire on the climbing infantry , stopping the weak , advanced US force short of the crest . In the afternoon the US battalion withdrew from Hill 518 and attacked northeast against Hill 490 , from which other North Korean troops had fired in support of the North Koreans on Hill 518 . 
 The next day at 12 : 00 , the newly arrived 3rd Battalion resumed the attack against Hill 518 from the south , as did the 1st Battalion the day before , in a column of companies that resolved itself in the end into a column of squads . Again the attack failed . Other attacks failed on September 4 . A North Korean forward observer captured on Hill 518 said that 1 @,@ 200 North Koreans were dug in on the hill and that they had large numbers of mortars and ammunition to hold out . 
 = = = North Korean flanking moves = = = 
 While these attacks were in progress on its right , the 2nd Battalion , 5th Cavalry Regiment , on September 4 attacked and captured Hill 303 . The next day it had difficulty in holding the hill against counterattacks . By September 4 it had become clear that the NK 3rd Division in front of the 5th and 7th Cavalry Regiments was also attacking , and despite continued air strikes , artillery preparations , and infantry efforts on Hill 518 , it was infiltrating large numbers of its troops to the rear of the attacking United States forces . That night large North Korean forces came through the gap between the 3rd Battalion on the southern slope of Hill 518 and the 2nd Battalion westward . The North Koreans turned west and occupied Hill 464 in force . By September 5 , Hill 464 to the rear of the US 7th Cavalry had more North Koreans on it than Hill 518 to its front . North Koreans cut the Waegwan to Tabu @-@ dong road east of the regiment so that its communications with other US units now were only to the west . During the day the 7th Cavalry made a limited withdrawal on Hill 518 , giving up on capturing the hill . 
 On the division right , Tabu @-@ dong was in North Korean hands , on the left Waegwan was a no @-@ man 's land , and in the center strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518 . The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan @-@ Tabu @-@ dong lateral supply road behind it , and was in danger of being surrounded . After discussing a withdrawal plan with Walker , Gay on September 5 issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position . The movement was to progress from right to left beginning with the 8th Cavalry Regiment , then the 7th Cavalry in the Hill 518 area , and finally the 5th Cavalry in the Waegwan area . This withdrawal caused the 3rd Battalion , 8th Cavalry , to give up a hill it had just attacked and captured near the Tabu @-@ dong road on the approaches of the Walled City of Ka @-@ san . In the 7th Cavalry sector the 1st , 3rd , and 2nd Battalions were to withdraw in that order , after the withdrawal of the 1st Battalion , 8th Cavalry , on their right . The 2d Battalion , 5th Cavalry , on Hill 303 north of Waegwan was to cover the withdrawal of the 7th Cavalry and hold open the escape road . 
 = = = Further US withdrawal = = = 
 In his withdrawal instructions for the 7th Cavalry , Colonel Cecil Nist , the regimental commander , ordered the 2nd Battalion to disengage from the North Koreans to its front and attack to its rear to gain possession of Hills 464 and 380 on the new main line of resistance to be occupied by the regiment . Efforts to gain possession of Hill 464 by other elements had failed in the past several days . 
 Heavy rains fell during the night of September 5 @-@ 6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked vehicles in the withdrawal . The 1st Battalion completed its withdrawal without opposition . During its night march west , the 3rd Battalion column was joined several times by groups of North Korean soldiers who apparently thought it was one of their own columns moving south . They were made prisoners and taken along in the withdrawal . Nearing Waegwan at dawn , the battalion column was taken under North Korean mortar and T @-@ 34 tank fire after daybreak and sustained 18 casualties . 
 The 2nd Battalion disengaged from the North Korean and began its withdrawal at 03 : 00 , September 6 . The battalion abandoned two of its own tanks , one because of mechanical failure and the other because it was stuck in the mud . The battalion moved to the rear in two main groups : G Company to attack Hill 464 and the rest of the battalion to seize Hill 380 , farther south . The North Koreans quickly discovered that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it . The battalion commander , Major Omar T. <unk> , and his operations officer , Captain James T. Milam , were killed . In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by North Koreans . Nist thought that the entire battalion was lost . 
 Moving by itself and completely cut off from all other units , G Company , numbering only about 80 men , was hardest hit . At 08 : 00 , nearing the top of Hill 464 , it surprised and killed three North Korean soldiers . Soon after , North Korean automatic weapons and small arms fire struck the company . All day G Company maneuvered around the hill but never gained its crest . At mid @-@ afternoon it received radio orders to withdraw that night . The company left six dead on the hill and , carrying its wounded on improvised litters of ponchos and tree branches , it started down the shale slopes of the mountain in rain and darkness . Halfway down , friendly fire injured Captain Herman L. West , the G Company commander . The company scattered but West reassembled it . <unk> his men to move quietly and not to fire their weapons , West led his men to the eastern base of Hill 464 where he went into a defensive position for the rest of the night . 
 = = = South flank = = = 
 On the division left , meanwhile , the 2nd Battalion , 5th Cavalry , on Hill 303 came under heavy attack and the battalion commander wanted to withdraw . The regimental commander , told him he could not do so until the 7th Cavalry had cleared on its withdrawal road . This battalion suffered heavy casualties before it abandoned Hill 303 on the September 6 to the North Koreans . 
 While G Company was trying to escape from Hill 464 , the rest of the 2nd Battalion was cut off at the eastern base of Hill 380 , to the south . Nist organized all the South Korean carriers he could find before dark and loaded them with water , food , and ammunition for the 2nd Battalion , but the carrier party was unable to find the battalion . At dawn on September 7 the men in G Company was discovered and attacked by North Korean troops in nearby positions . At this time , West heard what he recognized as fire from American weapons on a knob to his west . There , G Company was reunited with its Weapons Platoon which had become separated from him during the night . 
 The Weapons Platoon , after becoming separated from the rest of the company , encountered North Koreans on the trail it was following three times in the night , but in each instance neither side fired , each going on its way . At dawn , the platoon ambushed a group of North Koreans , killing 13 and capturing three North Koreans . From the body of a North Korean officer the men took a briefcase containing important documents and maps . These showed that Hill 464 was an assembly point for part of the NK 3rd Division in its advance from Hill 518 toward Taegu . 
 Later in the day on September 7 , Captain Melbourne C. Chandler , acting commander of the 2nd Battalion , received word of G Company 's location on Hill 464 from an aerial observer and sent a patrol which guided the company safely to the battalion at the eastern base of Hill 380 . The battalion , meanwhile , had received radio orders to withdraw by any route as soon as possible . It moved southwest into the 5th Cavalry sector . 
 = = = North Korean advance = = = 
 East of the 2nd Battalion , the North Koreans attacked the 1st Battalion in its new position on September 7 and overran the battalion aid station , killing four and wounding seven men . That night the 1st Battalion on division orders was attached to the 5th Cavalry Regiment . The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment moved to a point near Taegu in division reserve . During the night of September 7 @-@ 8 the 5th Cavalry Regiment on division orders withdrew still farther below Waegwan to new defensive positions astride the main Seoul @-@ Taegu highway . The North Korean 3rd Division was still moving reinforcements across the Naktong . Observers sighted barges loaded with troops and artillery pieces crossing the river 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Waegwan on the evening of the 7th . On the 8th the North Korean communiqué claimed the capture of Waegwan . 
 The next day the situation grew worse for the 1st Cavalry Division . On its left flank , the NK 3rd Division forced the 1st Battalion , 5th Cavalry , to withdraw from Hill 345 , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Waegwan . The North Korean pressed forward and the 5th Cavalry was immediately locked in hard , seesaw fighting on Hills 203 and 174 . The 1st Battalion , 7th Cavalry , before it left that sector to rejoin its regiment , finally captured the latter hill after four attacks . 
 Only with difficulty did the 5th Cavalry Regiment hold Hill 203 on September 12 . Between midnight and 04 : 00 on September 13 , the North Koreans attacked again and took Hill 203 from E Company , Hill 174 from L Company , and Hill 188 from B and F Companies . In an afternoon counterattack the regiment regained Hill 188 on the south side of the highway , but failed against Hills 203 and 174 on the north side . On the 14th , I Company again attacked Hill 174 , which had by now changed hands seven times . In this action the company suffered 82 casualties . Even so , the company held only one side of the hill , the North Korean held the other , and grenade battles between the two continued for another week . The battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment were so low in strength at this time that they were not considered combat effective . This seesaw battle continued in full 8 miles ( 13 km ) northwest of Taegu .

 The UN counterattack at Inchon collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes . On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night , and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them . Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea . The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first , the night of September 18 – 19 . After the forces there , the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North . The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the Naktong River positions , which were no longer of strategic importance . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The North Korean 3rd Division was almost completely destroyed in the battles . The division had numbered 7 @,@ 000 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1 . Only 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 800 men from the division were able to retreat back into North Korea by October . The majority of the division 's troops had been killed , captured or deserted . All of NK II Corps was in a similar state , and the North Korean army , exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon , was on the brink of defeat . 
 By this time , the US 1st Cavalry Division suffered 770 killed , 2 @,@ 613 wounded , 62 captured during its time at Pusan Perimeter . This included about 600 casualties , with around 200 killed in action it had already suffered during the Battle of Taegu the previous month . American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter . The division had numbered 14 @,@ 703 on September 1 , but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties . 
 Sgt. John Raymond Rice , a Ho Chunk Indian awarded the Bronze Star in World War II , was killed at Tabu @-@ dong on Sept . 6 , 1950 leading a squad of Company A , 8th Cavalry Regiment . When his remains were returned for burial in Sioux City , Iowa the public cemetery denied him a burial because of his race . President Truman personally intervened , and arranged for his burial with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery . A subsequent U.S. Supreme Court case determined in 1954 that racial segregation at public cemeteries was legal .

 Jeter was trained by Nick Dinsmore and debuted in 2001 in Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) . In 2003 , Jeter signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , and continued to wrestle in OVW , which was WWE 's developmental territory , although he occasionally made appearances in dark matches for WWE . In one of his earliest dark matches , Jeter teamed with Nova in a loss to Chuck Palumbo and Nunzio on the February 23 , 2003 episode of Velocity . His pay @-@ per @-@ view debut was at the 2003 Vengeance event , when Jeter appeared as the masked Conquistador # 2 in the APA 's Barroom Brawl match . 
 In 2004 , Jeter formed a tag team with Matt Cappotelli known as The Thrillseekers . The Thrillseekers wrestled in several dark matches before both Raw and SmackDown , defeating the teams of Johnny Nitro and Chris Cage , and MNM . On January 19 , 2005 , The Thrillseekers defeated MNM to win the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship . They successfully defended the championship against MNM and The Heart Throbs , before losing it to the Blond Bombers ( Tank and Chad Toland ) on April 6 . 
 On July 27 , The Thrillseekers defeated MNM to become the number one contenders to the Tag Team Championship , in a match with the added stipulation that whoever gained the pin would receive a match for the OVW Heavyweight Championship . The Thrillseekers got simultaneous pins , but it was Jeter who received the championship match . On August 3 , Jeter defeated the OVW Heavyweight Champion , Brent Albright , to win the championship , after Ken Anderson and Daniel Puder interfered on his behalf . After the match , Jeter turned into a heel ( villainous character ) by attacking Cappotelli , who had suffered an injury . In the following weeks , Jeter also attacked Albright , announcer Dean Hill , and official Danny Davis . 
 Jeter quickly formed an alliance with Ken Anderson , who helped him retain the championship on several occasions . They later added Paul Burchill to the alliance as an enforcer . After holding the OVW Heavyweight Championship for five months , Jeter lost it to Cappotelli in a two out of three falls match on November 9 , 2005 . Jeter challenged Cappotelli on numerous occasions Cappotelli in an attempt to regain the championship , but was unsuccessful .

 In OVW , he became a part of The Spirit Squad , a faction using the in @-@ ring personas of male cheerleaders , using the name " Johnny " . On January 23 , 2006 , they had their WWE television debut as a group , appearing on Raw and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry Lawler by distracting Lawler and performing cheers for Coachman . They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels . The heel ( villainous ) McMahon brought in The Spirit Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions , including placing them in multiple handicap matches . 
 They also wrestled in the tag team division and on Raw on April 3 , The Spirit Squad won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey , with outside help from the other three members , defeated Kane and The Big Show . After winning the championship , all five members of The Spirit Squad were recognized as the champions , allowing any combination of them to defend the championship . 
 In May , McMahon signed another handicap match , with The Spirit Squad facing Michaels . The Spirit Squad instead attacked Michaels before the match started , and Triple H came out to help The Spirit Squad . Triple H felt disrespected by The Spirit Squad however , and as a result , helped Michaels instead . This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D @-@ Generation X ( DX ) and they began a feud with The Spirit Squad . DX played various sophomoric jokes on The Spirit Squad and the McMahons , as well as defeating The Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night 's Main Event . 
 At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon , The Spirit Squad also wrestled other teams in Raw 's tag division over their World Tag Team Championship , successfully defending the championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene , Charlie Haas and Viscera , and Snitsky and Val Venis . They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders , whom they eventually defeated to retain the championship at the Unforgiven pay @-@ per @-@ view in September . The Spirit Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with Johnny , Mikey , and Mitch losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of Raw . After two consecutive losses to the debuting Cryme Tyme , Kenny announced that he was going to defeat Flair , and was successful with the help of the other members .

 = Agnes Mary Mansour = 
 Agnes Mary Mansour ( April 10 , 1931 – December 17 , 2004 ) was an American Roman Catholic nun who was given a choice from the Vatican in 1983 to end her religious vows or to resign from her position as the director of the Michigan Department of Social Services which required her to support and allocate public funding for abortions . The controversy involved her belief that that abortion was tragic but should be legal , despite her vows as a religious and the teachings of the Catholic Church . 
 After graduating from college in Detroit , Mansour entered religious orders then earned a doctorate degree in biochemistry . She served as the president of Mercy College of Detroit from 1971 to 1983 . She ran unsuccessfully for public office in 1982 , in the process provoking comment from the Archbishop of Detroit . The Governor of Michigan appointed her to lead the state 's social services department , and she was confirmed in early 1983 . During this time , the Bishop of Detroit and Vatican officials asked Mansour declare herself against abortion — her department was responsible for abortion services funded through Medicaid . Mansour refused to make such a statement , and two months after her confirmation as director she was required by the Vatican to decide whether she was to continue as director or as a nun . She chose to give up her vows as a nun . After serving out her appointment she was inducted into the Michigan Women 's Hall of Fame in 1988 . 
 = = Education and religion = = 
 Josephine A. Mansour was born in Detroit , Michigan to Lebanese immigrants on April 10 , 1931 , the fourth of four children in her family , all girls . She was baptized in the Antiochene Maronite branch of Eastern Catholicism . 
 After finishing St. Charles High School in Detroit 's East Side , she graduated from Mercy College in 1953 with a bachelor of science degree in medical technology and chemistry . She entered the Sisters of Mercy , assuming the name Sister Agnes Mary on September 7 , 1953 , transferring to the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church . She continued her education at Catholic University in Washington D.C. , earning a master of science degree in chemistry in 1958 . 
 On August 16 , 1959 , she took perpetual vows to become a nun . Her motto was " Free to be Faithful " . She entered Georgetown University and earned a doctorate in Biochemistry in 1964 . Regarding a harmful side effect of the use of chloroquine in the treatment of malaria , dangerous to the eyes , she co @-@ authored The Ocular Deposition of Chloroquine , with Howard Bernstein , Nathan <unk> and Martin Rubin . After receiving her doctorate , Mansour returned to Chicago and accepted the chairmanship of the Mercy College Department of Physical Science and Mathematics . She also coached the basketball team . 
 Mansour studied academic administration in the American Council on Education ( ACE ) Fellows program at the University of Kentucky . In 1971 , she began serving as president of Mercy College of Detroit , staying in the position until 1983 . As president , she greatly expanded enrollment and facilities at Mercy College , doubling the number of degree programs while balancing the budget with increased endowments . After 1987 , she served as visiting professor to Michigan State University and Wayne State University . 
 = = Public service = = 
 In 1982 , Mansour ran in a primary election for United States House of Representatives representing Michigan 's 17th congressional district , held on August 3 . She said of her campaign , " I look at politics as a legitimate extension of my work as a Sister of Mercy . " In a field of four Democratic Party candidates , Sander M. Levin won with more than seven times the votes received by Mansour , who picked up only 6 @.@ 4 % of the electorate . 
 Mansour 's run for office came as a surprise to Edmund Szoka , the Archbishop of Detroit . At the time , the Vatican allowed members of religious orders to hold political office , but the candidate was required to gain the approval of the local bishop . Mansour did not do so . She told reporters that canon law was an " old set of rules that are invoked when somebody wants to invoke them , and ignored when someone wants to ignore them . " Szoka accepted her excuse that she did not know to ask permission . 
 = = = Michigan Social Services = = = 
 After the general election in November 1982 , the incoming Michigan governor , James Blanchard , appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services ( DSS ) ; Michigan 's biggest agency . The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $ 5 million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions . To accept the appointment , she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka . Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion ; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition . Mansour did not follow his request . Though she personally disapproved of abortion , she knew that many others felt differently , and she determined that the poor should have equal access to abortion as long as it was legal . 
 Mansour assumed the directorship on December 29 , 1982 , pending Michigan legislative confirmation in the position . Bishop Szoka hardened his resolve , on February 23 , 1983 , directed the Detroit Province of the Sisters of Mercy to determine whether Mansour was in violation of the teachings of the Church . He told the Detroit Sisters leadership that Mansour no longer had his permission to serve the state , and he ordered them to inform her that she was to resign the state appointment . 
 Detroit archdiocese spokesman Jay Berman said of the NCAN protest : " Their efforts are confusing Catholics and misrepresenting 2 @,@ 000 years of church teaching on the sanctity of human life . " Bishop Szoka told the Pastoral Council that he was disappointed they did not support him . He said , " It is a question of my absolute duty to stand for , to protect and to defend the doctrine of the Church which has to do with human life . " On March 4 , Bishop Szoka met again with the leadership of the Detroit Sisters of Mercy , and he restated his directive . The Sisters determined they did not have to obey Szoka if " a greater good was involved " , and refused to force Mansour to quit her job . 
 On March 8 , Mansour was confirmed in her appointment by the Michigan Senate with a vote of 28 to 9 . She said , " I recognize that we live in a morally pluralistic society that government must be respectful of , and that my morality may not be someone else 's morality . " She told the Senate that she was personally against abortion but that she could tolerate the part of her job involving the disbursement of Medicaid funds to hospitals that performed abortions on women with little or no money . 
 On March 10 , Bishop Szoka reported the situation to the Vatican . The Vatican delegated Archbishop Pio <unk> to address the matter , and he sent a message to Sister Theresa Kane , the national president of the Sisters of Mercy , telling Kane that she must convince Mansour to resign as director of DSS . Kane refused , as did Detroit Provincial Superior Emily George who was the Vice President of the Sisters of Mercy of the Union , and was previously ( as Mary Karl George ) the president of Mercy College , before Mansour . 
 On April 11 , the day after Mansour 's 52nd birthday , Sister Kane requested a formal hearing on the matter from the Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes , a Vatican body that dealt with nuns and religious orders . On April 16 , the Congregation instructed Anthony Bevilacqua , Auxiliary Bishop of Brooklyn who was visiting Rome with other bishops , that he was " to approach Sister Agnes Mary Mansour directly and to require , in the name of the Holy See and by virtue of her vow of obedience , that she immediately resign as director " of DSS . Around this time , Mansour asked for and received permission for a leave of absence from the Sisters of Mercy , so that she could carry out her state appointment free of conflict with the Church . 
 Bevilacqua sent a letter directly to Mansour without communicating his intention to President Kane or any of the Detroit leaders of the Sisters of Mercy . The action was unusual because a Catholic bishop normally restricted his communications to the authorities of a religious order , not the individual members . In the letter , Bevilacqua told Mansour she was to meet him in person , and that she could bring with her two local sisters for moral support . She selected Sister Helen Marie Burns , Ph.D ( Detroit Sisters of Mercy ) and the order 's Provincial Superior , Emily George . On May 9 , 1983 , Bevilacqua met with the three women and told Mansour she must immediately decide whether to resign the directorship or her vows . Shocked at the sudden demand , for 80 minutes she contemplated the decision , then finally " with deep regret , sorrow , and limited freedom " signed the papers Bevilacqua had provided for requesting dispensation from her perpetual vows , voiding her leave of absence . After nearly 30 years of being in religious orders , she gave up her life as a nun . 
 The NCAN joined with the National Assembly of Religious Women ( <unk> ) to issue a joint statement : " The Roman Congregation for Religious in their fear of losing ' authority ' has ignored the principle of freedom of conscience . " The NCAN and <unk> requested sympathetic religious women to take part in a protest on Pentecost Sunday , May 22 , 1983 , " as a visible witness to the arrogant use of power in a male dominated church . " Small protests were organized at cathedrals in Chicago and Washington , D.C. Ms. magazine reported that Sister Donna Quinn , president of NCAN , said that the Pope 's demand for obedience " tramples on who we are as women religious in the United States " . Ms. writer Mary Kay Blakely added that she thought Mansour was correct in saying that " the Pope doesn 't understand the American people , and he doesn 't understand the American nun " . Divided over the Mansour affair , the Catholic Theological Society of America passed an unsuccessful resolution asking for dialog rather than simple administrative decisions which " violate both the theological meaning of authority in the church and the sacredness of conscience of church members " . 
 In 1983 , Mansour was offered money for the film rights to the story of her life . She said that she would accept on condition that the money was enough to balance Michigan 's state deficit , $ 900 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 at that time . No film rights were obtained . Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987 . Under her leadership , the department 's error rate dropped to its lowest levels in awarding food stamps , Medicaid funds , and Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( <unk> ) . She increased the investigation and conviction of fraud cases , and she achieved the highest national record of locating deadbeat parents for collecting child support . She streamlined office procedures , and she initiated programs to curtail teenage pregnancy and to assist teenage mothers . She broadened the state program benefiting victims of domestic abuse .

 In 1987 , Mansour accepted an executive adviser position with Mercy Health Services Special Initiative to the Poor . In 1988 , she founded the Poverty and Social Reform Institute ( PSRI ) with the mission of helping increase the health and education of children living in poverty . PSRI established two child care centers in Detroit , named " Leaps and Bounds " . 
 Mansour served on many executive boards , including PSRI , Sisters of Mercy Health Corporation , Women 's Economic Club , Michigan Bell Telephone , the National Bank of Detroit and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities . 
 = = Position on abortion = = 
 Mansour personally disapproved of abortion . However , she held the belief that , because abortion was legal , it should be equally available to all women , poor and rich . In July 1982 during her unsuccessful political campaign , Mansour wrote a " Position Paper on Abortion and Legislation " . In late summer 1984 , she joined 96 other leading theologians , nuns and priests who signed another position paper titled " A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion " , asking for Catholic discussion about abortion and requesting religious pluralism in Catholicism . 
 Mansour and the Sisters of Mercy made their 1980s decisions based on what they saw as the promise of freedom of conscience described in the Second Vatican Council of 1962 – 1965 presaged by the Ad Petri <unk> , a papal encyclical of 1959 which said , " Let there be unity in what is necessary , freedom in what is unsettled and charity in any case . " Mercy nuns believed that they held greater rights than simple obedience to authority . Pope John Paul II 's relatively quick and decisive action against Mansour signaled his retreat from the more liberal mid @-@ 1960s .

 The Sisters of Mercy did not honor Mansour 's 1983 resignation of her vows . They continued to consider her a member of the order . Around 1993 , Mansour discovered breast cancer and survived treatment for it . When the cancer returned a decade later , spreading to her bones and lungs , she was invited to stay at McAuley Center , in Farmington Hills , Michigan ; a rest home operated by the Sisters of Mercy . Facing death , Mansour said she was not bitter about the Vatican 's action , only hurt . She wanted to be remembered , " as someone who cared deeply about the benefits of education and service , and concern for those less fortunate " . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Mansour died on December 17 , 2004 , aged 73 . She was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery , Southfield , Michigan , in the Sisters of Mercy cemetery plot . Sister Linda <unk> , the President of the Detroit Regional Community of the Sisters of Mercy , said , " She never stopped being a Sister of Mercy in her heart and many of us never stopped thinking of her in that way . Throughout the years , her commitment to serving those who suffer from poverty , sickness and lack of education has been unwavering . " 
 Theologian Richard A. McCormick wrote in 2006 that Church officials abused their authority in the Mansour case , and brought " the teaching office into disrepute " . Author Kenneth A. Briggs , former religion editor for The New York Times , wrote that the Mansour case " was in many respects the most dramatic , but not the only , instance of a particular nun singled out for punishment " . Theologian Margaret Farley , a Sister of Mercy and a professor at Yale University , said , " It was a painful truth that [ Mansour ] had to leave , that the church declared her officially not a member . There was suffering in the community , and also for her . When she left she was quoted as saying that she would always be a Sister of Mercy in her heart . And that has absolutely been the case . She continued in works of mercy all her life . " 
 = Fire Emblem : Path of Radiance = 
 Fire Emblem : Path of Radiance , known in Japan as Fire Emblem : Sōen no Kiseki , is a tactical role @-@ playing video game developed by Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD , and published by Nintendo for the GameCube in 2005 . It is the ninth main installment in the Fire Emblem series , and the third to be released in the west . As with previous installments , gameplay revolves around positioning characters on a battlefield with the aim of defeating an opposing force . If characters are defeated in battle , they are removed from the rest of the game . 
 The story takes place in a separate world from other Fire Emblem games in Tellius , a continent inhabited by the humanoid Beorc and the shapeshifting Laguz . Protagonist Ike , a new member of his father 's mercenary group , finds a mysterious woman named Elincia Ridell Crimea during a mission . Crimea is invaded by the Beorc nation of Daein . During the group 's flight , Ike 's father is killed by a Daein general known as the Black Knight . Together with Elincia , who is the last remaining heir to the Crimean throne , Ike and his group travels Tellius to form allegiances with the other countries to free Crimea from Daein 's control , confronting racial tensions and long @-@ standing resentment between the Beorc and the Laguz during their travels . 
 Path of Radiance began development for the GameCube after the overseas success of the Game Boy Advance game Fire Emblem , becoming the first home console entry in the series since Fire Emblem : Thracia 776 . The game is the first entry in the series to feature 3D graphics , full motion cutscenes , and voice acting . The series ' transition to 3D caused multiple difficulties for the developers . The localization team worked closely with Intelligent Systems to ensure the localization was as true to the original Japanese as possible . Upon release , the game received widespread critical acclaim for its gameplay and story , but several journalistic sites and magazines made negative comments about the game 's graphics . The game debuted at the top of Japanese gaming charts , and was considered to have sold well . A direct sequel for the Wii , Fire Emblem : Radiant Dawn , was released in 2007 in North America and Japan , and 2008 in Europe and Australia . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Fire Emblem : Path of Radiance is a tactical role @-@ playing video game in which players control protagonist Ike and a group of up to 19 characters across multiple battle scenarios . At the game 's opening , multiple difficulty settings can be chosen : in the Japanese version the options are Normal , Hard , and Maniac modes , while the western versions have Easy , Normal , and Hard modes . Characters who fall in battle cannot be revived , being removed from the rest of the game , and no revival items can be used on them during a battle . If Ike falls in battle , the game will end and the level must be restarted . Between battles , characters can be managed at a Base . In this location , weapons can be managed and forged , and bonus experience points earned in battle can be given to characters . Characters ' skills can be tailored to a degree , but skills inherent to a particular character cannot be removed or changed , and the amount of skills awarded is limited by the character 's skill limit . 
 During battle , players have access to two species : the humanoid Beorc and the shape @-@ shifting Laguz . Beorc use weapons and magic , while Laguz use close @-@ quarters melee attacks . Laguz have a gauge which fills up during battle , filling at varying speed depending on their status and whether they are under attack . When full they transform into their animal form for a set number of turns . They are unable to attack while in human form , but the time between transformations can be shortened using special items . Playable Beorc characters are each assigned a character class . These classes affect how characters can move on the battlefield , and some are exclusive to certain characters : for example , the Ranger class is exclusive to Ike . Laguz units also have different movement speeds and strengths depending on their transformed form . 
 Characters used in battle gain experience levels , with larger amounts of experience being awarded depending on a character 's performance in battle : once they have 100 experience points , a character automatically levels up . At level 21 , a character 's class is automatically upgraded . This upgrade can happen at level 10 if the player uses an item called a Master Seal . Once the class changes , the character is reset to level 1 , while carrying over all the stat increases aggregated up to that point . Bonus experience is awarded by fulfilling secondary requirements outlined at the beginning of the level . 
 There is also a Support system , accessible through the Base , where player characters can talk with each other and improve their relationships . These actions improve affinity with a character and grant stat boots in battle . Supports are ranked from C to A , with A being the highest rank . 
 Battles take place on a grid @-@ based map , with multiple units attached to various sides : the player team , the enemy team , allied characters , and other unaffiliated characters . A character 's class ( animal form for the Laguz ) and the map 's terrain can effect how far they can move and how far ranged attacks can be . Gameplay is turn @-@ based , with the player moving , then other factions , with the aim being the defeat of the opposing side . Each turn ends automatically when each character is given their orders . The player can also manually end their turn . The standard commands battling including attacking units , using items , rescuing characters , trade items with other allied characters , and wait until a later turn to receive a command . Special commands include talking to characters in battle , opening chests and visiting places on the map , stealing items , and having characters escape from the map . Ike has the exclusive ability to command all free characters , and the level immediately ends if he escapes . 
 The series ' Weapon Triangle mechanic is present , in which the three main close @-@ combat weapons are strong or weak against each other : axes are strong against lances , lances are strong against swords , and swords are strong against axes . Other similar mechanics exist , such as fire magic being more damaging to some beasts , and arrows being more effective against airborne enemies . Weapon durability decreases over time , with weapons eventually breaking when used enough . Weapons have different levels of strength , with its assigned letter ( E to A and S ) denoting this . Weapons can also be customized with a unique name . Magic is governed by a similar system to the Weapons Triangle ; fire is weak to wind , wind is weak to thunder , and thunder is weak to fire .

 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 As with previous Fire Emblem games , Path of Radiance takes place in a continuity and setting separate from the rest of the series . The game 's setting is the continent of Tellius , inhabited by two species : the humanoid Beorc , and the shape @-@ shifting Laguz . According to legend , the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image , and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts . The two races have struggled to coexist , leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides . By the events of Path of Radiance , Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace . A key item in Tellius is <unk> 's Medallion , the world 's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem . It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea . To prevent the dark god being freed , war must be prevented in Tellius . 
 There are forty six characters encountered through the story that can be recruited , each offering their own contribution to the story . The majority of the main cast comes from the Greil Mercenaries group , led by its founder Greil . The protagonist is Ike , Greil 's son . He is accompanied on his travels by Mist , his sister , and Elincia Ridell Crimea , the lost heir to the Crimean Throne . Other Beorc characters include Titania , a former knight of Crimea ; and Soren , a mage and tactician . The Laguz characters include Lethe , a cat Laguz with a strong hatred of Beorc ; and <unk> , a lion Beorc who wishes for peaceful co @-@ existence . The antagonists are <unk> generals called the Four Riders , which include the Black Knight , and King Ashnard , the ruler of Daein . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The game opens with Greil recruiting Ike into his mercenaries upon recognizing the threat of Daein . While on a mission , Ike finds a woman who is revealed to be Elincia Ridell Crimea , a princess who was raised in secret due to her existence being a threat to the Crimean order of succession . Daein invades shortly after this , and Greil 's mercenaries flee over the border into Gallia . They are pursued by the Black Knight who kills Greil . Ike and Elincia decide to work together and drive the forces of Daein from Crimea . Over the course of the game , Ike and his companions overcome long @-@ held racial tensions between the Beorc and Laguz in order to form an alliance against their true enemy , Ashnard , king of Daein . In particular , Ike manages to re @-@ establish relations between the Beorc nation of Begnion and the few remaining members of the heron Laguz clan , which was annihilated in an act of genocide known as the <unk> Massacre . During the course of their journey , they discover that Ashnard is provoking the war to try and release the dark deity contained inside the Medallion , using Daein 's invasion as a template for his plan . In the final assault , Ike and his mercenaries manage to defeat both the Black Knight and Ashnard , thwarting his scheme . With Ashnard defeated and the Daein occupation ended , Elincia is crowned as Crimea 's new queen , who works to make the land a place where Beorc and Laguz can live in peace . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development on Path of Radiance began at Intelligent Systems after the international success of the first localized game in the series , released overseas under the title Fire Emblem . Due to high development costs , the team had been unwilling to develop a title for the GameCube , but after Fire Emblem 's success overseas , they decided to return from portable to home consoles for its next release . Nintendo SPD was also involved in development . Path of Radiance was the first Fire Emblem to have 3D in @-@ game graphics , full @-@ motion video cutscenes and voice acting . It was also the first home console game since Fire Emblem : Thracia 776 for the Super Famicom . Transitioning from 2D graphics to 3D graphics was one of the biggest challenges during development , especially the transition from the tilted overhead view to a unit @-@ to @-@ unit battle in third @-@ person . One of the features left out due to this process was a dedicated battle arena . At the same time , they introduced the base as members of the development team wanted a place where characters could interact separate from the battlefield . As there was no combat gameplay involved , other types of activity were created , such as special support conversations . To make moves in battle and cutscenes realistic , the team used motion capture , then made sure it appeared a little over the top so the fantasy feeling of the Fire Emblem series remained intact . By the end of development , Narihiro had some regrets about the quality of the game , saying in an interview that he considered it to be only 70 % complete when released . 
 The character designs were done by Senri Kita , an artist new to the series . In contrast to previous Fire Emblem games , where the protagonist was of royal blood , the main character Ike was intended to be of lower social rank , a mercenary who becomes involved in royal politics and conflict rather than being born into it . Ike was born from the many ideas for new directions being suggested for the new 3D game , with many people wanting the protagonist everyone could empathize with . His status as a mercenary was a highly requested character trait by male staff . A character that returned from previous games was <unk> , who was this time designed as a female character . Designing all the characters to be unique under the new conditions proved a challenge . This also resulted in higher @-@ quality character artwork being produced during the initial design stages . The full @-@ motion videos were created by Japanese animation studio Digital Frontier . Introducing the cutscenes into the game proved challenging for the team . The game 's subtitle does not refer to a specific object or place , but instead acts as a metaphor for the journeys of Ike and other characters . 
 = = Release = = 
 A new Fire Emblem title was first announced in April 2004 , with the full reveal coming in an issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump . The game 's title , story details and chosen platform were announced in Weekly Shōnen Jump , with a release date announced as some time during 2004 . The game was first shown publicly by Nintendo at their Nintendo World Touch DS event in early 2005 . The version of the game displayed there was an early model , and between its reveal and release , it underwent some changes to improve the usability and quality . As a pre @-@ order bonus , Nintendo created a special CD containing selected tracks form the game , and a special calendar commemorating the series ' 15th anniversary . The first western demonstration of the title was at E3 2005 . It was the third Fire Emblem title to be localized , after Fire Emblem and The Sacred Stones . Players with save data from the Game Boy Advance Fire Emblem games are able to connect with Path of Radiance and access concept art and special maps revolving around characters from those games . 
 = = = Localization = = = 
 The localization of Path of Radiance was handled by Nintendo of America 's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse . During the process , the team worked closely with Intelligent Systems staff members . The biggest challenge for the team was translating from Japanese to English , which required staff from Japan to come over and check their work . When translating the dialogue , the localization team wanted to preserve the story 's depth and serious tone , despite often having a limited text and character space for interaction and expression . While they had the option to add extra text boxes , this would potentially have made going through conversations tedious for players , so they worked to match the number of text boxes used in the Japanese version . Some character names , such as <unk> and Noel ( originally Eirik and <unk> ) were changed so they could be pronounced more easily while retaining their original meanings . The western version 's difficulty was also toned down : the Japanese version 's Maniac setting was removed , Hard Mode was toned down , and a new Easy was introduced . These adjustments were based on both western test player feedback , and feedback from Japanese players complaining about the game 's high difficulty . The amount of dialogue and text that needed translating was estimated at less than that in Animal Crossing , but still enough to take several months to complete . Due to its serious nature , the team needed to take a different approach to its localization than other Nintendo titles . As far as possible , the team remained faithful to the original script , aside from pieces like jokes which would not have made sense to people unfamiliar with Japanese humor . While most of the time they refrained from putting out @-@ of @-@ context remarks in character dialogue , an exception was Anna , a recurring Fire Emblem character who featured in optional tutorial missions . As she existed outside the game to a degree , they had more freedom to have her make pop culture references . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In Japan during its opening week , Path of Radiance sold over 100 @,@ 357 copies , selling through 64 @.@ 16 % of its initial shipment . By the end of 2005 , the game had sold 156 @,@ 413 copies . In its UK debut , it reached the top of the GameCube charts . Although no exact sales figures have been published , Nintendo cited the game as being among its successful GameCube titles for 2005 . According to the developers , the fact that it was released near the end of the GameCube 's lifespan affected sales , but it still managed to help sell the hardware and convinced Nintendo that the Fire Emblem had selling power on home consoles . 
 Reception of the game was generally positive : on aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic , it received scores of 85 % and 85 / 100 based upon 47 and 42 critic reviews respective . In IGN 's GamerMetrics List for 2005 and GameSpot 's 2005 Readers ' Choice award , Path of Radiance was at # 2 in their respective lists behind Resident Evil 4 . The game was among those nominated at the 2006 Golden Joystick Awards in the " Nintendo Game of the Year " category . The game was named by GamesRadar was one of the best GameCube games of all time in 2014 , and Destructoid listed it among the five best Fire Emblem games in the series in 2013 . 
 Famitsu 's reviewers each praised the gameplay , story , and the introduction of full @-@ motion movies . One reviewer cited it as the series ' new exemplar , while another pointed out rough edges in the graphical redesign and that the new 3D perspective made seeing some parts of the map difficult . 1UP.com 's Shane <unk> was positive overall , saying " [ Path of Radiance ] delivers a superbly paced and rewarding adventure " . RPGamer 's Chris <unk> said " While Fire Emblem : Path of Radiance doesn 't necessarily add anything new to the tactical genre , it does everything very well " , recommending it to players while stressing the need for patience . Peer Schneider of IGN called the game " yet another worthy installment in Intelligent Systems ' venerable strategy RPG series " . RPGFan reviewer Mark Tjan said that while not the best Fire Emblem game he had played , " it 's certainly a good game and worth picking up if you 're searching for an <unk> worth your time and money " . Nintendo World Report 's Karl Castaneda was also highly positive , though commenting that its graphical quality were more suited to the early days of the GameCube 's life and that it might have been a great success if released during that period . Eurogamer 's Tom Bramwell , despite feeling that the game was flawed by inherent problems in the Fire Emblem formula , enjoyed the game and was willing to replay once he had finished . Greg Kasavin , writing for GameSpot , saying that " by replacing the traditional random battles that typify most Japanese role @-@ playing games with a fun and exciting turn @-@ based combat system , and by going out of its way to deliver a memorable and genuinely emotional story , Fire Emblem : Path of Radiance accomplishes what all role @-@ playing games attempt , but very few actually manage to do " . The majority of praise went to the game 's story and gameplay , while criticism was focused on the graphical quality .

 = Manuel Belgrano = 
 Manuel José Joaquín del Corazón de Jesús Belgrano ( 3 June 1770 – 20 June 1820 ) , usually referred to as Manuel Belgrano , was an Argentine economist , lawyer , politician , and military leader . He took part in the Argentine Wars of Independence and created the Flag of Argentina . He is regarded as one of the main Libertadores of the country . 
 Belgrano was born in Buenos Aires , the fourth child of Italian businessman Domingo Belgrano y Peri and Josefa <unk> . He came into contact with the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment while at university in Spain around the time of the French Revolution . Upon his return to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata , where he became a notable member of the criollo population of Buenos Aires , he tried to promote some of the new political and economic ideals , but found severe resistance from local peninsulars . This rejection led him to work towards a greater autonomy for his country from the Spanish colonial regime . At first , he unsuccessfully promoted the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to become a regent ruler for the Viceroyalty during the period the Spanish King Ferdinand VII was imprisoned during the Peninsular War ( 1807 – 1814 ) . He favoured the May Revolution , which removed the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros from power on 25 May 1810 . He was elected as a voting member of the Primera Junta that took power after the ouster . 
 As a delegate for the Junta , he led the ill @-@ fated Paraguay campaign . His troops were defeated by Bernardo de Velasco at the battles of <unk> and <unk> . Though he was defeated , the campaign initiated the chain of events that led to the Independence of Paraguay in May 1811 . He retreated to the vicinity of Rosario , to fortify it against a possible royalist attack from the Eastern Band of the Uruguay River . While there , he created the flag of Argentina . The First Triumvirate did not approve the flag , but because of slow communications , Belgrano would only learn of that many weeks later , while reinforcing the Army of the North at Jujuy . There , knowing he was at a strategic disadvantage against the royalist armies coming from Upper Peru , Belgrano ordered the Jujuy Exodus , which evacuated the entire population of Jujuy Province to San Miguel de Tucumán . His counter @-@ offensive at the Battle of Tucumán resulted in a key strategic victory , and it was soon followed by a complete victory over the royalist army of Pío Tristán at the Battle of Salta . However , his deeper incursions into Upper Perú led to defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma , leading the Second Triumvirate to order his replacement as Commander of the Army of the North by the newly arrived José de San Martín . By then , the Asamblea del Año XIII had approved the use of Belgrano 's flag as the national war flag . 
 Belgrano then went on a diplomatic mission to Europe along with Bernardino Rivadavia to seek support for the revolutionary government . He returned in time to take part in the Congress of Tucumán , which declared Argentine Independence ( 1816 ) . He promoted the Inca plan to create a constitutional monarchy with an Inca descendant as Head of State . This proposal had the support of San Martín , Martín Miguel de Güemes , and many provincial delegates , but was strongly rejected by the delegates from Buenos Aires . The Congress of Tucumán approved the use of his flag as the national flag . After this , Belgrano again took command of the Army of the North , but his mission was limited to protecting San Miguel de Tucumán from royalist advances while San Martín prepared the Army of the Andes for an alternate offensive across the Andes . When Buenos Aires was about to be invaded by José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López , he moved the Army southwards , but his troops mutinied in January 1820 . Belgrano died of dropsy on 20 June 1820 . His last words reportedly were : " ¡ Ay , Patria <unk> ! " ( Oh , my country ! ) . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Ancestry = = = 
 Manuel José Joaquín del Corazón de Jesús Belgrano was born in Buenos Aires on 3 June 1770 , at his father 's house . It was located near the Santo Domingo convent , at Santo Domingo street , between the streets Martín de Tours and Santísima Trinidad ( the modern names of those streets are " Belgrano " , " Defensa " , and " Bolívar " respectively ) . Though the city was still rather small , the <unk> lived at one of the wealthiest neighbourhoods . Manuel Belgrano was baptised at the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral the following day . As he was born in America he was considered a criollo , a social class below the Peninsulars . 
 His father Domenico was Ligurian , from the town of Imperia , Italy . His last name was Peri , which he translated to the Spanish form Pérez , but later changed it to Belgrano – literally " <unk> " , a name that denoted good cereal production . He changed his name " Domenico " to the Spanish " Domingo " as well . He was a European merchant authorised by the King of Spain to move to America , and had contacts in Spain , Rio de Janeiro , and Britain . He promoted the establishment of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires , which his son Manuel would lead years later . Belgrano 's mother was María Josefa González Islas y <unk> , born in the city of Santiago del Estero , Argentina . The family was the second richest in Buenos Aires , after the <unk> . They had 16 sons , four of whom died . Domingo Belgrano Pérez managed a family business , and arranged his four daughters to be married to merchants who would become his trusted agents in the Banda Oriental , Misiones Province , and Spain . The eight living male sons followed different paths : Domingo José Estanislao became canon at the local cathedral , while Carlos José and José Gregorio joined the military . Manuel Belgrano was meant to follow his father 's work , but when he developed other interests , it was his brother Francisco José María de Indias who continued the family business . 
 = = = European studies = = = 
 Belgrano completed his first studies at the San Carlos school , where he learned Latin , philosophy , logic , physics , metaphysics , and literature ; he graduated in 1786 . Domingo had sufficient success as merchant to send his two sons Francisco and Manuel to study in Europe . He expected them to study commerce , but Manuel decided to study law . Belgrano was so successful and attained such prestige that Pope Pius VI allowed him to study forbidden literature , even books deemed as heretical , excepting only the astrological and obscene books . In this way he came into contact with authors like Montesquieu , Rousseau , and <unk> , who were forbidden in Spain . 
 Belgrano studied near the intellectual elite of Spain , and by that time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution . The principles of equality and freedom , the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate . Among the supporters of these ideas it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles , and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas . However , the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy . Thus , despite the new influences , Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist . 
 Belgrano also studied living languages , political economy , and public rights . The authors that most influenced him were Pedro Rodríguez de <unk> , Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos , Adam Smith , and François Quesnay . Belgrano translated Quesnay 's book Maximes <unk> de gouvernement <unk> d 'un <unk> agricole ( General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom ) to Spanish . His main interest in the works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity . Like many South American students , he became interested in physiocracy , which stated that new wealth came from nature , that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed , and that the state should not interfere at all with it . By that time , South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy . Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata . In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani , who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations , and Antonio <unk> , who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state , such as the provision of free education for some . During his time in Europe , Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation , forensic practice and political economy . 
 = = = Work in the consulate = = = 
 A short time before his return to Buenos Aires on 3 June 1794 , Belgrano was elected by Don Diego de Gardoqui as " perpetual secretary " of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires , a new local institution which dealt with commercial and industrial issues in the name of the crown . This date would be later known in Argentina as Economist Day . He would remain in this office until 1810 , and would deal with commercial disputes and promote agriculture , industry , and commerce . Not having enough freedom to make big changes in the economic system , he made big efforts to improve education . Influenced by <unk> , he believed that the true wealth of countries was human ingenuity , and that the best way to promote industrialisation was through education . 
 Belgrano maintained frequent discussions with the committee members of the Consulate , who were all merchants with strong interests involved in the <unk> commerce with Cadiz . He made many proposals , influenced by free trade ideas . By this time , Belgrano thought that " The merchant must have freedom to buy where he can be best accommodated , and it 's natural that he does where he is supplied with the best price to be able to earn the best profit " . Those proposals were rejected by the committee members ; his only supporters were Juan José Castelli , Juan Larrea , and Domingo Matheu . However , Belgrano had some successes , such as creating the Nautical School , the Commerce School , and the Geometry and Drawing Academy . He created the Commerce School to influence future merchants to work towards the best interests of the nation , and the nautical and drawing ones to provide the youth with prestigious and lucrative careers . The schools were situated next to the Consulate so that Belgrano could easily supervise their development . The schools were in place for three years before they were closed by a ruling of Manuel Godoy , from the Spanish monarchy , who considered them an unnecessary luxury for a colony . It was felt that Buenos Aires might not be able to maintain them . 
 Belgrano tried to promote the diversification of agriculture via the production of linen and hemp , following experiences with his friend Martín de <unk> . He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price . He also tried to make leather recognised as a product of the country , in order to promote its commercial potential . None of these proposals were accepted . He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy , diversify the agriculture , or <unk> the pampas . The system did not work as expected , and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given . 
 He helped to create the first newspaper of the city , the Telégrafo Mercantil , directed by Francisco Cabello y Mesa . He worked with Manuel José de Lavardén , and edited nearly two hundred issues . The newspaper was closed in 1802 because of conflicts with the authorities of the viceroyalty , who did not like the criticisms made in it or the jokes and parodies . He also worked at the Semanario de Agricultura , Comercio e Industria , directed by Hipólito Vieytes . He used this newspaper to explain his economic ideas : manufacturing and exporting finished goods , importing raw materials to manufacture , avoiding importing luxury goods or raw materials that could be produced or extracted locally , importing only vital products , and owning a merchant navy . The newspaper specialised in the " Philosophy of History , Geography and Statistics " . Many revolutionary principles were presented as essays . 
 Belgrano had symptoms of syphilis , which he had caught during his time in Europe . This sickness forced him to take long leaves from his work in the Consulate , and to suggest his cousin Juan José Castelli , who had similar ideas , as a possible replacement during his leaves . Rejection by the committee members delayed the approval of Castelli until 1796 . 
 = = = British invasions = = = 
 Belgrano was appointed as captain of the urban militias in 1797 by viceroy Pedro de Melo , who was instructed by Spain to prepare defences against a possible British or Portuguese attack . Belgrano by then worked in the Consulate , and was no longer interested in pursuing a military career . Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte requested that he create a militia to counter a possible British attack , but he did not take interest in it . His first intervention in a military conflict took place when the British , under William Carr Beresford , arrived with 1 @,@ 600 men and took Buenos Aires , starting the British invasions of the Río de la Plata . Belgrano moved to the fortress as soon as he heard the warning , and gathered many men to launch resistance . But without the required knowledge , his men marched in disorder and Belgrano was ordered to disband after a single British cannon shot . Belgrano would write later in his autobiography that he regretted not having by then even the most basic knowledge of militia work . 
 After the taking of the city , all Spanish authorities were requested to pledge allegiance to the British crown . Belgrano thought that the members of the Consulate should leave the city and join the viceroy , but the others did not agree . They obeyed the British request ; Belgrano refused to do so . He said that he wanted " either our old master , or no master at all " . To avoid being forced to pledge allegiance , he escaped from Buenos Aires and sought asylum at the chapel of Mercedes , in the Banda Oriental . 
 The British army was defeated by an army under the direction of Santiago de Liniers , and Spanish authority was restored . It was expected that the British would return , and the whole city started to prepare for that possibility . Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires after the reconquest , and put himself under the command of Liniers . He was appointed sergeant of the Patricians Regiment , under the command of Cornelio Saavedra , and started to study military strategy . After some conflicts with other officials , he resigned as sergeant and served again under the command of Liniers . A new British attack took place in July 1807 . During the battle he served as field assistant to a division commanded by <unk> . After a successful resistance against the British , Belgrano resumed his work in the Consulate and discontinued his military studies . Because of his knowledge of French he had a brief interview with the defeated Robert Craufurd , who proposed British support for an independentist movement . Belgrano rejected the offer , considering that Britain would readily remove their support if they had a more lucrative option in Europe , and in such case the revolutionaries would be helpless against a Spanish counterattack . 
 = = = Carlotism = = = 
 Manuel Belgrano was the main proponent of the Carlotist political movement in the Rio de la Plata , a response to recent developments in Europe , where Spain was at war with France . Through the abdications of Bayonne , the Spanish king Ferdinand VII was deposed and imprisoned and the Frenchman Joseph Bonaparte was appointed King of Spain by the French victors . This led to a partial power vacuum in the viceroyalty , as the legitimacy of the new king was rejected by all parties . The purpose of the Carlotist movement was to replace the authority of the deposed king with that of Carlota Joaquina , sister of Ferdinand , who was then living in Rio de Janeiro . The project was supported as a means to achieve more autonomy , and perhaps independence , for Spanish colonies in the New World . Belgrano kept a fluent mail communication with Carlota , and convinced many <unk> to join him in the project , such as Castelli , Vieytes , Nicolás Rodríguez Peña , and Juan José Paso . 
 The project , however , found strong resistance . As Carlota was married to John VI , a prince of Portugal , many people though that Carlotism was a trick to conceal Portuguese expansionism . Carlota herself had different political ideas than those of her supporters : Belgrano and the others shared the ideas of enlightenment , but Carlota aspired to keep the full power of an absolutist monarchy . By 1810 the project was forgotten . 
 A new viceroy , Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros , arrived from Europe to replace Liniers . Belgrano had failed to convince Liniers of the benefits of the Carlotist plan , so he aimed instead to convince him of refusing to give up the viceroyalty , as Liniers had been confirmed as viceroy by a Spanish king . Cisneros , appointed by the Junta of Seville , lacked such legitimacy . Liniers refused this proposal as well , and handed command to Cisneros without resistance . Belgrano later convinced the new viceroy to allow him to edit a new newspaper , the " Correo de Comercio " . This allowed him to gather with other revolutionary leaders with the excuse of discussing the development of the newspaper . He also supported Cisneros when he allowed foreign trade at the port ( previously only Spanish ships were allowed ) , but this ruling was strongly rejected by Spanish merchants . The lawyer Mariano Moreno wrote The Representation of the Hacendados , an economic essay that convinced Cisneros to maintain the free foreign trade . Some historians , such as Miguel Ángel <unk> , suggest that the essay was actually Belgrano 's work , or a work by Moreno from a draft written by Belgrano . Belgrano may not have been able to present such a work himself , because he held a political office and because his past opposition to Cisneros may have risked its rejection . 
 Belgrano resigned from his work in the Consulate in April 1810 and moved to the countryside . A short time later he received a letter from his friends requesting him to return to Buenos Aires and join the revolutionary movements . 
 = = = May Revolution = = = 
 The Peninsular War was not developing favourably for Spain , and by May 1810 a ship arrived with the news of the defeat of Seville and the disbanding of the Junta of Seville . Without either a recognised Spanish king or the Junta that had appointed Cisneros , many people thought that the viceroy no longer had any authority . Cisneros tried to conceal the news by gathering all the newspapers brought by the ship , but Belgrano and Castelli managed to get one . Cisneros then explained the European developments to the public . Belgrano and the members of the Carlotist party , despite having given up their original idea , plotted to remove the viceroy and replace him with a junta . Under the advice of Cornelio Saavedra , they waited for the news of the defeat in Spain to take action . 
 Belgrano and Saavedra , representing the military and the intellectuals , got an interview with Cisneros to request an open cabildo , but without getting an answer . Cisneros called the military leaders and requested their support , but they refused , under the grounds that his viceroyalty lacked legitimacy . Castelli and other patriots insisted in their request , and Cisneros finally accepted . A massive demonstration the following day ensured that Cisneros would keep his word . The open cabildo was held on 22 May , with all political leaders present , and armed men filling the Plaza and ready to invade the cabildo in case the peninsulars attempted a disruption , which would be indicated by a signal from Belgrano . He supported the stance of his cousin Castelli , who made a speech explaining the concept of the retroversion of the sovereignty of the people , and that Spanish America was subject to the King of Spain but not to Spain itself . At the time of voting , Castelli 's proposal was coupled with the one of Cornelio Saavedra , with Belgrano among its supporters . This joint proposal for the removal of Cisneros and the creation of a government junta prevailed over the others . However , the cabildo attempted to keep Cisneros in power in spite of this result , by creating a junta with Cisneros as its president . This was rejected by the revolutionary leaders and the population . A great state of turmoil ended when the Junta was disbanded on 25 May and replaced by the Primera Junta . Belgrano was included in this junta , among many other local politicians . 
 In his autobiography Belgrano declared that he did not have any previous knowledge of being included in the junta , and that his appointment took him by surprise . Nevertheless , he accepted the role . He was part of the political line of Mariano Moreno ; they were expecting to use the government to make big changes in the social order . One of his first rulings was the making of a Maths Academy , located in the building of the Consulate and with the purpose of instructing the military . Belgrano was appointed its protector . He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience , and the execution of Liniers and other counter @-@ revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba . Some historians suggest that he would have promoted the creation of the Operations plan , a secret document written by Moreno that set harsh ways for the junta to achieve its goals , while others consider the whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit the junta . A few others suspect that some paragraphs or the whole document may have been the result of collaborative writing between Moreno , Belgrano , and Hipólito Vieytes . 
 = = = Expedition to Paraguay = = = 
 Three months after the creation of the Primera Junta , Manuel Belgrano was appointed Chief Commander of an army sent to gather support at Corrientes , Santa Fe , Paraguay , and the Banda Oriental . A few days later his goal was made more specific : he must aim for Paraguay . The Junta had been informed that the patriotic party was strong , and a small army would suffice to take control . Trusting this information , Belgrano went to Paraguay with two possible goals : get acknowledgment for the Junta in Paraguay or promote a new government that would stay on friendly terms with Buenos Aires . Belgrano was unaware that on 24 July a general assembly in Paraguay discussed the Junta of Buenos Aires , and decided to reject it and pledge allegiance to the Regency Council of Spain . 
 Belgrano headed north with nearly two hundred men , expecting to gather more people by the end of the Paraná River . Soldiers from the <unk> regiments of San Nicolás and Santa Fe joined them en route , and later the Junta sent reinforcements of another two hundred soldiers . The army was welcomed by most of the population along the way , receiving donations and new recruits . Ultimately the army was composed of nearly 950 men , consisting of infantry and cavalry divided in four divisions with one piece of artillery each . 
 By the end of October the army stopped at Curuzú <unk> , where Belgrano solved an old border conflict between Corrientes and <unk> . He set which territories would belong to Curuzu <unk> and <unk> , and organised their urban layout around the chapel and school . By November the army arrived at the coast of Paraná near <unk> island , and there Belgrano took measures to benefit the natives that were living in missions . With his authority as speaker of the Junta he gave them full civil and political rights , granted lands , authorised commerce with the United Provinces , and lifted their restriction on taking public or religious office . However , the Junta requested later that he should seek authorization for such changes in the future . 
 From that point the army moved to Candelaria , which was used as a stronghold for the attack into Paraguay . The terrain gave a clear advantage to the Paraguayan governor Velazco against Belgrano : the Paraná River , nearly 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) wide , was an effective natural barrier , and once it was crossed the patriotic army would have to move a long distance across a land without supplies . Swamps , hills , rivers , and lakes would force the army to march slowly , making a possible retreat very difficult . The Parana was crossed with several boats on 19 December , and a task force of 54 Paraguayan soldiers was forced to flee during the Battle of <unk> . Belgrano saw Velazco 's army from the <unk> hill , and despite being greatly outnumbered , he ordered an attack , trusting in the moral strength of his soldiers . When the Battle of <unk> started , the patriots briefly held the upper hand , but eventually Velazco , with superior numbers , prevailed . Even with 10 deaths and 120 soldiers taken prisoner , Belgrano wanted to continue the fight , but his officials convinced him to retreat . 
 The army left for Tacuarí , being closely watched by the combined armies of <unk> and Cabañas . Those two armies had nearly three thousand soldiers , while Belgrano had barely four hundred . They were attacked from many sides during the Battle of Tacuarí , on 9 March . Greatly outnumbered and losing an unequal fight , Belgrano refused to surrender . He reorganised the remaining 235 men and ordered his secretary to burn all his documents and personal papers to prevent them from falling into enemy hands . Belgrano arranged for the troops and artillery to fire for many minutes , which made the Paraguayan soldiers disperse . When the barrage stopped , Belgrano requested an armistice , telling Cabañas that he had arrived to Paraguay to aid and not to conquer ; considering the open hostility with which he was met , he would leave the province . Cabañas accepted , on the grounds that the remaining group must leave the province within a day . 
 The campaign to Paraguay was a complete military defeat for Belgrano . However , the aftermath of the conflict led the Paraguayans to replace <unk> with a local junta , and declare independence from Spain . Under the rule of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia , Paraguay broke ties with Buenos Aires as well , and stayed isolated for several years afterwards . 
 = = = Creation of the flag of Argentina = = = 
 After the defeat in Tacuarí , the government of Buenos Aires ( which by then was the First Triumvirate ) issued a series of conflicting orders . First they requested he should fight the royalists in the Banda Oriental , then to return to the city and be judged for the defeats . However , no charges were formulated against him . He was appointed as the head of the Regiment of Patricians , replacing the banished Cornelio Saavedra , but the troops did not accept him and started the <unk> Mutiny . After that , the Triumvirate requested that he fortify Rosario against possible royalist attacks from the Banda Oriental . Belgrano created two batteries , " Independencia " ( " Independence " ) and " Libertad " ( " Freedom " ) . After realising that both patriots and royalists were fighting under the same colours , he created the cockade of Argentina , of light blue and white , the use of which was approved by the Triumvirate . The reasons for the colours are usually considered to be either loyalty to the House of Bourbon or his esteem of the Virgin Mary . Belgrano created a flag with the same colours , which was hoisted at Rosario near the Paraná River on 27 February 1812 . On that same day he was appointed to replace <unk> in the Army of the North , so he travelled to Yatasto . He found demoralised officials , nearly 1 @,@ 500 soldiers ( a quarter of them hospitalised ) , minimal artillery , and no money . Some of the officials were Manuel Dorrego , Gregorio Aráoz de <unk> , Cornelio Zelaya , José María Paz , Diego Balcarce , and Eustaquio Díaz Vélez . The cities were much more hostile to the Army than those that Belgrano encountered on his way into Paraguay . Salta was menaced by the royalist general José Manuel de Goyeneche ; Belgrano had orders to take command and retreat without fighting , but he disobeyed . He prepared a base at Campo Santo , in Salta , where he improved the hospital and created a military tribunal . He later moved to Jujuy , knowing that he did not have the resources to launch an attack on Upper Perú . 
 The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag created in Rosario , but Belgrano was initially unaware of that . He had the flag blessed by the priest Juan Ignacio de Gorriti at Salta , on the second anniversary of the May Revolution . When he found out the flag was not approved , he put it away . When asked , he would say that he was keeping it for a great victory . 
 Three months later royalist general Pío Tristán advanced in the north with more than three thousand men , prepared to invade the United Provinces . Once again outnumbered by larger armies , Belgrano organised a great exodus of the city of Jujuy : the entire population of the city would have to retreat with the army and not leave behind anything that might be of value to the royalists ( such as animals , crops , or housing ) . By September a proper formation of columns provided them with a victory against a royalist task force of 500 men during the Battle of Las Piedras . The First Triumvirate commanded Belgrano to retreat to Cordoba without fighting , but he thought that doing so would mean the loss of the northern provinces . Thus , instead of continuing to Cordoba , he was convinced by the people of San Miguel de Tucumán to make a stand there . His forces had increased by then to nearly 1 @,@ 800 soldiers , still much less than the 3 @,@ 000 at Tristan 's command . Even so , he obtained a victory in the Battle of Tucumán . By that time , the First Triumvirate was replaced by the Second Triumvirate , which provided greater support for Belgrano . The Second Triumvirate called the Assembly of Year XIII soon after taking power , which was intended to declare independence and enact a national constitution , but failed to do so because of political disputes between the members . It did not take measures regarding the national flag , but allowed Belgrano to use the blue and white flag as the flag of the Army of the North . 
 After the defeat in Tucumán , Tristán garrisoned at the city of Salta with 2 @,@ 500 men . Belgrano , with reinforcements from the government , intended to gather 4 @,@ 000 men and march to Upper Peru , up to the border of the Viceroyalty of Lima . The Battle of Salta , the first battle with the new approved banner , was a decisive victory , ending with the capitulation of Pío Tristán and all of his army . 
 These victories ensured Argentine authority in the northwest and stopped the royalist advance into the central territory . Although there were a number of colonialist ' invasions ' from Upper Peru until 1821 , Belgrano 's campaign is widely considered the decisive one . 
 = = = Campaign to Upper Peru = = = 
 By June 1813 Belgrano set up a base in Potosí with an army of 2 @,@ 500 men , to prepare an attack on Upper Peru . Goyeneche moved to Oruro and resigned , being replaced by Joaquín de la Pezuela . Belgrano administrated the zone and tried to revert the bad impression left by the previous campaign of Juan José Castelli . Belgrano initiated good relations with the natives as well . Belgrano 's plan was to attack the royalists from the front and the sides , with the aid of the armies of Cárdenas and Zelaya . Both armies were near 3 @,@ 500 men . However , the royalists obtained an important advantage by defeating Cárdenas and getting possession of his papers , which gave them insight into the patriotic plans . Belgrano was taken by surprise at Vilcapugio on 1 October , and initially gained the upper hand against the royalist troops , who started to flee . However , when Pezuela saw that the patriotic armies were not following , he reorganised his forces , returned to the battle , and won . There were barely 400 survivors . Belgrano said : " Soldiers : we have lost the battle after so much fighting . Victory has betrayed us by going to the enemy ranks during our triumph . It does not matter ! The flag of the nation still swings in our hands ! " . After gathering his army at Macha , where he received reinforcements from Cochabamba , Belgrano was ready for another engagement with Pezuela , whose troops were not in a better situation . On 14 November , Belgrano was again vanquished by the royalists at Ayohuma , and was forced to withdraw the remains of his army towards Potosí and from there to Jujuy . 
 The Second Triumvirate reacted by sending José de San Martín to take the command of the Army of the North , with Belgrano as his second in command . San Martín would reinforce the battle @-@ weary Army of the North with his own soldiers . <unk> by Belgrano 's illness , San Martín travelled to the rendezvous as quickly as possible ; they met at the Yatasto relay , in Salta . Belgrano gave San Martin full freedom to implement changes , and took command of the First Regiment . The Second Triumvirate , and later the Supreme Director Gervasio Posadas , requested Belgrano to return to Buenos Aires and be judged for the defeats at Vilcapugio and Ayohuma , but San Martín refused to send him because of his poor health . San Martín finally agreed to send Belgrano to Córdoba by March 1814 . He temporarily settled in Luján to await outcome of the trial , and during this time he wrote his autobiography . Soon afterwards , all charges against Belgrano were dismissed , as no definite accusation was formulated against him . The new government , trusting in Belgrano 's diplomatic abilities , sent him on a mission to Europe to negotiate support for the independence of the United Provinces . 
 = = = Declaration of Independence = = = 
 By 1814 the Spanish King Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne and started the Absolutist Restauration , which had grave consequences for the governments in the Americas . Belgrano and Bernardino Rivadavia were sent to Europe to seek support for the United Provinces from both Spain and Britain . They sought to promote the crowning of Francisco de Paula , son of Charles IV of Spain , as regent of the United Provinces , but in the end he refused to act against the interests of the King of Spain . The diplomatic mission failed , but Belgrano learned of changes in ideology that had taken place in Europe since his previous visit . With the influence of the French Revolution , there had been a great consensus for making republican governments . After the government of Napoleon I , monarchies were preferred again , but in the form of constitutional monarchies , such as in Britain . He also noticed that the European powers approved of the South American revolutions , but the approval was compromised when the countries started to fall into anarchy . 
 When the emissaries returned to Buenos Aires , the government was worried by the defeats of Rondeau at Sipe Sipe and the political stir generated by José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López . Alvarez Thomas appointed Belgrano to head the army at Rosario , but shortly afterwards Thomas resigned . Pueyrredón became the new Supreme Director . With the signing of the Santo Tomé pact , the aforementioned army was retired from Rosario . Belgrano was then sent back to take command of the Army of the North , with the strong support of San Martín . " In the case of designating who must replace Rondeau , I am decided for Belgrano ; he is the most methodical man of all whom I know in America ; he is full of integrity and natural talent . He may not have the military knowledge of a Moreau or a Bonaparte as far as the army is concerned , but I think he is the best we have in South America " . 
 Belgrano met with the Congress of Tucuman on 6 July 1816 to explain the results of his diplomatic mission in Europe . He thought that enacting a local monarchy would help to prevent anarchy , which would not end simply with independence from Spain . He felt a declaration of independence would be more easily accepted by the European powers if it created a monarchic system . To this end he formulated the Inca Plan : a monarchy ruled by a noble of the Inca civilisation . He thought that this would generate support from the indigenous populations as well , and repair the actions taken against the Inca by the Spanish colonisation . This proposal was supported by San Martín , Güemes , the deputies from the Upper Peru , and other provinces , but it found a strong rejection from Buenos Aires ; they would not accept Cuzco as the capital city . On 9 July the Congress finally signed the Declaration of Independence from Spain . The flag created by Belgrano , which was being used without a law regulating it , was accepted as the national flag . The Inca Plan was still under discussion , but the Congress delayed it due to several states of emergency in the provinces caused by the war . 
 In August Belgrano again took command of the Army of the North , but with very limited people and resources . He was ordered to avoid trying to advance against the royalists in the north , and was to stay in a defensive state at Tucumán . With Güemes in Salta , his task was to prevent the Royalists from moving to the south . The Supreme Director Pueyrredón was supporting an alternative plan designed by José de San Martín : create the Army of the Andes at Cuyo and , after making the Crossing of the Andes , defeat the royalists in Chile , get control of the Chilean navy , and attack the royalist stronghold of Lima with it .

 In 1819 Buenos Aires was at war with José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López , and requested San Martín and Belgrano to return with their armies to take part in the conflict . San Martín refused to do so , but Belgrano accepted . However , before his arrival the governors Estanislao López and Juan José Viamonte signed an eight @-@ day truce to start peace negotiations . Belgrano 's health was in a very bad state by this point , but he refused to resign , thinking that the morale of the Army would suffer without his presence . He moved to the frontier between Santa Fe and Córdoba , from where he would be able to move to either the <unk> or the north if needed . His health continued to worsen , and he was given an unlimited leave from work by the Supreme Director . He handed command to Fernández de la Cruz and moved to Tucumán , where he met his daughter Manuela Mónica , just one year old . The governor of Tucuman , Feliciano de la Motta , was deposed during his stay , and Belgrano was taken prisoner . Abraham González led the uprising and attempted to put Belgrano into a shrew 's fiddle , but Belgrano 's doctor Josef Redhead objected , because of his delicate health , and his sentence was changed to simple imprisonment . When Bernabé <unk> took control of the government of Tucumán , Belgrano was immediately released . 
 He returned to Buenos Aires , to his parent 's house . By that time the Battle of Cepeda had ended the authority of the Supreme Directors , starting the period known as Anarchy of the year 20 . On 20 June 1820 , at the age of 50 , Belgrano died of dropsy . Due to his poverty , as the war consumed all his old wealth , he paid his doctor with his clock and his carriage , some of the few possessions he still had . As requested , he was shrouded into the robes of the Dominican Order , and buried in the Santo Domingo convent . Before dying , Belgrano said " Ay , Patria <unk> " ( in Spanish , " Oh , my Fatherland " ) . 
 Due to the state of anarchy being experienced by the city , Belgrano 's death was largely unnoticed . The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El <unk> <unk> , written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda , and there was no government representation at his funeral . Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies , when the news started to be known . The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia , who was minister by then , organised a massive state funeral . 
 In 1902 , during the presidency of Julio Argentino Roca , Belgrano 's body was exhumed from the atrium of Santo Domingo , to be moved into a mausoleum . This was done on 4 September , by a government commission which included Dr. Joaquín V. González ( ministry of interior ) , Pablo Riccheri ( ministry of war ) , Gabriel L. <unk> ( president of the commission ) , Fray Modesto <unk> ( from the convent ) , Carlos Vega Belgrano and <unk> Manuel Belgrano ( descendants of Belgrano ) , Dr. Armando <unk> ( <unk> of the Interior ) , Dr. Marcial Quiroga ( Health Inspector of the Army ) , Dr. Carlos <unk> ( president of the National Department of Health ) , Coronel Justo Domínguez , and doctors Luis <unk> and C. Massot ( Arsenal of War ) . The exhumation revealed a number of preserved bones , pieces of wood , and nails . The bones were placed on a silver plate , and the following day there was a great controversy in the press : the newspaper La Prensa announced that Joaquín V. González and Riccheri had stolen a pair of teeth . Both were returned the following day . Gonzalez declared that he intended to show the tooth to his friends , and Riccheri that he took one to Belgrano 's biographer , Bartolomé Mitre . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Manuel Belgrano met María Josefa Ezcurra , sister of Encarnación Ezcurra , at the age of 22 . Her father , Juan Ignacio Ezcurra , did not approve of their relationship because of the bankruptcy of Domingo Belgrano , Manuel 's father . Juan Ignacio arranged the wedding of his daughter with Juan Esteban Ezcurra , a distant relative from Pamplona that worked selling clothes . Juan Ignacio opposed the May Revolution and returned to Spain , leaving his wife in Buenos Aires , which allowed her to return to her former relationship with Belgrano . 
 When Belgrano was dispatched to Upper Peru , María Josefa followed him to Jujuy . She took part in the Jujuy Exodus and saw the battle of Tucumán . It is thought that she was pregnant by this time . Her son , Pedro Pablo , was born on 30 July 1813 . Pedro Pablo was adopted by Encarnación Ezcurra and her husband , Juan Manuel de Rosas , who she had married shortly before . 
 Belgrano also met María Dolores <unk> in Tucumán , and briefly considered getting married , but the war forced a postponement . María Dolores married another man ; the relationship ended , but was briefly restarted in 1818 . While he was near the frontiers of Córdoba , Santa Fe , and Buenos Aires , and in a delicate state of health , he learned that María Dolores had given birth to his daughter , Manuela Mónica del Sagrado Corazón , who was born on 4 May 1819 . 
 Neither of these children were recognised by Belgrano in his will , where he said he had no children . However , it is thought that he did not mention them in order to protect their mothers , as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted . Nevertheless , he requested that his brother , Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano , who was appointed as his heir , should look after his newborn daughter . 
 = = = Diseases = = = 
 There are no records of diseases experienced by Belgrano during his youth or adolescence . His first illness dates from the time of his return to Buenos Aires , when he worked in the Consulate ; he experienced symptoms of syphilis caught during his stay in Spain . He was treated by the most prestigious physicians of the city : Miguel Gorman from the <unk> of Buenos Aires , Miguel García de Rojas , and José Ignacio de <unk> . This disease forced him to take long leaves from his work at the Consulate and take repose stays at Maldonado and San Isidro . He was treated with salts and <unk> , and his condition eventually improved . It is also suspected that he may have had rheumatism . By the year 1800 he had a growing lacrimal fistula in one of his eyes and was invited by the King to move to Spain for a cure . He was offered a one @-@ year leave with paid wages , but he rejected it , giving priority to his work for the nation over his own personal health . The fistula would later stabilise at a safe and unnoticeable size . 
 During his military career he had blood vomits , such as before the Battle of Salta ; he was almost too ill to participate in the battle . It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress , and not in the respiratory system , because the vomits were sporadic , the condition did not become chronic , and it eventually cured itself . Nothing was revealed in the autopsy . 
 Belgrano also experienced <unk> ( malaria ) during the second campaign to Upper Peru . On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease , which made it difficult for him to work or even talk . He was treated by doctor Joseph <unk> , who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant . The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain , when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone . 
 He also experienced stomach disease , having a low production of gastric acids . This was worsened by harsh military conditions , including long periods with little food . The first references to the disease that would lead to his death , a case of edema , are from a year before , in a letter directed to Álvarez Thomas . He declared having problems in the chest , a lung , and his right leg . A later letter to Sarratea confirmed his situation , and specified that it started on 23 April 1819 . The gravity of his condition led the doctor Francisco de Paula Rivero to diagnose an advanced dropsy . Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires , where he died . He was embalmed by Joseph Redhead and Juan Sullivan . Sullivan performed the autopsy ; it revealed high levels of fluid in multiple <unk> and a tumor in the right epigastrium . The liver and spleen had grown beyond normal levels , there were <unk> in the kidneys , and problems with the lungs and heart .

 Manuel Belgrano had a vast intellectual awareness of most important topics of his age . He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions , and was a versatile polyglot , capable of understanding Spanish , English , French , Italian , and some indigenous languages . This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment , and understand the social , economic , technical , educative , political , cultural , and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas . He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with his work in the Consulate . He rejected localist perspectives , favouring a Latin Americanist one . He was driven by the concept of the common good , which he regarded as an ethical value . He considered public health , education , and work as part of the common good , as well as religion . He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution , but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment : most notably , he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs , being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology . His monarchism was not a conservative one , as he agreed that the existing state of things should be modified , but not towards a republic as in France or the United States , but towards a constitutional monarchy , like in Britain . 
 In the economic fields , he was influenced by the principles of physiocracy , an economic doctrine that considered that nature was the source of wealth . As a result , much of his works and reform proposals at the Consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture , livestock , manufacturing , and free trade . He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities , developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole . This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely unpopulated areas of the territory ; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes . He introduced new crops , and promoted the use of local fauna for livestock production . He protected the weaving industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba , as he considered the local crop to be of similar quality to the cotton from Europe . 
 = = = Promotion of education = = = 
 Manuel Belgrano was one of the first politicians to advocate the development of an important educative system . He did so at the first report he made as head of the Consulate of Commerce , suggesting the creating of schools of agriculture and commerce . A school of agriculture would teach about important topics such as crop rotation , the specific ways to work with each crop , methods of seeding and harvesting , preservation of seeds , and identification of pests . Until that time , the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits , who were banished in 1767 . 
 He was not only concerned with higher education , but also with primary education , and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children . In those schools , students would learn to read and learn basic maths and the catechism . He thought that this would help to raise people willing to work , and reduce laziness . 
 He also promoted the creation of schools for women , where they would learn about weaving , as well as reading . However , he did not aim to generate intellectual women , but just to prevent ignorance and laziness , and have them learn things valuable for daily living . Being a strong Catholic himself , he was aligned with the Catholic perspective that rejected mixed @-@ sex education , in contrast with Protestantism . 
 His concern with public education was not interrupted by his military campaigns . In 1813 he was rewarded with 40 @,@ 000 pesos for his victories at Salta and Tucumán , an amount that would equal almost 80 gold kilograms . Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself , considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth . He gave it back to the XIII year Assembly , with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija , Jujuy , San Miguel de Tucumán , and Santiago del Estero . He laid out a series of instructions about the methods and requirements for the selection of the teachers . However , the schools were not built , and by 1823 Bernardino Rivadavia declared that the money was lost ; Juan Ramón Balcarce included it in the debt of the Buenos Aires province a decade later . 
 = = = Translations = = = 
 The historian Bartolomé Mitre stated that Manuel Belgrano held a deep admiration for George Washington , leader of the American Revolution and first President of the United States . Because of this , he worked on a translation of George Washington 's Farewell Address into the Spanish language . He started working on it during the Paraguay Campaign , but before the battle of Tacuarí he destroyed all his papers , including the unfinished translation , to prevent them from falling into enemy hands . Belgrano resumed work on it afterwards and finished it before the Battle of Salta . He sent it to Buenos Aires for publication . George Washington 's Farewell Address is considered , along with Gettysburg Address , one of the most important texts in the history of the United States . It talks about the importance of keeping national unity as the key to maintain independence , prosperity , and freedom — ideas that were shared by Belgrano regarding the population of Hispanic America . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Belgrano is considered one of the greatest heroes in Argentina 's history . A monument complex ( Monumento Nacional a la Bandera , National Flag Memorial ) was built in 1957 in honour of the flag , in Rosario . The Flag Memorial and the park that surround it are the seat of national celebrations every Flag Day , on 20 June , the anniversary of Belgrano 's death . Jujuy Province is declared the honorary capital of Argentina each 23 August since 2002 , in reference to the Jujuy Exodus . 
 The cruiser ARA General Belgrano , which was sunk during the Falklands War , was named after him , as was Puerto Belgrano , which is the largest base of the Argentinian navy . A small town in the province of Córdoba , Argentina , Villa General Belgrano , also bears his name , as well as many other small towns and departments . Avenida Belgrano in the City of Buenos Aires and part of the avenue that leads to the Flag Memorial in Rosario ( also Avenida Belgrano ) bear his name . Additionally , there is a northern neighbourhood within Buenos Aires city that carries the name Belgrano . 
 In the museum Casa de la Libertad at Sucre , Bolivia , there is an Argentine flag , protected by a glass case and in a deteriorated condition , which they claim to be the original one raised by Belgrano for first time in 1812 . The ensign was one of two abandoned and hidden inside a small church near Macha after the battle of Ayohuma , during the retreat from Upper Peru in 1813 . The other flag was given back to Argentina by the Bolivian authorities in 1896 . 
 In Genoa , Italy , there is a commemorative statue of Belgrano , at the end of the Corso Buenos Aires . 
 = = = Historiography = = = 
 The first biography of Manuel Belgrano was his autobiography , which he wrote by the time he was stationed in Lujan . It long remained unpublished . His first biography written by someone else was " <unk> <unk> del General Don Manuel Belgrano " ( Historical stub on General Don Manuel Belgrano ) , authored by José Ignacio Álvarez Thomas . Álvarez Thomas wrote it during his exile at Colonia del Sacramento , and his work had a high political bias . 
 The historian Bartolomé Mitre wrote Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina ( Spanish : History of Belgrano and of the Independence of Argentina ) , whose scope expanded on the simple biography of Belgrano himself , and detailed instead the Argentine War of Independence as a whole . The work followed the Great Man theory , linking the success in the war of independence to the figure of Belgrano and his natal Buenos Aires . This book included as well the autobiography of Belgrano , which was discovered by Mitre . The book was criticised by contemporary Argentine authors , such as <unk> Vélez Sarsfield and Juan Bautista Alberdi , born in other provinces , and Vicente Fidel López . Vélez Sarsfield dismissed the Great Man theory and maintained that the work of the other provinces for the Argentine independence was as important as that of Buenos Aires . He criticised the work of Mitre at " <unk> <unk> : General Belgrano , General Güemes " ( Historical rectifications : General Belgrano , General Güemes ) which dealt with Martín Miguel de Güemes as well , and Mitre would answer at " Estudios <unk> sobre la Revolución de Mayo : Belgrano y Güemes " ( Historical studies about the May Revolution : Belgrano and Güemes ) . Both books were written in 1864 . Vicente López provided a biography of Belgrano from a different angle , his book was " Debate <unk> , <unk> a las <unk> <unk> sobre la Historia de Belgrano " ( Historical debate , rebuttals to the historical <unk> about the history of Belgrano ) , and Mitre replied with " Nuevas <unk> sobre historia argentina " ( New <unk> about the history of Argentina ) . López considered history as an art form , and Mitre considered it a science , rejecting historical narrations that could not be backed by primary sources . These disputes about Belgrano are considered the starting point of the Historiography of Argentina . Historiographical studies of Manuel Belgrano are currently held by the <unk> National Institute .

 Belgrano appears on a number of currencies in the numismatic history of Argentina . He appeared for the first time on the banknotes of 1 , 5 , and 10 pesos according to the Peso Ley 18 @.@ 188 , in effect from 1970 to 1983 . He was later included on the 10 @,@ 000 pesos banknotes of the pesos <unk> , the highest banknote value in circulation . The Argentine austral had a number of political and military figures that did not include Belgrano , but later the 10 @,@ 000 pesos <unk> banknotes were allowed to be used as <unk> .

 At the age of 19 , Joseph dropped out of University after getting the part of Cassie <unk> in the soap opera Paradise Beach . Like many of the cast , she had no formal acting training , though she turned this to her advantage with " exuberance and energy " . Joseph gained acting experience and friendships with <unk> Hill , Megan Connolly , and Isla Fisher , though the series was cancelled after only 18 months . After Paradise Beach ended , she began appearing in the Nine Network variety show Hey Hey It 's Saturday . Joseph had no contract with Nine , and was making the appearances as a favor to her friend , host Daryl Somers . Nine Network executives wanted to make her a regular on the show and began using her in publicity material . However , rival network Seven offered her a contract to co @-@ host Gladiators before Nine could make her Hey Hey contract permanent . Her defection to Seven in 1995 caused a small scandal . She described hosting Gladiators as " tough and scary " on account of the live audience . She appeared for three seasons and some international specials before taking the role of Joanne Brennan in Home and Away in an effort to get away from presenting . The character , a secretary who dealt drugs to school children , appeared from 1995 to 1996 . She left the soap with the possibility of returning to the character later . Alongside her role in Home and Away , she appeared in a play with Geoffrey Hughes . 
 Until 1999 , she continued working as a " jobbing actress " , making appearances in Hercules : the Legendary Journeys and Sale of the Century , and Tales of the South Seas . Eager to move away from soap opera acting , Joseph moved to the United States to study acting with the Atlantic Theater Company in New York City . She then moved to Los Angeles , where she spent 18 months living off her savings trying to get auditions . In those 18 months , her only jobs were a single commercial and a job interviewing LA @-@ based film actors for Australian television . In 2001 , her lawyer informed her that she would have to travel to Sydney , Australia to be interviewed for her green card . On the day she was due to fly back to Australia , her agent informed her of an audition for the British television series Cold Feet , whose producer was looking for an Australian actress to become a new main cast member . Two weeks later she had moved to Manchester , England and was doing script read @-@ throughs with the rest of the cast . Her character , Jo Ellison , appeared in all episodes of the fourth and fifth series . Two days after filming the final episode in 2002 , Joseph left Britain and returned to Australia . 
 In 2004 , she appeared on Australian television for the first time since 1999 , playing Dr. Grace Connelly in six episodes of All Saints . The day after she completed filming of her scenes , she returned to Los Angeles for the pilot season . She got a small part as a flight attendant in the pilot episode of Lost . Joseph 's scenes , on an airplane set , were filmed over two and a half days in Los Angeles . An early script draft of the pilot called for her character to be seen dead on a beach , though subsequent rewrites removed the scene . A producer liked Joseph and her character , and planned to bring both back to the series at a later date . She returned at the beginning of the second season , when it was revealed that her character , given the name Cindy Chandler , had survived the plane crash in the pilot episode along with other passengers from the tail section of the plane . Despite being asked not to change her appearance too much after the pilot , Joseph had her hair cut , so in her first few episodes of the second season she had to " go through the whole debacle of putting a Rambo scarf around [ her ] head , which just looked ridiculous . " Her episodes for season two were filmed over five weeks and were broadcast in 2005 . Her character was abducted in the middle of an episode and was not seen again until in the third season , when Joseph reprised the role for two episodes and the whereabouts of her character are revealed . Joseph resumed the role for the sixth and final season in 2010 . 
 Joseph also filmed minor roles in two Ron Howard films ; in Frost / Nixon ( 2008 ) , she portrayed tennis champion <unk> Goolagong , and she had a minor role in Angels & Demons ( 2009 ) . Although of a different ethnicity to Goolagong , she was cast in Frost / Nixon because she had the " right look " . Both of her scenes were cut from the films before release . 
 Currently ( 2011 ) Joseph appears as the featured actress in television commercials for <unk> , the satellite @-@ based Internet Service Provider . 
 In 2013 , Joseph appeared in Linkin Park 's music video for their single Castle of Glass . Joseph played the bereaved wife of a deceased Navy SEAL .

 = Leona Woods = 
 Leona Harriet Woods ( August 9 , 1919 – November 10 , 1986 ) , later known as Leona Woods Marshall and Leona Woods Marshall Libby , was an American physicist who helped build the first nuclear reactor and the first atomic bomb . 
 At age 23 , she was the youngest and only female member of the team which built and experimented with the world 's first nuclear reactor ( then called a pile ) , Chicago Pile @-@ 1 , in a project led by her mentor Enrico Fermi . In particular , Woods was instrumental in the construction and then utilization of geiger counters for analysis during experimentation . She was the only woman present when the reactor went critical . She worked with Fermi on the Manhattan Project , and , together with her first husband John Marshall , she subsequently helped solve the problem of xenon poisoning at the Hanford plutonium production site , and supervised the construction and operation of Hanford 's plutonium production reactors . 
 After the war , she became a fellow at Fermi 's Institute for Nuclear Studies . She later worked at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton , New Jersey , the Brookhaven National Laboratory , and New York University , where she became a professor in 1962 . Her research involved high @-@ energy physics , astrophysics and cosmology . In 1966 she divorced Marshall and married Nobel laureate Willard Libby . She became a professor at the University of Colorado , and a staff member at RAND Corporation . In later life she became interested in ecological and environmental issues , and she devised a method of using the isotope ratios in tree rings to study climate change . She was a strong advocate of food irradiation as a means of killing harmful bacteria . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Leona Harriet Woods was born on a farm in La Grange , Illinois on August 9 , 1919 , the second of five children of <unk> Arno Woods , a lawyer , and his wife Mary Leona Holderness Woods . She had two sisters and two brothers . She graduated from Lyons Township High School in La Grange at 14 , and received her BS in chemistry from the University of Chicago in 1938 , at the age of 18 . 
 After passing her qualifying exams in chemistry , she approached the Nobel Prize for Physics laureate James Franck about being his graduate student , having been impressed by a talk he gave in 1939 on Brillouin zones . Franck accepted , but told her that when he was young his professor had warned him that as a Jewish academic , he would starve to death . Franck therefore warned Woods that " You are a woman and you will starve to death . " Despite the fact that Franck did not look malnourished , she took the warning seriously , and decided to instead become a graduate student of Robert Mulliken , who would one day become a Nobel laureate himself . 
 Mulliken allowed her to choose her own research problem , and edited the final version before it appeared in the Physical Review . Her doctoral thesis , " On the Silicon Oxide Bands " , prepared under the supervision of Mulliken and Polish chemist Stanisław <unk> was accepted in 1943 . Mulliken , she later recalled , had twice told her " that perhaps not all he taught me was wasted . " His students , she noted , " agree that this is his highest praise . " 
 = = Manhattan Project = = 
 By 1942 , when she was finishing writing up her thesis , she was the youngest and last of Mulliken 's pre @-@ war students , and was working alone because all her fellow students had become involved with war work . She met Herbert Anderson , who was working for Enrico Fermi . The two would go swimming together in Lake Michigan every afternoon at 5 pm . Anderson discovered that Woods was adept with vacuum technology from her research , and as soon as her PhD was finished , he hired her to work with the boron trifluoride detectors used to measure neutron flux . 
 Fermi 's group constructed a nuclear reactor known as Chicago Pile @-@ 1 under the stands of Stagg Field , the University 's abandoned football stadium , where Woods had once played squash . Walter Zinn did not want a woman involved in the dirty work of placing the graphite blocks , but Woods had plenty of work to do with the detectors and thermocouples , and used a small stack of graphite of her own to measure the effects of a radium @-@ beryllium source on manganese foil to obtain a measure of the neutron cross section in order to calibrate the detectors . Woods was the only woman present when the reactor went critical , asking Fermi " When do we become scared ? " 
 Laura Fermi remembered Woods as " a tall young girl built like an athlete , who could do a man 's job and do it well . She was the only woman physicist in Enrico 's group . At that time , her mother , who was also endowed with inexhaustible energy , was running a small farm near Chicago almost by herself . To relieve Mrs. Woods of some work , Leona divided her time between atoms and potatoes . " 
 Like many scientists working on the project , Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation . After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal , Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens , and her white blood cell count halved . The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells , a proposition that Woods was skeptical of . She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly . When the team moved to their new home at Argonne , Woods had a dormitory all to herself . 
 Woods married John Marshall in July 1943 . Soon after , she fell pregnant . While she told Enrico Fermi , they agreed not to let Walter Zinn know , for fear that he would insist that she leave the reactor building . She covered up her pregnant belly with her baggy denim work clothes . She rode to work each day on an unheated Army bus , " arriving each morning barely in time to vomit before starting the day 's work . " The child , a boy called Peter , was born in 1944 . She returned to work a few days later . 
 A team from Argonne was on hand for powering up the first reactor at the Hanford Site , where large reactors would produce plutonium for bombs . They watched the reactor in shifts , with John Marshall and others on the day shift , Enrico Fermi and Leona Marshall on the night shift , ending at midnight , and Don Hughes and John Wheeler on the swing shift . While the Marshalls were babysitting the reactor in Hanford , they left Peter with Leona 's mother . 
 The reactor was powered up successfully , but after a few hours the power level dropped and the reactor shut down . Leona speculated that a water leak was the problem , rather than a radioactive poison . However , during the night the operators were able to power the reactor up again only to have it once more die away . The timings now pointed to a radioactive poison . After working through the numbers with slide rules and hand calculators , they determined the Neutron cross section of the poison , which turned out to be xenon @-@ 135 . Fortunately , the DuPont engineers had equipped the reactor with 50 per cent more fuel tubes that the physicists had called for , and by loading them up , they managed to get the reactor started . 
 Asked many years later about how she felt about her involvement in the Manhattan Project , she said : 
 I think everyone was terrified that we were wrong ( in our way of developing the bomb ) and the Germans were ahead of us . That was a persistent and ever @-@ present fear , fed , of course , by the fact that our leaders knew those people in Germany . They went to school with them . Our leaders were terrified , and that terror fed to us . If the Germans had got it before we did , I don 't know what would have happened to the world . Something different . Germany led in the field of physics . In every respect , at the time war set in , when Hitler lowered the boom . It was a very frightening time . 
 I certainly do recall how I felt when the atomic bombs were used . My brother @-@ in @-@ law was captain of the first minesweeper scheduled into Sasebo Harbor . My brother was a Marine , with a flame thrower on Okinawa . I 'm sure these people would not have lasted in an invasion . It was pretty clear the war would continue , with half a million of our fighting men dead not to say how many Japanese . You know and I know that General ( Curtis ) LeMay firebombed Tokyo and nobody even mentions the slaughter that happened then . They think Nagasaki and Hiroshima were something compared to the firebombing . 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> ! 
 I have no regrets . I think we did right , and we couldn 't have done it differently . Yeah . I know it has been suggested the second bomb , Nagasaki , was not necessary . The guys who cry on shoulders , when you are in a war , to the death , I don 't think you stand around and ask , " Is it right ? "

 After the war , Leona Marshall returned to the University of Chicago , where she became a fellow at Fermi 's Institute for Nuclear Studies . Working with the Chicago Pile 3 heavy water reactor , she found a way to 100 percent spin polarize neutron beams , and determined the refractive index of neutrons for various materials . Her second child , John Marshall III , was born in 1949 . She became an assistant professor in 1953 . 
 After Fermi died in 1954 , the Marshalls separated . John Marshall returned to the Los Alamos Laboratory , while Leona , now effectively a single mother , became a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton , New Jersey in 1957 . The following year she became a fellow at the Brookhaven National Laboratory , at a time when the focus of research in physics was shifting away from the nucleus and towards elementary particles . In 1960 , she joined New York University as an associate professor of physics . She became a professor in 1962 . 
 Three years later , she became a professor at the University of Colorado , researching high @-@ energy physics , astrophysics and cosmology . She then became a staff member at RAND Corporation , where she worked until 1976 . In 1966 , she divorced John Marshall , and married Willard Libby , who had won the Nobel prize in 1960 . She later joined him at UCLA , where she became a visiting professor of environmental studies , engineering , engineering archaeology , mechanical aerospace and nuclear engineering in 1973 . 
 Now known as Leona Marshall Libby , she became interested in ecological and environmental issues , and she devised a method of using the isotope ratios of Oxygen @-@ 18 to Oxygen @-@ 16 , Carbon @-@ 13 to Carbon @-@ 12 , and Deuterium to Hydrogen in tree rings to study changes in temperature and rainfall patterns hundreds of years before records were kept , opening the door to the study of climate change . 
 Like Willard Libby , she was a strong advocate of food irradiation as a means of killing off harmful bacteria , and advocated that legal and regulatory restrictions on its use be relaxed . She proposed that , instead of it being sprayed with malathion , fruit affected by the Mediterranean fruit fly could be treated with gamma rays . 
 She was a prolific author , publishing over 200 scientific papers . While at RAND she wrote a paper on Creation of an Atmosphere for the Moon ( 1969 ) . Her works include the autobiographical The Uranium People ( 1979 ) , a history of early atomic research . After Libby died in 1980 , she edited his papers with Rainer Berger , and published The Life Work of Nobel Laureate Willard Libby ( 1982 ) . Her last paper , on quasi @-@ stellar objects , appeared in 1984 . 
 She died at St. John 's Medical Center in Santa Monica , California , on November 10 , 1986 , from an anesthesia @-@ induced stroke . She was survived by her sons Peter and John , and four grandchildren . She also had two stepdaughters , Janet Eva Libby and Susan Charlotte Libby from her second marriage .

 = Jehovah 's Witnesses = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with <unk> beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity . The group claims a worldwide membership of more than 8 @.@ 2 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance figures of more than 15 million , and an annual Memorial attendance of more than 19 @.@ 9 million . Jehovah 's Witnesses are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah 's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn , New York , which establishes all doctrines based on its interpretations of the Bible . They prefer to use their own translation , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , although their literature occasionally quotes and cites other translations . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent , and that the establishment of God 's kingdom over the earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity . 
 The group emerged from the Bible Student movement , founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell with the formation of Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society , with significant organizational and doctrinal changes under the leadership of Joseph Franklin Rutherford . The name Jehovah 's witnesses was adopted in 1931 to distinguish themselves from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell 's traditions . 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses are best known for their door @-@ to @-@ door preaching , distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake ! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship . They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be <unk> doctrines . They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity . Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as " the truth " and consider themselves to be " in the truth " . They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non @-@ Witnesses . Congregational disciplinary actions include <unk> , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned . <unk> and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant . 
 The religion 's position regarding conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute national flags has brought it into conflict with some governments . Consequently , some Jehovah 's Witnesses have been persecuted and their activities are banned or restricted in some countries . Persistent legal challenges by Jehovah 's Witnesses have influenced legislation related to civil rights in several countries . 
 The organization has attracted criticism over issues surrounding biblical translation , doctrines , handling of sexual abuse cases , and alleged coercion of its members . The claims are rejected by the religion 's leaders , and some have been disputed by courts and religious scholars .

 = = = Background ( 1870 – 1916 ) = = = 
 In 1870 , Charles Taze Russell and others formed a group in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to study the Bible . During the course of his ministry , Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul , hellfire , predestination , the fleshly return of Jesus Christ , the Trinity , and the burning up of the world . In 1876 , Russell met Nelson H. Barbour ; later that year they jointly produced the book Three Worlds , which combined <unk> views with end time prophecy . The book taught that God 's dealings with humanity were divided <unk> , each ending with a " harvest , " that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874 inaugurating the " harvest of the Gospel age , " and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520 @-@ year period called " the Gentile Times , " at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God 's kingdom on earth . Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal , Herald of the Morning . In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences , and in July , Russell began publishing the magazine Zion 's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ 's Presence , stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in " the last days , " and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent . 
 From 1879 , Watch Tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically . Thirty congregations were founded , and during 1879 and 1880 , Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings . As congregations continued to form during Russell 's ministry , they each remained self @-@ administrative , functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance . In 1881 , Zion 's Watch Tower Tract Society was presided over by William Henry Conley , and in 1884 , Charles Taze Russell incorporated the society as a non @-@ profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles . By about 1900 , Russell had organized thousands of <unk> and full @-@ time <unk> , and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices . By the 1910s , Russell 's organization maintained nearly a hundred " pilgrims , " or traveling preachers . Russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry , and by 1912 , he was the most distributed Christian author in the United States . 
 Russell moved the Watch Tower Society 's headquarters to Brooklyn , New York , in 1909 , combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship ; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named Bethel . He identified the religious movement as " Bible Students , " and more formally as the International Bible Students Association . By 1910 , about 50 @,@ 000 people worldwide were associated with the movement and congregations re @-@ elected him annually as their " pastor . " Russell died October 31 , 1916 , at the age of 64 while returning from a ministerial speaking tour . 
 = = = Reorganization ( 1917 – 1942 ) = = = 
 In January 1917 , the Watch Tower Society 's legal representative , Joseph Franklin Rutherford , was elected as its next president . His election was disputed , and members of the Board of Directors accused him of acting in an autocratic and secretive manner . The divisions between his supporters and opponents triggered a major turnover of members over the next decade . In June 1917 , he released The Finished Mystery as a seventh volume of Russell 's Studies in the Scriptures series . The book , published as the posthumous work of Russell , was a compilation of his commentaries on the Bible books of Ezekiel and Revelation , plus numerous additions by Bible Students Clayton Woodworth and George Fisher . It strongly criticized Catholic and Protestant clergy and Christian involvement in the Great War . As a result , Watch Tower Society directors were jailed for sedition under the Espionage Act in 1918 and members were subjected to mob violence ; the directors were released in March 1919 and charges against them were dropped in 1920 . 
 Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society . In 1919 , he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation , and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters . At an international convention held at Cedar Point , Ohio , in September 1922 , a new emphasis was made on house @-@ to @-@ house preaching . Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford 's twenty @-@ five years as president , including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs ( such as Abraham and Isaac ) would be resurrected in 1925 , marking the beginning of Christ 's thousand @-@ year Kingdom . Disappointed by the changes , tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford 's tenure , leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society , most of which still exist . By mid @-@ 1919 , as many as one in seven of Russell @-@ era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society , and as many as two @-@ thirds by the end of the 1920s . 
 On July 26 , 1931 , at a convention in Columbus , Ohio , Rutherford introduced the new name — Jehovah 's witnesses — based on Isaiah 43 : 10 : " Ye are my witnesses , saith Jehovah , and my servant whom I have chosen " — which was adopted by resolution . The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society , as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods . In 1932 , Rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938 , introduced what he called a " theocratic " ( literally , God @-@ ruled ) organizational system , under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the Brooklyn headquarters . 
 From 1932 , it was taught that the " little flock " of 144 @,@ 000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon . Rutherford explained that in addition to the 144 @,@ 000 " anointed " who would be resurrected — or transferred at death — to live in heaven to rule over earth with Christ , a separate class of members , the " great multitude , " would live in a paradise restored on earth ; from 1935 , new converts to the movement were considered part of that class . By the mid @-@ 1930s , the timing of the beginning of Christ 's presence ( Greek : <unk> ) , his enthronement as king , and the start of the " last days " were each moved to 1914 . 
 As their interpretations of the Bible developed , Witness publications decreed that saluting national flags is a form of idolatry , which led to a new outbreak of mob violence and government opposition in the United States , Canada , Germany , and other countries . 
 Worldwide membership of Jehovah 's Witnesses reached 113 @,@ 624 in 5 @,@ 323 congregations by the time of Rutherford 's death in January 1942 . 
 = = = Continued development ( 1942 – present ) = = = 
 Nathan Knorr was appointed as third president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942 . Knorr commissioned a new translation of the Bible , the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures , the full version of which was released in 1961 . He organized large international assemblies , instituted new training programs for members , and expanded missionary activity and branch offices throughout the world . Knorr 's presidency was also marked by an increasing use of explicit instructions guiding Witnesses in their lifestyle and conduct , and a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code . 
 From 1966 , Witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that Christ 's thousand @-@ year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . The number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59 @,@ 000 in 1966 to more than 297 @,@ 000 in 1974 . By 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . Membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . Watch Tower Society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year . 
 The offices of elder and ministerial servant were restored to Witness congregations in 1972 , with appointments made from headquarters ( and later , also by branch committees ) . It was announced that , starting in September 2014 , appointments would be made by traveling overseers . In a major organizational overhaul in 1976 , the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished , with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body . Since Knorr 's death in 1977 , the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz ( 1977 – 1992 ) and Milton Henschel ( 1992 – 2000 ) , both members of the Governing Body , and since 2000 by Don A. Adams , not a member of the Governing Body . In 1995 , Jehovah 's Witnesses abandoned the idea that Armageddon must occur during the lives of the generation that was alive in 1914 and in 2013 changed their teaching on the " generation " . 
 = = Organization = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses are organized hierarchically , in what the leadership calls a " theocratic organization " , reflecting their belief that it is God 's " visible organization " on earth . The organization is led by the Governing Body — an all @-@ male group that varies in size , but since early 2014 has comprised seven members , all of whom profess to be of the " anointed " class with a hope of heavenly life — based in the Watch Tower Society 's Brooklyn headquarters . There is no election for membership ; new members are selected by the existing body . Until late 2012 , the Governing Body described itself as the representative and " spokesman " for God 's " faithful and discreet slave class " ( approximately 10 @,@ 000 self @-@ professed " anointed " Jehovah 's Witnesses ) . At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society , the " faithful and discreet slave " was defined as referring to the Governing Body only . The Governing Body directs several committees that are responsible for administrative functions , including publishing , assembly programs and evangelizing activities . It appoints all branch committee members and traveling overseers , after they have been recommended by local branches , with traveling overseers supervising circuits of congregations within their jurisdictions . Traveling overseers appoint local elders and ministerial servants , and while branch offices may appoint regional committees for matters such as Kingdom Hall construction or disaster relief . 
 Each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants . Elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance , setting meeting times , selecting speakers and conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and creating " judicial committees " to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches . New elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders . Ministerial servants — appointed in a similar manner to elders — fulfill clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings . Witnesses do not use elder as a title to signify a formal clergy @-@ laity division , though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege such as confession of sins . 
 Baptism is a requirement for being considered a member of Jehovah 's Witnesses . Jehovah 's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism , and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid . Individuals undergoing baptism must affirm publicly that dedication and baptism identify them " as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses in association with God 's spirit @-@ directed organization , " though Witness publications say baptism symbolizes personal dedication to God and not " to a man , work or organization . " Their literature emphasizes the need for members to be obedient and loyal to Jehovah and to " his organization , " stating that individuals must remain part of it to receive God 's favor and to survive Armageddon . 
 = = = Publishing = = = 
 The organization publishes a significant amount of literature as part of its evangelism activities . The Watch Tower Society has produced over 200 million copies of the Bible in whole or part in over 120 languages . The Watchtower and Awake ! are the most widely distributed magazines in the world . Translation of Witness publications is done by over 2000 volunteers worldwide , producing literature in over 760 languages . 
 = = = Funding = = = 
 Much of their funding is provided by donations , primarily from members . There is no tithing or collection . In 2001 Newsday listed the Watch Tower Society as one of New York 's forty richest corporations , with revenues exceeding $ 950 million . The organization reported for the same year that it " spent over 70 @.@ 9 million dollars in caring for special pioneers , missionaries , and traveling overseers in their field service assignments . " 
 = = Beliefs = = 
 = = = Jehovah and Jesus Christ = = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses emphasize use of the name Jehovah — a representation of God 's name based on the Tetragrammaton . They believe that Jehovah is the only true God , the creator of all things , and the " Universal Sovereign " . They believe that all worship should be directed toward him , and that he is not part of a Trinity ; consequently , the religion places more emphasis on God than on Christ . They believe that the holy spirit is God 's applied power or " active force " , rather than a person . 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus is God 's only direct creation , that everything else was created by means of Christ , and that the initial unassisted act of creation uniquely identifies Jesus as God 's " only @-@ begotten Son " . Jesus served as a redeemer and a ransom sacrifice to pay for the sins of humanity . They believe Jesus died on a single upright post rather than the traditional cross . They believe that references in the Bible to the Archangel Michael , Abaddon ( <unk> ) , and the Word all refer to Jesus . Jesus is considered to be the only intercessor and high priest between God and humanity , and appointed by God as the king and judge of his kingdom . His role as a mediator ( referred to in 1 Timothy 2 : 5 ) is applied to the ' anointed ' class , though the ' other sheep ' are said to also benefit from the arrangement . 
 = = = Satan = = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Satan was originally a perfect angel who developed feelings of self @-@ importance and craved worship . Satan influenced Adam and Eve to disobey God , and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of Jehovah and Satan to universal sovereignty . Other angels who sided with Satan became demons . 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses teach that Satan and his demons were cast down to earth from heaven after October 1 , 1914 , at which point the end times began . Witnesses believe that Satan is the ruler of the current world order , that human society is influenced and misled by Satan and his demons , and that they are a cause of human suffering . They also believe that human governments are controlled by Satan , but that he does not directly control each human ruler . 
 = = = Life after death = = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses believe death is a state of non @-@ existence with no consciousness . There is no Hell of fiery torment ; Hades and <unk> are understood to refer to the condition of death , termed the common grave . Jehovah 's Witnesses consider the soul to be a life or a living body that can die . Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that humanity is in a sinful state , from which release is only possible by means of Jesus ' shed blood as a ransom , or atonement , for the sins of humankind . 
 Witnesses believe that a " little flock " go to heaven , but that the hope for life after death for the majority of " other sheep " involves being resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon . They interpret Revelation 14 : 1 – 5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144 @,@ 000 , who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth . They believe that baptism as one of Jehovah 's Witnesses is vital for salvation and that only they meet scriptural requirements for surviving Armageddon , but that God is the final judge . During Christ 's millennial reign , most people who died prior to Armageddon will be resurrected with the prospect of living forever ; they will be taught the proper way to worship God to prepare them for their final test at the end of the millennium . 
 = = = God 's kingdom = = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that God 's kingdom is a literal government in heaven , ruled by Jesus Christ and 144 @,@ 000 " spirit @-@ anointed " Christians drawn from the earth , which they associate with Jesus ' reference to a " new covenant " . The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth , transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death . It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus ' ministry on earth . They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914 , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 A central teaching of Jehovah 's Witnesses is that the current world era , or " system of things " , entered the " last days " in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ , leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably . They consider all other present @-@ day religions to be false , identifying them with " Babylon the Great " , or the " harlot " , of Revelation 17 , and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the United Nations , which they believe is represented in scripture by the scarlet @-@ colored wild beast of Revelation chapter 17 . This development will mark the beginning of the " great tribulation " . Satan will subsequently attack Jehovah 's Witnesses , an action that will prompt God to begin the war of Armageddon , during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ 's " sheep " , or true followers , will be destroyed . After Armageddon , God will extend his heavenly kingdom to include earth , which will be transformed into a paradise similar to the Garden of Eden . Most of those who had died before God 's intervention will gradually be resurrected during " judgment day " lasting for one thousand years . This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds . At the end of the thousand years , Christ will hand all authority back to God . Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind . Those who fail will be destroyed , along with Satan and his demons . The end result will be a fully tested , glorified human race . 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God 's kingdom in October 1914 , and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . They believe that Jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word <unk> — usually translated as " coming " when referring to Christ — as " presence " . They believe Jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the " second coming " of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .

 = = = Worship = = = 
 Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls , which are typically functional in character , and do not contain religious symbols . Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose " territory " they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as " meetings " as scheduled by congregation elders . The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible . The format of the meetings is established by the religion 's headquarters , and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide . Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , typically gathering mid @-@ week ( three meetings ) and on the weekend ( two meetings ) . Prior to 2009 , congregations met three times each week ; these meetings were condensed , with the intention that members dedicate an evening for " family worship " . Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs ( hymns ) and brief prayers . Twice each year , Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a " circuit " gather for a one @-@ day assembly . Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three @-@ day " regional convention " , usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums . Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the " Lord 's Evening Meal " , or " Memorial of Christ 's Death " on the date of the Jewish Passover . 
 = = = Evangelism = = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs , most notably by visiting people from house to house , distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages . The objective is to start a regular " Bible study " with any person who is not already a member , with the intention that the student be baptized as a member of the group ; Witnesses are advised to consider discontinuing Bible studies with students who show no interest in becoming members . Witnesses are taught they are under a biblical command to engage in public preaching . They are instructed to devote as much time as possible to their ministry and are required to submit an individual monthly " Field Service Report " . Baptized members who fail to report a month of preaching are termed " irregular " and may be counseled by elders ; those who do not submit reports for six consecutive months are termed " inactive " . 
 = = = Ethics and morality = = = 
 All sexual relations outside of marriage are grounds for expulsion if the individual is not deemed repentant ; homosexual activity is considered a serious sin , and same @-@ sex marriages are forbidden . Abortion is considered murder . Suicide is considered to be " self @-@ murder " and a sin against God . Modesty in dress and grooming is frequently emphasized . Gambling , drunkenness , illegal drugs , and tobacco use are forbidden . Drinking of alcoholic beverages is permitted in moderation . 
 The family structure is patriarchal . The husband is considered to have authority on family decisions , but is encouraged to solicit his wife 's thoughts and feelings , as well as those of his children . Marriages are required to be monogamous and legally registered . Marrying a non @-@ believer , or endorsing such a union , is strongly discouraged and carries religious sanctions . 
 Divorce is discouraged , and remarriage is forbidden unless a divorce is obtained on the grounds of adultery , which they refer to as " a scriptural divorce " . If a divorce is obtained for any other reason , remarriage is considered adulterous unless the prior spouse has died or is since considered to have committed sexual immorality . Extreme physical abuse , willful non @-@ support of one 's family , and what the religion terms " absolute endangerment of spirituality " are considered grounds for legal separation . 
 = = = Disciplinary action = = = 
 Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders . When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin — usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah 's Witness doctrines — a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt , provide help and possibly administer discipline . <unk> , a form of shunning , is the strongest form of discipline , administered to an offender deemed unrepentant . Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home , and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement ; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged . Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that " losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [ the shunned individual ] to come ' to his senses , ' see the seriousness of his wrong , and take steps to return to Jehovah . " The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior . Members who disassociate ( formally resign ) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned . Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the <unk> was enforced . Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin ; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service , but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship . Marking , a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship , is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin .

 Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions , on the basis that there can only be one truth from God , and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements . They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity , and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed . Jehovah 's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain " separate from the world . " The Witnesses ' literature defines the " world " as " the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah 's approved servants " and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan . Witnesses are taught that association with " worldly " people presents a " danger " to their faith , and are instructed to minimize social contact with non @-@ members to better maintain their own standards of morality . 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses believe their highest allegiance belongs to God 's kingdom , which is viewed as an actual government in heaven , with Christ as king . They remain politically neutral , do not seek public office , and are discouraged from voting , though individual members may participate in uncontroversial community improvement issues . Although they do not take part in politics , they respect the authority of the governments under which they live . They do not celebrate religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter , nor do they observe birthdays , nationalistic holidays , or other celebrations they consider to honor people other than Jesus . They feel that these and many other customs have pagan origins or reflect a nationalistic or political spirit . Their position is that these traditional holidays reflect Satan 's control over the world . Witnesses are told that spontaneous giving at other times can help their children to not feel deprived of birthdays or other celebrations . 
 They do not work in industries associated with the military , do not serve in the armed services , and refuse national military service , which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment . They do not salute or pledge allegiance to flags or sing national anthems or patriotic songs . Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as a worldwide brotherhood that transcends national boundaries and ethnic loyalties . Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested the religion 's intellectual and organizational isolation , coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents , rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution , has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message . 
 = = = Rejection of blood transfusions = = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions , which they consider a violation of God 's law based on their interpretation of Acts 15 : 28 , 29 and other scriptures . Since 1961 the willing acceptance of a blood transfusion by an unrepentant member has been grounds for expulsion from the religion . Members are directed to refuse blood transfusions , even in " a life @-@ or @-@ death situation " . Jehovah 's Witnesses accept non @-@ blood alternatives and other medical procedures in lieu of blood transfusions , and their literature provides information about non @-@ blood medical procedures . 
 Though Jehovah 's Witnesses do not accept blood transfusions of whole blood , they may accept some blood plasma fractions at their own discretion . The Watch Tower Society provides pre @-@ formatted durable power of attorney documents prohibiting major blood components , in which members can specify which allowable fractions and treatments they will personally accept . Jehovah 's Witnesses have established Hospital Liaison Committees as a cooperative arrangement between individual Jehovah 's Witnesses and medical professionals and hospitals . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses have an active presence in most countries , but do not form a large part of the population of any country . 
 As of August 2015 , Jehovah 's Witnesses report an average of 8 @.@ 2 million publishers — the term they use for members actively involved in preaching — in 118 @,@ 016 congregations . In 2015 , these reports indicated over 1 @.@ 93 billion hours spent in preaching and " Bible study " activity . Since the mid @-@ 1990s , the number of peak publishers has increased from 4 @.@ 5 million to 8 @.@ 2 million . In the same year , they conducted " Bible studies " with over 9 @.@ 7 million individuals , including those conducted by Witness parents with their children . Jehovah 's Witnesses estimate their current worldwide growth rate to be 1 @.@ 5 % per year . 
 The official published membership statistics , such as those mentioned above , include only those who submit reports for their personal ministry ; official statistics do not include inactive and disfellowshipped individuals or others who might attend their meetings . As a result , only about half of those who self @-@ identified as Jehovah 's Witnesses in independent demographic studies are considered active by the faith itself . The 2008 US Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life survey found a low retention rate among members of the religion : about 37 % of people raised in the religion continued to identify themselves as Jehovah 's Witnesses . 
 = = Sociological analysis = = 
 Sociologist James A. Beckford , in his 1975 study of Jehovah 's Witnesses , classified the religion 's organizational structure as <unk> , characterized by an assertive leadership , specific and narrow objectives , control over competing demands on members ' time and energy , and control over the quality of new members . Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities , reluctance to co @-@ operate with other religious organizations , a high rate of membership turnover , a low rate of doctrinal change , and strict uniformity of beliefs among members . Beckford identified the religion 's chief characteristics as historicism ( identifying historical events as relating to the <unk> of God 's purpose ) , absolutism ( conviction that Jehovah 's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth ) , activism ( capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks ) , rationalism ( conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery ) , authoritarianism ( rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism ) and world indifference ( rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments ) . 
 Sociologist Bryan R. Wilson , in his consideration of five religions including Jehovah 's Witnesses , noted that each of the religions : 
 " exists in a state of tension with the wider society ; " 
 " imposes tests of merit on would @-@ be members ; " 
 " exercises stern discipline , regulating the declared beliefs and the life habits of members and prescribing and operating sanctions for those who deviate , including the possibility of expulsion ; " 
 " demands sustained and total commitment from its members , and the subordination , and perhaps even the exclusion of all other interests . " 
 A sociological comparative study by the Pew Research Center found that Jehovah 's Witnesses in the United States ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation , belief in God , importance of religion in one 's life , frequency of religious attendance , frequency of prayers , frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services , belief their prayers are answered , belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way , belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life , opposition to abortion , and opposition to homosexuality . In the study , Jehovah 's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having earned a graduate degree and interest in politics . 
 = = Opposition = = 
 Controversy surrounding various beliefs , doctrines and practices of Jehovah 's Witnesses has led to opposition from local governments , communities , and religious groups . Religious commentator Ken <unk> wrote that " Viewed globally , this persecution has been so persistent and of such intensity that it would not be inaccurate to regard Jehovah 's Witnesses as the most persecuted group of Christians of the twentieth century . " 
 = = = Persecution = = = 
 Political and religious animosity against Jehovah 's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries . Their doctrine of political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory . In 1933 , there were approximately 20 @,@ 000 Jehovah 's Witnesses in Germany , of whom about 10 @,@ 000 were later imprisoned . Of those , 2000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps , where they were identified by purple triangles ; as many as 1200 died , including 250 who were executed . In Canada , Jehovah 's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent . In the former Soviet Union , about 9 @,@ 300 Jehovah 's Witnesses were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951 . Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries , including China , Vietnam and some Islamic states . 
 Authors including William Whalen , Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses Barbara <unk> Harrison , Alan Rogerson and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religions by Jehovah ’ s Witnesses . Whalen , Harrison and Schnell have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society , and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God . Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed that Witnesses should " never seek a controversy " nor resist arrest , but also advised members not to co @-@ operate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching , and to prefer jail rather than pay fines . 
 = = = Legal challenges = = = 
 Several cases involving Jehovah 's Witnesses have been heard by Supreme Courts throughout the world . The cases generally relate to their right to practice their religion , displays of patriotism and military service , and blood transfusions . 
 In the United States , their persistent legal challenges prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties . Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference , the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service , the right of patients to refuse medical treatment , and the right to engage in public discourse . Similar cases in their favor have been heard in Canada . 
 = = Criticism and controversy = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses have attracted criticism over issues surrounding their Bible translation , doctrines , their handling of sexual abuse cases , and alleged coercion of members . Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah 's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by religious scholars . 
 = = = Free speech and thought = = = 
 Doctrines of Jehovah 's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body . The religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " God 's organization " . It also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by Satan the Devil " and would " cause division " . Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " . 
 Former members Heather and Gary Botting compare the cultural paradigms of the religion to George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty @-@ four , and Alan Rogerson describes the religion 's leadership as totalitarian . Other critics charge that by disparaging individual decision @-@ making , the religion 's leaders cultivate a system of unquestioning obedience in which Witnesses abrogate all responsibility and rights over their personal lives . Critics also accuse the religion 's leaders of exercising " intellectual dominance " over Witnesses , controlling information and creating " mental isolation " , which former Governing Body member Raymond Franz argued were all elements of mind control . 
 Jehovah 's Witness publications state that consensus of faith aids unity , and deny that unity restricts individuality or imagination . Historian James Irvin <unk> has rejected the description of the religion as " totalitarian " . 
 Sociologist Rodney Stark states that Jehovah 's Witness leaders are " not always very democratic " and that members " are expected to conform to rather strict standards , " but adds that " enforcement tends to be very informal , sustained by the close bonds of friendship within the group " , and that Jehovah 's Witnesses see themselves as " part of the power structure rather than subject to it . " Sociologist Andrew Holden states that most members who join millenarian movements such as Jehovah 's Witnesses have made an informed choice . However , he also states that defectors " are seldom allowed a dignified exit " , and describes the administration as autocratic . 
 = = = New World Translation = = = 
 Some Bible scholars including Bruce M. Metzger , former Professor and Bible editor at Princeton Theological Seminary , have said that the translation of certain texts in its New World Translation of the Bible is biased in favor of Witness practices and doctrines . The Bible editor Harold H. Rowley criticized the pre @-@ release edition of the first volume ( Genesis to Ruth ) published in 1953 as " a shining example of how the Bible should not be translated . " 
 On the other hand , in his study on nine of " the Bibles most widely in use in the English @-@ speaking world " , Bible scholar Jason <unk> , Professor of Religious Studies at the Northern Arizona University , wrote : “ The NW [ New World Translation ] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared . ” Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the New World Translation are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators , <unk> stated : “ Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal , conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers . ” He added however that the insertion of the name Jehovah in the New Testament " violate [ s ] accuracy in favor of denominationally preferred expressions for God " . 
 = = = Failed predictions = = = 
 Watch Tower Society publications have claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses ( and formerly , the International Bible Students ) to declare his will and has provided advance knowledge about Armageddon and the establishment of God 's kingdom . Some publications also claimed that God has used Jehovah 's Witnesses and the International Bible Students as a modern @-@ day prophet . Jehovah 's Witnesses ' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible . Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines . Some failed predictions had been presented as " beyond doubt " or " approved by God " . 
 The Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet , stating that its teachings are not inspired or infallible , and that it has not claimed its predictions were " the words of Jehovah . " George D. Chryssides has suggested that with the exception of statements about 1914 , 1925 and 1975 , the changing views and dates of the Jehovah 's Witnesses are largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions . Chryssides further states , " it is therefore simplistic and naïve to view the Witnesses as a group that continues to set a single end @-@ date that fails and then devise a new one , as many counter @-@ cultists do . " However , sociologist Andrew Holden states that since the foundation of the movement around 140 years ago , " Witnesses have maintained that we are living on the precipice of the end of time . " 
 = = = Handling of sexual abuse cases = = = 
 Jehovah 's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization . The religion has been criticized for its " two witness rule " for church discipline , based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19 : 15 and Matthew 18 : 15 @-@ 17 , which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing . In cases where corroboration is lacking , the Watch Tower Society 's instruction is that " the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah 's hands " . A former member of the church ’ s headquarters staff , Barbara Anderson , says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation , " which is an impossibility " . Anderson says the policies " protect pedophiles rather than protect the children . " Jehovah 's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children , adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents ; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents . 
 The religion 's failure to report abuse allegations to authorities has also been criticized . The Watch Tower Society 's policy is that elders inform authorities when required by law to do so , but otherwise leave that action up to the victim and his or her family . The Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that of 1006 alleged perpetrators of child sexual abuse identified by the Jehovah 's Witnesses within their organization since 1950 , " not one was reported by the church to secular authorities . " William Bowen , a former Jehovah 's Witness elder who established the <unk> organization to assist sex abuse victims within the religion , has claimed Witness leaders discourage followers from reporting incidents of sexual misconduct to authorities , and other critics claim the organization is reluctant to alert authorities in order to protect its " crime @-@ free " reputation . In court cases in the United Kingdom and the United States the Watch Tower Society has been found to have been negligent in its failure to protect children from known sex offenders within the congregation and the Society has settled other child abuse lawsuits out of court , reportedly paying as much as $ 780 @,@ 000 to one plaintiff without admitting wrongdoing .

 M @-@ 203 was first designated as a spur route from Hancock north to the state park in 1933 . It was later cancelled as a state highway in 1939 . This cancellation was reversed in late 1940 . At this time , the M @-@ 203 designation was extended from McLain State Park north ( on what was Houghton Co . Rd . 566 ) to Calumet . A construction project rerouted the roadway near the state park in 1963 . The highway 's routing was moved out of the park proper , bypassing it to the east .

 = First Amendment to the United States Constitution = 
 The First Amendment ( Amendment I ) to the United States Constitution prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion , impeding the free exercise of religion , abridging the freedom of speech , infringing on the freedom of the press , interfering with the right to peaceably assemble , or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances . It was adopted on December 15 , 1791 , as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights . 
 The Bill of Rights was originally proposed as a measure to assuage Anti @-@ Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification . Initially , the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress , and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today . Beginning with Gitlow v. New York ( 1925 ) , the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states — a process known as incorporation — through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . 
 In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , the Court drew on Thomas Jefferson 's correspondence to call for " a wall of separation between church and State " , though the precise boundary of this separation remains in dispute . Speech rights were expanded significantly in a series of 20th and 21st @-@ century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech , anonymous speech , campaign financing , pornography , and school speech ; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections . The Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the burden of proof for defamation and libel suits , most notably in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) . Commercial speech , however , is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech , and is therefore subject to greater regulation . 
 The Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions , and applies to a wide variety of media . In Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) and New York Times v. United States ( 1971 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint — pre @-@ publication censorship — in almost all cases . The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action . In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause , the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association .

 The amendment as adopted in 1791 reads as follows : 
 Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .

 In 1776 , the second year of the American Revolutionary War , the Virginia colonial legislature passed a Declaration of Rights that included the sentence " The freedom of the press is one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty , and can never be restrained but by despotic Governments . " Eight of the other thirteen states made similar pledges . However , these declarations were generally considered " mere admonitions to state legislatures " , rather than enforceable provisions . 
 After several years of comparatively weak government under the Articles of Confederation , a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17 , 1787 , featuring among other changes a stronger chief executive . George Mason , a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia 's Declaration of Rights , proposed that the Constitution include a bill of rights listing and guaranteeing civil liberties . Other delegates — including future Bill of Rights drafter James Madison — disagreed , arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other , unnamed rights were unprotected . After a brief debate , Mason 's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations . 
 For the constitution to be ratified , however , nine of the thirteen states were required to approve it in state conventions . Opposition to ratification ( " Anti @-@ Federalism " ) was partly based on the Constitution 's lack of adequate guarantees for civil liberties . Supporters of the Constitution in states where popular sentiment was against ratification ( including Virginia , Massachusetts , and New York ) successfully proposed that their state conventions both ratify the Constitution and call for the addition of a bill of rights . The U.S. Constitution was eventually ratified by all thirteen states . In the 1st United States Congress , following the state legislatures ' request , James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments , and his proposed draft of the First Amendment read as follows : 
 The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship , nor shall any national religion be established , nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner , or on any pretext , infringed . The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak , to write , or to publish their sentiments ; and the freedom of the press , as one of the great bulwarks of liberty , shall be inviolable . The people shall not be restrained from peaceably assembling and consulting for their common good ; nor from applying to the Legislature by petitions , or remonstrances , for redress of their grievances . 
 This language was greatly condensed by Congress , and passed the House and Senate with almost no recorded debate , complicating future discussion of the Amendment 's intent . The First Amendment , along with the rest of the Bill of Rights , was submitted to the states for ratification on September 25 , 1789 , and adopted on December 15 , 1791 .

 Thomas Jefferson wrote with respect to the First Amendment and its restriction on the legislative branch of the federal government in an 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptists ( a religious minority concerned about the dominant position of the Congregationalist church in Connecticut ) : 
 Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God , that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship , that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only , & not opinions , I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should " make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof " , thus building a wall of separation between Church & State . Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience , I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights , convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties . 
 In Reynolds v. United States ( 1878 ) the Supreme Court used these words to declare that " it may be accepted almost as an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment thus secured . Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere [ religious ] opinion , but was left free to reach [ only those religious ] actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order . " Quoting from Jefferson 's Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom the court stated further in Reynolds : 
 In the preamble of this act [ . . . ] religious freedom is defined ; and after a recital ' that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion , and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency , is a dangerous fallacy which at once destroys all religious liberty ' , it is declared ' that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to interfere [ only ] when [ religious ] principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order . ' In these two sentences is found the true distinction between what properly belongs to the church and what to the State . 
 Originally , the First Amendment applied only to the federal government , and some states continued official state religions after ratification . Massachusetts , for example , was officially Congregationalist until the 1830s . In Everson v. Board of Education ( 1947 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court incorporated the Establishment Clause ( i.e. , made it apply against the states ) : 
 The " establishment of religion " clause of the First Amendment means at least this : Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church . Neither can pass laws which aid one religion , aid all religions , or prefer one religion to another . . . in the words of Jefferson , the [ First Amendment ] clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect ' a wall of separation between church and State ' . . . That wall must be kept high and impregnable . We could not approve the slightest breach . 
 In Torcaso v. Watkins ( 1961 ) , the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits states and the federal government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office . In the Board of Education of <unk> Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) , The Court concluded that " government should not prefer one religion to another , or religion to irreligion . " In a series of cases in the first decade of the 2000s — Van Orden v. Perry ( 2005 ) , McCreary County v. ACLU ( 2005 ) , and Salazar v. Buono ( 2010 ) — the Court considered the issue of religious monuments on federal lands without reaching a majority reasoning on the subject .

 Everson used the metaphor of a wall of separation between church and state , derived from the correspondence of President Thomas Jefferson . It had been long established in the decisions of the Supreme Court , beginning with Reynolds v. United States in 1879 , when the Court reviewed the history of the early Republic in deciding the extent of the liberties of Mormons . Chief Justice Morrison Waite , who consulted the historian George Bancroft , also discussed at some length the Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments by James Madison , who drafted the First Amendment ; Madison used the metaphor of a " great barrier " . 
 In Everson , the Court adopted Jefferson 's words . The Court has affirmed it often , with majority , but not unanimous , support . Warren Nord , in Does God Make a Difference ? , characterized the general tendency of the dissents as a weaker reading of the First Amendment ; the dissents tend to be " less concerned about the dangers of establishment and less concerned to protect free exercise rights , particularly of religious minorities . " 
 Beginning with Everson , which permitted New Jersey school boards to pay for transportation to parochial schools , the Court has used various tests to determine when the wall of separation has been breached . Everson laid down the test that establishment existed when aid was given to religion , but that the transportation was justifiable because the benefit to the children was more important . In the school prayer cases of the early 1960s , ( Engel v. Vitale and Abington School District v. <unk> ) , aid seemed irrelevant ; the Court ruled on the basis that a legitimate action both served a secular purpose and did not primarily assist religion . In Walz v. Tax Commission ( 1970 ) , the Court ruled that a legitimate action could not entangle government with religion ; in Lemon v. Kurtzman ( 1971 ) , these points were combined into the Lemon test , declaring that an action was an establishment if : 
 the statute ( or practice ) lacked a secular purpose ; 
 its principal or primary effect advanced or inhibited religion ; or 
 it fostered an excessive government entanglement with religion . 
 The Lemon test has been criticized by justices and legal scholars , but it remains the predominant means by which the Court enforces the Establishment Clause . In Agostini v. Felton ( 1997 ) , the entanglement prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice . In Zelman v. Simmons @-@ Harris ( 2002 ) , the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect ; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test . Further tests , such as the endorsement test and coercion test , have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause . 
 In Lemon the Court stated that that the separation of church and state could never be absolute : " Our prior holdings do not call for total separation between church and state ; total separation is not possible in an absolute sense . Some relationship between government and religious organizations is inevitable " , the court wrote . " Judicial caveats against entanglement must recognize that the line of separation , far from being a ' wall ' , is a blurred , indistinct , and variable barrier depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship . "

 <unk> , in contrast , argue along with Justice William O. Douglas that " [ w ] e are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being " . This group holds that the Lemon test should be applied selectively . As such , for many conservatives , the Establishment Clause solely prevents the establishment of a state church , not public acknowledgements of God nor " developing policies that encourage general religious beliefs that do not favor a particular sect and are consistent with the secular government 's goals . " 
 = = Free exercise of religion = = 
 " Freedom of religion means freedom to hold an opinion or belief , but not to take action in violation of social duties or subversive to good order . " In Reynolds v. United States ( 1878 ) , the Supreme Court found that while laws cannot interfere with religious belief and opinions , laws can be made to regulate some religious practices ( e.g. , human sacrifices , and the Hindu practice of <unk> ) . The Court stated that to rule otherwise , " would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land , and in effect permit every citizen to become a law unto himself . Government would exist only in name under such circumstances . " In Cantwell v. Connecticut ( 1940 ) , the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Free Exercise Clause to the states . While the right to have religious beliefs is absolute , the freedom to act on such beliefs is not absolute . 
 In Sherbert v. Verner ( 1963 ) , the Supreme Court required states to meet the " strict scrutiny " standard when refusing to accommodate religiously motivated conduct . This meant that a government needed to have a " compelling interest " regarding such a refusal . The case involved Adele Sherbert , who was denied unemployment benefits by South Carolina because she refused to work on Saturdays , something forbidden by her Seventh @-@ day Adventist faith . In Wisconsin v. Yoder ( 1972 ) , the Court ruled that a law that " unduly burdens the practice of religion " without a compelling interest , even though it might be " neutral on its face " , would be unconstitutional . 
 The need for a compelling governmental interest was narrowed in Employment Division v. Smith ( 1990 ) , which held no such interest was required under the Free Exercise Clause regarding a neutral law of general applicability that happens to affect a religious practice , as opposed to a law that targets a particular religious practice ( which does require a compelling governmental interest ) . In Church of <unk> <unk> Aye v. City of Hialeah ( 1993 ) , the Supreme Court ruled Hialeah had passed an ordinance banning ritual slaughter , a practice central to the Santería religion , while providing exceptions for some practices such as the kosher slaughter . Since the ordinance was not " generally applicable " , the Court ruled that it needed to have a compelling interest , which it failed to have , and so was declared unconstitutional . 
 In 1993 , the Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) , seeking to restore the compelling interest requirement applied in Sherbert and Yoder . In City of Boerne v. Flores ( 1997 ) , the Court struck down the provisions of RFRA that forced state and local governments to provide protections exceeding those required by the First Amendment , on the grounds that while the Congress could enforce the Supreme Court 's interpretation of a constitutional right , the Congress could not impose its own interpretation on states and localities . According to the court 's ruling in Gonzales v. <unk> ( 2006 ) , RFRA remains applicable to federal laws and so those laws must still have a " compelling interest " .

 The First Amendment bars Congress from " abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press … . " U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens commented about this phraseology in a 1993 journal article : " I emphasize the word ' the ' in the term ' the freedom of speech ' because the definite article suggests that the draftsmen intended to immunize a previously identified category or subset of speech . " Stevens explained that , otherwise , the clause might absurdly immunize things like false testimony under oath . Like Stevens , the journalist Anthony Lewis wrote : " The word ' the ' can be read to mean what was understood at the time to be included in the concept of free speech . " But what was understood at the time is not 100 % clear . In the late 1790s , the lead author of the speech and press clauses , James Madison , argued against narrowing this freedom to what had existed under English common law : 
 The practice in America must be entitled to much more respect . In every state , probably , in the Union , the press has exerted a freedom in canvassing the merits and measures of public men , of every description , which has not been confined to the strict limits of the common law . 
 Madison wrote this in 1799 , when he was in a dispute about the constitutionality of the Alien and Sedition Laws , which was legislation enacted in 1798 by President John Adams ' Federalist Party to ban seditious libel . Madison believed that legislation to be unconstitutional , and his adversaries in that dispute , such as John Marshall , advocated the narrow freedom of speech that had existed in the English common law .

 The Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of any federal law regarding the Free Speech Clause until the 20th century . For example , the Supreme Court never ruled on the Alien and Sedition Acts ; three of the Supreme Court 's justices ( riding circuit ) presided over resulting sedition trials without indicating any reservations . The leading critics of the law , Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , argued for the Acts ' unconstitutionality based on the First Amendment and other Constitutional provisions . Jefferson succeeded Adams as president , in part due to the unpopularity of the latter 's sedition prosecutions ; he and his party quickly overturned the Acts and pardoned those imprisoned by them . In the majority opinion in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan ( 1964 ) , the Court noted the importance of this public debate as a precedent in First Amendment law and ruled that the Acts had been unconstitutional : " Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court , the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history . "

 During the patriotic fervor of World War I and the First Red Scare , the Espionage Act of 1917 imposed a maximum sentence of twenty years for anyone who caused or attempted to cause " insubordination , disloyalty , mutiny , or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces of the United States " . Specifically , the Espionage Act of 1917 states that if anyone allows any enemies to enter or fly over the United States and obtain information from a place connected with the national defense , they will be punished . Hundreds of prosecutions followed . In 1919 , the Supreme Court heard four appeals resulting from these cases : Schenck v. United States , Debs v. United States , <unk> v. United States , and Abrams v. United States . 
 In the first of these cases , Socialist Party of America official Charles Schenck had been convicted under the Espionage Act for publishing leaflets urging resistance to the draft . Schenck appealed , arguing that the Espionage Act violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment . In Schenck v. United States , the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Schenck 's appeal and affirmed his conviction . This conviction continued to be debated over whether Schenck went against the right to freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment . Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr . , writing for the Court , explained that " the question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent . " One week later , in <unk> v. United States , the court again upheld an Espionage Act conviction , this time that of a journalist who had criticized U.S. involvement in foreign wars . Both of these cases show that the government can overrule The Bill of Rights with certain acts like The Espionage Act of 1917 . It all depends on what was done to put the United States in danger . 
 In Debs v. United States , the Court elaborated on the " clear and present danger " test established in Schenck . On June 16 , 1918 , Eugene V. Debs , a political activist , delivered a speech in Canton , Ohio , in which he spoke of " most loyal comrades were paying the penalty to the working class – these being Wagenknecht , Baker and <unk> , who had been convicted of aiding and abetting another in failing to register for the draft . " Following his speech , Debs was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act . In upholding his conviction , the Court reasoned that although he had not spoken any words that posed a " clear and present danger " , taken in context , the speech had a " natural tendency and a probable effect to obstruct the recruiting services " . In Abrams v. United States , four Russian refugees appealed their conviction for throwing leaflets from a building in New York ; the leaflets argued against President Woodrow Wilson 's intervention in Russia against the October Revolution . The majority upheld their conviction , but Holmes and Justice Louis Brandeis dissented , holding that the government had demonstrated no " clear and present danger " in the four 's political advocacy .
