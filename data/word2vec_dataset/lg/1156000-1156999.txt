 The Anzac Mounted Division had been ordered to cut the road linking Jaffa to Jerusalem by capturing Ramleh and Ludd . This was the only main road from the coast through Ramleh up the Vale of <unk> to Jerusalem . During the morning Meldrum 's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade crossed the river close to the sand dunes with 1st Light Horse Brigade on its right . By 09 : 00 El Kubeibeh had been occupied by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade before pushing on towards the Wadi Hunayn . Here Ottoman rearguards were encountered in the orange groves and on the hills between El Kubeibeh and the sand dunes . About noon the 1st Light Horse Brigade drove an Ottoman rearguard from a ridge facing Yibna where the Anzac Mounted Division had bivouaced the night before and occupied the village of Rehovot also called Deiran . At the same time the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade fought off a strongly entrenched rearguard at Ayun Kara . After conceding considerable ground the Ottoman soldiers made a vigorous counterattack but were finally defeated .

 At midnight on 14 November Falkenhayn ordered a general withdrawal and in the days following the Ottoman Seventh Army fell back into the Judean Hills towards Jerusalem while the Eighth Army retreated north of Jaffa across the Nahr el Auja . The Ottoman armies suffered heavily and their subsequent withdrawal resulted in the loss of substantial territory ; between 40 – 60 miles ( 64 – 97 km ) was invaded by the British north of the old Gaza – Beersheba line . In its wake the two Ottoman armies left behind 10 @,@ 000 prisoners of war and 100 guns . 
 The day after the action at Ayun Kara , the 75th Division and the Australian Mounted Division advanced towards Latron where the Jaffa to Jerusalem road enters the Judean Hills , while the Anzac Mounted Division occupied Ramleh and Ludd . An Ottoman rearguard above Abu Shusheh blocked the Vale of <unk> on the right flank of the advance on Ramleh . This rearguard position was charged and overwhelmed by the 6th Mounted Brigade ( Yeomanry Mounted Division ) . On 16 November Latron itself was captured and the first British unit to enter Jaffa ; the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade ( Anzac Mounted Division ) occupied the city , without opposition . They administered Jaffa until representatives of the director of Occupied Enemy Territory arrived . And marking the end of the British Empire 's first advance into Palestine , the Ottoman Eighth Army retired to the northern bank of the Auja River some 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of Jaffa and the Seventh Army retreated into the Judean Hills . Since the advance from Gaza and Beersheba began very heavy casualties and losses had been inflicted . The invasion had spread 50 miles ( 80 km ) northwards into Ottoman territory while over 10 @,@ 000 Ottoman prisoners of war and 100 guns had been captured by the victorious Egyptian Expeditionary Force .

 The three divisional receiving stations of the Anzac , Australian and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions operated in echelon . As soon as one had evacuated all wounded to the rear , they moved ahead of the other two divisional receiving stations to repeat the process . However , from the beginning there were problems evacuating casualties caused by the lack of linking infrastructure , one receiving station lost all its transport , and the light motor ambulances of another disappeared . The greatest difficulty were of communication and traveling including mechanical breakdowns on the rough roads and tracks which quickly became impassable for motor traffic .

 = Lord Henry Paulet = 
 Lord Henry " Harry " Paulet KCB ( 1767 – 28 January 1832 ) was an officer in the Royal Navy who saw service in the American War of Independence , the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars . Born into the British nobility as a younger son of the Marquess of Winchester , he rose through the ranks and had gained his own command by the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars . He was involved in a number of famous engagements during his career , such as the capture of the French frigate Gloire in 1795 , though he narrowly missed out on seeing direct action at two of the most significant naval battles of the wars with the French . The first was the Battle of Cape St Vincent , where he had left Jervis 's fleet a few days previously , the second was the Battle of Copenhagen , where he remained with Sir Hyde Parker 's reserve squadron . He nevertheless rose through the ranks to reach vice @-@ admiral , despite an incident that saw him court @-@ martialled and dismissed , only to be reinstated by the intervention of the King ; and a tendency to eccentricity . He married towards the end of the wars with France , and had several children . Paulet served as one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty from 1813 , and was installed as a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1815 , but ill @-@ health forced his retirement from active service shortly afterwards , and he eventually died of cancer in 1832 . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 Henry Paulet was born in 1767 , the younger son of George Paulet , 12th Marquess of Winchester , and a brother to Charles Paulet , the future 13th Marquess of Winchester . Paulet joined the navy as a midshipman during the later years of the American War of Independence . He spent 11 years at this rank , during which time he was present at Admiral Sir George Rodney 's victory at the Battle of the Saintes . He was made junior lieutenant aboard HMS Crown at Spithead in early February 1789 . The Crown then became flagship of Commodore William Cornwallis , who sailed with a squadron to India . Paulet reached Tenerife with the ship , but on the squadron 's arrival there he was transferred to the frigate HMS Phoenix in exchange for one of the Phoenix 's lieutenants . Paulet completed the voyage to India with the Phoenix , but shortly after his arrival he learnt that he was not to be taken back aboard the Crown . He was invalided back to Britain aboard the East Indiaman Houghton . 
 = = Promotion and command = = 
 Paulet was promoted to full lieutenant in 1791 and appointed to HMS Vulcan , though he was moved to HMS Assistance in April 1792 . On 20 February 1793 Paulet received a promotion to master and commander , and command of the sloop HMS Nautilus . He commanded the Nautilus as part of John Laforey 's naval force that captured Tobago on 15 April 1793 . He was promoted again to post @-@ captain on 9 January 1794 and was given command of HMS Vengeance by Sir John Jervis . Paulet served as flag captain to Commodore Charles Thompson at the capture of Martinique . 
 = = = Command of HMS Astraea = = = 
 After this success , Paulet returned to Britain and was given command of the 32 @-@ gun fifth rate HMS Astraea , cruising in the English Channel under the orders of Sir John Colpoys . While sailing in thick fog on 10 April 1795 three sails were spotted through a break . Identifying them as enemy frigates Paulet gave chase to one of them . He closed the distance , and after foiling an attempt from the French ship to rake the Astraea , Paulet came alongside and the two ships exchanged broadsides for nearly an hour before the French ship struck . She was discovered to be the 42 @-@ gun Gloire , with 275 men aboard . She had suffered casualties of 40 killed and wounded , while Astraea , of 32 guns and 212 men , had only eight wounded . For this feat Paulet was awarded the Naval Gold Medal . 
 = = = Command of HMS Thalia = = = 
 Paulet 's next command was the 36 @-@ gun frigate HMS Thalia , attached to Lord Bridport 's fleet . He was present at the Battle of Groix , afterwards taking on board the fleet 's flag captain , William Domett , and one of the captured French captains . The Thalia almost ran onto rocks while rounding Ushant , but Paulet was able to get her off safely . While returning to the fleet two frigates were spotted in the distance , which Domett feared might be French . In reply Paulet pointed to the guns on the maindeck and said ' Never mind Domett , those are 18 @-@ pounders , and hit <unk> 
 Paulet and the Thalia continued to serve in the Channel until January 1797 , when they were sent with Rear @-@ Admiral William Parker to reinforce John Jervis 's fleet prior to the Battle of Cape St Vincent . Thalia was not present at the battle though , having been attached to the Mediterranean Fleet a few days earlier . While in the Mediterranean he captured the 16 @-@ gun corvette Espoir , and several French and Spanish privateers . 
 It was about this time that an incident occurred that temporarily clouded his career . In a moment of anger he struck one of the Thalia 's lieutenants , Robert Forbes . He was brought to court @-@ martial on 12 June 1798 aboard HMS Prince , and the offence being proved , the court had no choice but to dismiss him from the service . In view of the mitigating circumstances , the court recommended that Paulet be considered for clemency by King George III . The King was pleased to follow the recommendation and reinstated Paulet in the service . 
 Paulet then received command of the 74 @-@ gun HMS Defence . He went with Sir Hyde Parker to the Baltic in 1801 and while he and the Defence were present at the Battle of Copenhagen , they were kept with Parker 's reserve squadron and took no part in the fighting . 
 The Defence was paid off with the conclusion of the Treaty of Amiens in 1802 , though the resumption of hostilities led to Paulet 's return to service as captain of HMS Terrible . He commanded her in the blockades of the French and Spanish ports , and by 1806 he was in the West Indies . In August that year the Terrible was caught in a hurricane , completely dismasted and almost wrecked . 
 = = Personal and later life = = 
 Paulet was something of an eccentric . On one occasion , while his ship was moored at Spithead , he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London . This was refused , with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge . Thus challenged , Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart and went off to London anyway . 
 He became a Colonel of Royal Marines on 1 August 1811 , and advanced to rear @-@ admiral on 12 August 1812 . He replaced William Johnstone Hope as one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in 1813 , holding the position until being forced to retire in 1816 due to ill health . On 2 January 1815 , Paulet was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath , and in 1819 was promoted to vice @-@ admiral . On 26 October 1813 , he married Anna @-@ Maria Ravenscroft , with whom he had two sons and three daughters . 
 Increasingly ill during his last years from cancer , that it was believed had been brought on by a fall against a slide of one of the carronades aboard the Terrible , Paulet died on 28 January 1832 at his seat of Westhill Lodge , <unk> , Hampshire . He was buried in the family vault at <unk> on 3 February . His eldest son Henry Charles Paulet was created a Baronet in his honour in 1836 ( see Paulet Baronets ) . 
 = WonderSwan = 
 The WonderSwan ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a handheld game console released in Japan by Bandai . It was developed by Gunpei Yokoi 's company Koto Laboratory and Bandai . Released in 1999 in the fifth generation of video game consoles , the WonderSwan and its two later models , the WonderSwan Color and SwanCrystal were officially supported until being discontinued by Bandai in 2003 . During its lifespan , no variation of the WonderSwan was released outside Japan . 
 Powered by a 16 @-@ bit central processing unit , the WonderSwan took advantage of a low price point and long battery life in comparison to its competition , Nintendo 's Game Boy Color and SNK 's Neo Geo Pocket Color . Later improvements took advantage of quality upgrades to the handheld 's screen and added color . The WonderSwan is playable both vertically and horizontally , and features a unique library of games , including numerous first @-@ party titles based on licensed anime properties , as well as significant third @-@ party support from Square , Namco , and Taito . Overall , the WonderSwan in all its variations combined to sell an estimated 3 @.@ 5 million units and managed to obtain as much as 8 % of the Japanese handheld video game console market before being marginalized by Nintendo 's Game Boy Advance . Retrospective feedback praises the potential of the WonderSwan despite its low sales and its brief time holding its own against Nintendo in the marketplace . 
 = = History = = 
 Founded in 1950 by <unk> Yamashina , Bandai was originally a manufacturer of toy cars and plastic models , but became a major player in the toy industry through the licensing of popular anime characters beginning with <unk> <unk> in 1963 . In the 1970s , Bandai manufactured both LCD games based on television programs and dedicated consoles . In 1982 , the company released the Intellivision in Japan , and in 1985 it became one of the first third @-@ party licensees on the Family Computer . The company 's greatest success in electronic games , however , was the Tamagotchi virtual pet first released in 1996 . Despite plans for Bandai to merge with Sega to form Sega Bandai Ltd. in 1997 , the merger was called off suddenly . Bandai 's board of directors decided to oppose the merger less than a week after approving it , and Sega in turn decided to accept Bandai 's actions at an emergency board meeting later that day . Bandai president Makoto Yamashina took responsibility for failing to gain the support of his company for the merger . As a result , Bandai entered the market without outside support . 
 Engineer Gunpei Yokoi was known for creating the Game Boy handheld system at Nintendo . After the failure of the Virtual Boy , however , he left the company in 1996 in order to create his own engineering firm , Koto Laboratory . It was then that Bandai approached Yokoi to create the WonderSwan to compete with the Game Boy . Yokoi was involved in development of the new handheld , but died in 1997 in a car accident before it was released . 
 The WonderSwan was officially unveiled in Tokyo on October 8 , 1998 . Bandai chose the name of the system to highlight its aesthetics and technical capabilities because the swan is recognized as an elegant bird with powerful legs to help it swim . The company promised a 30 @-@ hour battery life , a low retail price , and a launch lineup of roughly fifty games . 
 The WonderSwan launched on March 4 , 1999 and was available in nine casing colors : Pearl White , Skeleton Green , Silver Metallic , Skeleton Red , Blue Metallic , Skeleton Blue , Skeleton Black , <unk> , and Gold . Three limited edition two @-@ tone models were also released in Frozen Mint , Sherbet Melon and Soda Blue . These colors were chosen through an online poll at Bandai ’ s website , with the metallic models and Pearl White discontinued on July 22 to make room for the special tone models . Despite Nintendo 's release of the Game Boy Color five months before , Bandai remained confident that the WonderSwan and its monochromatic screen would perform well because the original black @-@ and @-@ white Game Boy had previously been more successful than its color @-@ screen competitors , the Sega Game Gear and Atari Lynx , on the basis of its battery life and the quality of its game library . With a retail price JP ¥ 4 @,@ 800 , the WonderSwan was also cheaper than its competition . In 2000 , Bandai signed an agreement with Mattel to bring the handheld to North America , but ultimately decided against a Western release . The exact reason for this is unknown , but the crowded handheld video game console market has been suggested as a factor . 
 Later that year , Bandai announced the WonderSwan Color ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) which would incorporate a color screen while retaining backward compatibility with the original WonderSwan . It was released on December 9 , 2000 in Japan and was available in Pearl Blue , Pearl Pink , Crystal Black , Crystal Blue , and Crystal Orange . The launch was a moderate success , with the system selling 270 @,@ 632 units in under a month after its release . Before the WonderSwan Color could be released , however , Nintendo announced the Game Boy Advance , which featured superior hardware . The WonderSwan Color still retailed at a lower price point at ¥ 6 @,@ 800 compared to the Advance at ¥ 9 @,@ 800 , but despite peaking at 8 % of the handheld market share in Japan , the WonderSwan 's sales never recovered after the Game Boy Advance reached store shelves in March 2001 . 
 A redesign of the WonderSwan Color , titled SwanCrystal ( <unk> , <unk> ) , was released in Japan on July 12 , 2002 for ¥ 7 @,@ 800 , ¥ 1 @,@ 000 less than the Game Boy Advance . Once again , Bandai held a poll on its website to determine casing colors and released the system in Blue Violet , Wine Red , Crystal Blue , and Crystal Black . Despite its low price and an improved LCD screen , the SwanCrystal was unable to compete , so Bandai announced the discontinuation of the WonderSwan line in 2003 due to low demand and backed out of producing video game hardware altogether . In all , the handheld sold 3 @.@ 5 million units , of which 1 @.@ 55 million were of the original WonderSwan and at least 1 @.@ 1 million were of the WonderSwan Color . 
 = = Technical specifications = = 
 The main CPU of the WonderSwan is a 16 @-@ bit NEC V20 . The original model 's screen is capable of displaying up to eight shades of gray , in contrast to the four displayed by the WonderSwan 's main competitor , the Game Boy . Similar to the Atari Lynx , the handheld has an extra set of buttons allowing the console to be played at different angles ; for the WonderSwan , these buttons were used to allow gamers to play games in both portrait and landscape orientations . The WonderSwan series are all powered by a single AA battery , with the original monochrome version having a battery life of 40 hours . Also included in the handheld was built @-@ in memory allowing players to save games without using passwords . Its LCD screen is 2 @.@ 49 inches ( 6 @.@ 3 cm ) and displays at a resolution of 224 x 144 . Its sound capabilities consist of four PCM channels , each of which can play 32 @-@ sample , 4 @-@ bit sounds at selectable volume and pitch levels . 
 Several features and accessories were developed for the WonderSwan . The <unk> was an official software development kit aimed at amateur programmers that was released by <unk> Corporation . It sold at a cost of ¥ 11 @,@ 800 and allows for games to be developed in the C programming language . An adapter was created to connect headphones to the handheld , as the WonderSwan lacks a headphone port . A remote @-@ controlled robot known as the <unk> can be operated through the unit . In addition , the handheld can be connected to a Sony PocketStation through a device known as the <unk> , although this functionality was rarely exploited . The <unk> can also be used as a wireless way to play two player game between <unk> . The WonderSwan and its later models were also capable of connecting to the Internet via a mobile phone network . 
 The physical measurements of the WonderSwan Color are 12 @.@ 8 by 7 @.@ 43 by 24 @.@ 3 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 04 in × 2 @.@ 93 in × 9 @.@ 57 in ) , slightly larger than the original WonderSwan , and it weighs 3 @.@ 38 ounces ( 96 g ) . Its CPU is a 3 @.@ 072 MHz NEC V20 , and it includes 512 Kbit of RAM , which is shared between the video RAM and the work RAM . The screen on the WonderSwan Color can display up to 241 colors out of a palette of 4096 , and up to 28 sprites per line . It offers backward compatibility with all previous WonderSwan titles . Its LCD screen is also larger than that of the original WonderSwan , measuring 2 @.@ 9 inches ( 7 @.@ 4 cm ) . The SwanCrystal improves upon the design of the WonderSwan Color through the use of a TFT LCD monitor , which has a superior response time to the <unk> monitor used in the former system . This helped to reduce motion blur in the handheld 's graphics . The unit 's case was also redesigned to be more durable . Its approximate battery life is 15 hours . 
 = = Game library = = 
 Koto Laboratories claims that the WonderSwan sold 10 million game cartridges in all . In developing games for the WonderSwan , Bandai leveraged the assistance of several developers . Banpresto — part @-@ owned by Bandai at the time — added support by way of anime licenses and licensed titles , while Namco and Capcom also developed titles for the handheld . Squaresoft contributed remakes of Final Fantasy , Final Fantasy II , and Final Fantasy IV which later also came to the Game Boy Advance . Taito contributed well @-@ received ports such as Space Invaders and Densha de Go ! . Bandai augmented these releases with titles of its own , including exclusive titles in the Digimon and Gundam franchises . To compete with Tetris , Gunpei Yokoi developed a puzzle game for the system ultimately named <unk> in his honor . A sequel known as <unk> EX was a launch title for the WonderSwan Color . Certain games produced through the <unk> kit , such as Judgment <unk> , have also been noted as excellent titles . 
 Support for the WonderSwan has been considered underwhelming . Although some well known third @-@ party developers supported the console , most publishers continued to exclusively support Nintendo 's handhelds . The departure of Squaresoft as a developer and its return to Nintendo has been cited as a factor in the WonderSwan 's diminishing sales in later years . After the discontinuation of the WonderSwan in 2003 , several developers ported WonderSwan games to the Game Boy Advance .

 Two popular WonderSwan emulators are Cygne and the later <unk> . Multiple system emulator software such as <unk> and <unk> also include WonderSwan emulation .

 Selling 3 @.@ 5 million units , the WonderSwan only picked up 8 % of the marketshare in Japan and was ultimately outperformed by Nintendo 's Game Boy Advance . Due to its brightly colored screen and deep game library , the Game Boy Advance ensured Nintendo would have a near @-@ monopoly on the handheld console market in Japan until the release of the PlayStation Portable by Sony in 2004 . 
 Retrospective feedback to the handheld praises its accomplishments , but defines it as a " niche " handheld that appeals to only certain gamers . Jeremy Parish considers the WonderSwan the ultimate expression of Gunpei Yokoi 's design philosophy and notes its modest impact on the market , but blames Bandai for its lack of success , stating , " While WonderSwan ultimately will be remembered as a highly localized blip in the history of handheld games , as a platform it genuinely held its own ... the system 's obscurity resulted more from poor timing and Bandai 's strangely meek strategy , not from any inherent flaws in the design of the machine itself . " Parish also goes on to hypothesize on the lack of a WonderSwan release in North America , stating , " given how hard it was to find Neo Geo Pocket systems and games at U.S. retail , it 's hard to imagine they were clamoring for yet another niche portable from Japan . " Retro Gamer 's Kim Wild criticizes some aspects of the handheld , including its lack of a headphone and AC port , as well as its poor control scheme for left @-@ handed individuals and inability to play multiplayer link games with the headphone adapter connected . Wild offers some praise for the handheld , however , stating " what [ Bandai ] managed with the WonderSwan was impressive given the competition . The low price even today makes it more than worthy of consideration . " 
 = 1993 Bishopsgate bombing = 
 The Bishopsgate bombing occurred on Saturday 24 April 1993 , when the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) detonated an ANFO truck bomb on Bishopsgate , a major thoroughfare in London 's financial district , the City of London . A news photographer was killed in the explosion and 44 people were injured ; the damage cost £ 350 million to repair . As a result of the bombing , which occurred just over a year after the bombing of the nearby Baltic Exchange , a " ring of steel " was implemented to protect the City , and many firms introduced disaster recovery plans in case of further attacks or similar disasters . 
 = = Background = = 
 In early 1993 the Northern Ireland peace process was at a delicate stage , with attempts to broker an IRA ceasefire ongoing . Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin and John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party had been engaged in private dialogue since 1988 , with a view to establishing a broad Irish nationalist coalition . British Prime Minister John Major had refused to openly enter into talks with Sinn Féin until the IRA declared a ceasefire . The risk of an IRA attack on the City of London had increased due to the lack of progress with political talks , resulting in a warning being circulated to all police forces in Britain highlighting intelligence reports of a possible attack , as it was felt the IRA had sufficient personnel , equipment and funds to launch a sustained campaign in England . During the Troubles the IRA had bombed financial targets in London on a number of occasions , most notably on 10 April 1992 when a truck bomb exploded outside the Baltic Exchange on St. Mary Axe . The Baltic Exchange bombing caused £ 800 million worth of damage ( the equivalent of £ 1 @,@ 470 million in 2016 ) , £ 200 million more than the total damage caused by the 10 @,@ 000 explosions that had occurred during the Troubles in Northern Ireland up to that point . 
 = = Bombing = = 
 In March 1993 an Iveco <unk> truck was stolen in Newcastle @-@ under @-@ Lyme , Staffordshire , and repainted from white to dark blue . A 1 tonne ANFO bomb made by the IRA 's South Armagh Brigade had been smuggled into England and was placed in the truck disguised underneath a layer of tarmac . At approximately 9 am on 24 April , two volunteers from an IRA active service unit drove the truck containing the bomb onto Bishopsgate . They parked the truck outside 99 Bishopsgate , which was then the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank , located by the junction with Wormwood Street and <unk> Street , and left the area in a car driven by an accomplice . A series of telephone warnings were then delivered from a <unk> in <unk> , County Armagh , Northern Ireland , with the caller using a recognised IRA codeword and stating " [ there 's ] a massive bomb … clear a wide area " . Two police officers were already making inquiries into the truck when the warnings were received , and police began evacuating the area . 
 The bomb exploded at 10 : 27 am causing extensive damage to multiple buildings along a significant stretch of Bishopsgate ; the cost of repair was estimated at the time at £ 1 billion . Buildings up to 500 metres away were damaged , with 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 140 @,@ 000 m ² ) of office space being affected and over 500 tonnes of glass broken . The NatWest Tower — at the time the City 's tallest skyscraper – was amongst the structures badly damaged , with many windows on the east side of the tower destroyed ; the Daily Mail said " black gaps punched its fifty @-@ two floors like a mouth full of bad teeth " . Damage extended as far north as Liverpool Street station and south beyond Threadneedle Street . St <unk> 's church , seven metres away from the bomb , collapsed as a result of the explosion . Civilian casualties were low as it was a Saturday morning and the City was typically occupied by only a small number of residents , office workers , security guards , builders , and maintenance staff . Forty @-@ four people were injured by the bomb and News of the World photographer Ed Henty was killed after ignoring police warnings and rushing to the scene . The truck @-@ bomb produced explosive power of 1 @,@ 200 kg of TNT . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The business community and media called for increased security in the City , with one leading City figure calling for " a medieval @-@ style walled enclave to prevent terrorist attacks " . Prime Minister John Major received a telephone call from Francis McWilliams , the Lord Mayor of London , reminding him that " the City of London earned £ 17 billion last year for the nation as a whole . Its operating environment and future must be preserved " . Major , McWilliams and Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont made public statements that business would continue as normal in the City and that the Bishopsgate bombing would not achieve a lasting effect . Major later gave an account of the public stance taken by his government on the bombing : 
 Frankly , we thought it was likely to bring the whole process to an end . And we told them repeatedly that that was the case . They assumed that if they bombed and put pressure on the British at Bishopsgate or with some other outrage or other , it would affect our negotiating position to their advantage . In that judgment they were wholly wrong . Every time they did that , they made it harder not easier for any movement to be made towards a settlement . They hardened our attitude , whereas they believed that their actions would soften it . That is a fundamental mistake the IRA have made with successive British governments throughout the last quarter of a century . 
 John Hume and Gerry Adams issued their first joint statement on the same day as the bombing , stating , " We accept that the Irish people as a whole have a right to national self @-@ determination . This is a view shared by a majority of the people of this island , though not by all its people " , and that , " The exercise of self @-@ determination is a matter for agreement between the people of Ireland " . 
 The IRA 's reaction appeared in the 29 April edition of An <unk> , highlighting how the bombers exploited a security loophole after " having spotted a breach in the usually tight security around the City " . There was also a message from the IRA leadership , calling for " the British establishment to seize the opportunity and to take the steps needed for ending its futile and costly war in Ireland . We again emphasise that they should pursue the path of peace or resign themselves to the path of war " . The IRA also attempted to apply indirect pressure to the British government with a statement sent to non @-@ American foreign @-@ owned businesses in the City , warning that " no one should be misled into underestimating the IRA 's intention to mount future planned attacks into the political and financial heart of the British state ... In the context of present political realities , further attacks on the City of London and elsewhere are inevitable . This we feel we are bound to convey to you directly , to allow you to make fully informed decisions " . 
 The City of London Corporation 's chief planning officer called for the demolition of buildings damaged in the explosion , including the NatWest Tower , seeing an opportunity to rid the City of some of the 1970s architecture and build a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art structure as a " symbol of defiance to the IRA " . His comments were not endorsed by the Corporation themselves , who remarked that the NatWest Tower was an integral part of the City 's skyline . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In May 1993 the City of London Police confirmed a planned security cordon for the City , conceived by its commissioner Owen Kelly , and on 3 July 1993 the ' ring of steel ' was introduced . Most routes into the City were closed or made exit @-@ only , and the remaining eight routes into the City had checkpoints manned by armed police . CCTV cameras were also introduced to monitor vehicles entering the area , including two cameras at each entry point – one to read the vehicle registration plate and another to monitor the driver and passenger . Over 70 police @-@ controlled cameras monitored the City but to increase coverage of public areas " Camera Watch " was launched in September 1993 to encourage co @-@ operation on surveillance between the police , private companies and the Corporation of London . Nine months after the scheme was launched only 12 @.@ 5 % of buildings had camera systems , but by 1996 well over 1 @,@ 000 cameras in 376 separate systems were operational in the City . 
 The bombing resulted in a number of companies changing their working practices and drawing up plans to deal with any future incidents . Documents were blown out of windows of multi @-@ storey buildings by the force of the explosion , prompting the police to use a shredder to destroy all documents found . This resulted in risk managers subsequently demanding a " clear desk " policy at the end of each working day to improve information security . The attack also prompted British and American financial companies to prepare disaster recovery plans in case of future attacks . The World Trade Center bombing in New York City in February 1993 had caused bankruptcy in 40 % of the affected companies within two years of the attack , according to a report from analysts IDC . As a result of the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate bomb attacks , City @-@ based companies were well @-@ prepared to deal with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 , with a spokesman for the Corporation of London stating : " After the IRA bombs , firms redoubled their disaster recovery plans and the City recovered remarkably quickly . It has left the City pretty well @-@ prepared for this sort of thing now . " 
 The initial estimate of £ 1 billion worth of damage was later downgraded , and the total cost of reconstruction was £ 350 million . The subsequent payouts by insurance companies resulted in them suffering heavy losses causing a crisis in the industry , including the near @-@ collapse of the Lloyd 's of London market . A government @-@ backed insurance scheme , Pool Re , was subsequently introduced in Britain , with the government acting as a " re @-@ insurer of last resort " for losses over £ 75 million . 
 The bombing , mounted at a cost of £ 3 @,@ 000 , was the last major bombing in England during that phase of the Northern Ireland conflict . The campaign of bombing of the UK 's financial centre , described by author and journalist Ed Moloney as " possibly the [ IRA 's ] most successful military tactic since the start of the Troubles " , was suspended by the IRA to allow the political progress made by Gerry Adams and John Hume to continue . The IRA carried out a number of smaller bomb and mortar attacks in England during the remainder of 1993 and in early 1994 , before declaring a " complete cessation of military operations " on 31 August 1994 .

 In July 2000 it was announced that Punch magazine was to be prosecuted for contempt of court after publishing an article by former MI5 agent David Shayler . Shayler 's article claimed MI5 could have stopped the Bishopsgate bombing , which a spokesman for Attorney General Lord Williams claimed was a breach of a 1997 court injunction preventing Shayler disclosing information on security or intelligence matters . In November 2000 Punch and its editor were found guilty and fined £ 20 @,@ 000 and £ 5 @,@ 000 respectively . In March 2001 the editor successfully appealed against his conviction and fine , with an appeal judge accusing the Attorney General of acting like a press censor and ruling that the 1997 injunction was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights . In December 2002 this decision was overturned at the House of Lords , with five law lords ruling that editor James Steen 's publication of Shayler 's article was indeed in contempt . 
 On 24 April 2013 , a commemorative dinner was held by the Felix Fund , a charity for bomb disposal experts and their families , at the Merchant Taylors ' Hall on Threadneedle Street , to mark 20 years since the Bishopsgate bombing . 
 = SMS Helgoland ( 1912 ) = 
 SMS Helgoland was a Novara @-@ class scout cruiser built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy right before World War I. Helgoland participated in several raids on the ships defending the Strait of Otranto , including the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in May 1917 . She was transferred to Italy in 1920 in accordance with the peace treaties ending World War I and renamed Brindisi . After modifications , the ship was assigned to the squadron responsible for the Eastern Mediterranean until 1924 . She spent the next five years based in Libya and Italy before Brindisi was disarmed and turned into a depot ship in 1929 . The ship was stricken from the Navy List in 1937 and later disposed of . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The ship measured 130 @.@ 64 meters ( 428 ft 7 in ) overall , with a beam of 12 @.@ 79 meters ( 42 ft 0 in ) . Helgoland had a mean draft of 4 @.@ 6 meters ( 15 ft 1 in ) and displaced 3 @,@ 500 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 400 long tons ) at normal load . At deep load , she displaced 4 @,@ 017 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 954 long tons ) . Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of AEG @-@ Curtis steam turbines driving two propeller shafts . They were designed to provide 25 @,@ 600 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 100 kW ) and were powered by 16 Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers . These gave the ship a top speed of 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) . Helgoland carried about 710 metric tons ( 700 long tons ) of coal that gave her a range of approximately 1 @,@ 600 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 000 km ; 1 @,@ 800 mi ) at 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . The ship had a crew of 340 officers and men . 
 Helgoland was armed with nine 50 @-@ caliber 10 @-@ centimeter ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) guns in single pedestal mounts . Three were placed forward on the forecastle , four were located amidships , two on either side , and two were side by side on the quarterdeck . A 50 @-@ caliber 6 @.@ 6 @-@ centimeter ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) anti @-@ aircraft gun and six 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes in twin mounts were added in 1917 . The navy planned to remove the guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and replace them with a 15 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns fore and aft , but nothing was done before the end of the war . 
 The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships . The conning tower had 60 mm thick sides , and the deck was 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Helgoland was laid down at the Danubius shipyard in Fiume on 28 October 1911 and was launched on 23 November 1912 . The ship was completed on 5 September 1914 , a month after the start of World War I. 
 One day after Italy declared war on Austria @-@ Hungary on 23 May 1915 , Helgoland and two destroyers engaged and sank the Italian destroyer Turbine . On 17 August 1915 , Helgoland , her sister ship Saida , and four destroyers bombarded Italian forces on the island of Pelagosa which had recently been occupied by the Italians . 
 In late 1915 , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy began a series of raids against the merchant ships supplying Allied forces in Serbia and Montenegro . On the night of 22 / 23 November 1915 , Helgoland , Saida , and the 1st Torpedo Division raided the Albanian coast and sank a pair of Italian transports carrying flour . To facilitate these raids , Helgoland , her sister Novara , six modern Tátra @-@ class destroyers , six T @-@ 74 class torpedo boats and an oiler were transferred to Cattaro to facilitate further raids on 29 November . Helgoland , together with five destroyers , participated in another of these raids at the end of December . On the night of 28 / 29 December 1915 , while making her sortie , Helgoland rammed and sank the French submarine Monge between Brindisi and the Albanian port of Durazzo . Helgoland and the destroyers attacked shipping in Durazzo the following morning . Two of the destroyers struck mines while after sinking several ships in the port and had to be abandoned . The Austro @-@ Hungarians managed to evade the Allied pursuit only when darkness fell . On the night of 31 May / 1 June 1916 , the ship covered a raid by two destroyers and three torpedo boats on the drifters defending the Strait of Otranto against submarines trying to exit the Adriatic Sea , sinking one . 
 Erich Heyssler assumed command of Helgoland in April 1917 and Miklós Horthy planned another raid on the drifters using a force composed of the three Novara @-@ class cruisers . The three cruisers were to attack separately while two destroyers made a diversionary attack on the drifters near the Albanian coast . On the night of 14 May , the ships departed port and managed to pass through the line of drifters in the darkness without being identified . As the sounds from the diversionary attack were heard , the drifters released their nets and began to head towards Otranto . Helgoland turned around and attacked the westernmost group of drifters as dawn began on the morning of 15 May . Between the three cruisers , they sank 14 drifters and badly damaged an additional four . The skipper of the drifter Gowan Lea , Joseph Watt , refused to surrender and abandon ship when demanded by Helgoland , despite the cruiser only being 100 yards ( 91 m ) away . Watt 's crew only managed to fire one shot before their single 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) six @-@ pounder gun was disabled . Watt 's refusal to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds was recognized after the battle by the award of the Victoria Cross . 
 Helgoland did not linger to ensure that Gowan Lea was sunk , but proceeded to attack other drifters . She did , however , pause briefly to rescue 18 survivors from other drifters before turning for home . The Austrian ships were first contacted during their retreat by a group of three French destroyers led by a small Italian scout cruiser , Carlo Mirabello , but the heavier guns of the Austrian ships dissuaded the Allied commander from closing the range . They were intercepted shortly afterward by a stronger group of two British protected cruisers , Bristol and Dartmouth , escorted by four Italian destroyers . Dartmouth opened fire with her 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns at a range of 10 @,@ 600 yards ( 9 @,@ 700 m ) and Horthy ordered his ships to make smoke several minutes later . This nearly caused the three Austrian cruisers to collide in the dense smoke , but covered them against the fire from the British ships as they closed the range . When they emerged , the Austrian ships were only about 4 @,@ 900 yards ( 4 @,@ 500 m ) from the British , a range much more suitable for the smaller Austrian guns . 
 The three cruisers were gradually drawing away from their pursuers when Novara , leading the Austrian ships , was hit several times ; most critically in the engine room that knocked out half her boilers . Helgoland was also hit five times , but not seriously , aside from one gun disabled . One crewman had been killed and 16 were wounded . The British ships turned away , around the time that Novara had to extinguish her remaining boilers and went dead in the water , upon learning that more Austrian ships were approaching . Saida was preparing to take Novara under tow when several Italian destroyers attacked in succession . The weight of fire from the three cruisers prevented them from closing to torpedo range and they scored no hits . The Allied ship returned to Brindisi and the Austrians slowly proceeded back to base . Helgoland had fired 1052 shells from her 10 cm guns . Heyssler received the Order of Leopold with crossed swords in recognition of his leadership during the battle . 
 Helgoland and six destroyers attempted to duplicate the success of the earlier raid on 18 – 19 October , but they were spotted by Italian aircraft and turned back in the face of substantial Allied reinforcements alerted by the aircraft . She was caught under the guns of several mutinous armored cruisers during the Gulf of Kotor Mutiny in February 1918 , but managed to escape without damage . The ship was tasked to participate in a major attack on the Allied ships defending the Strait of Otranto on 11 June , but it was called off after the dreadnought SMS Szent István was sunk by an Italian motor torpedo boat en route to the rendezvous for the operation . Following the Armistice of Villa Giusti between Italy and Austria @-@ Hungary on 3 November , the entire Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet was transferred to the newly formed Yugoslavia .

 Italy received Helgoland from Austria @-@ Hungary on 19 September 1920 as part of the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye that ended the country 's participation in World War I. Renamed Brindisi and anchored at Bizerte , Tunisia , when the transfer was made , the ship was rated as an <unk> ( scout cruiser ) by Italy , and reached La Spezia on 26 October where she was assigned to the Scouting Group ( Gruppo <unk> ) . The ship was modified to suit the Italians at La Spezia from 6 April to 16 June 1921 before she entered service . She became the flagship of Rear Admiral Massimiliano <unk> , commander of the Light Squadron , upon recommissioning . Brindisi sailed for Istanbul on 3 July , visiting a number of ports in Italy , Greece , and Turkey en route . She relieved the armored cruiser San Giorgio as flagship of the Eastern Squadron upon her arrival on 16 July . The ship was replaced as flagship on 6 October and remained assigned to the Eastern Squadron until she returned to Italy on 7 January 1924 . 
 Brindisi hosted King Victor Emmanuel III aboard during the ceremonies that transferred Fiume to Italian control in accordance with the Treaty of Rome in February – March 1924 . The ship was then transferred to Libya where she spent the next year . Brindisi returned to Italy the following year and was briefly assigned to the Scout Squadron on 1 April 1926 before she was placed in reserve on 26 July . The ship was reactivated on 1 June 1927 when she was assigned as the flagship of the 1st Destroyer Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Enrico <unk> . Six months later , she was relieved as flagship and was transferred to the Special Squadron where she became flagship of Rear Admiral Antonio <unk> on 6 June 1928 . In May – June 1929 , Brindisi made a cruise in the Eastern Mediterranean where she visited ports in Greece and the Dodecanese Islands . Rear Admiral Salvatore <unk> relieved <unk> on 15 October and the ship was disarmed on 26 November . She was used as a depot ship at Ancona , Pula , and Trieste until she was stricken from the Navy List on 11 March 1937 .

 Briarcliff Manor / <unk> / is a suburban village in Westchester County , New York , around 30 miles ( 50 km ) north of New York City . It is on 5 @.@ 9 square miles ( 15 km2 ) of land on the east bank of the Hudson River , geographically shared by the towns of Mount Pleasant and Ossining . Briarcliff Manor includes the communities of Scarborough and Chilmark , and is served by the Scarborough station of the Metro @-@ North Railroad 's Hudson Line . A section of the village , including buildings and homes covering 376 acres ( 152 ha ) , is part of the Scarborough Historic District and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 . The village motto is " A Village between Two Rivers " , reflecting Briarcliff Manor 's location between the Hudson and Pocantico Rivers . Although the Pocantico is the primary boundary between Mount Pleasant and Ossining , since its incorporation the village has spread into Mount Pleasant . 
 In the precolonial era , the village 's area was inhabited by a band of the Wappinger tribes of Native Americans . In the early 19th century , the area was known as Whitson 's Corners . Walter William Law moved to the area and purchased lands during the 1890s . Law developed the village , establishing schools , churches , parks , and the Briarcliff Lodge . Briarcliff Manor was incorporated as a village in 1902 , and celebrated its centennial on November 21 , 2002 . The village has grown from 331 people when established to 7 @,@ 867 in the 2010 census . 
 Briarcliff Manor was historically known for its wealthy estate @-@ owning families , including the Vanderbilts , Astors , and Rockefellers . It still remains primarily residential and its population is still considered affluent by U.S. standards . It has about 180 acres ( 70 ha ) of recreational facilities and parks , all accessible to the public . The village has seven Christian churches for various denominations and two synagogues . The oldest church is Saint Mary 's Episcopal Church , built in 1851 . Briarcliff Manor has an elected local government , with departments including police , fire , recreation , and public works . It has a low crime rate : a 2012 study found it had the second @-@ lowest in the state . In the New York State Legislature it is split between the New York State Assembly 's 95th and 92nd districts , and the New York Senate 's 38th and 40th districts . In Congress the village is in New York 's 17th District .

 Briarcliff Manor 's original settlement was known as Whitson 's Corners for brothers John H. , Richard , and Reuben Whitson , who owned adjoining farms in the area totaling 400 acres ( 160 ha ) . Whitson 's Corners was named after the corner of Pleasantville and South State Roads , where John H. Whitson 's house , the <unk> , stood from 1820 until the 1940s . The Briarcliff Congregational Church 's parish house currently stands at its former location . The neighboring community of Scarborough was known as Weskora until it was renamed in 1864 , after resident William <unk> 's ancestral hometown in Yorkshire . After the community was incorporated into Briarcliff Manor in 1906 , the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad put up a sign reading " Briarcliff West " at the village 's Scarborough station . Soon afterward , attributed to the neighborhood 's pride over their name , that sign was thrown into the Hudson River and replaced with the original Scarborough sign . 
 Briarcliff Manor derives from " Brier Cliff " , a compound of the English words " <unk> " and " cliff " . The name originated in Ireland as that of the family home of John David Ogilby , a professor of ecclesiastical history at the General Theological Seminary . Ogilby had named his New York summer home Brier Cliff after his family home in Ireland . In 1890 , Walter Law bought James Stillman 's 236 @-@ acre ( 96 ha ) Briarcliff Farm and further developed it , later using the name Briarcliff for all his property . Law 's friend , Andrew Carnegie , called him " The Laird of Briarcliff Manor " ; since the title appealed to all concerned , the village was named " Briarcliff Manor " . By 1897 , the village post office and railroad station bore the name Briarcliff Manor . The village ( and its name ) were approved by its residents in a September 12 , 1902 referendum ; the name prevailed over other suggestions , including " Sing Sing East " . On November 21 , 1902 , the village of Briarcliff Manor was established . 
 The village is also known by several other names . It is conversationally called " Briarcliff " , and often erroneously written as " Briar Cliff Manor " ( although historically there has been little distinction ) . The village has been called " Briarcliff on the Hudson " by Mark Twain and Aileen <unk> ; it is also known as " the Village of Briarcliff Manor " . The name Briarcliff has also been applied to other municipalities , including the 470 @-@ person town of Briarcliffe Acres in South Carolina ; in naming it , the town 's founder had drawn inspiration from Briarcliff Manor 's name .

 The history of Briarcliff Manor can be traced back to the founding of a settlement between the Hudson and Pocantico Rivers in the 19th century . The area now known as Briarcliff Manor had seen human occupation since at least the Archaic period , but significant growth in the settlements that are now incorporated into the village did not occur until the Industrial Revolution . 
 In the precolonial era , the area of present @-@ day Briarcliff Manor was inhabited by a band of the Wappinger tribes of Native Americans , known as Sint <unk> ( or " Sing Sings " ) . They owned territory as far north as the Croton River . In the 1680s , Frederick Philipse purchased about 156 @,@ 000 acres ( 631 km2 ) from the Sint <unk> , and named it Philipsburg Manor . The <unk> lost their claim to the land because of the American Revolutionary War ; the family , which was Loyalist , had its property confiscated in 1779 . The area remained largely unsettled until after the war ; in 1693 , fewer than twenty families lived in the 50 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 202 km2 ) area of Westchester which included Briarcliff Manor . 
 = = = Progressive era to present day = = = 
 After retiring as vice president of W. & J. Sloane , Walter Law moved with his family to the present Briarcliff Manor . He bought his first 236 acres ( 96 ha ) in 1890 , and then quickly expanded his property , buying about forty parcels in less than ten years ; by 1900 , he owned more than 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 7 @.@ 8 sq mi ) of Westchester County . Law developed the village , establishing schools , churches , parks , and the Briarcliff Lodge . His employees at Briarcliff Farms moved into the village , and the population grew to encourage Law to establish the area as a village . A proposition was presented to the supervisors of Mount Pleasant and Ossining on October 8 , 1902 that the area of 640 acres with a population of 331 be incorporated as the Village of Briarcliff Manor , and the village was incorporated on November 21 . 
 The Tudor Revival @-@ style Briarcliff Lodge was opened in 1902 as a premier resort hotel . It was surrounded by Walter Law 's dairy barns and greenhouses , and hosted numerous distinguished guests , including Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt . The lodge held the Edgewood Park School ( 1936 – 1954 ) and The King 's College ( 1955 – 1994 ) before it burned to the ground on September 20 , 2003 . 
 The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department was founded on February 10 , 1903 from Briarcliff Manor 's first fire company , the 1901 Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1 . Scarborough was incorporated into Briarcliff Manor in 1906 , and the Police Department was organized two years later . The Village Municipal Building was built in 1913 and was opened on July 4 , 1914 . The high school opened in 1928 , and in 1946 , the People 's Caucus party , an organization which calls out interested residents for candidacy , was created . Briarcliff Manor celebrated its semicentennial celebration from October 10 – 12 , 1952 , publishing a book about the village and its history ; that year , the Crossroads neighborhood of 84 houses was completed . 
 In 1953 , Todd Elementary School opened to free space at the Law Park grade school . The Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad was discontinued in 1958 , and the following year the Briarcliff Manor Public Library opened in the former Briarcliff Manor train station . The village 's first corporate facility ( part of Philips Research ) opened in 1960 . In 1964 the new Village Hall opened , replacing the Municipal Building . The present high school opened in 1971 to ease the large enrollment at the grade @-@ school building . In 1980 , Pace University began leasing the middle @-@ school building , and the middle school was moved to a portion of the new high @-@ school building . The grade @-@ school building was demolished in 1996 , and a retirement home was built on its site the following year . The village celebrated its centennial in 2002 , which involved celebratory events .

 The village is home to neighborhoods and business and residential areas , including the central business district , the hamlets of Scarborough and Chilmark , and residential areas Central Briarcliff West , the Tree Streets and the Crossroads . 
 Scarborough , often called Scarborough @-@ on @-@ Hudson because it borders the Hudson River , is an 0 @.@ 45 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km2 ) unincorporated district divided between Briarcliff Manor and the village of Ossining , with most of the area within Briarcliff Manor and a few streets in the village of Ossining . Briarcliff Manor 's portion of Scarborough was annexed into the village in 1906 . Scarborough is largely residential , and has some of the most expensive houses in the village , due in part to its proximity to the Hudson . Condominium complexes within Scarborough include <unk> Cove , built in 1974 , and Scarborough Manor , a 7 @-@ story , 205 @-@ unit complex built in the 1960s . The hamlet has a post office and a station on the Metro @-@ North Hudson Line within walking distance of most houses in the hamlet . Unlike most of Briarcliff Manor , Scarborough is within the Ossining Union Free School District . During the 17th century , Scarborough became one of the first trading posts for the Dutch on the Hudson . During the early 20th century , the Astor , Rockefeller , and Vanderbilt families entertained guests on their river @-@ view country estates in the Scarborough area . The Scarborough Historic District , including the Scarborough Presbyterian Church , is on the National Register of Historic Places . Across the street from the church is Sparta Cemetery , containing graves of local Revolutionary War veterans and the Leatherman . A notable building on the register is Beechwood , built in 1780 and considered one of the finest examples of Federal architecture in Westchester County . Beechwood was later purchased by Frank A. Vanderlip , who constructed the Scarborough School on the estate . The school was founded in 1913 , and closed in 1978 . Holly Hill is a notable house nearby . Hubert Rogers , a New York City attorney , had the house designed around 1927 by William Adams Delano ; Rogers named it Weskora . After his death Brooke Astor purchased the estate , renaming it Holly Hill for its holly trees . Directly across from Holly Hill is the site used from 1965 for the U.S. headquarters of Philips Research , built on part of Waldheim , the former 130 @-@ acre ( 53 ha ) estate of James Speyer ; Philips plans to relocate to Cambridge , Massachusetts by 2016 . 
 Chilmark ( also known as Chilmark Park ) is an unincorporated residential community of about 300 acres ( 120 ha ) , established in 1925 , in northern Briarcliff Manor . The neighborhood was designed with Underhill Road as its main thoroughfare , running north @-@ south . It was named after the village of Chilmark , England , located near the home of Thomas Macy ( an ancestor of Valentine Everit Macy ) , who arrived in the colonies in 1635 . The area is culturally significant for its association with the Macy family , whose members were active in New York and Westchester County during the 19th and early 20th centuries . Valentine Everit Macy and his wife , Edith Carpenter Macy , founded the community and aided in its development ; Macy purchased several small family farms in present Chilmark in 1897 . In 1925 , Macy donated 265 acres ( 107 ha ) on Old Chappaqua Road for the first national Girl Scout camp , which later became the Edith Macy Conference Center , a conference and training facility owned and operated by the Girl Scouts of the USA . The Briarcliff Recreation Center was formerly the private Chilmark Club until the 1970s , when the village purchased the land for a recreation center and adjoining park . Macy 's residence in the area was the Chilmark estate , a Tudor @-@ style stone and stucco mansion built in 1896 with a nine @-@ hole golf course . The neighborhood hosts Briarcliff Manor 's Conservative temple Congregation Sons of Israel . 
 Chilmark features landscaped , winding roads designed to blend with the topography , access to transportation ( including a commuter rail line and a highway and homes built in revival styles echoing Tudor and Gothic architecture ; it is architecturally significant as an example of early @-@ 20th @-@ century suburban design . During the 1920s Macy 's son , V.E. Macy Jr . , founded the Chilmark Park Realty Corporation to sell land parcels . When he began marketing the area , he renovated or demolished existing homes to lend an air of development and built a private 8 @.@ 3 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 4 ha ) country club for use by Chilmark residents . The village of Briarcliff Manor later purchased the site , and operates it as Chilmark Park . To denote its development as an exclusive neighborhood , Macy planted distinctive shade trees along Underhill Road . Since its founding , additional homes have been built in Chilmark , most between 1955 and 1960 . The developments expanded the area beyond its original 300 acres ; it presently comprises Underhill Road and the streets immediately adjacent to it . 
 The central business district , also known as the Village Center , is located on Briarcliff Manor 's main street on Pleasantville Road and continues on North State Road . The area has numerous businesses lining Pleasantville Road , a large expansion from the three stores that existed there in 1906 . The business district is home to the village hall and a pocket park , and has brick sidewalks , period street lighting , and free parking . Farther south along the road is the Walter W. Law Memorial Park , and further east along the road are the three schools of the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District . The Village Center contains a number of pre @-@ Revolutionary War houses , including the Whitson House , built during the 1770s and the former home of Richard Whitson ( one of the Whitson brothers , after whom Whitson 's Corners was named ) ; <unk> House , also dating to the 1770s and named for the family who lived there for over a century and the oldest , Century Homestead , dating to about 1767 and first owned by Reuben Whitson . The Washburn House , another pre @-@ Revolutionary house , was sold by the New York State Commission on Forfeiture to Joseph Washburn in 1775 . 
 Central Briarcliff West is a neighborhood which has a number of mansions built by 20th @-@ century millionaires who stayed at the Briarcliff Lodge and later built estates in the area . The lodge stood in the area and on the highest point of Walter Law 's estate from its construction in 1902 until it burned down in 2003 . Other historic estates in the neighborhood include the Law family homes ( built in 1902 for Walter Law 's children ) and Law 's estate , the Manor House , all on Scarborough Road . The three estates for his children are Six Gables , Mt . Vernon , and Hillcrest . The modernist Vanderlip @-@ Street house , designed by Wallace Harrison for Frank A. Vanderlip ( who built it for his daughter and son @-@ in @-@ law ) was one of the first contemporary @-@ style homes in Westchester . Ashridge , a large Greek Revival estate , was built around 1825 . 
 The Tree Streets is a network of streets in the Mount Pleasant portion of the village . Several of the streets are named after regional trees , including <unk> Lane , Larch Road , and Oak Road . A number of houses in the neighborhood were constructed during a 1930s building boom , circling Jackson Park and near Todd Elementary School . The Crossroads is a group of 84 houses on streets named after local World War II veterans , including Schrade Road , Hazelton Circle , Matthes Road , and Dunn Lane . It was constructed at the end of World War II to provide affordable housing to returning veterans , and was completed in 1952 .

 Briarcliff Manor maintains strong ties to its history and traditions . During Briarcliff Manor 's 1952 semicentennial , nine people served on the Historical Committee and published a village history book . In March 1974 , after the mayor appointed twelve people for a 75th anniversary committee , the committee began by forming the Briarcliff Manor @-@ Scarborough Historical Society ( BMSHS ) . The historical society published an updated village history ( A Village Between Two Rivers : Briarcliff Manor ) in 1977 , marking the 75th anniversary of the village . The historical society was initially located at the since @-@ demolished Briarcliff Middle School building ; it later moved to the second floor of a realty building on Pleasantville Road , and moved back to the school building after it was leased by Pace University . On March 21 , 2010 , the BMSHS was given a permanent location at the Eileen O 'Connor Weber Historical Center , established as part of the expanded Briarcliff Manor Public Library .

 Saint Mary 's Episcopal Church , founded in 1839 by William Creighton as Saint Mary 's Church , Beechwood , is Briarcliff Manor 's oldest church ; it was reincorporated in 1945 as Saint Mary 's Church of Scarborough . The granite church was built by local stonemasons and paid for by Creighton 's wealthy neighbors , including Commodore Matthew Perry , James Watson Webb , William Aspinwall , and Ambrose Kingsland . The church is in near @-@ original condition , with a design based on the 14th @-@ century Gothic St. Mary 's parish church in Scarborough , England and the only church with a complete set of William Jay Bolton stained @-@ glass windows . The church , built in 1851 , is a contributing property to the National Register @-@ listed Scarborough Historic District . The 338 @-@ acre ( 137 ha ) Sleepy Hollow Country Club surrounds the church grounds on three sides . Notable parishioners included Commodore Matthew C. Perry and Washington Irving . Irving , author of " Rip Van Winkle " and " The Legend of Sleepy Hollow " , brought the ivy surrounding the church from Abbotsford ( home of Walter Scott ) . On July 5 , 2015 , Saint Mary 's Episcopal Church closed after 175 years in operation . 
 Scarborough Presbyterian Church , given to the community by Margaret Louisa Vanderbilt Shepard and her husband Colonel Elliott Fitch Shepard ( who lived on the nearby Woodlea estate ) , was the first church in the United States with an electric organ . Built in 1895 and designed by Augustus Haydel ( a nephew of Stanford White ) and Shepard ( a nephew of Elliott Shepard ) — who designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan — the 3 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) church property is also part of the Scarborough Historic District .

 Briarcliff Congregational Church , built in 1896 , has windows by Louis Comfort Tiffany , William Willet , J & R Lamb Studios , Hardman & Co . , and Woodhaven . The church began in a small , one @-@ room schoolhouse ( known as the " white school " ) , built around 1865 and used as a school , a religious school , and a house of worship for up to 60 people . In 1896 , George A. Todd Jr. asked Walter Law to support the construction of a new church . Law donated the church land , making his new church a Congregational one so the entire community ( regardless of religious background ) could attend . The nave and a Norman @-@ style tower were built first , in an English @-@ parish style with Gothic windows . When the congregation outgrew the church , Law funded a northern section ( including transepts and apse ) which was dedicated in 1905 . He donated the church organ ( replacing it in 1924 ) , four Tiffany windows , and the manse across the street . The church housed a weekly indoor farmers ' market at its parish house from 2008 to 2011 , when the market was moved to Pace University 's Briarcliff Campus . 
 Congregation Sons of Israel , self @-@ described as egalitarian Conservative , was the first synagogue in Briarcliff Manor .

 MOA @-@ 2009 @-@ BLG @-@ 387 was a gravitational microlensing event detected by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics collaboration on July 24 , 2009 , which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of stars with other stars or objects ; such alignments cause a gravitational lens effect , which bends light and causes distorted , but magnified , images that can be interpreted . The detection of two caustics were logged over the next few days by the South African Astronomical Observatory , the Perth Observatory , and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania , with a separation of about seven days between caustic events . 
 On June 7 , 2010 , long after the microlensing event had subsided , the science teams studying the star used the NACO adaptive optics facility at the Very Large Telescope in Chile to determine the actual apparent magnitude of the star that <unk> its background star , hoping to compare it to the magnitude of the star measured during the microlensing event .

 = Jon Burge = 
 Jon Graham Burge ( born December 20 , 1947 ) is a convicted felon and former Chicago Police Department detective and commander who gained notoriety for torturing more than 200 criminal suspects between 1972 and 1991 in order to force confessions . A decorated United States Army veteran , Burge served tours in South Korea and Vietnam and continued as an enlisted United States Army Reserve soldier where he served in the military police . He then returned to the South Side of Chicago and began his career as a police officer . Allegations were made about the methods of Burge and those under his command . Eventually , hundreds of similar reports resulted in a decision by Illinois Governor George Ryan to declare a moratorium on death penalty executions in Illinois in 2000 and to clear the state 's death row in 2003 . 
 The most controversial arrests began in February 1982 , in the midst of a series of shootings of Chicago law enforcement officials in Police Area 2 , whose detective squad Burge commanded . Some of the people who confessed to murder were later granted new trials and a few were acquitted or pardoned . Burge was acquitted of police brutality charges in 1989 after a first trial resulted in a hung jury . He was suspended from the Chicago Police Department in 1991 and fired in 1993 after the Police Department Review Board ruled that he had used torture . 
 After Burge was fired , there was a groundswell of support to investigate convictions for which he provided evidence . In 2002 , a special prosecutor began investigating the accusations . The review , which cost $ 17 million , revealed improprieties that resulted in no action due to the statute of limitations . Several convictions were reversed , remanded , or overturned . All Illinois death row inmates received reductions in their sentences . Four of Burge 's victims were pardoned by then @-@ Governor Ryan and subsequently filed a consolidated suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the City of Chicago , various police officers , Cook County and various State 's Attorneys . A $ 19 @.@ 8 million settlement was reached in December 2007 , with the " city defendants " . Cases against Cook County and the other current / former county prosecutors continue as of July 2008 . In October 2008 , Patrick Fitzgerald had Burge arrested on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury in relation to a civil suit regarding the torture allegations against him . On April 1 , 2010 , Judge Joan Lefkow postponed the trial , for the fourth time , to May 24 , 2010 . Burge was convicted on all counts on June 28 , 2010 . He was sentenced to four @-@ and @-@ one @-@ half years in federal prison on January 21 , 2011 and was released in October 2014 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Raised in the South Deering community area on the Southeast Side of Chicago , Burge was the second eldest son of Floyd and Ethel Burge . Floyd was a blue collar worker of Norwegian descent and Ethel was an aspiring fashion writer of mixed Western European descent . Burge attended Bowen High School where he showed a keen interest in the school 's Junior Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( JROTC ) . There he was exposed to military drill , weapons , leadership and military history . He attended the University of Missouri but dropped out after one semester , which ended his draft deferment . He returned to Chicago to work as a stock clerk in the Jewel supermarket chain in 1966 . 
 In June 1966 , Burge enlisted in the army reserve and began six years of service , including two years of active duty . He spent eight weeks at a military police ( MP ) school in Georgia . He also received some training at Fort Benning , Georgia , where he learned interrogation techniques . He volunteered for a tour of duty in the Vietnam War , but instead he became an MP trainer and then served as an MP in South Korea , gathering five letters of appreciation from superiors . On June 18 , 1968 , Burge volunteered for duty in Vietnam a second time , and was assigned to the Ninth Military Police Company of the Ninth Infantry Division . He reported to division headquarters , where he was assigned to provide security as a sergeant at his division base camp , which was named Đồng Tâm by William Westmoreland . Burge described his military police service as time spent escorting convoys , providing security for forward support bases , supervising security for the divisional central base camp in Dong Tam , and then serving a tour as a provost marshal investigator . 
 During his military service , Burge earned a Bronze Star , a Purple Heart , the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry and two Army Commendation Medals for valor , for pulling wounded men to safety while under fire . Burge claimed no knowledge of or involvement in prisoner interrogation , brutality or torture in Vietnam . Burge was honorably discharged from the Army on August 25 , 1969 . However , when reporting on the Chicago Police Department 's ongoing legacy of torture , Ryan Cooper , reporting in The Week magazine , asserted that Burge probably learned to torture in Vietnam , because his preferred technique was to use a hand @-@ cranked generator , a common technique in Vietnam , where hand @-@ cranked field telephones were widely available . 
 = = Police career = = 
 Burge became a police officer in March 1970 at age 22 on the South side of Chicago . In 20 years of service , he earned 13 commendations and a letter of praise from the Department of Justice . In May 1972 , he was promoted to detective and assigned to Area 2 ( Pullman Area ) Robbery . He was later promoted to field lieutenant in the Monroe Street District . From 1981 – 1986 he served as the commander of the Area 2 Violent Crimes Unit until he was promoted to commander of the Bomb and Arson Unit in 1986 . In 1988 , Burge became Area 3 ( Brighton Park ) detective commander . 
 = = = Turning point = = = 
 According to The Guardian , federal prosecutors stated that Burge 's use of torture began in 1972 . However , the most prominent example occurred in 1982 . On February 9 , 1982 , there was an incident on the streets in which a suspect took a police officer 's weapon , then shot and killed both the officer and his partner . This incident occurred within Burge 's jurisdiction ; he was then a lieutenant and commanding officer of Area 2 . The two fatalities brought the total to five officers ( including two Cook County Sheriff 's Officers wounded and a rookie Chicago police officer shot and killed on a CTA bus on February 5 ) who had been shot in the 60 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 160 km2 ) area of the South Side within about a month . 
 Initial interrogation procedures allegedly included shooting pets , handcuffing subjects to stationary objects for entire days , and holding guns to the heads of minors . Jesse Jackson , Operation PUSH spokesmen , the Chicago Defender and black Chicago Police officers were outraged . Renault Robinson , president of Chicago 's Afro American Police League characterized the dragnet operation as " sloppy police work , a matter of racism " , comparing the police action to that of a southern sheriff leading a posse that turned into a lynch mob . Jackson complained that the black community was being held under martial law . After all of the police excesses , mere coincidence enabled the capture of the suspects for the most recent two killings . Tyrone Sims identified Donald " Kojak " White as the shooter , and Kojak was linked to Andrew and Jackie Wilson by having committed a burglary with them earlier on the day of the killings . 
 = = = The torture = = = 
 Andrew Wilson was arrested on the morning of February 14 , 1982 for the murder of the two police officers , and by the end of the day he was in Mercy Hospital and Medical Center with lacerations on various parts of his head , including his face , chest bruises and second @-@ degree thigh burns . It was clear that Wilson had received sufficient injuries to be sent to the hospital , with more than a dozen of them caused while in police custody . During a two @-@ week trial in 1983 , Andrew Wilson was convicted of the killings and given a death penalty sentence , while his brother , Jackie , was convicted as an accomplice and given a life sentence . In 1985 , Jackie 's conviction was overturned by the Illinois Appellate Court because his right to remain silent had not been properly explained . Because Andrew was given a death sentence , his case was not reviewable on the same grounds by the Appellate Court and went directly to the Illinois Supreme Court . In April 1987 , the Supreme Court overturned Andrew 's conviction with a ruling that his confession had been coerced involuntarily out of him while under duress . 
 In October 1987 , the appellate court further ruled that Jackie Wilson should have been tried separately from his brother and that evidence against Andrew Wilson regarding other matters for which the police wanted him was incorrectly admitted . In June 1988 , Andrew was re @-@ convicted . However , with ten women in favor and two men opposed , the jury was unable to agree on his eligibility for the death penalty after five days of deliberation , and the following month he was sentenced to life imprisonment . 
 Seven years after the original arrest , Andrew filed a civil suit stating that he had been beaten , suffocated with a plastic bag , burned ( by cigarette and radiator ) , treated with electric shock , and been the victim of the pattern of a cover @-@ up . Although the suit was against four detectives , a former police superintendent and the City of Chicago , it hinged on the testimonies of plaintiff Wilson and commander Burge , who oversaw all of the alleged activity . 
 Jury selection commenced on February 15 , 1989 . The original two @-@ woman , four @-@ man jury included three African @-@ Americans and one Latino . When Burge took the stand on March 13 , 1989 , he denied claims he injured Andrew Wilson during questioning and denied any knowledge of any such activity by other officers . Wilson 's legal team , led by G. Flint Taylor , received anonymous letters during the trial from a person claiming to be an officer who worked with Burge . This person alleged that the Wilson case was part of a larger pattern of police torture , sanctioned by Burge , of African @-@ American suspects . However , U.S. District Judge Brian Barnett Duff did not permit the jury to hear this evidence . Gradually , charges against other officers were dismissed . On March 15 , 1989 , Sergeant Thomas McKenna was cleared of wrongdoing ; and on March 30 , 1989 , Detectives John Yucaitis and Patrick O 'Hara were unanimously cleared by the jury . However , the jury was at an impasse on the Burge verdict . Judge Duff ordered a retrial for Burge , former Police Supt. Richard Brzeczek and the City of Chicago on two other outstanding charges ( conspiracy and whether the City of Chicago 's policy toward police brutality contributed to Wilson 's injuries ) . Burge was cleared in a second nine @-@ week trial that began on June 9 , 1989 . 
 Burge and other Chicago Police officers allegedly used methods of torture that left few marks . They were accused of slamming telephone books on top of suspect ’ s heads . There were also three separate electrical devices that Burge and his detectives were accused of using : a cattle prod , a hand cranked device , and a violet wand . They allegedly used a Tucker telephone , an old @-@ style hand cranked telephone which generated electricity , and attached wires to the suspect ’ s genitals or face . According to veteran sergeant D. J. Lewis , this is a method of torture common in the Korean War , and usually results in a confession . Burge has denied ever witnessing such telephone torture procedures . The violet wand was said to be regularly placed either on the anus , into the rectum or against the victim 's exposed genitals . They also used stun guns and adapted hair dryers . Burge and officers under his command also allegedly engaged in mock executions , in putting plastic bags over heads , cigarette burnings and severe beatings . At one point he is alleged to have supervised the electrical shocking of a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , Marcus Wiggins . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 The verdict that cleared Burge and his colleagues also found that the City of Chicago employed a policy of using excessive force on suspected killers of police officers . Initial reports of torture appeared in the pages of the alternative weekly the Chicago Reader in 1990 . By 1990 there was growing momentum to an effort to seek disciplinary action against Burge . An investigation conducted by Chicago Police Department 's Office of Professional Standards concluded that Jon Burge and his detectives engaged in " methodical " and " systematic " torture , and " The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating , but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture . " 
 Danny K. Davis turned police brutality and excessive force into a Chicago mayoral race campaign issue for the February 26 , 1991 Democratic Primary . He sought an independent citizens ' review . On January 28 , 1991 , Amnesty International called for an investigation into police torture in Chicago . After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley showed reluctance to follow the Amnesty International directive , Davis raised an issue about a police coverup . Eventually , after pressure by citizens ' organizations and anti @-@ brutality organizations , an internal investigation resumed . 
 In 1991 , Gregory Banks filed suit against Burge , three colleagues and the City of Chicago for condoning brutality and torture . The allegation was related to a false 1983 confession to murder obtained by placing a plastic bag over Banks ' head , putting a gun in his mouth and other acts . There were eleven other suspects that the officers allegedly abused with brutality such as electro @-@ shock . The suit was brought by the same attorneys who represented Andrew Wilson in the previous 1989 brutality case . The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 1972 – 1985 . A third suit was brought against Burge in 1993 . The Banks suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abusive handling . Dignan was promoted later for meritorious service despite the fact that the City of Chicago settled out of court with Banks . 
 In November 1991 , the Chicago Police Department Office of Professional Standards , an internal review division for police misconduct , acknowledged an October 25 , 1991 request for action against Burge . This type of request was a common precursor to a police dismissal and gave the City of Chicago 's Corporation counsel 30 days to consider the report . Burge was suspended pending separation for 30 days starting on November 8 , 1991 . The Chicago Police Board set a November 25 hearing to formalize the firing of Burge and two detectives based on 30 counts of abuse and brutality against Wilson . The hearing related to the internal police investigation finding that Burge and Detective John Yucaitis physically abused Wilson in 1982 , while Detective Patrick O 'Hara did nothing to stop them . The suspension became controversial after the 30 day period ended and the officers remained suspended without pay . They sued for reinstatement , but their reinstatements were denied . During the hearing an internal report that had been suppressed for years revealed police review findings that criminal suspects were subjected to systematic brutality at the Area 2 detective headquarters for 12 years and that supervisory commanders had knowledge of the abuses . During the trial , several alleged victims testified against Burge . 
 The internal hearing concluded in March 1992 , and the Chicago Police Board found Burge guilty of " physically abusing " an accused murderer 11 years earlier and ordered his firing from the police force on February 10 , 1993 . Detectives John Yucaitis and Patrick O 'Hara were given 15 @-@ month suspensions without pay and reinstated , which amounted to a penalty equal to time served . Upon reinstatement the two detectives were initially demoted , but almost a year later they were reinstated at full @-@ rank with <unk> for time served while demoted . Burge attempted to have the ruling overturned , but the suspension and subsequent firing was upheld . 
 The internal hearing resulted in a situation in which the City of Chicago was employing lawyers to defend Burge during an appeal by Wilson and a new case by Banks while employing lawyers to prosecute him on departmental charges . The City of Chicago had to hire outside counsel to prosecute the detectives at the internal hearing . After having spent $ 750 @,@ 000 to defend Burge in the Wilson hearing , the City of Chicago was in a dilemma about whether to follow normal practices and pay for the defense of its police officers . 
 In 1993 , Wilson was granted a new hearing by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . The ruling was based on the fact that the exoneration of the officers resulted from a trial strategy to " immerse the jury in the sordid details of Wilson 's crimes " rather than focus on a suspect 's " right to be free from torture and the correlative right to present his claim of torture to a jury that has not been whipped into a frenzy of hatred " .

 In 1998 , Bianca Jagger , Anthony Amsterdam , George N. Leighton , Abner Mikva , R. Eugene Pincham and representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School , and by the London @-@ based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson who was allegedly tortured into a confession . 
 In 1999 , lawyers for several death row inmates began to call for a special review of the convictions based on evidence extracted by Burge and his colleagues . These inmates ( Aaron Patterson ; Madison Hobley ; Stanley Howard ; Leonard Kidd ; Derrick King ; Ronald Kitchen ; Reginald Mahaffey ; Jerry Mahaffey ; Andrew Maxwell , and Leroy Orange ) became known as the " Death Row 10 " . In a report called the Goldston Report , the City of Chicago enumerated 50 alleged instances of police brutality and abuse by Burge and other officers . The City of Chicago struggled with the issue of coerced confessions for decades and in the 1990s it quietly reopened several controversial brutality cases . Despite an extensive investigation into the actions by a number of police employees , few others but Burge were sanctioned . 
 Several politicians , including US Representative Bobby Rush , requested that State 's Attorney Richard A. Devine seek new trials for the Death Row 10 who were allegedly tortured by Burge . Devine met with representatives and supporters of the inmates and was convinced to request that the Illinois Supreme Court stay proceedings against three of the inmates . However , the Supreme Court denied Devine 's request . Rush also sought out Janet Reno to pursue federal intervention . 
 In February 1999 , David <unk> , a Northwestern University journalism professor and his students uncovered exonerating evidence on behalf of Death Row inmate Anthony Porter . The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that placed the guilt on another suspect . <unk> of testimony at trial were among the affidavits obtained . One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter after police officers threatened , harassed and intimidated him into doing so . 
 In 2000 , Governor Ryan halted executions in Illinois after courts found that 13 death row inmates had been wrongfully convicted . Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates . Given the number of cases of alleged brutality , allegedly coerced inmates were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges . A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim . Devine made a broader offer to several inmates . Aaron Patterson rejected the plea . 
 On January 11 , 2003 , having lost confidence in the state 's penal system , outgoing Republican Governor George Ryan commuted the death sentences of 167 prisoners on Illinois ’ death row . He decided to grant clemency to all death row inmates by converting death sentences to sentences of life without parole in most cases and reducing some sentences . In addition , Ryan pardoned four death row inmates : Madison Hobley , Aaron Patterson , Leroy Orange and Stanley Howard , who were among the ten who claimed wrongful imprisonment . In the unusual proceeding , the governor took the extraordinary step of a direct pardon release rather than a court proceeding . 
 Daley , at the time the Cook County State 's Attorney , has been accused by the Illinois General Assembly of failing to act on information he possessed on the conduct of Burge and others . Daley has acknowledged his responsibility to be proactive in stopping the torture , but denies any knowledge which could have made him responsible . On July 19 , 2006 , US Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. issued a press release calling Mayor Daley culpable , possibly even criminally culpable , for his failure to prosecute until the statute of limitations had run out . Jackson called for an investigation to determine if there was any planned delay to allow the cases to expire . Eventually , death penalty opponents requested that U.S. President Bill Clinton follow Ryan 's lead in halting executions . In August 2000 , The Illinois Supreme Court reversed or remanded two Burge @-@ related death row cases based on allegations of torture by police . 
 After being pardoned by Governor Ryan , Burge 's victims began to file lawsuits . Madison Hobley was the first of the four pardoned inmates to file suit in May 2003 . Aaron Patterson followed in June with his own suit , and Stanley Howard filed suit in November . Eventually , the City of Chicago agreed to a $ 20 million settlement with the four pardoned inmates . Another result of the pardons was a series of legislative death penalty reforms that Ryan 's successor Rod Blagojevich vetoed . By 2005 , the state mandated video recording of interrogations in homicide cases . Barack Obama had pushed the mandated video recording bill through the Illinois State Senate in 2003 . One of the four men pardoned by Ryan , Madison Hobley , would sue Burge for the torture . Ultimately , it was answers Burge gave in a deposition in Hobley 's lawsuit that allowed Burge to be charged with perjury . 
 = = = Review = = = 
 In 2002 , the Cook County Bar Association , the Justice Coalition of Chicago and others petitioned for a review of the allegations against Burge . Edward Egan , a former prosecutor , Illinois Appellate Court jurist , and <unk> lawyer who lived in Florida , was appointed as a Special State 's Attorney ( a / k / a " special prosecutor " ) to investigate allegations dating back to 1973 . He hired an assistant , several lawyers and retired Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) agents . The only prior official investigation , which resulted in Burge 's firing , had been by the Office of Professional Standards , which determined that " the preponderance of evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic . " Former prosecutor Robert D. Boyle was also appointed as a special prosecutor . In 2003 , former Chief of the Special Prosecution Division of the U.S. Attorney 's Office Gordon B. Nash Jr. was appointed as an additional special prosecutor . 
 A total of 60 cases were ordered to be reviewed . A special prosecutor was hired because Cook County State 's Attorney , Richard Devine , had a conflict of interest stemming from his tenure at the law firm of Phelan , Pope & John , which defended Burge in two federal suits . Criminal Courts Judge Paul P. Biebel Jr. presided over the determination of the need of a review to determine the propriety of criminal charges and the appointment of the special prosecutor . 
 During the written phase of the investigation Burge and eight other officers pleaded the Fifth Amendment . On September 1 , 2004 , Burge was served with a subpoena to testify before a grand jury in an ongoing criminal investigation of police torture while in town for depositions on civil lawsuits at his attorney 's office . Burge pleaded the Fifth Amendment to virtually every question during a 4 @-@ hour civil case deposition . He only answered questions about his name , his boat 's name ( Vigilante ) and his $ 30 @,@ 000 annual pension . The City of Chicago continues to be bound by court order to pay for Burge 's legal fees . The service of the subpoena was quite storied with Burge eluding servers at Midway Airport and a team placed at his lawyer 's office before dawn . Eventually , several police officers were granted immunity in order to further the investigation into Burge . 
 Three years into the investigation no criminal charges had been filed although several civil suits were filed in federal court . By that time , a total of 139 victims were involved in the case as well as 19 investigators . Disappointment on the progress caused the victims to request the Inter @-@ American Commission on Human Rights allot them an hour @-@ long hearing at their October 2005 session . 
 On May 19 , 2006 an initial ruling was made to release the special report on torture accusations . On June 20 , 2006 , the Illinois Supreme Court unblocked the release of the special report by Egan that took 4 years and cost $ 17 million . In the end 148 cases were evaluated . The investigation revealed that in three of the cases prosecutors could have proved beyond a reasonable doubt in court that torture by the police involving five former officers including Burge had occurred . Half of the claims were deemed credible , but because of the statute of limitations no indictments were handed out . Mayor Daley and all law enforcement officials who had been deposed were excluded from the report . Also , the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked with the report focusing on doubts about the actual torture of pardoned death row inmates . Among the final costs were $ 6 @.@ 2 million for the investigation and $ 7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohorts . Although the statute of limitations argument was a disappointment to many , the argument was very elaborately detailed in an 18 @-@ page section of the report . Debates in the op @-@ ed pages continued for days and Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues . 
 On the same day of the initial ruling to release the special report was made , the 36th session of the United Nations Committee Against Torture issued its " Conclusions and recommendations of the Committee against Torture " report of the United States . The document states , " The Committee is concerned at allegations of impunity of some of the State party ’ s law @-@ enforcement personnel in respect of acts of torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . The Committee notes the limited investigation and lack of prosecution in respect of the allegations of torture perpetrated in areas 2 and 3 of the Chicago Police Department ( art . 12 ) . The State party should promptly , thoroughly and impartially investigate all allegations of acts of torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by law @-@ enforcement personnel and bring perpetrators to justice , in order to fulfil its obligations under article 12 of the Convention . The State party should also provide the Committee with information on the ongoing investigations and prosecution relating to the above @-@ mentioned case . " 
 In 2002 , Special State 's Attorney ( a / k / a " special prosecutor " ) Egan was appointed by Judge Paul P. Biebel , Jr . , Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Circuit Court of Cook County , who directed Egan to investigate ( and , if appropriate , prosecute ) the accusations . Egan 's review , which cost $ 17 million , revealed improprieties that resulted in no action due to the statute of limitations . 
 Four of Burge 's death row inmate victims — Aaron Patterson , LeRoy Orange , <unk> Howard , and Madison Hobley — filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the City of Chicago , Burge , several of Burge 's former subordinate police detectives , Cook County , and a few current and former State 's Attorneys and assistant state 's attorneys of Cook County ( the precise list of police officers and prosecutors varied somewhat from plaintiff to plaintiff ) . Although each case was randomly assigned to a different district judge , the parties all consented to have the four cases consolidated for discovery management before Magistrate Judge Geraldine <unk> Brown . A settlement of $ 19 @.@ 8 million was reached in December 2007 between the plaintiffs and the so @-@ called " city defendants " consisting of the City of Chicago , Burge , the other former detectives , and former Cook County State 's Attorney ( and Mayor of Chicago at the time of the settlement ) Richard M. Daley . The cases against Cook County and the other current / former prosecutors continue as of July 2008 . Having never been convicted of a felony , Burge continues to receive a police pension to which he is entitled under Illinois state law . 
 After being fired , Burge lived in Apollo Beach , Florida , a suburb of Tampa . In 1994 , he bought his current wood @-@ frame home for $ 154 @,@ 000 and a 22 ft ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) motorboat . While a police officer Burge had owned a 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) cabin cruiser named The Vigilante that he maintained at Burnham Harbor . Upon retiring at full pension he ran a fishing business in Florida . The precise amount of his pension is not a matter of public record , but he was eligible for 50 % of his approximately $ 60 @,@ 000 salary . 
 The torture revelations led to actions to mandate videotaping of confessions . The case has been chronicled in various formats in the mass media . The book Unspeakable Acts , Ordinary People ( 2001 , ISBN 0 @-@ 520 @-@ <unk> @-@ 6 ) by John Conroy includes four chapters on Burge 's story . Also , the 1994 Public Broadcasting Service documentary film , co @-@ produced with Peter Kuttner , that was entitled The End of the <unk> , analyzed the torture charges against Burge . 
 = = Arrest = = 
 Although Burge had been presumed to be protected by a statute of limitations , the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , Patrick Fitzgerald , in October 2008 charged Burge with two counts of obstruction of justice and one count of perjury . Burge was arrested on October 21 , 2008 at his home in Apollo Beach by FBI agents . 
 Under the charges , Burge could have been subject to 40 years in prison for the two obstruction counts and five years on the perjury count . The charges were the result of convicted felon Madison Hobley 's 2003 civil rights lawsuit alleging police beatings , electric shocks and death threats by Burge and other officers against dozens of criminal suspects . 
 Burge pleaded not guilty and was released on $ 250 @,@ 000 bond . Fitzgerald noted that although Burge was being charged with lying and not the torture to which the statute of limitations applied , he believed Burge to be guilty of both . In the October 21 press conference , Fitzgerald stated that Burge had " lied and impeded court proceedings " during his 2003 written testimony . In the indictment , the prosecution stated that Burge understood that he was a participant in and was aware of " such events involving the abuse or torture of people in custody " . The trial had been set for May 11 , 2009 . Instead , on April 29 , Burge filed a change @-@ of @-@ venue motion and the trial in relation to a lawsuit filed by former Death Row inmate Madison Hobley was set for October 29 , 2009 . 
 Also in April , Cortez Brown , who had sought a new trial with respect to two 1990 murders and who had already subpoenaed two Chicago police detectives for his May 18 , 2009 hearing , won the right to subpoena Burge from a Cook County Judge . Burge was expected to exercise his 5th Amendment right not to incriminate himself . However , the Florida judge refused to grant such a subpoena given the likelihood that Burge would exercise this right . 
 On May 6 , jury selection began for the trial . 80 potential jurors were given a 29 @-@ page questionnaire to complete . Attorneys had until May 24 to review the questionnaires before final jury selection began . An additional batch of 90 potential jurors was given a questionnaire on May 17 . The trial heard its first testimony on May 26 . Burge testified in his own defense for six hours on June 17 and on subsequent days . Closing arguments were heard on June 24 , and jury deliberations began on June 25 . On June 28 , Burge was convicted on all three counts : two counts of obstruction of justice and one count of perjury . 
 On January 21 , 2011 , Burge was sentenced to four and a half years in federal prison by U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow , who had refused to withdraw from the case . The federal probation office had recommended a 15- to 21 @-@ month sentence , while prosecutors had requested as much as 30 years . Burge served his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Butner Low near Butner , North Carolina , about 45 miles ( 72 km ) northwest of Raleigh , where he was Bureau of Prisons Register # <unk> @-@ 018 . Burge 's projected release date was February 14 , 2015 . However , he was released from prison on October 3 , 2014 . 
 There are plans to file federal civil lawsuits against Burge , Daley and others .

 Spencer Ackerman , writing in The Guardian , reported settlements from lawsuits over Burge 's use of torture , and other expenses , had cost the Police Department over $ 100 million . Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge 's . However , Ackerman states that the two officers never served together . 
 = = Reparations = = 
 On April 14 , 2015 , the Mayor of Chicago , Rahm Emanuel , announced the creation of a $ 5 @.@ 5 million city fund for individuals who could prove that they were victimized by Burge . Burge said he found it hard to believe that Chicago political leadership could " even contemplate giving reparations to human vermin " . The fund was approved by the Chicago City Council on May 6 , 2015 . 
 In approving the reparations , Chicago became the first municipal government to approve compensating victims with valid claims of police torture . Under the terms , about 60 living victims would each be eligible to receive up to $ 100 @,@ 000 . The living survivors , their immediate families , and the immediate families of the deceased torture victims would also gain access to services , including psychological counseling and free tuition to the City Colleges of Chicago . Additionally , the city approved building a public memorial to the deceased victims and established a requirement that students in the eighth and tenth grades attending Chicago Public Schools learn about the Burge legacy . At the May Council meeting , as more than a dozen Burge survivors looked on , Mayor Emanuel offered an official apology on behalf of the City of Chicago , and the aldermen stood and applauded . G. Flint Taylor , who was part of the legal team that negotiated the deal , stated in an interview that the “ non @-@ financial reparations make it truly historic . Taylor predicted that the reparations will be a “ beacon for other cities here and across the world for dealing with racist police brutality . ” 
 = Eriophorum angustifolium = 
 Eriophorum angustifolium , commonly known as common cottongrass or common <unk> , is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae . Native to North America , North Asia , and Northern Europe , it is often found on peat or acidic soils , in open wetland , heath or moorland . It begins to flower in April or May and , after fertilisation in early summer , the small , unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle @-@ like seed @-@ heads that resemble tufts of cotton ; combined with its ecological suitability to bog , these characteristics give rise to the plant 's alternative name , bog cotton . 
 Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy , herbaceous , rhizomatous , perennial sedge , able to endure in a variety of environments in the temperate , subarctic and arctic regions of Earth . Unlike Gossypium , the genus from which cotton is derived , the bristles which grow on E. angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing . Nevertheless , in Northern Europe , they were used as a substitute in the production of paper , pillows , candle @-@ wicks , and wound @-@ dressings . The indigenous peoples of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems . Following a vote in 2002 , Plantlife International designated E. angustifolium the County Flower of Greater Manchester , as part of its British County Flowers campaign . 
 = = Description = = 
 In the wild , Eriophorum angustifolium is a creeping rhizomatous perennial sedge , with an abundance of unbranched , translucent pink roots . Fully grown , it has a tall , erect stem shaped like a narrow cylinder or triangular prism ; it is smooth in texture and green in colour . Reports of the plant 's height vary ; estimates include up to 60 cm ( 24 in ) , 15 – 75 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 – 29 @.@ 5 in ) , and up to 100 cm ( 39 in ) . E. angustifolium has " stiff grass @-@ like foliage " consisting of long , narrow solidly dark green leaves , which have a single central groove , and narrow from their 2 – 6 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 08 – 0 @.@ 24 in ) wide base to a rust @-@ coloured triangular tip . Up to seven green and brown aerial peduncles and <unk> , roughly 4 – 10 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 39 in ) in size , protrude from umbels at the top of the stem from which <unk> are produced after fertilisation , each with a single pappus ; these combine to form a distinctive white perianth around 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) long . 
 Eriophorum angustifolium is described as " a rather dull plant " in winter and spring , but " simply breathtaking " in summer and autumn , when 1 – 7 conspicuous inflorescences – composed of hundreds of white pappi comparable to cotton , hair , tassels , and / or bristles – stand out against naturally drab surroundings . 
 Eriophorum angustifolium differs from other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology . Its multiple flower heads and growth from rhizomes distinguish it from E. vaginatum , which has a single flower head and grows from dense tussocks . Although E. latifolium has 2 – 12 flower heads , it has <unk> caespitose ( tufted ) growth , and its pappi are forked . The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E. angustifolium from E. gracile , which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has <unk> ( rough ) peduncles . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 Eriophorum angustifolium is native to the Northern Hemisphere , and distributed across Eurasia , North America and the British Isles , where there is open bog , heath , wetland and moorland , with standing water and calcareous peat or acidic soil . It can survive in the Subarctic and Arctic , and is found in Alaska , Finland and Greenland as far north as 83 ° N. The British botanist William Turner <unk> @-@ Dyer recorded E. angustifolium in the South African Republic in 1898 . 
 In North America , Eriophorum angustifolium is found in the north from Alaska through Manitoba and the Canadian Prairies to Newfoundland and Labrador , down the Pacific Northwest and the state of Washington , across the Midwestern United States through Michigan and Iowa , down the Eastern Seaboard as far south @-@ east as New York and New Jersey , and reaching as far south @-@ west as New Mexico . In Eurasia , E. angustifolium is distributed throughout the Caucasus , European Russia and North Asia , including Siberia and the Kamchatka Peninsula , and south @-@ east to Manchuria and Korea . It grows throughout continental Europe , with the exception of those parts within the Mediterranean Basin , growing in Scandinavia in the north , and as far south as the Norte Region of Portugal and the <unk> Mountains of Greece . 
 Eriophorum angustifolium is the most common of the four native species of Eriophorum in the British Isles , and has been recorded as having existed in all vice @-@ counties , thriving particularly well in Ireland and northern and western regions of Great Britain , but less so in southern and eastern areas . In the mires of Northern Ireland and the South Pennines , it considered a ruderal , pioneer and keystone species , because it can quickly colonise and repair damaged or eroded peat , encourage the re @-@ vegetation of its surroundings , and retain sediment and its landscape to serve as a carbon sink . In central and southern counties of England , the species is rare or absent , and was " completely destroyed " in Cambridgeshire , The Broads , The Fens and other parts of the East of England by human activities such as land reclamation . Within the British Isles , E. angustifolium thrives at a range of altitudes from sea @-@ level fens and lowland meadows , to exposed upland moors when provided with a habitat of acid bog or waterlogged heath . It has an altitudinal limit of 1 @,@ 100 metres ( 3 @,@ 600 ft ) above sea level , reaching 854 metres ( 2 @,@ 802 ft ) in the Wicklow Mountains of Ireland , and 1 @,@ 060 metres ( 3 @,@ 480 ft ) in the Scottish Highlands . 
 = = = Ecology = = = 
 Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy , herbaceous , rhizomatous , perennial plant , meaning that it is resilient to cold and freezing climatic conditions , dies back at the end of its growing season , has creeping <unk> , and lives for over two years . It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2 – 5 years , and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed , cut or eroded peat . E. angustifolium is protogynous . 
 Sexual reproduction in Eriophorum angustifolium begins with flowering in spring or early summer ( in or around May ) , when groups of 3 – 5 brown flowers are produced . Fertilisation usually takes place in May or June , via <unk> ( wind @-@ pollination ) , and the white bristle @-@ like perianth , composed of <unk> with pappi ( seeds with hairs ) then grows outwards to appear like short tufts of cotton thread . These pappi endure well into summer , lasting from around June to September . Like the pappus of Taraxacum ( dandelions ) , this aids in wind @-@ dispersal , and also serves as thermal insulation , conserving the temperature of the plant 's reproductive organs by trapping solar radiation . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Eriophorum angustifolium has a NatureServe conservation status of G5 , meaning that the species is considered to be ecologically secure by NatureServe , lacking any threats to its global abundance . 
 = = In human culture = = 
 Eriophorum angustifolium seeds and stems are edible and are used in traditional Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives , Inuit and Inupiat people . The leaves and roots of E. angustifolium are also edible and , because of their astringent properties , used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes , through a process of decoction , infusion or poultice , to treat <unk> of the human gastrointestinal tract , and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea . In abundance , E. angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog . Consequently , it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through . Attempts to make a cotton @-@ like thread from the hairs of the plant 's seed @-@ heads have been thwarted by its brittleness , but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany , and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex , England . In Scotland , during World War I , it was used to dress wounds . 
 In 2002 , the County Flowers campaign of Plantlife International , which asked members of the public to nominate and vote for a wildflower emblem for each of the counties and metropolitan areas of the United Kingdom , resulted in Eriophorum angustifolium being announced as the County Flower of Greater Manchester . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was named Eriophorum angustifolium in 1782 by the German botanist Gerhard August <unk> . The German botanist Albrecht Wilhelm Roth published this name in 1788 , referring to <unk> 's work , and is sometimes erroneously considered the author of the species name . The genus name Eriophorum consists of two Ancient Greek roots – <unk> ( <unk> , " wool " ) and <unk> ( <unk> , " <unk> " ) – referring to the fibrous seed @-@ heads of the genus , which resemble tufts of thread . The specific epithet angustifolium is composed of the Latin words angustus ( " narrow " ) and folium ( " leaf " ) . The Linnaean name Eriophorum <unk> is a nomen <unk> , being based on a mixed batch of specimens . Scirpus <unk> is a later combination published by the Japanese botanist Tetsuo Koyama in 1958 , but this generic assignment is not widely accepted . 
 Two subspecies are recognised within E. angustifolium . The <unk> subspecies , E. angustifolium subsp. angustifolium , is found in more southerly sites , while E. angustifolium subsp. triste has an overlapping distribution centred further north . The two also differ in height and the roughness of the peduncles , with E. a. subsp. angustifolium being up to 100 cm ( 39 in ) tall and having smooth @-@ surfaced peduncles , while E. a. subsp. triste has rough peduncles and only reaches 30 cm ( 12 in ) tall . 
 In English , E. angustifolium is known by a variety of common names ( with various spellings ) , including common cottongrass , common cotton @-@ grass , common <unk> , tassel cotton grass , many @-@ headed cotton @-@ grass , thin @-@ scale cotton @-@ grass , tall cotton @-@ grass , downy ling and bog cotton . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Although " difficult to grow under cultivation " , The Royal Horticultural Society states Eriophorum angustifolium can be cultivated as a low @-@ maintenance wildflower , suitable for meadows , ponds margins or bog gardens . This may be done in sheltered or exposed terrain , but best accomplished with full sun at a <unk> or west @-@ facing aspect , in water up to 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) deep . Poorly @-@ drained peat , sand , clay or loam with an acidic soil pH is required . Division in spring is the recommended form of propagation for the species , and regular deadheading is the recommended method of pruning . <unk> <unk> and Myrica gale are suitable for companion planting with E. angustifolium . Eriophorum angustifolium is " generally pest free " . As a seedling and young plant it is eaten by sheep and cattle , and a variety of goose species . It is tolerant to chalybeate ( iron @-@ enriched ) water , but may succumb to powdery <unk> . 
 = Wings ( Bonnie Tyler album ) = 
 Wings is the fifteenth studio album by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler . It was released in Europe on 14 May 2005 by Stick Music , and on 12 June 2006 in the UK under the title Celebrate . The album spawned two singles , " Louise " and " Celebrate " . The majority of newly written tracks were composed by Tyler and French songwriters Paul D. Fitzgerald and Karen Drotar , and produced by Jean Lahcene ( under the pseudonym of John Stage ) . Tyler also recorded new versions of her international hits " It 's a Heartache " and " Total Eclipse of the Heart " . 
 Reviews of the album were mixed , with music critics arguing that Tyler 's best work comes through her pairing with Jim Steinman . The album only charted in France in 2005 , peaking at number 133 .

 In January 2004 , Tyler was number one in France with her bilingual song " Si <unk> ... ( Turn Around ) " , which boosted sales of her then @-@ current studio album Simply Believe . Still working in France , Tyler went on to collaborate with French producer Jean Lahcene to put together another album . Wings was released on 14 May 2005 , and would be her last album for eight years before the release of Rocks and Honey . Tyler co @-@ wrote nine of the tracks for Wings ; this was the first time in Tyler 's career that she had been directly involved in the composition of her songs . The album was recorded at the Pasteur Studio in Paris , France , and " All I Need Is Love " and " I 'll Stand By You " were recorded at Stuart Emerson 's studio in the UK . Wings features two tracks written by Stuart Emerson , one of which was a duet with his partner and Tyler 's friend , Lorraine Crosby . Emerson also contributed to Tyler 's 1995 album Free Spirit and 2004 album Simply Believe . Two of the tracks , " Louise " and " Celebrate " are also featured on the album in French . 
 Wings was released in the United Kingdom under the title Celebrate in 2006 . The UK version omitted the French versions of the two singles . 
 Other releases including live performances of songs from Wings include the DVD Bonnie on Tour ( 2006 ) , the live CD Bonnie Tyler Live ( 2006 ) and The Complete Bonnie Tyler ( 2007 ) ; a CD and DVD pack that included Tyler 's DVD Bonnie on Tour and Wings .

 The album received a mixed review from Tomas <unk> of Allmusic . He described the album as " safe , " and added that it " serves as a herald that Tyler should be re @-@ teaming with a producer of Jim Steinman 's caliber to bring out the best in her inimitable voice . " After pointing out that the album did have some high points , he concluded that the album was , however , forgettable . 
 When released in the UK as Celebrate , Elly Roberts ( of <unk> Magazine ) praised the album . She said : " The voice , as unique as you ’ ll find by a female singer , is as coarse as ever . Her band is as hot as anything on the scene ( the lead guitarist is outstanding ) , with superb production at every level . " Talking about the track " Run Run Run " , she described it as a " typical chart friendly affair , full of wailing guitar solos , and a catchy chorus that would grace any party dancefloor " , and predicted that the track could possibly become her next anthem .

 = Numedal Line = 
 The Numedal Line ( Norwegian : <unk> ) is a 92 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometer ( 57 @.@ 7 mi ) long railway line that runs up the Numedal valley between Kongsberg and Rødberg in Buskerud , Norway . Built and operated by the Norwegian State Railways , the non @-@ electrified , standard gauge line passes through the municipalities of Kongsberg , Flesberg , Rollag and Nore og Uvdal . It is now owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . 
 The first plans for a line through Numedal were launched after the Sørland Line reached in Kongsberg in 1871 . After it was decided that the Bergen Line would instead follow Hallingdal , the Numedal plans lay dead until it was decided that a railway was necessary to build two hydroelectric power stations near Rødberg . The plans were passed in 1918 , the first trains started running in 1924 and the line was officially opened in 1927 . At first all services were provided with steam locomotives , but from the 1930s diesel multiple units were used for passenger trains . The line was frequented with classes <unk> 16 , 86 , 87 and 91 . The last regular train ran in 1988 ; since , there has been sporadic freight service and some heritage trains running from Kongsberg to Rollag . <unk> rental is available on the section from Veggli to Rødberg . 
 In 2013 , <unk> reopened a <unk> stretch between Kongsberg and Flesberg , to support the forestry industry . Following a derailment in April 2014 , the entire stretch was upgraded with new sleepers .

 The Numedal Line branches off from the Sørland Line at Kongsberg Station , which is located 99 @.@ 37 kilometers ( 61 @.@ 75 mi ) from Oslo Central Station and 161 @.@ 9 meters ( 531 ft ) above mean sea level ( AMSL ) . The line runs past four stops , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , before reaching a branch to Svene Gravel Pit , 3 @.@ 48 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 16 mi ) from Kongsberg . The line continues past the halts <unk> , Svene , <unk> and <unk> before reaching <unk> Station , 10 @.@ 50 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 52 mi ) from Kongsberg . The line then passes over <unk> on a 27 @-@ meter ( 89 ft ) bridge and continues past the stops <unk> , Ruud , <unk> and <unk> before reaching the branch to the sawmill Numedal Bruk , 29 @.@ 69 kilometers ( 18 @.@ 45 mi ) from Kongsberg , which is located just south of Flesberg Station . 
 The line continues past the stops <unk> , <unk> and <unk> before reaching the 228 @-@ meter ( 748 ft ) Helle Tunnel and then <unk> Station 40 @.@ 63 kilometers ( 25 @.@ 25 mi ) after Kongsberg . The line then runs through the 78 @-@ meter ( 256 ft ) Ulvik Tunnel and the 57 @-@ meter ( 187 ft ) <unk> Tunnel . It then passes the halt <unk> before running through the 44 @-@ meter ( 144 ft ) <unk> Tunnel . After passing through the halt <unk> , the line reaches Rollag Station , which is 46 @.@ 80 kilometers ( 29 @.@ 08 mi ) from Kongsberg . Since 1989 , this is the furthest north the line is kept operational , although the track remains all the way to Rødberg . 
 The line continues past the stops <unk> , Rollag kirke , Bråten , <unk> , over the 65 @-@ meter ( 213 ft ) <unk> Bridge , past the stops <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and then passes over the river Veggli <unk> on a 30 @-@ meter ( 98 ft ) long bridge . At 60 @.@ 81 kilometers ( 37 @.@ 79 mi ) after Kongsberg the line reaches Veggli Station , before continuing past the stops <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and then through two tunnels , <unk> I and <unk> II , which are 572 meters ( 1 @,@ 877 ft ) and 246 meters ( 807 ft ) long , respectively . The line then passes by the stops <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a 30 @-@ meter ( 98 ft ) bridge over <unk> , the stops <unk> , <unk> and the 146 @-@ meter ( 479 ft ) <unk> Tunnel . The line then runs past the stop <unk> and Søndre Sandnes before running through five tunnels , named Sandnes I and II , <unk> I and II , and <unk> , which are between 12 and 140 meters ( 39 and 459 ft ) long . Just before <unk> Station , which is 87 @.@ 39 kilometers ( 54 @.@ 30 mi ) from Kongsberg , there is a branch to Nore II Power Station . 
 The line then runs through six tunnels , named <unk> I through V , and <unk> . These are between 156 and 16 metres ( 512 and 52 ft ) long . The line then passes past Rødberg <unk> , which is 90 @.@ 92 kilometers ( 56 @.@ 50 mi ) form Kongsberg and is , at 395 @.@ 0 metres ( 1 @,@ 295 @.@ 9 ft ) AMSL the highest point on the line . The line then passes over <unk> on a 35 @-@ meter ( 115 ft ) combined road and rail bridge , before reaching Rødberg , 92 @.@ 84 kilometers ( 57 @.@ 69 mi ) from Kongsberg . 
 = = History = = 
 With the construction of the Sørland Line to Kongsberg , which opened on 10 November 1871 , proposals were launched to extend the line up Numedal . On 16 August 1873 , a meeting was held between representatives from the municipalities in Numedal to discuss how they could convince national politicians to build the Bergen Line through Numedal . However , instead the Bergen Line was decided to run through Hallingdal . What finally spurred the construction was the construction of hydroelectric power stations in the valley . In 1907 , the government , through its power agency , had secured rights to build a power station in the rivers <unk> and <unk> . The state saw it as advantageous to build a railway through the valley to aid construction of Nore I and Nore II Power Station , despite the line not being on the railway plan . This was because machines weighing up to 40 tonnes ( 39 long tons ; 44 short tons ) would have to be transported up the valley . The initial estimates for the line was a cost of 8 @.@ 3 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) . 
 On 3 August 1918 , the line was passed by the Parliament of Norway and it was decided that the line was to be built with standard gauge , which by then had become the norm . The decision was controversial , as the line was expected to have little traffic and would therefore not be profitable . A minority of the parliamentarians instead wanted the line to be built with narrow gauge to reduce construction costs . The state required that local municipalities and counties contributed to some of the investment costs . NOK 1 @.@ 2 million was paid by Buskerud County Municipality , while NOK 2 @.@ 17 million million was paid by the various municipalities . The largest amounts were paid by Flesberg with NOK 635 @,@ 000 , Nore with NOK 615 @,@ 000 and Rollag with NOK 517 @,@ 000 , while Uvdal paid NOK 198 @,@ 000 , Kongsberg NOK 125 @,@ 000 and Drammen NOK 80 @,@ 000 . 
 Siting commenced in 1918 , and by 1919 , an administration for the works had been established in Kongsberg . Construction commenced on 2 July 1920 , between <unk> and <unk> . However , there quickly arose a strike , resulting in construction not being taken up until March 1921 . Final approval by parliament was first made on 20 July 1921 . Most of the construction was done using hand tools . 543 @,@ 000 cubic meters ( 19 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of earth was moved , 217 @,@ 000 cubic meters ( 7 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of rock was blasted and 2 @.@ 3 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) of tunnel were built . 190 @,@ 000 cubic meters ( 6 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of ballast stone were used , most of it from the gravel pits at <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The whole construction used seven million work hours and for the tunneling , each work hour gave 7 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) of progress . Most of the tracks were used from other railways . Five of the station buildings , at <unk> , Flesberg , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , were workmen 's sheds which had been placed on a foundation . 
 From 1924 , the railway was taken partially into use . Trains could run the 36 kilometers ( 22 mi ) from Kongsberg to <unk> from 15 November 1924 , the 65 kilometers ( 40 mi ) to <unk> from 1 December 1925 and to Rødberg from 1 December 1926 . These trains included transport of 950 tonnes ( 930 long tons ; 1 @,@ 050 short tons ) of cement and 590 tonnes ( 580 long tons ; 650 short tons ) for the railway bridges . In total 4 @,@ 300 wagon loads were transported before the official opening , of which about half was for the power stations . Because of the delay of building the line , it could only be used during part of the construction period for the power stations . 
 The official opening took place on 19 November 1927 by King Haakon VII . When the line opened there were 21 manned station on the line . Up to 70 people worked on the line , in addition to station employees . In 1932 , the operations were rationalized , cutting costs from NOK 426 @,@ 000 to NOK 310 @,@ 000 per year . This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and replacing them with a clerk . 
 Initially , all trains on the line were hauled by steam locomotives , in particular NSB Class 20 and NSB Class 21 brought in used from other lines . The first diesel multiple units were taken into use in the 1930s , with the line seeing the use of both NSB Class <unk> 16 and Kristine <unk> . During World War II , the line was again entirely hauled by steam locomotives and the service was reduced considerably . By 1945 , there were three round trips per week , but after the war ended , the frequency increased and by 1947 there were four daily round trips . Various classes of multiple units have been used , including NSB Class 86 , NSB Class 87 and NSB Class 91 . During the 1950s , there were sometimes also trains that operated just from Kongsberg to Veggli . 
 Because the conductors and engineers often knew where the locals lived or were headed , trains would make non @-@ scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk . In the 1960s , the number of round trips was reduced to three per day , allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit . NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970 , when NSB 's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg . For a short period during the 1980s , there were also school trains , but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line , it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus . 
 Discussion about closing the line started in the 1950s , and the line became a candidate every time NSB and the parliament discussed closures . In 1988 , the parliament decided to close many Norwegian lines , including the Numedal Line , although it was decided that the section from Kongsberg to Rollag was to be kept for freight traffic . The last passenger train operated on 31 December 1988 and the line north of Rollag was officially closed on 1 January 1989 . By the time the line closed in 1989 , manning remained at only three stations : Flesberg , Veggli and Rødberg . NSB retained some traffic south of Flesberg ; in 1993 the company hauled 30 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 30 @,@ 000 long tons ; 33 @,@ 000 short tons ) of gravel and 25 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 25 @,@ 000 long tons ; 28 @,@ 000 short tons ) of lumber along the line . 
 After the closure , the non @-@ profit organization Friends of the Numedal Line was established and offered occasional heritage rides along the line . It maintains the tracks between Rollag and Rødberg and offers <unk> rental between Veggli and Rødberg . Irregular transport from the gravel pit at Svene and the sawmill Numedal Bruk at Flesberg . The latter is operated by <unk> i <unk> and hauls lumber from Uddevalla , Sweden . The stretch from Flesberg to Rødberg is suggested preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage . 
 = William S. Edmiston = 
 William Somerville Edmiston ( November 10 , 1857 – July 24 , 1903 ) was an architect and politician in present day Alberta , Canada . He was a member of the Edmonton Town Council and for two terms , the mayor of Edmonton . 
 Originally a native of Scotland , Edmiston came to Canada to settle in Clover Bar , Northwest Territories in the early 1880s . After living there for about ten years , he relocated to Edmonton where he would employ himself as an architect , the first ever in the town . Engaging in a partnership with another fellow architect , his firm would design some of the first buildings in the newly developing town . He would also involve himself with the town 's politics , sitting on the Edmonton Town Council , and later serving out two terms as Mayor of Edmonton , from 1897 to 1899 . During his time as mayor , he involved himself in local affairs as well as run his architectural business . He would also lobby for a new bridge to be built over the North Saskatchewan River , connecting Edmonton with the town of Strathcona . He would voluntarily relinquish his position as mayor and not run in the 1899 election , opting to retire . 
 Edmiston was also very active in the sporting affairs of Edmonton , participating in and managing many sporting activities and clubs . He died after an accident which resulted in heart failure in 1903 ; an industrial park in Edmonton was subsequently named after him .

 Edmiston was born in 1857 at the <unk> section of Glasgow , Scotland , the son of William Thomson and Jessie ( née Mitchell ) Edmiston . He immigrated to Canada in 1882 , and settled in Clover Bar , Northwest Territories where he farmed . His siblings , Janet Hamilton Edmiston and Herbert William Edmiston had also immigrated to Canada . In Clover Bar , he was named justice of the peace , and served as a trustee in the local school board . 
 = = Career = = 
 He relocated to the town of Edmonton in 1892 , becoming the town 's first architect . He also operated a brickyard upon settling . In 1892 , Edmiston , working independently at the time , was contracted by the Edmonton Town Council to draft a map of the town . In that same year , he was also a member of a committee tasked with a project to establish a brewery in Edmonton . In 1893 , he established a partnership with local architect Nathaniel G. Flater , and operated under the name Edmiston & Flater , headquartered at the Edmonton Imperial Bank Building . The firm designed many notable buildings for the town , including the first post office , the city 's first brick school ( for the Edmonton Public School District ) , the All Saints ' Anglican Cathedral , a home for Herbert Charles Wilson , the McDougall & Secord retail store , and a fire hall . In 1899 , he would end his partnership with Flater and enter into a new one , with Henry D. Johnson of Calgary , under the firm name Edmiston & Johnson Architects , <unk> , <unk> and Insurance Agents . This firm was responsible for constructing , amongst many , a hospital building , a new Presbyterian church and making alterations to the Robertson Hall Theatre . 
 In 1900 , an article was published in the Edmonton Bulletin , praising the firm Edmiston & Johnson , specifically for their " skill and artistic tastes " , stating that they had " built for themselves a reputation that is second to none in their line " . 
 William Edmiston was also briefly involved in the meat industry , establishing a pork packing business , the Edmonton Pork Packing Company , around 1896 . During the 1890s he was also a director of the Edmonton District Railway Company .

 In 1895 , Edmiston was nominated for and subsequently elected to Edmonton Town Council , finishing first in the aldermanic race in a field of nine candidates , with 175 votes . He was re @-@ elected in 1896 , finishing second of eight candidates . During this term , Edmiston sat as the chair of the board of works . He also sat on the council 's finance , public works and market committees . He did not seek re @-@ election in the next election . In early 1897 , he was a member of a planning committee for Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee celebrations within the town . In the ensuing December 1897 election , having been nominated for mayor by Colin Strang and George Roy , he was the only candidate put forth for the position , and thus was acclaimed to the position . In 1898 , in response to getting nominated for re @-@ election as mayor , Edmiston responded by purchasing an advertisement in the Edmonton Bulletin , stating : 
 As I have been requested by a large number of taxpayers to run for Mayor for 1899 , I thank them for the honor and beg to say I have much pleasure and pride in accepting the nomination . 
 He would be re @-@ elected in the election later that year , defeating former mayor Cornelius Gallagher by 81 votes . He did not seek re @-@ election in 1899 , opting to retire . Following his last council meeting , after thanking members of the council , he treated members of the council and press members to " an excellent oyster supper " at a dining hall . During his two terms as mayor , he was involved in petitioning the dominion government for the bridge that became the Low Level Bridge , which would be constructed shortly after his final mayoral term , in 1900 . He also introduced bylaws that permitted a new flour mill to operate with reduced taxation rates , authorized the widening of Queen Street , and provided for the purchase of additional property for the expansion of the town . 
 In May 1900 , Edmiston , along with notables Alex Taylor , John Alexander McDougall , James McDonald , William Johnston Walker , Robert Manson , Thomas Bellamy , Herman McInnes , and Hedley C. Taylor , were named to The Edmonton Public Hospital corporate governing board , on the advice of the Legislative Assembly of the North @-@ West Territories .

 = Battle of Kyongju = 
 The Battle of Kyongju was an engagement between United Nations ( UN ) and North Korean ( NK ) forces early in the Korean War from August 31 to September 15 , 1950 , in the vicinity of Kyongju in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack . 
 Holding a line north of P 'ohang @-@ dong , An 'gang @-@ ni , and Kyongju , the so @-@ called " Kyongju corridor , " the Republic of Korea Army I Corps was unexpectedly hit with an attack by the North Korean People 's Army 's II Corps , part of the wider Great Naktong Offensive . The South Korean troops , already demoralized and struggling to maintain a strong defensive line , were easily pushed back from their positions . US Army units were called in to assist the South Koreans repel the attack . 
 Fighting was heavy and the two sides fought to capture and recapture P 'ohang @-@ dong and An 'gang @-@ ni , with the North Koreans seeking to break through the Kyongju corridor as a way to attack the UN base at Pusan . However , with large amounts of UN air and naval support , the US and South Korean ground forces were able to rout and force back the North Korean troops after two weeks of fighting . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Pusan Perimeter = = = 
 From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea ( also known as the Republic of Korea ) by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and South Korean forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . 
 When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the NK 6th Division , and later the NK 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan , initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam @-@ ni and Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of Masan , the NK 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area . In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the NK 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In the Taegu region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu . Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the NK 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P 'ohang @-@ dong during the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong . All along the front , the North Korean troops were reeling from these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were not working . 
 = = = September push = = = 
 In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and South Korean units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu . 
 On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ prong attack against the UN lines . These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back . Five battle groupings were ordered . The easternmost of these was for the NK 12th and NK 5th Divisions break through the ROK Capital Division and ROK 3rd Division to P 'ohang @-@ dong and Kyongju . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The North Korean attack struck first on the UN 's right flank on Korea 's east coast . Although the NK II Corps general attack in the north and east was planned for September 2 , the NK 12th Division , now with a strength of 5 @,@ 000 men , started to move forward from the mountains earlier than planned , from where it had reorganized after its defeat in the Kigye and P 'ohang @-@ dong area . The division was low in food supply , weapons , and ammunition , and its men suffered from low morale . On August 26 , American and South Korean officers in the P 'ohang @-@ dong and Kigye area were optimistic ; they congratulated each other on having repulsed what they thought was the last serious threat to the Pusan Perimeter . 
 = = = Early attack = = = 
 Facing the NK 12th Division was the ROK Capital Division . At 04 : 00 August 27 , a North Korean attack overran one company of the ROK 17th Regiment , Capital Division , north of Kigye . This caused the whole regiment to buckle and retreat . Then the ROK 18th Regiment to the east fell back because of its exposed flank . The ROK 17th Regiment lost the town of Kigye in pulling back , and the entire Capital Division fell back 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to the south side of the Kigye valley . 
 At a briefing in Taegu on August 27 , Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker showed his concern over this development . One of those present was Major General John B. Coulter who had arrived in Korea about a month earlier . Half an hour after the briefing ended , Walker ordered Coulter to observe the South Korean troops on the east . Coulter flew to Kyongju , arriving there at 12 : 00 that day . Walker in the meantime formally appointed Coulter Deputy Commander , Eighth Army , placing him in command of the ROK I Corps which controlled the Capital and 3rd Divisions , the US 21st Infantry Regiment , the 3rd Battalion , US 9th Infantry Regiment , and the 73rd Medium Tank Battalion , less C Company . Coulter designated these units Task Force Jackson and established his headquarters in the same building in Kyongju in which the ROK I Corps commander and the KMAG officers had their command post . 
 When he arrived at Kyongju that day , Coulter found the ROK I Corps disintegrating rapidly and in low morale . Walker had instructed him to issue his orders to the ROK I Corps commander as advice , which Coulter did . Coulter had the mission of eliminating the North Korean penetration in the Kigye area and of seizing and organizing the high ground extending from north of Yongch 'on to the coast at <unk> 'o @-@ ri , about 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of P 'ohang @-@ dong . This line passed 10 miles ( 16 km ) north of Kigye . Coulter was to attack as soon as possible with Task Force Jackson to gain the first high ground north of Kigye . The US 21st Infantry Regiment was moving to a position north of Taegu on the morning of August 27 , when Walker revoked its orders and instructed it to turn around and proceed as rapidly as possible to Kyongju and report to Coulter . The regiment departed Taegu at 10 : 00 and arrived at Kyongju that afternoon . Coulter immediately sent the 3rd Battalion north to An 'gang @-@ ni where it went into a position behind the ROK Capital Division . 
 = = = UN counterattack = = = 
 Coulter 's plan to attack on August 28 had to be postponed . Major General Kim Hong Il , the ROK I Corps commander , told him he could not attack , that there were too many casualties and the South Korean were exhausted . The NK 5th Division above P 'ohang @-@ dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back . On the 28th , the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division , at a time he deemed favorable , advised South Korean Brigadier General Kim Suk Won , the division commander , to counterattack , but Kim refused to do so . The next day Kim said he was going to move his command post out of P 'ohang @-@ dong . The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group was going to stay in P 'ohang @-@ dong . Upon hearing that , Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time being to avoid loss of face . That day , August 28 , Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army , and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense , Shin Sung @-@ mo . He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter , and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible , counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains . 
 The ROK disorganization was so great in the face of continued North Korean pressure that Task Force Jackson could not launch its planned attack . The US 21st Infantry was in an assembly area north of An 'gang @-@ ni and ready for an attack the morning of the 28th , but during the night the ROK 17th Regiment lost its position on the high ridge northward at the bend of the Kigye valley , and the attack was canceled . The South Koreans regained their position in the afternoon but that night lost it again . At the same time , elements of the NK 5th Division penetrated the ROK 3rd Division southwest of P 'ohang @-@ dong . Coulter directed the 21st Infantry to repel this penetration . During the day on August 29 , B Company , 21st Infantry , supported by a platoon of tanks of B Company , 73rd Medium Tank Battalion , successfully counterattacked northwest from the southern edge of P 'ohang @-@ dong for a distance of 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) , with South Korean troops following . The American units then withdrew to P 'ohang @-@ dong . That night the ROK 's withdrew , and the next day an American infantry @-@ tank force repeated the action of the day before . The 21st Infantry then took over from the ROK 3rd Division a sector extending north and northwest of P 'ohang @-@ dong . 
 Also on August 29 , the ROK Capital Division , with American tank and artillery support , recaptured Kigye and held it during the night against North Korean counterattacks , only to lose it again at dawn . American air attacks continued at an increased tempo in the Kigye area . South Korean troops reported finding the bodies of many North Koreans , apparently killed by air attack . They also found many suits of white clothing scattered on the ground , abandoned when North Korean soldiers changed from civilian disguises into military uniforms . 
 With this air action in the Kigye area , US naval vessels continued their efforts to help stop the NK 5th Division on the east coast . A cruiser and two destroyers concentrated their firepower on the Hunghae area 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of P 'ohang @-@ dong where the NK 5th Division 's troop assembly and forward supply center were located . On August 29 and 30 the three vessels fired almost 1 @,@ 500 5 @-@ inch shells at targets there in support of the ROK 3rd Division . Despite this aerial and naval support , on August 31 the battle continued to go against the ROK forces both at Kigye and P 'ohang @-@ dong . 
 = = = Kigye recaptured = = = 
 UN aerial observation on September 1 discovered the North Koreans were moving southward in the mountains above Kigye and P 'ohang @-@ dong . The next day another major attack was forming north and northwest of Kigye . In the afternoon , KMAG advisers with the Capital Division estimated that 2 @,@ 500 North Korean soldiers had penetrated a gap between the ROK 17th and 18th Regiments . 
 At the same time , North Korean pressure built up steadily north of P 'ohang @-@ dong , where the NK 5th Division fed replacements on to Hill 99 in front of the ROK 23rd Regiment . This hill became almost as notorious as had Hill 181 near Yongdok earlier because of the almost continuous and bloody fighting there for its control . Although aided by US air attacks and artillery and naval gunfire , the ROK 3rd Division was not able to capture this hill , and suffered many casualties in the effort . On September 2 the US 21st Infantry attacked northwest from P 'ohang @-@ dong in an effort to help the South Koreans recapture Hill 99 . A platoon of tanks followed the valley road between P 'ohang @-@ dong and Hunghae . The regimental commander assigned K Company Hill 99 as its objective . The 21st Infantry made very slow progress in this attack and casualties were heavy . By 15 : 25 that afternoon , K Company could account for only 35 of its men , the rest killed , wounded or missing . The company was unable to take Hill 99 from the well dug @-@ in North Koreans who threw large numbers of hand grenades to repel all efforts to reach the top . Two tanks of the 6th Tank Battalion were lost in this attack , one in a mine field and another because of a thrown track . At dusk a North Korean penetration occurred along the boundary between the ROK Capital and 3rd Divisions 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Kigye . 
 The next morning , September 2 at 01 : 30 , the NK 12th Division , executing its part of the coordinated NK II Corps general attack , struck the Capital Division on the high hill masses south of the Kigye valley . This attack threw back the ROK 18th Regiment on the left in the area of Hills 334 and 438 , and the ROK 17th Regiment on the right in the area of Hill 445 . By dawn of September 3 , the North Korean penetration there had reached the vital east @-@ west corridor road 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of An 'gang @-@ ni . As a result of this gain during the night , the NK 12th Division had advanced 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) and the Capital Division all but collapsed . 
 This forced Coulter to withdraw the 21st Infantry from the line northwest of P 'ohang @-@ dong and concentrate it in the vicinity of Kyongju . The 2nd Battalion had joined the regiment on August 31 , but Coulter had held it in the task force 's reserve at An 'gang @-@ ni . That battalion now took up a horseshoe @-@ shaped defense position around the town , with some elements on high ground 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east where they protected the Kyongju to P 'ohang @-@ dong highway . The rest of the regiment closed into an assembly area north of Kyongju . At the same time , Walker started the newly activated ROK 7th Division toward the North Korean penetration . Its ROK 5th Regiment closed at Yongch 'on that afternoon , and the ROK 3rd Regiment , less its 1st Battalion , closed at Kyongju in the evening . Walker also authorized Coulter to use the 3rd Battalion , 9th Infantry ; the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company ; and the 15th Field Artillery Battalion as he deemed advisable . These units , held at Yonil Airfield for its defense , had not previously been available for commitment elsewhere . 
 = = = Fall of An 'gang @-@ ni = = = 
 During the day on September 3 , KMAG advisers at P 'ohang @-@ dong sent Coulter a message that the ROK 3rd Division commander was preparing to withdraw from P 'ohang @-@ dong . Coulter went immediately to the ROK I Corps commander and had him order ROK 3rd Division would not withdraw . Coulter checked every half @-@ hour to see that the division stayed in its P 'ohang @-@ dong positions . That night , September 3 – 4 , the remainder of the ROK I Corps front collapsed . Three North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment . Following a mortar preparation , the North Koreans entered An 'gang @-@ ni at 02 : 20 . An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused . By 0400 American tanks ceased firing because remnants of the Capital Division had become intermingled with North Korean forces . At daylight , G Company , US 21st Infantry , discovered that it was alone in An 'gang @-@ ni , nearly surrounded by the North Koreans . ROK troops had disappeared . At 18 : 10 , G Company withdrew from the town and dug in along the road eastward near the rest of the 2nd Battalion , 21st Infantry at the bridge over the Hyongsan @-@ gang . North Koreans held the town and extended southward along the railroad . 
 Receiving orders to withdraw and join the regiment above Kyongju , the 2nd Battalion , 21st Infantry had to fight through a North Korean roadblock on the east side of the Hyongsan @-@ gang 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) southeast of An 'gang @-@ ni . Upon arrival , it discovered that G Company was missing and the battalion had to turn around and get G Company . The 2nd Battalion fought its way back north and found G Company at the bridge . Reunited , the battalion fought its way out again , with tanks firing down the road ahead of the column and into the hills along the sides . North Korean fire knocked the tracks off three US M46 Patton tanks . US artillery then destroyed them to prevent North Korean use . The 2nd Battalion arrived in the Kyongju area shortly before 12 : 00 . 
 = = = Kyongju threatened = = = 
 By 1200 on September 4 , North Korean units had established roadblocks along the Kyongju @-@ An 'gang @-@ ni road within 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of Kyongju . A 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) gap existed between the ROK 3rd and Capital Divisions in the P 'ohang @-@ dong area . But the big break in the United Nations line was in the high mountain mass west of the Hyongsan valley and southwest of An 'gang @-@ ni . In this area northwest of Kyongju there was an 8 miles ( 13 km ) gap between the Capital Division and the ROK 8th Division to the west . From that direction the North Koreans posed a threat to the railroad and the road net running south through the Kyongju corridor to Pusan . Faced with this big gap on his left flank , Coulter put the US 21st Infantry in the broad valley and on its bordering hills northwest of Kyongju to block any approach from that direction . 
 The situation at Kyongju during the evening of September 4 was tense . Kim Hong Il , The South Korean corps commander , proposed to evacuate the town . He said that the North Koreans were only 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) away on the hills to the north , and that they would attack and overrun the town that night . Coulter told him that he would not move his command post . Coulter put four tanks around the building where the command posts were located . Out on the roads he stationed KMAG officers to round up ROK stragglers and get them into positions at the edge of the town . One KMAG Major stopped ROK troops fleeing south , sometimes having to do so with a pistol . 
 The expected North Korean attack on Kyongju , however , never came . The North Koreans turned east , crossed the highway north of the town , and headed toward Yonil Airfield . The next day the US Air Force , attacking North Korean gun positions 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) north of Kyongju along the road , found many targets in the Kigye @-@ Kyongju @-@ P 'ohang @-@ dong triangle as they caught the North Koreans advancing in the open . 
 = = = Fall of P 'ohang @-@ dong = = = 
 At 02 : 00 September 5 , Lieutenant Colonel Rollins S. Emmerich , one of the ROK I Corps KMAG advisers , hastened to Yonil Airfield where he conferred with Lieutenant Colonel D. M. <unk> , commanding the 3rd Battalion , 9th Infantry , stationed there , and informed him of the situation in P 'ohang @-@ dong . Emmerich obtained a platoon of tanks and returned with them to the town . He placed the tanks in position and awaited the expected North Korean armored attack . At 05 : 30 he received information that elements of the ROK 22nd Regiment had retreated in the face of North Korean attack . North Korean troops entered this gap and just before 11 : 00 the American tanks in P 'ohang @-@ dong were under heavy North Korean machine gun fire . Five NK SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled guns approached and began firing . At a range of one city block the US tanks knocked out the lead gun , killing its three crew members . In the ensuing exchange of fire the other four withdrew . Emmerich then directed air strikes and artillery fire which destroyed the other four guns . But that afternoon at 14 : 35 the order came to evacuate all materiel and supplies from the Yonil airstrip . 
 That night , September 5 – 6 , events reached a climax inside P 'ohang @-@ dong . At midnight , after 10 rounds of North Korean mortar or artillery fire struck near it , the ROK 3rd Division command post moved to another location . North Korean fire that followed it to the new location indicated observed and directed fire . The South Korean division commander , Brigadier General Lee Jun <unk> and several members of his senior staff claimed they became sick . The division withdrew from P 'ohang @-@ dong , and on September 6 it was again in North Korean hands . The South Korean Army relieved both the ROK I Corps and the ROK 3rd Division commanders . At this time new commanders were appointed for these major commands . Brigadier General Kim Paik Il took command of ROK I Corps , while Capital Division came under command of Colonel Song Yo Ch 'an , and ROK 3rd Division came under command of Colonel Lee Jong Ch 'an . 
 Because the big gap between the ROK Capital and ROK 8th Divisions made it impossible for ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct the action of the 8th Division , the ROK Army transferred that division to the control of the ROK II Corps on September 7 , and attached to it the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division . This shift of command came just as the NK 15th Division penetrated the ROK 8th Division lines to enter Yongch 'on in the Taegu @-@ P 'ohang @-@ dong corridor . From west of An 'gang @-@ ni the ROK 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch 'on , attempting to close the gap . 
 = = = US 24th Infantry Division arrives = = = 
 The gains of the North Koreans in the east on September 4 caused Walker to shift still more troops to that area . The day before , he had ordered the US 24th Infantry Division to move from its reserve position near Taegu to the lower Naktong River to relieve the US 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Infantry Division front . It bivouacked that night on the banks of the Naktong near Susan @-@ nil . On the morning of the 4th , before it could begin relief of the US Marine Corps forces there , the 24th Infantry Division received a new order to proceed to Kyongju . The assistant division commander , Brigadier General Garrison H. Davidson , proceeding at once by jeep , arrived at Kyongju that evening . Division troops and the US 19th Infantry Regiment started at 13 : 00 the next day , September 5 , and , traveling over muddy roads , most of them arrived at Kyongju just before midnight . Major General John H. Church , the 24th Division commander , had arrived there during the day . All division units had arrived by 07 : 00 , September 6 . 
 Coulter knew the NK 15th Division had crossed the Taegu lateral corridor at Yongch 'on and was heading in the direction of Kyongju . On September 6 , he ordered the US 21st Infantry to attack the next day up the valley and bordering hills that lead northwest from Kyongju into the high mountain mass in the direction of Yongch 'on . When it attacked there on September 7 the 21st Infantry encountered virtually no opposition . 
 At 12 : 30 Eighth Army redesignated Task Force Jackson as Task Force Church , and at 13 : 00 Coulter departed Kyongju for Taegu to resume his planning duties . Church was now in command on the eastern front . That afternoon , September 7 , Church canceled Coulter 's order for the 21st Infantry to attack into the mountains . He felt it was a useless dispersion of troops and he wanted the regiment concentrated near Kyongju . Church made still another change in the disposition of the task force . On the 8th he moved its command post from Kyongju to the vicinity of <unk> @-@ ni , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south . He believed the command post could be more easily defended there in the open if attacked than in a town , and that traffic congestion near it would be less . 
 = = = Deadlock = = = 
 Fighting continued between the North Koreans and the ROK Capital Division on the hills bordering the valley from An 'gang @-@ ni to Kyongju . The 3rd Battalion , US 19th Infantry , became involved there just after midnight on September 8 – 9 . A North Korean force attacked K Company and drove it from Hill 300 , a defensive position midway between An 'gang @-@ ni and Kyongju . North Koreans held the hill during September 9 against counterattack . Farther north , on the left side of the valley , the ROK 17th Regiment attacked and , with the support of the US 13th Field Artillery Battalion , captured Hill 285 and held it against several North Korean counterattacks . On the opposite , east side of the valley the ROK 18th Regiment made limited gains . These battles took place in drenching typhoon rains . Low @-@ hanging clouds allowed very little air support . The rains finally ceased on September 10 . 
 In this second week of September elements of the NK 5th Division had spread out over the hills west , southwest , and south of P 'ohang @-@ dong . One North Korean force , estimated to number 1 @,@ 600 men , reached Hills 482 and 510 , 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) southwest of Yonil Airfield . Facing this force were two regiments of the ROK 3rd Division , which held a defensive position on the hills bordering the west side of the valley south of the airfield . North Korean pressure threatened to penetrate between the two ROK regiments . 
 On the evening of September 9 , Church formed Task Force Davidson to eliminate this threat to Yonil . The airfield itself had not been used since the middle of August except for emergency landing and refueling of planes , but evacuation of US Air Force equipment , bombs , and petroleum products was still in progress . Davidson commanded the task force , which was composed of the US 19th Infantry , less the 3rd Battalion , the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Infantry , the 13th Field Artillery Battalion , C Battery of the 15th Field Artillery Battalion , A Company of the 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion , the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company , two batteries of antiaircraft automatic weapons , and other miscellaneous units . 
 With the North Koreans having cut off all other approaches from the Kyongju area , the task force spent all of September 10 making a circuitous southern approach to its objective . It arrived in its assembly area at Yongdok @-@ tong , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Yonil Airfield , at 19 : 00 that evening . Davidson early that morning had flown on ahead from Kyongju to Yongdok @-@ tong . Emmerich was there to meet him when his light plane landed on the road . On the flight over , Davidson looked for but did not see any North Korean soldiers . Emmerich told Davidson the North Koreans had driven the ROK troops from Hill 131 . This hill was on the southern side of the boundary between the two ROK regiments holding the Yonil defensive position . Davidson and Emmerich agreed that the ROK troops would have to recapture Hill 131 during the night and that then the task force would attack through the ROK 3rd Division to capture the main North Korean positions on Hill 482 . They thought that if the task force could establish the ROK troops on Hill 482 they should be able to hold it and control the situation thereafter . Emmerich took Davidson to meet the ROK 3rd Division commander . Davidson told him that he was in command in that area and informed him of his plan for the attack . That night the South Korean troops did succeed in recapturing Hill 131 and restoring their lines there . In this attack the ROK 3rd Engineer Battalion fought as infantry , and under the leadership and guidance of Captain Walter J. Hutchins , the KMAG adviser to the battalion , contributed heavily to the success . 
 = = = North Koreans repulsed = = = 
 The next morning , September 11 , the 19th Infantry passed through the left @-@ hand ROK regiment just south of Hill 131 and , with the 1st Battalion leading , attacked west . At 09 : 30 it captured without opposition the first hill mass 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of its starting point . The 2nd Battalion then passed through the 1st Battalion and continued the attack toward Hill 482 ( <unk> @-@ san ) , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) westward across a steep @-@ sided gorge . There , North Koreans held entrenched positions , and their machine gun fire checked the 2nd Battalion for the rest of the day . The morning of September 12 four Australian pilots from No. 77 Squadron RAAF struck the North Korean positions with napalm , and an artillery preparation followed the strike . The 2nd Battalion then launched its attack and secured Hill 482 about 12 : 00 . That afternoon , ROK forces relieved Task Force Davidson on the hill mass , and the task force descended to the valley southwest of Yongdok @-@ tong for the night . On September 13 , Task Force Davidson returned to Kyongju . 
 While this action was in progress near Yonil Airfield , the week @-@ long battle for Hill 300 north of Kyongju came to an end . A regiment of the ROK 3rd Division captured the hill on September 11 . In midafternoon the 3rd Battalion , US 19th Infantry , relieved the South Korean troops there . Scattered over Hill 300 lay 257 counted North Korean dead and great quantities of abandoned equipment and weapons , some of it American . In this fighting for Hill 300 , the US 3rd Battalion , 19th Infantry , 37 men killed . 
 September 12 is considered as the day when the North Korean offensive in the east ended . By that date , the NK 12th Division had been virtually destroyed and the NK 5th Division was trying to consolidate its survivors near P 'ohang @-@ dong . Aerial observers reported sighting many North Korean groups moving north and east . 
 The ROK 3rd Division followed the withdrawing NK 5th Division , and the ROK Capital Division advanced against the retreating survivors of the NK 12th Division . On September 15 some elements of the Capital Division reached the southern edge of An 'gang @-@ ni . Reports indicated that North Korean troops were retreating toward Kigye . With the threat in the east subsiding , Eighth Army dissolved Task Force Church , effective at 12 : 00 September 15 , and the ROK Army resumed control of the ROK I Corps . Eighth Army also ordered the US 24th Infantry Division to move to Kyongsan , southeast of Taegu , in a regrouping of forces . The US 21st Infantry Regiment had already moved there on the 14th . The US 9th Infantry was to remain temporarily at Kyongju in Eighth Army reserve . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 North and South Korean forces suffered heavily in the battle , each side inflicted large numbers of casualties on one another . The exact numbers of casualties are impossible to determine . Both sides are known to have suffered heavily . Following the counterattack at Inchon , the North Korean units in the sector fled back North , no more than a few thousand troops from the NK 5th and 12th divisions were known to have returned to North Korea . US Casualties , in the meantime , were relatively light . 
 In the eastern battles during the first two weeks of September , the South Korean troops , demoralized though they were , did most of the ground fighting . American tanks , artillery , and ground units supported them . <unk> UN aerial supremacy and naval gunfire from offshore also supported the South Korean troops , and probably were the factors that tipped the scales in their favor . After the initial phase of their September offensive , the North Koreans labored under what proved to be insurmountable difficulties in supplying their forward units . The North Korean system of supply could not resolve the problems of logistics and communication necessary to support and exploit an offensive operation in this sector of the front . Nevertheless , the breakthrough was severe enough that the Eighth Army considered pulling back for several days , eventually deciding to stand its ground .

 Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on an earlier four @-@ panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student . At that time , the main characters that make up the student council were instead members of the drama club . However , Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha 's Waai ! magazine , and she decided it would be easier to manage a cross @-@ dressing character if he was in the student council . Before creating Himegoto , Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross @-@ dressing boys , but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys . When she proposed the idea of Himegoto , she wanted to pair a cross @-@ dressing boy with girls , which Tsukudani herself wanted to read . In this way , she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it . 
 When drawing the manga , Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that were easy to read , something she felt she was unable to do well when the manga 's serialization began . What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible . When developing the characters , she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student . However , Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani 's ideals for a cross @-@ dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair , side pigtails , and him being forced to cross @-@ dress . When developing the members of the public morals committee , Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross @-@ dressing brothers , which lead to Kaguya 's development . Tsukudani 's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin @-@ off manga Himegoto + , and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner , so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross @-@ dressing girl . For Mitsunaga and Hiro , she wanted them to cross @-@ dress due to some preconceived issue . Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them , including what hair color they would have . 
 Although Tsukudani kept a notebook with story ideas , she admitted that on many occasions the theme of a chapter was born out of her own daydreams . Once she decided on a theme , she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard . Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were , she noted that they moved around for her on their own . Conversely , if the characters were stiff with a given theme , Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea . The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization , as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story .

 Reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime 's short episode format as offering " more direct comedy , quicker hits and more playfulness and abuse when it comes to the gender issues . " He initially called the premise " familiar yet fun " with " enough off kilter material " to amuse the audience . By the end of the series , Beveridge noted that its approach focused on humiliation and shame , and went on to say that it " works one gag and does its best to run it into the ground as much as possible . " Tim Jones at THEM Anime Reviews heavily panned the series , calling the treatment of the student council girls towards Hime as " sinister and tasteless " . Jones pointed out his frustration with every episode , going on to heavily pan the characters and use of a " terrible one @-@ joke premise " . 
 = Tom Quinn ( Spooks ) = 
 Tom Quinn is a fictional character in the BBC espionage television series Spooks ( called MI @-@ 5 in the United States ) , which follows the exploits of Section D , a counter @-@ terrorism division of MI5 . He is portrayed by British actor Matthew Macfadyen . In the first two series , Tom is the chief of Section D. The character was in the first and second episode of the third series but was decommissioned as a result of sabotaging an operation . 
 Series creator David Wolstencroft believed that writing Tom was the most fun , yet hardest to work on . During the second series , the producers were unsure whether Macfadyen would return for the third ; because of this , Tom was originally killed in the second series finale . However , when Macfadyen decided to appear in the first two episodes of the third series , series writer Howard Brenton had to " <unk> him . " Reaction towards the character by fans were positive , though critics were mixed about Macfadyen 's portrayal . Tom Quinn would later appear again as a cameo on the final episode of Spooks ; his brief return was met with generally positive reactions .

 Tom Quinn joined Section D in 1996 , where he eventually became Head of Section D following the imprisonment of predecessor Lucas North ( Richard Armitage ) during an operation in Russia . Throughout the first series , Tom engages in a relationship with Ellie Simm ( Esther Hall ) , who knows him as " Matthew Archer " , a civil servant in IT . In the second episode , Tom performed an undercover operation with fellow officer Helen Flynn ( Lisa Faulkner ) to recruit the wife of right @-@ wing businessman , Robert Osbourne , who was believed to incite race riots throughout the country . However , during the operation , Osbourne discovers they are spies and attempts to get his hands on information regarding MI5 operations . When Tom fails to cooperate Osbourne tortured Flynn with a deep fryer before killing her . Tom is able to escape and works with Harry to have Osbourne assassinated for retribution . When Tom is shot during a Turkish Consulate raid in the third episode , Tom is forced to admit his true identity and profession , which temporarily puts a strain on their relationship . In the series one finale , Tom has his home protected in order to keep Ellie and her daughter Maisie safe . However , in the end of the finale , he inadvertently brings home a laptop rigged with C4 ; Ellie and Maisie become trapped in the house with the bomb . The bomb fails to detonate . However , by the end of the second series premiere , Ellie leaves Tom , claiming that he will always choose his job over her . 
 Later in the second series , Tom starts a brief relationship with Vicky Westbrook ( Natasha Little ) , which he ends due to her behaviour after an <unk> ( Extreme Emergency Response Initiative Exercise ) in the fifth episode . In the following episode , Vicky retaliates by posting his phone number in Soho telephone boxes and clubs , garnering him unwanted attention . While Tom has Sam Buxton ( Shauna Macdonald ) find and destroy every leaflet , CIA liaison Christine Dale ( Megan Dodds ) makes Vicky stop the harassment . At the end of the episode , he starts a relationship with Dale , which superior Harry Pearce ( Peter Firth ) disapproves of , demanding that he end it . In later episodes , a shift in consciousness starts to interfere with Tom 's work , such as when he goes undercover to stop a renegade British Army major . In the series two finale , he learns from Dale that an American assassin , Mickey <unk> , is visiting the UK . It is later revealed <unk> was actually killed , and the entire operation was orchestrated by supposedly dead CIA agent Herman Joyce ( Tomas Arana ) , who is seeking revenge on Tom for ruining his daughter 's life when Tom recruited her . Joyce frames Tom for assassinating the Chief of the Defence Staff . While Tom attempts to prove his innocence , Harry corners him , forcing Tom to wound Harry and escape into the North Sea . At the end of the episode , the team assumes he drowned . 
 In the third series premiere episode , Tom survives and poses as a vagrant in order to find Joyce in a church ; Tom kills Joyce and leaves his body outside Thames House in an attempt to prove his innocence . When it does not , Adam Carter ( Rupert Penry @-@ Jones ) tracks down Joyce 's wife and makes her confess to their plan to frame Tom , clearing him of all charges . Tom is reinstated as Head of Section . However , in the next episode , he undergoes a " conscience explosion " and sabotages an operation to lure a terrorist cell into buying " red mercury " , because he did not like what was being done to the scientist in order for him to attempt to create it ( which includes forging gambling debt , prompting the man 's wife to leave him . He also develops a severe alcohol problem ) . As a result , Tom is decommissioned and takes early retirement from MI5 . In the book Spooks : The Personnel Files , Tom is revealed to have married Christine Dale following his retirement and to have founded a private security company called ' Trans Atlantic Security ' . He is also mentioned in Season 7 Episode 1 when Lucas North asks Harry ' How did Tom Quinn work out ? ' . Tom briefly returns in the final episode , hired by Harry Pearce as an " outside contractor " to eliminate the head of a conspiracy of Russian nationalists who tried to derail the move to a closer Russian / UK relationship . Although brief , this scene makes it clear that Tom is still involved in spying .

 Tom Quinn is depicted as " serious , focused and popular " with his team , as well as " deeply intelligent " , with " impeccable instincts . " Throughout the first series , Tom has a relationship with Ellie Simm . In the first few episodes , Tom deals with keeping his true identity secret , but not being truthful to Ellie is " eating away at him . " Ultimately , Tom tells her the truth , and she later leaves him in the beginning of the second series as a consequence . Throughout the second series , Tom 's " journey " has evolved slowly , where his attitude to his work has changed , and his conscience has " kicked in " , finding himself questioning the world he is in . In Tom 's final episode , writer Howard Brenton described Tom as not disillusioned , but " sort of becomes a human being . " 
 = = Conceptual history = = 
 Series creator David Wolstencroft believed that writing Tom was the most fun , yet the hardest work compared with other characters , because he was Spooks ' primary protagonist . Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology ( IT ) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie , because he felt that in real life people are reluctant to ask questions about IT work . To portray the character , actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts , and did not want to deviate from them , as he did not believe doing so would be useful . Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence . 
 During production of the first series , Macfadyen , along with co stars Keeley Hawes and David Oyelowo were wary of playing the lead characters in their mid @-@ twenties , but since felt they earned the right to be in the series . During production of episodes three and five of the first series , Macfadyen burst a blood vessel on one of his eyes . Macfadyen compensated by wearing sunglasses in order to hide it . Halfway through filming series two , Macfadyen got to carry a gun for the first time in the series ; he was disappointed in not carrying one in the first series . 
 Though Macfadyen enjoyed working in the series , he began to feel " very sluggish and fed up " with playing the same character for two years . When the producers knew Macfadyen planned to leave , they did not know whether or not he would appear in the beginning of the third series . Howard Brenton , who wrote the series two finale , originally killed Tom off by drowning him while trying to escape onto the North Sea , while labouring under the impression that he was not to return . The producers would have continued the third series without Tom , however when they heard the actor would be prepared to return for the first two episodes of the third series , they were rewritten to include his character Tom . Brenton had to " <unk> him . " After a seven @-@ year absence , in October 2011 , it was announced that Macfadyen was to make a " fleeting " cameo appearance in the final episode of the series . A Spooks insider stated that his scene " will bring back all the memories of Tom and what the character endured in those first few series . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 The character gained Matthew Macfadyen recognition during his tenure on Spooks , but since his departure , Macfadyen stated that " no one notices me now . " Fan reaction of the character proved positive . In the " Best of Drama " viewer polls at BBC Online , Macfadyen was voted fifth in the " Best Actor " category in 2002 , ahead of co @-@ star Peter Firth , who was voted 21st . He would later be voted fourth in 2003 , and then fifth again in 2004 ; co @-@ star Rupert Penry @-@ Jones was voted third in the same category . Furthermore , the scene entitled " Tom 's death ( or was it ? ) " in the cliffhanger of series two , was voted second in the " Favourite Moment " category in 2003 , beaten only by the return of " Dirty Den " Watts in EastEnders . 
 Critical reaction towards the character was generally mixed . In a DVD review of the first series , Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema thought Macfadyen was not a very good actor and believed " he seems to be in some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression , " but thought the character himself , particularly his personal life , mostly worked well for the most part as it continues " as a standard soap opera . " In review of the second series , Dennis Landmann of <unk> praised the " drama and intensity that builds around his character , " noting Tom 's somewhat " haunted soul " and the last five minutes of the last episode " were so powerful they affected how I felt for the next couple of days ; I kept thinking about the character and the tragic events that happened to him . " In the third series , Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name , but thought his exit was " not particularly satisfying . " However , David Blackwell of Enterline Media thought that his farewell scene was " one of [ his ] best moments of the first two episode ( in addition to the way Tom acts in the opening episode ) . " 
 Critical reaction toward Tom 's cameo appearance was met with generally positive reviews . Christopher <unk> of Metro opined " the return of Tom Quinn as a hired assassin in the final few seconds was a nice nod to early series of show . " Rob McLaughlin of Den of Geek noted that Tom 's return among the final few minutes of the show was " a welcome return from an old friend , " while Dork Adore reviewer Nick Bryan called it " a nice touch , " also reflecting that it " nailed home the central moral : no @-@ one ever escapes from the horror . ( Especially since that guy was written out of the show due to an attack of conscience , yet is now doing Harry ’ s dirty work . ) " Vicky Frost of The Guardian meanwhile , felt the cameo " made no sense at all . Obviously it was super cheesy , " but she " obviously " " completely loved it – despite knowing it was coming . " 
 = Elmer Flick = 
 Elmer Harrison Flick ( January 11 , 1876 – January 9 , 1971 ) was an American major league baseball outfielder who played from 1898 to 1910 for the Philadelphia Phillies , Philadelphia Athletics , and Cleveland Bronchos / Naps . In 1 @,@ 483 career games Flick recorded a .313 batting average while accumulating 164 triples , 1 @,@ 752 hits , 330 stolen bases , and 756 runs batted in . He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963 . 
 Flick began his career in semi @-@ professional baseball and played in minor league baseball for two years . He was noticed by George Stallings , the manager of the Phillies , who signed Flick as a reserve outfielder . Flick was pressed into a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire . He excelled as a starter . Flick jumped to the Athletics in 1902 , but an court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania . He joined the Naps , where he continued to play for the remainder of his major league career , which was curtailed by a stomach ailment . 
 Flick was known predominantly for his solid batting and speed . He led the National League in RBIs in 1900 , and led the American League in stolen bases in 1904 and 1906 , and in batting average in 1905 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Flick was born on January 11 , 1876 , the third of five children of Zachary and Mary Flick , on the family farm in Bedford , Ohio . His father was a farmer and mechanic who had served in the American Civil War . Flick attended Bedford High School , where he played catcher on the school 's baseball team . He also played American football , wrestled , and boxed . 
 Flick entered semi @-@ professional baseball by chance . When he was 15 years old , he was at a train station to support the local baseball team as it left for a road trip . Only eight of the team 's players showed up at the station , so Flick was recruited to go on the trip with the team . Though Flick did not have a uniform or shoes , he hit well in both games of the doubleheader , though Bedford lost both games . He joined the Bedford team on a regular basis , and he continued to play semi @-@ pro baseball throughout his teenage years .

 In 1896 , the manager of the Youngstown <unk> of the Interstate League signed Flick . Because the team had an established catcher , Flick played in the outfield , where he struggled to learn the position . In 31 games , Flick had a <unk> fielding percentage . However , Flick had a strong performance offensively . Using his father 's lathe , Flick crafted his own baseball bat , which he used to hit for a .438 batting average . 
 The next year , Flick played for the Dayton Old Soldiers , also in the Interstate League , as their regular left fielder . His defense improved , as he compiled a .921 fielding percentage , and he batted .386 . He also led the league with 20 triples and 295 total bases . 
 = = = Major League Baseball = = = 
 George Stallings , the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League ( NL ) , noticed Flick while he played for Dayton . Stallings signed Flick to the Phillies to serve as a reserve outfielder for the team in the 1898 season . Starting outfielder Sam Thompson injured his back after six games , forcing Stallings to play Flick . In his debut game , Flick went 2 @-@ for @-@ 3 with two singles against Fred Klobedanz . Thompson returned to the team briefly , but reinjured his back and announced his retirement in May , allowing Flick to play regularly . Flick proved himself a capable big leaguer , batting .302 with eight home runs , 13 triples and 81 runs batted in ( RBIs ) . In the 1899 season , he batted .342 , with 98 runs scored and 98 RBIs . However , he suffered a serious knee injury in August , and reinjured the knee when he returned to the game too quickly . 
 Before the 1900 season , Philadelphia stars Napoleon Lajoie and Ed Delahanty held out of renewing their contracts with the team . Other members of the team had grown disgruntled . Amid talk of a revival of the American Association , Flick and several other players began to talk about not returning to the team the next year . The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Flick 's father was in the chair business in Cleveland and that he might require Flick 's help with the business . Flick agreed to a contract extension before the season started . 
 That year , he led the NL with 110 RBIs . He finished second in the NL with a .367 batting average , a .545 slugging percentage , 11 home runs , 59 extra @-@ base hits , and 297 total bases . He also engaged in a fistfight with Lajoie that caused Lajoie to miss five weeks due to a broken thumb . The race for the batting title came down to the end of the season . The title winner , Honus Wagner , later said , " I 've had a lot of thrills , but don 't think I was ever happier than in 1900 when I won after battling Elmer Flick to the last day of the season for the title . " 
 Flick was one of many star NL players who jumped to the fledgling American League ( AL ) after the 1901 season , playing for the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics . Flick played in 11 games for the Athletics , before the Phillies obtained an injunction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibiting any player under contract with the Phillies from playing for another team . Though this injunction named Lajoie , Bill Bernhard , and Chick Fraser only , it still applied to Flick as well . As a recourse , Flick and teammate Lajoie signed instead with the Cleveland Naps , as the Pennsylvania injunction could not be enforced in Ohio . The two players often traveled separately from their teammates for the next year , never setting foot in Pennsylvania in order to avoid a subpoena . Flick spent the remainder of his career in Cleveland , and the contract dispute was resolved when the leagues made peace in September 1903 with the National Agreement . 
 On July 6 , 1902 , Flick hit three triples in one game . Between 1900 and 2010 , 49 players accomplished that feat . By early 1904 , Flick did not want to re @-@ sign with Cleveland for the offered $ 2 @,@ 500 ( $ 65 @,@ 843 in current dollar terms ) . Plans were being made to run a railroad through a corner of Flick 's farm and Flick hoped to hire some of his horses to the construction team . " After July 4 , my farm work will be along so that I will be able to give considerable attention to independent ball " , he said . 
 Flick did return to Cleveland for the 1904 season . That year , Flick tied teammate Harry Bay for the league lead with 38 stolen bases . Flick was the AL batting champion in the 1905 season with a .308 average . Only Carl Yastrzemski , who won the batting title with a .301 average in the 1968 season , led the league with a lower average . Flick also led the league with a .462 slugging percentage and 18 triples in 1905 . His .383 on @-@ base percentage trailed only Topsy <unk> . During a 1905 game , Cleveland fielders were charged with seven errors in a single inning , but Flick committed only one of the errors . 
 In the 1906 season , Flick played a league @-@ leading 157 games . He led the league with 700 plate appearances , 624 at @-@ bats , 98 runs scored , 22 triples , and 39 stolen bases ( tied with John Anderson ) . However , Flick was " said to be dissatisfied with the team " , and the Naps considered trading him to the Detroit Tigers for Matty McIntyre . Before the 1907 season , the Naps turned down a trade with the Tigers which would have exchanged Flick for the 21 @-@ year @-@ old Ty Cobb . Hughie Jennings , the Tigers ' manager , was tired of dealing with Cobb 's abrasive behavior . The Naps refused to part with Flick , even in exchange for Cobb . They countered with Bunk <unk> , but the Tigers declined . Flick had been holding out but he signed a few days after the proposed trade . After Cobb was nearly traded away , Jennings attempted to repair the difficult relationships between Cobb and the other Detroit players . " Cobb is too good a hitter to let get away , when a little diplomacy will get the boys together " , Jennings said . In the 1907 season , Flick again led the league with 18 triples . 
 However , baseball took its toll on Flick . Before the 1907 season , he considered retiring to pursue other business opportunities . By 1908 , he developed stomach problems . Cleveland personnel initially said that the illness was related to Flick 's overeating . He left training camp that year , complaining of " train sickness " , and returned home to Cleveland . He missed the majority of the 1908 season , playing in only nine games . He missed the beginning of the 1909 season as well , as a doctor recommended Flick have his appendix removed . Now weighing 130 pounds ( 59 kg ) , Flick was afraid of a bad outcome from the surgery , which was a significant risk at the time . He kept his appendix and played in 66 games , batting .255 . He played in another 24 games in the 1910 season before he was again sidelined by his stomach ailment . 
 The Naps acquired Shoeless Joe Jackson from the Athletics in a trade and had him replace Flick in the lineup . In July 1910 , the Naps sold Flick to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association , but Flick refused to report to Kansas City , which cancelled the transaction . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 In 1911 , Flick looked to continue his career . Unable to find a major league team willing to sign him , he returned to the minor leagues . The Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association purchased him from Cleveland . Flick played for Toledo in 1911 and 1912 . He batted .326 in the 1911 season and .262 in the 1912 season , but did not hit for power . The Mud Hens released him at the end of the 1912 season . He retired from professional baseball after being released by Toledo , though he briefly played as a second baseman for a local amateur team in Bedford in 1914 . 
 Flick retired without playing in a World Series . As of 2003 , there were six Hall of Famers without a World Series appearance who played most of their careers after 1903 ; three of them – Flick , Lajoie and Addie Joss – played together with Cleveland from 1902 to 1910 .

 Returning to Bedford , Flick hunted , raised horses , built buildings , and became involved in selling real estate . He also scouted for Cleveland . Only four 19th century baseball players , including Flick , were still alive in 1970 . In his later years , Flick still answered requests for autographs from his fans . Proud of his longevity , Flick often completed autographs by writing the date and his age above or underneath his signature . 
 Flick was married to Rosa Ella ( née Gates ) . The couple had five daughters . Flick died in his hometown of Bedford in 1971 , at the age of 94 , of congestive heart failure . He also suffered from <unk> <unk> .

 When Cobb died in 1961 , stories written about him mentioned the attempted trade between Cleveland and Detroit , which revived interest in Flick . Flick was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963 after being unanimously elected by the Veterans Committee ( VC ) . When he received the call from Branch Rickey that he had been selected , Flick did not believe Rickey at first . He said that he did not even realize that he was being considered for election at the time . Flick 's family had to convince him that the call was real . He was the oldest living inductee in Hall of Fame history . At his induction , the 87 @-@ year @-@ old Flick said , " This is a bigger day than I 've ever had before . I 'm not going to find the words to explain how I feel . " 
 Subsequent to his induction , writers have questioned the validity of Flick 's Hall of Fame membership . James Vail characterized Flick and three other Hall of Famers as " some of the most dubious VC choices ever " . David Fleitz wrote that Rickey 's influence on the Veterans Committee led to Flick 's election , as Rickey was the only committee member who had seen Flick play . Author Robert E. Kelly pointed out that Flick 's career was relatively short and that stronger candidates from Flick 's era ( such as Sherry Magee ) had not been inducted . 
 Flick was enshrined in the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1977 , and the Ohio Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987 . A statue of Flick 's likeness was created to be placed in Bedford ; it was funded by donations and was dedicated in September 2013 . Mike Hargrove was among the baseball figures who attended the ceremony .

 In 1987 , Gasper obtained a D.Phil in English Literature from the University of Oxford after studying at Somerville College . Her thesis examined the Protestant plays of Elizabethan English playwright Thomas Dekker . In 1990 , Clarendon Press published Gasper 's work The Dragon and the Dove : The Plays of Thomas Dekker . Writing in The Yearbook of English Studies , John <unk> of the University of Manchester described the book as " trenchant and well @-@ informed " and expressed the view that he found Gasper 's thesis – that Dekker 's dramatic works subscribed to a militant Protestant ideology – to be " convincing " . John Harmon of Syracuse University reviewed Gasper 's book for the English Studies journal , describing it as " crisply researched " and " eminently readable " although thought that she argued " somewhat defensively " that scholars should take Dekker 's work more seriously . Reviewing the book for The Review of English Studies , T. H. Howard @-@ Hill of the University of South Carolina noted that despite the work 's title , it did not examine all of Dekker 's 26 plays but only a selection of them . While noting that the work was " thoroughly researched , well documented , and densely written " , Hill also opined that it was " disjointed , digressive , repetitive , and rambling " and felt that it did not " convincingly illustrate Decker 's militant Protestant orientation " in some of the plays that she had discussed . 
 In 2013 the University of Delaware Press published her book Theodore von Neuhoff , King of Corsica : The Man behind the Legend . Reviewing the tome for the European Review of History : Revue <unk> d 'histoire , José Miguel <unk> <unk> of the European University Institute noted that Gasper brought a novel approach to her examination of the Corsican monarch . Although describing the " exciting " work as an " interesting exercise in historical biography " , he noted that Gasper paints a " hagiographic image " of von Neuhoff , for instance by unconvincingly portraying him as a " military genius " and by falling into " the trap of seeing things in black and white by frequently presenting Neuhoff and his followers as heroes <unk> against villains .

 In early 2012 , UKIP selected Gasper to represent them as their Parliamentary candidate for Oxford East , while she also began campaigning to be elected onto Oxford City Council . Asserting that " my central message is to take back control of this country " , she campaigned on a platform of promoting the UK 's removal from the European Union , opposing " mass immigration " , abolishing university tuition fees , and increasing the state pension . 
 During her campaign , a resident in the Oxford area discovered a blog post which Gasper had authored in 2010 ; concerned about its contents , they contacted the LGBT @-@ themed news service Pink News , who reported on it . Stating that homosexuality was not a sexual orientation but a " form of behaviour " , in her post Gasper suggested that same @-@ sex attraction was a choice , before criticising gay people for " complaining constantly of persecution " and being insufficiently grateful to heterosexuals for creating them . Asserting that legal support for LGBT rights had " gone too far " , she condemned same @-@ sex marriage and the adoption of children by same @-@ sex couples as " wholly unacceptable " , and claimed that there were strong links between male homosexuality and paedophilia . Her claims generated outrage , with a UKIP spokesperson commenting that while the party did not endorse Gasper 's views on this issue , it did uphold her right to hold and express them . 
 Later that month Gasper complained that readers of Pink News had threatened her , declaring that they should be forcibly institutionalised under the Mental Health Act . In doing so , she compared her situation to that of Salman Rushdie during The Satanic Verses controversy . She then claimed that she had received email death threats and was under police protection , assertions that local police refused to either confirm or deny . Commenting to Cherwell , she claimed her views on LGBT issues were " very , very middle ground " and that she had not said anything homophobic , but been the victim of " a malicious witch hunt " . <unk> Russell , former chair of the International Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Youth and Student Organisation , emailed Gasper to discuss the latter 's comments , to which Gasper responded that Russell too should be institutionalised . Russell proceeded to condemn Gasper , stating that " as a long @-@ term political activist I 'm disgusted she used this kind of language . Using mental health as a slur on top of everything else she 's doing is just unacceptable . " Rafe Jeune , chair of Oxford 's Pride parade , characterised Gasper 's comments as " abhorrent " and " disgusting " , noting that there was no evidence to link paedophilia and homosexuality . 
 In the United Kingdom general election , 2010 Gasper came fifth in her constituency with 2 @.@ 3 % of the vote ( 1 @,@ 202 votes ) . 
 In January 2013 , The Sunday Mirror revealed that in a UKIP members ' online forum Gasper had condemned LGBT rights as a " lunatic 's charter " , while claiming that some homosexuals prefer sex with animals over that with other humans , and reiterating her belief in a link between homosexuality and paedophilia . The newspaper characterised the comments as " extremist and offensive " and noted that the forum contained many homophobic and racist statements from UKIP members . When The Sunday Mirror asked for comment , Gasper stated that " I 'm not going to talk about them . It 's none of your business . " Political commentator Nick Cohen , commenting in The Observer , described Gasper as an advocate of " dumb prejudice " . 
 The forum was shut down , Gasper resigned from her position as chairman of UKIP 's Oxford branch , and a number of her supporters were also removed from the committee . A party spokesperson stated Gasper had stepped down " to avoid doing herself or the party any more damage " . Gasper insisted the withdrawal was her own decision , adding that she had been the victim of a " press vendetta " . UKIP stated that her resignation as Oxfordshire branch chair was welcome , but she would not be forced out of the party altogether . However , UKIP leader Nigel Farage condemned Gasper 's " war against homosexuals " as " unacceptable " , while Olly Neville , former chairman of UKIP 's Young Independent wing , tweeted a message of support for Gasper 's removal , stating that " her disgraceful views have no place as a rep [ <unk> ] of a mainstream party " . 
 Gasper later lambasted UKIP as being " plagued with transsexuals " , a reference to the <unk> Nikki <unk> and Kellie Maloney , both of whom have served as candidates for the party . Asserting that she refused to recognise <unk> as women , she declared Maloney to be " absolutely grotesque " and added that her transition was " totally barmy – and how pathetic that he [ sic ] can do nothing better with his life . " In May , a former UKIP activist , Colin <unk> , also publicly revealed to Cherwell that in emails Gasper had sent to him she had again emphasised a connection between homosexuality and paedophilia , and had described the Quran as a " fascist " book , comparing it to Adolf Hitler 's Mein Kampf and describing Islam as " a severely oppressive ideology " . 
 In November 2013 , Gasper was criticised for an essay entitled " The Myth of the <unk> " , which she uploaded to her <unk> account . It claimed that LGBT rights activists had fabricated the extent of the Nazi persecution of homosexuals . Olivia Marks @-@ <unk> , chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust , criticised Gasper 's claims as disappointing : " Whilst it is important to recognise the differences between the ways the Nazis persecuted different groups , this shouldn 't lead us to question the fact that thousands of gay men suffered appalling persecution because of their sexuality . " 
 = = = English Democrats : 2014 – 16 = = = 
 Disillusioned with UKIP , Gasper switched her allegiance to the English Democrats . In April 2014 , she declared there were far too many gay people in the Houses of Parliament , deeming this a " violation of democracy " . Claiming that only 1 @.@ 5 % of the population was gay , she stated this could justify no more than ten gay MPs , far less than the hundreds that she alleged existed . In the same post , she called for the gay networking and dating app Grindr to be banned as a threat to " public health " . Questioned by the BBC , the English Democrats ' party spokesman Steve Uncles defended Gasper 's " personal opinion " , which he claimed was based on a traditional , Christian understanding of sexuality , adding that she was " factually correct " in her claims regarding the number of homosexuals in Parliament . Conversely , her statistics were dismissed as " absurd " by the Oxford University Student Union 's LGBT representative ; they characterised Gasper 's comments as representing evidence of the continuing existence of those with " alarming prejudices " who " wish to actively discriminate against LGBTQ people " . 
 The following month , Gasper commented on the resignation of Brendan <unk> as CEO of Mozilla after it was revealed that he had financially supported a group campaigning to prevent the legal recognition of same @-@ sex marriage in California . Gasper claimed <unk> had been " victimised by a queer mafia that takes a vindictive pleasure in bullying and abusing people " and that this " Homo fascism is a threat to fundamental human rights . " Among those she accused of contributing to this campaign were US President Barack Obama , British Prime Minister David Cameron , Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , the Labour Party , the United Nations , the European Union , Amnesty International , the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby , the Bishop of Buckingham Alan Wilson , Pope Francis , the actor Daniel Radcliffe , all European and American universities , and media such as The Guardian , The Daily Mail , and The Huffington Post . The following day , she condemned World AIDS Day as a celebration of HIV / AIDS and homosexuality , claiming it " congratulates " people for " spreading the disease " . Some days later she claimed that in campaigning for legal recognition of same @-@ sex marriage , " queer thugs and gangsters " had " used violence , threats , censorship , abuse , and every form of dirty tactic " . She hoped that " a twinge of guilt ... kills them " . 
 In May , Gasper stood as the English Democrats ' candidate for the South East England region in the European Parliament elections , gaining the votes of 0 @.@ 76 % of the electorate ( 17 @,@ 771 votes ) . Following the resignation of the Labour councillor for Quarry and Risinghurst on the Oxford City Council , Gasper stood as the English Democrats ' candidate for the seat , coming last with 43 votes . 
 After this failure , Gasper returned to her blog to argue there were " far too many homosexual comedians on TV " , focusing her criticism on Graham Norton , " the horrid little Alan Carr " , and " the unctuous Stephen Fry [ ... ] portly , preening and self @-@ satisfied . " She also posted that homosexuals were not persecuted anywhere in the world and that claims to the contrary , such as those regarding the murders of Matthew Shepard and David Kato , were " fraudulent " . Pink News , she said , operated as a " mafia " and had placed the actor Rupert Everett on its " hit list " , forcing him to obtain police protection . In October 2014 , Pink News founder Benjamin Cohen claimed this constituted libel and threatened legal action against her . Gasper responded that she did not simply stand by what she had said , but that she was " proud of it and I have morality on my side " . Commenting in an article in Cherwell , Samuel <unk> @-@ Mills questioned why the media bothered reporting on Gasper 's anti @-@ LGBT comments , noting that as a parish councillor her " political significance is tenuous ... and scarcely newsworthy or interesting . " He warned that excessive coverage of such opinions was counterproductive to the advancement of LGBT rights , by making " extreme homophobia " seem more commonplace than it really is . 
 Gasper retained her seat as parish councillor for Risinghurst and Sandhills at the United Kingdom local elections , 2016 .

 Cheadle Hulme / <unk> <unk> / is a suburb of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester , England . Historically in Cheshire , it is 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) south @-@ west of Stockport and 7 @.@ 5 miles ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) south @-@ east of the city of Manchester . It lies in the Ladybrook Valley on the Cheshire Plain , and the drift consists mostly of boulder clay , sands and gravels . In 2001 , it had a population of 29 @,@ 000 . This had fallen to 26 @,@ 479 ( both North and South Wards ) by 2011 . 
 Evidence of Bronze Age , Roman , and Anglo @-@ Saxon activity , including coins , jewellery and axes , has been discovered locally . The area was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was a large estate which included neighbouring Cheadle . In the early 14th century it was split into southern and northern parts at about the future locations of Cheadle Hulme and Cheadle , respectively . The area was acquired by the Moseley family in the 17th century and became known as Cheadle Moseley . Unlike many English villages it did not grow around a church ; instead it formed from several hamlets , many of which retain their names as neighbourhoods within Cheadle Hulme . In the late 19th century Cheadle Hulme was united with Cheadle , Gatley and other neighbouring places to form the urban district of Cheadle and Gatley . This district was abolished in 1974 and Cheadle Hulme became a distinct place in its own right , as part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport . 
 Cheadle Hulme is an affluent area with open parkland ; it has a railway station and is close to both Manchester Airport and the A34 .

 The Domesday Book provides the earliest mention of the area , where it is recorded as " <unk> " , Celtic for " wood " . Local archaeological finds include Bronze Age axes discovered in Cheadle . Evidence of Roman occupation includes coins and jewellery , which were discovered in 1972 . The modern @-@ day Cheadle Road was originally known as Street Lane , and may be of Roman origin . A stone cross dedicated to the Anglo @-@ Saxon St Chad , discovered in 1873 , indicates Anglo @-@ Saxon activity . The cross was found in an area called " Chad Hill " , on the banks of the Micker Brook near its confluence with the River Mersey ; this area became " Chedle " . Suggestions for the origin of the name include the words <unk> , and <unk> or leah , in Old English meaning " clearing " , forming the modern day " Cheadle " . " Hulme " may have been derived from the Danish word for " water meadow " or " island in the fen " . 
 According to the Domesday Book in 1086 , the modern @-@ day Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme were a single large estate . Valued at £ 20 , it was described as " large and important " and " a wood three leagues [ about 9 miles ] long and half as broad " . One of the earliest owners of the property was the Earl of Chester . It was held by a Gamel , a free Saxon , under Hugh d 'Avranches , 1st Earl of Chester , and later became the property of the de Chedle family , who took their name from the land they owned . By June 1294 Geoffrey de Chedle was Lord of the Manor . Geoffrey 's descendant Robert ( or Roger ) died in the early 1320s , leaving the estate to his wife Matilda who held it until her death in 1326 . As there were no male heirs the manor , which was now worth £ 30 per annum , was divided between her daughters , Clemence and Agnes . Clemence inherited the southern half ( which would later become the modern @-@ day Cheadle Hulme ) , and Agnes inherited the northern half , ( latterly Cheadle ) . The two areas became known as " Chedle Holme " and " Chedle Bulkeley " respectively . Shortly afterwards the Chedle Holme estate was divided and the part where Hulme Hall is now situated became known as " Holme " , and held by the Vernons . The estates were reunified on the death of the last of the Vernons in 1476 . 
 The only daughter of Clemence and William de <unk> , Isabel de <unk> , succeeded her parents as owner of the manor , and married Sir Thomas Danyers . Danyers was rewarded for his efforts in the crusades through an annual payment from the King of 40 marks , as well as the gift of Lyme Hall . His daughter Margaret continued to receive payments after his death . 
 The first John Savage succeeded Margaret , and nine more followed him . The tenth died young , so the estate passed to his brother , Thomas Savage . In 1626 Charles I created the title of Viscount Savage for him . On his death the estate passed to his daughter Joan , who later married John Paulet , 5th Marquess of Winchester . Joan died during childbirth at the age of 23 , and the estate passed to the Marquess . The Marquess practised Catholicism , and in 1643 the estate was confiscated due to persecution of Catholics in the English Civil War . 
 Following this , the estate was acquired by the Moseley family of Manchester and became known as Cheadle Moseley . Anne Moseley was the last of this family to hold the manor , as her husband could not afford to keep it following her death . It was purchased by John Davenport , who bequeathed it to the Bamford family when he died childless in 1760 . After the last Bamford died without male issue in 1806 , the estate passed to Robert Hesketh who took the name Bamford @-@ Hesketh ; it is from this family that the Hesketh Tavern public house in Cheadle Hulme got its name . The last person to hold the manor was Winifred , Countess of Dundonald , one of Bamford @-@ Hesketh 's descendants . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 In 1801 the population was 971 and had risen to 2 @,@ 319 by 1851 . In 1868 the area became a parish , but it was merged with Cheadle Bulkeley in 1879 and became part of the Cheadle and Gatley district in 1894 . The name " Cheadle Moseley " continued to be used for the area , and appeared on tithes and deeds until the 20th century . In 1974 , the Cheadle and Gatley district was abolished and Cheadle Hulme became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport . 
 During the Second World War , Cheadle Hulme was a refuge for evacuees from places such as Manchester and the Channel Islands . The area had its own Home Guard , as well as several air @-@ raid shelters . Cheadle Hulme was also home to large parts of RAF Handforth . This was a maintenance unit , classed as a ' Universal stores ' depot and had the official Royal Air Force name , " RAF Handforth No 61 <unk> ( Maintenance unit ) " . The depot opened in 1939 and closed in 1958 – 59 and covered large areas of land in both Cheadle Hulme and neighbouring Handforth . 
 The depot stored and dispatched every conceivable item that the " RAF " would use in wartime . Everything from knives and forks to aircraft engines were stored and dispatched from RAF Handforth . The site was served by a large , internal railway system which left the [ Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station . The site of the exchange sidings and junction is at the rear of the ' Pets at home ' offices on Epsom Avenue . The depot had its own shunting locomotives , which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre . 
 The only surviving buildings of RAF Handforth are the government pay offices adjacent to the ' Total Fitness ' gym on <unk> Lane . These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military / MoD use to this day . The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme , these being Site Number 5 , general storage ( beneath the Eden Park road housing development which , until the housing development began still maintained the internal road layout and building foundations ) and site number 6 ( motor transport storage area ) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate . Three large ( 150 ft × 250 ft ) steel built , vehicle storage sheds stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close / Tintern Road . The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a rubbish dump . This stood between <unk> Close and Tintern Road . The houses on May Avenue were built by the RAF as married quarters and exist to this day . 
 As well as the above sites , several ' domestic sites ' existed within Cheadle Hulme . These provided sleeping , eating and washing facilities for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth . Grove Lane park was the site of an Officer 's mess , Cinema , NAAFI , Post Office , chapel and bath house among other buildings . ' The Grove ' near to the junction of Grove Lane and <unk> Lane , was Nissen hut accommodation , as were the flats on <unk> Road opposite the shops and the large field at the junction of Longsight Lane and Stanley Road . The remains of the air raid shelters can still be seen at this location to this day . The wooded area to the rear of numbers 48 – 64 Hall Moss Lane also housed an officers ' mess , NAAFI , post office , chapel and bath house . 
 RAF Handforth was a large and important storage facility , that contributed directly to the war effort . The site stretched from the centre of Handforth village , through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford . The industrial estate , ' Adlington Park ' ( which is actually in Woodford / Poynton ) , was a dispersed site of RAF Handforth . Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged , but its villagers knew the extent of the war , mainly due to the large and visible presence of the RAF and could hear the sounds of air @-@ raids on Manchester . 
 Cheadle Hulme did not grow around a church like many English villages , but instead grew from several hamlets that existed in the area . Many of the names of these hamlets still appear in the names of areas , including Smithy Green , Lane End , Gill Bent , and Grove Lane . Some of the many farms such as <unk> Mere Farm and Hursthead Farm which covered the area also retain their names in schools that were built in their place .

 Lying within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire , Cheadle Hulme was historically a township known as " Cheadle Moseley " in the ecclesiastical parish of Cheadle and Hundred of Stockport . Following the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , part of Cheadle Moseley was amalgamated into the Municipal Borough of Stockport . In 1879 , the remaining part was merged with neighbouring Cheadle Bulkeley to form the township of Cheadle . 
 Established in 1886 , Cheadle Hulme 's first local authority was the Cheadle and Gatley local board of health , a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for the area of Stockport Etchells township and the part of Cheadle township outside the Municipal Borough of Stockport . The board of health was also part of Stockport poor law union . In 1888 the board was divided into four wards : Adswood , Cheadle , Cheadle Hulme and Gatley . Under the Local Government Act 1894 the area of the local board became Cheadle and Gatley Urban District . There were exchanges of land with the neighbouring urban districts of Wilmslow and Handforth in 1901 , and the wards were restructured again , splitting Cheadle Hulme into north and south , and merging in Adswood . Due to the fast @-@ paced growth of the district , the wards were again restructured in 1930 , with the addition of Heald Green . In 1940 the current wards of Adswood , Cheadle East , Cheadle West , Cheadle Hulme North , Cheadle Hulme South , Gatley and Heald Green were established . Under the Local Government Act 1972 the Cheadle and Gatley Urban District was abolished , and Cheadle Hulme has , since 1 April 1974 , formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester . 
 Since 1950 Cheadle Hulme has been part of the Cheadle parliamentary constituency , and has been represented by Conservative member Mary Robinson since 2015 . Six councillors , three representing Cheadle Hulme South ward and three representing Cheadle Hulme North , serve on the borough council .

 The majority of buildings in the area are houses from the 20th century , but there are a few buildings , landmarks , and objects that date from the 16th century , in addition to Bramall Hall which dates from the 14th century . In particular , there are many Victorian buildings in several places across the area . The local drift geology is mostly glacial boulder clay , as well as glacial sands and gravel . For many years the clay has been used for making bricks and tiles .

 For many years Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside , made up of woods , open land , and farms . The local population was made up of farmers and peasants , living in small cottages and working the land under the tenancy of the Lord of the Manor . Most families kept animals for food , grew their own crops , and probably bought and sold produce at Stockport market . Water was obtained from local wells and ponds , and sometimes the Micker Brook . 
 Local silk weaving became a large part of everyday life . The work took place in domestic cottages in a room known as a " <unk> " , and the woven silk was transported to firms in Macclesfield 8 miles ( 13 km ) away . Silk @-@ weaving remained commonplace in the area until the early 20th century , when the process became industrialised . Other industries in the area included a corn mill , which collapsed some time during the First World War , located next to the Micker Brook ; cotton weaving ; and brickworks , one located where the fire station is and one near the railway station . A coal wharf was situated opposite the railway station and supplied the area with coal . 
 The building of the railways in the early 1840s introduced new employment opportunities for people in places such as Stockport and Manchester , as well as an influx of people coming to live in the area . In the mid @-@ 19th century , one of the earliest shops was opened in the Smithy Green area , selling groceries , sweets and other provisions . As people settled in the area , more shops were opened and new houses were built , many of which still stand . During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population , mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to live in the area , and it gradually became more suburban . In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and <unk> Lane , Gill Bent Road , Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas , and new roads replaced old farms . In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm . By 2009 the only farm remaining was Leather 's Farm on <unk> Road . 
 Cheadle Hulme is served by a fire station on <unk> Road which opened in October 1960 . Before this the area made use of a service in Cheadle . An ambulance station is near the fire station , and the closest public hospital is Stepping Hill Hospital in Hazel Grove . Until the early 2000s the area had a police station which served as the headquarters for the west Stockport area . The building , which opened in 1912 , was sold in 2006 and converted into flats . 
 Cheadle Hulme has a large variety of businesses serving the area . Station Road is home to the shopping precinct ( built in 1962 ) and contains among other businesses an Oxfam shop , an Asda supermarket , a hairdressing salon , an optician , a pharmacy , some clothing retailers and several restaurants . There are more restaurants and cafés along Station Road as well as solicitors and building societies , and long @-@ running family businesses such as Pimlott 's butchers are also prominent . In 2002 , a Tesco Express opened on the site of an old petrol station , and in July 2007 Cheadle Hulme became the home of Waitrose 's first purpose @-@ built retail outlet in northern England . Other retailers include a Wetherspoons pub , <unk> chic interiors store and Mountain Ski Services , a local ski and snowboard tuning service . 
 According to the 2001 census , the biggest industry of employment for Cheadle Hulme residents is that of wholesale and retail trade and repairs with approximately 16 % of people employed in that industry . This is followed closely by real estate , renting and business activities with 15 % of people employed in this area . Other big areas of employment include manufacturing ( 13 % ) , health and social work ( 11 % ) , and education ( 10 % ) . Approximately 30 % of people were classed as " economically inactive " in the 2001 census . This included retired people , people who had to look after their family , and disabled or sick people .

 Bramall Hall , a Grade I listed building , is a 14th @-@ century black and white timber framed Tudor manor house , located between Cheadle Hulme and Bramhall . Described by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council ( SMBC ) as " the most prestigious and historically significant building in the Conservation Area " , it is situated in the middle of 70 acres ( 28 ha ) of landscaped parkland featuring lakes , woodland and gardens . Both house and grounds are open to the public and are in one of the 19 conservation areas in the borough . 
 The Swann Lane , Hulme Hall Road , and Hill Top Avenue conservation area contains 16th and 17th century timber @-@ framed buildings , Victorian villas , churches , and some former farmsteads . There are two Grade II listed buildings in this area : Hulme Hall , a timber @-@ framed manor house which dates from either the 16th or 17th century , and 1 Higham Street , formerly Hill Cottage , which is of a similar period and style to Hulme Hall . The Church Inn public house , which dates from either the late 18th or early 19th century , is situated on the edge of this area . 
 Around 300 men from Cheadle Hulme served in the First World War , and it was decided that those who died should be commemorated . Various ideas , including a library and clock tower , were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of <unk> Road and Manor Road in 1921 . Additions for later wars have been made , and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area . 
 Bruntwood Park has a variety of facilities , including orienteering , an 18 @-@ hole , par 3 pitch and putt golf course , children 's play areas , football pitches , and a BMX track . Bruntwood Park is also home to The Bowmen of Bruntwood , Stockport 's only archery club . Bruntwood Park is a Grade B Site of Biological Interest , and in 1999 was given a Green Flag Award for its high standards . The land it occupies was once a large estate , which at one time included a stud farm . Bruntwood Hall , a Victorian Gothic building constructed in 1861 , has been used for various purposes , including serving as Cheadle and Gatley Town Hall from 1944 until 1959 . It is now used as offices , and since the 1940s the park has been open to the public . 
 Oak Meadow Park is a small park on Station Road , with a large grass area and woodland . In the early 2000s it was renovated and refurbished , with new fences , benches and footpaths . The project to maintain and improve the park is a continuous process overseen by a local volunteer group . The park is used for special community events throughout the year . 
 = = Transport = = 
 Although most of the roads in the area date from the 20th century , there are many older roads formed from ancient routes , some as old as Roman . Cheadle Road possibly originated in Roman times and Ack Lane ( formerly Hack Lane ) is named after <unk> , a local Saxon landowner . Hulme Hall Road is named for the landmark it runs through and has existed since at least the 18th century . Until the 20th century , the roads were little more than country lanes , and most traffic consisted of <unk> carriages , carts , and milk floats . The roads were about half as wide as they are currently , and have all since been widened to accommodate the increasing amount of traffic . The first cars appeared in Cheadle Hulme in the early 1900s , but horse @-@ drawn vehicles were the main form of transport until the 1920s . A bus , known as the " Rattler " was introduced around this time , and ran a service through the area . It was , however , very slow and noisy , as its name suggests . 
 The Crewe to Manchester railway was completed in May 1842 , and a railway station known as " Cheadle " was built opposite the modern @-@ day Hesketh Tavern . When the Stafford to Manchester railway opened in 1845 the original station closed and a new station was built to accommodate the junction between the two railways . The road was renamed to Station Road in the same year , and the station was renamed to Cheadle Hulme in 1866 . The station has four platforms that serve the Crewe to Manchester and Stafford to Manchester Lines ; there are three trains per hour to Manchester , and one train per hour to Stoke and Crewe . During the financial year 2007 – 2008 the station was used by passengers 424 @,@ 000 times , an increase of 47 @,@ 000 from the previous year . 
 Cheadle Hulme is situated near the A34 Cheadle bypass , as well as international transport link Manchester Airport , the busiest airport in the United Kingdom outside London . The <unk> and <unk> roads traverse Cheadle Hulme ; there are many buses that operate on a daily basis throughout the area , with frequent services to and from Stockport bus station , passing through neighbouring towns and villages . There are also services to Manchester Piccadilly Gardens , as well as to places such as Woodford , Macclesfield , Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport . Most buses are operated by Stagecoach Manchester . 
 = = Education = = 
 Cheadle Hulme 's first school , established in 1785 , was named after local grocer Jonathan Robinson , who donated 3 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 ha ) of land on what is now Woods Lane . The school was built on what is now the corner of Woods Lane and Church Road , and was originally for the teaching of four boys and four girls .

 = Handled the ball = 
 Handled the ball is one of the ten methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket . It dictates that either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat . An exception is given for if the batsman handles the ball to avoid injury . It is governed by Law 33 of the laws of cricket , and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed : in the history of cricket , there have been 60 instances in first @-@ class matches and 5 occasions in List A games . In most cases this occurs when a batsman thinks that the ball is going to hit their wicket , and knocks it away from the stumps with their hand . 
 In international cricket , only ten dismissals have been given in this fashion ; on seven occasions in Test cricket and thrice in One Day Internationals . The South African Russell Endean became the first victim of this method in international cricket when he was dismissed in a 1957 Test match against England . The most recent occurrence was in an ODI in 2015 , when <unk> <unk> was given out against Afghanistan . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Handled the ball is Law 33 in the laws of cricket established by the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . A batsman can be given out for handling the ball if , while playing a delivery , the batsman intentionally touches the ball with one or both of their hands not holding the bat . A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman handles the ball to avoid incurring an injury . A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion . 
 = = History = = 
 As a method of dismissal , handling the ball has been included in the laws of cricket since the original code was written in 1744 . In that document , it stated that " If ye Striker touches or takes up ye Ball before she is lain quite still , unless asked by ye Bowler or Wicket Keeper , its out . " Similar wording remained in the revision made to the laws thirty years later . The first batsman to be dismissed for handling the ball in first @-@ class cricket was James Grundy , who suffered the fate while playing for the MCC against Kent in 1857 . Prior to 1899 , a batsman could be given out for handling the ball even if they were doing so to remove a ball which had got stuck in their equipment or clothing . At the time , if one of the fielders removed the ball from the batsman 's clothing , they could claim a catch . It was in such a situation that George Bennett , the first player to be given out handled the ball in English county cricket , was dismissed in 1872 . The wicket of William Scotton in early 1887 was described by Gerald Brodribb as " most unusual " . In a match between the smokers and the non @-@ smokers involved in the 1886 – 87 Ashes series , Scotton faced the final delivery of the contest . Eager to claim the ball as a souvenir of the high @-@ scoring match , he defended the delivery and picked the ball up . The fielders — who also wanted the souvenir — appealed , and Scotton was ruled out . 
 An addition was made to the law in 1950 to allow umpires to give a batsman not out if the ball should strike the hand after " an involuntary action by the striker in the throwing up of a hand to protect his person " . For a time , the act of handing the ball back to the fielding side was listed as not out under Law 33 , and instead was considered to be part of a different method of dismissal : obstructing the field , covered in Law 37 . The illegal nature of this offence was later returned to Law 33 , but reverted to Law 37 in 2013 . In 1948 the MCC issued a reminder to batsman , advising them not to handle the ball for any reason at any point during a cricket match , but it is relatively common for batsmen to pick the ball up and return it to the fielding side . Charles Wright was the first player to be dismissed for returning the ball to a fielder in first @-@ class cricket ; albeit wrongly . Brodribb relates that in an 1893 match , W. G. Grace influenced Wright to return the ball to him , and upon doing so , appealed . The umpire dismissed Wright , despite a clause added to the law nine years previous stating that a batsman would not be ruled out if they were returning the ball at the request of the fielding side . 
 In 2013 , the law received a major change . Prior to this , there had been ambiguity in certain situations whether handling the ball or obstructing the field was applicable . This ambiguity was removed by setting a clear demarcation point between the two as the point when the striker has " finished playing the ball " : before this point , handling the ball applies ; thereafter , obstructing the field applies . The result is that only the striker can now be dismissed handled ball , and only during the short period when the striker is playing ( or is attempting to play ) the ball , either as a first or subsequent stroke . The act of handing the ball back to the fielding side , mentioned above , is therefore no longer regarded as the striker playing the ball , resulting in this event now being dealt with under obstructing the field . 
 In total , there have been 60 occasions on which a batsman has been given out handled the ball in first @-@ class cricket and 5 instances in List A cricket . The most recent dismissal of this fashion in first @-@ class cricket occurred during a County Championship contest between Leicestershire and Kent in April 2016 , when Kent batsman Sean Dickson was dismissed for the infraction . Brodribb suggests that it is likely that there should have been a significant number more dismissals than there have been for handling the ball : in addition to the cases where batsman have returned the ball to the fielding side without permission , there are records of cases in which the umpires have been reticent to uphold an appeal . On one such instance , the umpire David Constant rejected an appeal against Younis Ahmed , saying that he thought the appeal was not serious . 
 = = Occasions in international cricket = = 
 The first occasion of a batsman being given out handled the ball in international cricket occurred during a Test match between South Africa and England in Cape Town in 1957 . In the second innings of the match , the South African Russell Endean padded away a delivery from Jim Laker . The ball looped off his pads into the air , and was falling towards his stumps until Endean instinctively knocked it away with his free hand . He later suggested that he had " thought of heading it away , but that seemed too theatrical . " The second instance came 22 years later during a bad @-@ tempered series between Australia and Pakistan that also involved another rare dismissal method : <unk> . Andrew Hilditch was the victim in this match ; he picked up the ball and returned it to the bowler after a wayward throw from a fielder . The bowler , Sarfraz Nawaz , appealed for the wicket and Hilditch was given out . Another Pakistan player , Asif Iqbal , distanced himself from the incident , commenting that he felt " there was no need for us to stoop so low as to appeal against Hilditch " . Hilditch 's dismissal marked the only time that a non @-@ striking batsman has been given out for handling the ball . The next case also occurred in a match between Australia and Pakistan . The match was marred by stones being thrown at the Australians in the field , providing a tense atmosphere . Mohsin Khan defended a delivery from Geoff Lawson , which then landed behind him . Mohsin pushed the ball away from the stumps with his hand , resulting in the wicket . 
 Desmond Haynes was the fourth man to be dismissed for handling the ball in Test cricket , just over a year after Mohsin . Facing India in late 1983 , Haynes had been struck on the bat and pad by the ball , which then headed towards the stumps . The West Indian batsman redirected the ball away from the stumps with his free hand . Upon being given out , Haynes — who was ignorant of the law regarding handling the ball — argued with the umpire about the dismissal . After asking the bowler , Kapil Dev , if he wanted to withdraw his appeal , the umpire sent Haynes back to the pavilion . The first instance in One Day Internationals was in 1986 , when the Indian batsman Mohinder Amarnath knocked away a turning delivery from Australia 's Greg Matthews that was heading for the stumps . In 1993 , Graham Gooch became the only player to be dismissed for handling the ball after scoring a century . Playing defensively to try and draw the Test match against Australia , Gooch blocked a short ball from Merv Hughes . The ball flicked off his bat and fell towards his stumps , prompting Gooch to instinctively punch the ball away : Australia won the match by 179 runs . 
 The dismissal of Daryll Cullinan in 1999 was the second instance in ODIs : facing the West Indian spinner Keith Arthurton , Cullinan fended the ball off into the ground . It bounced high in the air , and Cullinan removed his right hand from his bat to catch it as it fell again . Despite the fact that it was unlikely that the ball would land near the stumps , the West Indies captain , Brian Lara , appealed , and Cullinan was dismissed . The next occurrence was two years later , in a Test match between Australia and India . In the first innings of the match , Steve Waugh was struck on the pads by a delivery from Harbhajan Singh . The umpire turned down the appeal , but as he did so , the ball bounced and spun towards the stumps . Waugh was alerted by a shout from the non @-@ striking batsman , and instinctively swept the ball away with his free hand . The most recent instance came during the same year as Waugh 's dismissal , in another Test match involving India . England 's Michael Vaughan missed an attempted sweep against <unk> Singh , and the ball trickled along the ground after striking his pads . Vaughan brushed the ball away with his hand , despite the fact that it was not travelling towards the stumps . Initially , he claimed that he was attempting the give the ball back to the fielder at short leg , but he later admitted that he " should have just held up [ his ] hands and said ' I got it all wrong , I 'm an idiot . ' "

 = Star Trek : The God Thing = 
 Star Trek : The God Thing is an unproduced film script written by Star Trek series creator Gene Roddenberry . Following the success of Star Trek in broadcast syndication during the early 1970s , Paramount Studios sought to produce a feature film based on the property . The film 's plot follows the Enterprise crew after the events of The Original Series : when an alien entity declares itself God and begins travel to Earth , Admiral James T. Kirk reunites the crew , who send it back to its own dimension . Roddenberry completed the story on June 30 , 1976 , but Paramount rejected the script for reasons Roddenberry attributed to the religious views of company executives . The story was rewritten as In Thy Image for the proposed television series Star Trek : Phase II and then as Star Trek : The Motion Picture . 
 After Paramount rejected the film , Roddenberry sought to produce The God Thing as a novel in the late 1970s . He signed a deal with Bantam Books to publish it , but was given extensions because of his work ; first on Phase II and then The Motion Picture . During this period , Star Trek actor Walter Koenig helped Roddenberry expand the novel . In 1991 , shortly before Roddenberry 's death , his assistant Susan Sackett rediscovered the work on the novel . She contacted Pocket Books , which wanted to publish it ; discussions to hire Sackett and Fred Bronson to expand it to novel length were held , but negotiations stopped after Roddenberry 's death and Sackett 's dismissal from Star Trek : The Next Generation . Michael Jan Friedman was later engaged to expand the work but it went unpublished . The God Thing has been compared to the film Star Trek V : The Final Frontier that dealt with similar religious concepts .

 NBC canceled Star Trek following the third season in 1969 , but the episodes were released into broadcast syndication where they were successful . Because of this success and fans ' responses at science fiction conventions held in honor of the series , Paramount Pictures soon sought to create a movie based on the series . By March 1972 , series creator Gene Roddenberry said there was interest in a Star Trek feature film , and that the series could return to television on NBC . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The five @-@ year mission of Star Trek has finished and the crew has moved on from their postings on the starship Enterprise . Captain James T. Kirk has been promoted to Admiral , Doctor Leonard McCoy has left Starfleet to become a veterinarian , and other crew members have been given desk jobs . Engineer Montgomery Scott has become an alcoholic through boredom . Spock has returned to his home planet , Vulcan , where he was seeking to control the human half of his persona . 
 After an alien entity declaring itself to be God destroys spacecraft en route to Earth , the Enterprise is launched under the command of Admiral Kirk to engage the vessel . He re @-@ assembles the former crew , including Spock , and sets out to intercept the alien . As they approach the entity , it transports a humanoid probe on board the Enterprise that takes a variety of forms — including that of Jesus . The crew determine that the being and its craft are from an alternate dimension and have been responsible for the creation of religion of numerous planets to teach their inhabitants its laws in a manner understandable at their points in development . The being is malfunctioning ; the crew repair it and send it back to its own dimension . 
 = = Production = = 
 In May 1975 , Roddenberry entered a development deal with Paramount , with principal photography intended to start on July 15 , 1976 , and a budget of $ 5 million . He started work on treatments ; his first involved the formation of the Enterprise crew , including their training at Starfleet Academy and the formation of Starfleet , but this idea was never submitted to Paramount . His first major submitted script was The God Thing . A scene involving a discussion in which Spock 's tutors describe religion on Earth worried the studio . The tutor says , " We have never really understood your Earth legend of gods . Particularly in that so many of your gods have said , ' You have to bow down on your bellies every seven days and worship me ' . This seems to us like they are very insecure gods . " Roddenberry completed the script on 30 June ; Paramount rejected it the following month . The studio was also unhappy with , and rejected , scripts by Robert Silverberg , Chris <unk> , Dick Simmons and Theodore Sturgeon . Roddenberry blamed religious Paramount executives including Barry Diller for turning down The God Thing , a story that writer Jon Povill summarized as " God was a malfunctioning spaceship " . 
 The production start date for the film was postponed to 1977 , and Paramount brought in new staff . Jerry Isenberg was hired as executive producer , who hired writers British writers Bryant and Scott in September 1976 to begin work on a new treatment that became known as Star Trek : Planet of the Titans . After that failed , Roddenberry planned to take Star Trek back to television as the series Star Trek : Phase II , redeveloping The God Thing into the pilot episode of the series , " In Thy Image " . After this too was canceled , the story was again redeveloped to become the film Star Trek : The Motion Picture . 
 = = = Novelization = = = 
 Following the rejection of the script , Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel . After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig had asked her to type , Roddenberry sought Koenig 's collaboration on The God Thing . Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig , who added another 83 in two months . Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically , but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned . In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors , Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book . 
 In the January 1977 issue of Starlog , Roddenberry said he was not sure when the novel would be complete , but confirmed that it would discuss the meaning of God . By March 1978 , the novel was said to be half @-@ completed . Publisher Bantam Books told Roddenberry it would wait until he finished production on Phase II to resume work on the novel . When later in 1978 that production turned into The Motion Picture , Bantam gave Roddenberry an extension because the novelization was thought to be a full @-@ time effort . 
 In 1991 , Sackett discovered a partly @-@ completed manuscript while she researched documents for her book Inside Trek . This prompted her to suggest sending it to Pocket Books , which held the rights to Star Trek novels at the time , despite the prior agreement with Bantam . Roddenberry was not enthusiastic about the idea , but editor David Stern at Pocket Books was interested and wanted to know whether Sackett and fellow writer Fred Bronson would be able to expand and complete it . Contract negotiations for the work began in April 1991 , during which time Sackett had a version re @-@ typed because no electronic versions were available and the type on the existing print out was faint in places . The writers were dealing with Roddenberry 's lawyer Leonard Maizlish , but discussions lasted over six months . Two days after Roddenberry 's death on October 24 , they were informed that work on the novel would not continue . Sackett said this may have been linked to her dismissal from the Star Trek : The Next Generation television series following Roddenberry 's death . Pocket Books brought in Michael Jan Friedman to finish the work , but it was never published .
