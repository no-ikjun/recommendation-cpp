 On 18 June 1992 , a state of Emergency was announced throughout the NKR . On 15 August , the Committee for State Defense of the NKR was created , headed by Robert Kocharyan and later by Serzh Sargsyan . Partial mobilization was called for , which covered sergeants and privates in the NKR , NKR men available for military service aged 18 – 40 , officers up to the age of 50 and women with previous military training . The newly conscripted now numbered 15 @,@ 000 men . Military reforms swiftly took place consolidating many of the separate fighting Armenian volunteer detachments into a single NKR Defense Army . 
 The Azeri thrust ground to a halt when the armor was driven off by helicopter gunships . It was claimed that many of the crew members of the armored units in the Azeri launched assault were Russians from the 104th Guards Airborne Division , based out of Ganja and , ironically enough , so were the units that eventually stopped them . According to an Armenian government official , they were able to persuade Russian military units to bombard and effectively halt the advance within a few days . Russia also supplied arms to the Armenians . This allowed the Armenian government to make up its losses and reorganize a counteroffensive to restore the original lines of the front . Given the reorganization of the NKR Defense Army , the tide of Azeri advances was finally stemmed . By the autumn of 1992 , the Azerbaijani army was exhausted and had suffered heavy losses . Faced with imminent defeat , Suret Huseynov moved what was left of his army out of <unk> and back to Ganja , where it could recuperate and restock on ammunition and armaments found at the 104th Guards Airborne Division 's base . In February – March of the following year , the NKR Defense Army helped turn the tide into an unprecedented wave of advances . 
 = = = Subsequent attempts to mediate peace = = = 
 New efforts at peace talks were initiated by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in the first half of 1992 , after the events in Khojaly and the resignation of Azeri President Ayaz <unk> . Iranian diplomats conducted shuttle diplomacy and were able to bring the new president of Azerbaijan Yaqub Mammadov and President of Armenia Levon Ter @-@ Petrosian to Tehran for bilateral talks on 7 May 1992 . The Tehran Communiqué was signed by Mammadov , Ter @-@ Petrosian , and Rafsanjani following the agreement of the parties to international legal norms , stability of borders and to deal with the refugee crisis . However , the peace efforts were disrupted on the next day when Armenian troops captured the town of Shusha and completely failed following the capture of the town Lachin on 18 May . 
 In the summer of 1992 , the CSCE ( later to become the Organization for Security and Co @-@ operation in Europe ) , created the Minsk Group in Helsinki which comprised eleven nations and was co @-@ chaired by France , Russia , and the United States with the purpose of mediating a peace deal with Armenia and Azerbaijan . However , in their annual summit in 1992 , the organization failed to address and solve the many new problems that had arisen since the Soviet Union collapsed , much less the Karabakh conflict . The war in Yugoslavia , Moldova 's war with the breakaway republic of Transnistria , the secessionist movement in Chechnya , and Georgia 's renewed disputes with Russia , Abkhazia , and Ossetia were all top agenda issues that involved various ethnic groups fighting each other . 
 The CSCE proposed the use of NATO and CIS peacekeepers to monitor ceasefires and protect shipments of humanitarian aid being sent to displaced refugees . Several ceasefires were put into effect after the June offensive but the implementation of a European peacekeeping force , endorsed by Armenia , never came to fruition . The idea of sending 100 international observers to Karabakh was once raised but talks broke down completely between Armenian and Azeri leaders in July . Russia was especially opposed to allowing a multinational peacekeeping force from NATO to entering the Caucasus , seeing it as a move that encroached on its " backyard " . 
 = = = Mardakert and Martuni Offensives = = = 
 In late June , a new , smaller Azeri offensive was planned , this time against the town of Martuni in the southeastern half of Karabakh . The attack force consisted of several dozen tanks and armored fighting vehicles along with a complement of several infantry companies massing along the <unk> and <unk> fronts near Martuni and <unk> Bazar . Martuni 's regimental commander , Monte Melkonian , referred now by his men as " <unk> " , although lacking heavy armor , managed to stave off repeated attempts by the Azeri forces . 
 In late August 1992 , Nagorno @-@ Karabakh 's government found itself in a disorderly state and its members resigned on 17 August . Power was subsequently assumed by a council called the State Defense Committee and chaired by Robert Kocharyan , which stated it would temporarily govern the enclave until the conflict ended . At the same time , Azerbaijan also launched attacks by fixed @-@ wing aircraft , often bombing civilian targets . Kocharyan condemned what he believed were intentional attempts to kill civilians by the Azeris and also Russia 's alleged passive and unconcerned attitude toward allowing its army 's weapons stockpiles to be sold or transferred to Azerbaijan . 
 = = = Winter thaw = = = 
 As winter approached , both sides largely abstained from launching full @-@ scale offensives so as to preserve resources , such as gas and electricity , for domestic use . Despite the opening of an economic highway to the residents living in Karabakh , both Armenia and the enclave suffered a great deal due to the economic blockades imposed by Azerbaijan . While not completely shut off , material aid sent through Turkey arrived sporadically . 
 Experiencing both food shortages and power shortages , after the shutting down of the <unk> nuclear power plant , Armenia 's economic outlook appeared bleak : in Georgia , a new bout of civil wars against separatists in Abkhazia and Ossetia began , and supply convoys were raided and the only oil pipeline leading from Russia to Armenia repeatedly destroyed . Similar to the winter of 1991 – 1992 , the 1992 – 1993 winter was especially cold , as many families throughout Armenia and Karabakh were left without heating and hot water . 
 Grain had become difficult to procure . The Armenian Diaspora raised money and donated supplies to Armenia . In December , two shipments of 33 @,@ 000 tons of grain and 150 tons of infant formula arrived from the United States via the Black Sea port of Batumi , Georgia . In February 1993 , the European Community sent 4 @.@ 5 million <unk> to Armenia . Armenia 's southern neighbor Iran also helped Armenia economically by providing power and electricity . Elchibey 's acrimonious stance toward Iran and his remarks to unify with Iran 's Azeri minority alienated relations between the two countries . 
 Azeris displaced as internal and international refugees were forced to live in makeshift camps provided by both the Azerbaijan government and Iran . The International Red Cross also distributed blankets to the Azeris and noted that by December , enough food was being allocated for the refugees . Azerbaijan also struggled to rehabilitate its petroleum industry , the country 's chief export . Its oil refineries were not generating at full capacity and production quotas fell well short of estimates . In 1965 , the oil fields in Baku were producing 21 @.@ 5 million tons of oil annually ; by 1988 , that number had dropped down to almost 3 @.@ 3 million . <unk> Soviet refinery equipment and a reluctance by Western oil companies to invest in a war region where pipelines would routinely be destroyed prevented Azerbaijan from fully exploiting its oil wealth .

 Despite the grueling winter , the new year was viewed enthusiastically by both sides . Azerbaijan 's President Elchibey expressed optimism toward bringing an agreeable solution to the conflict with Armenia 's Ter @-@ Petrosyan . <unk> of such hope , however , quickly began to fade in January 1993 , despite the calls for a new ceasefire by Boris Yeltsin and George H. W. Bush , as hostilities in the region brewed up once more . Armenian forces began a new bout of offensives that overran villages in northern Karabakh that had been held by the Azeris since the previous autumn . 
 Frustration over these military defeats took a toll on the domestic front in Azerbaijan . Azerbaijan 's military had grown more desperate and defense minister <unk> and Huseynov 's brigade turned to Russian help , a move which ran against Elchibey 's policies and were construed as insubordination . Political infighting and arguments on where to shift military units between the country 's ministry of the interior <unk> <unk> and <unk> led to the latter 's resignation on 20 February . Armenia was similarly wracked by political turmoil and growing Armenian dissension against President Ter @-@ Petrosyan . 
 = = = Kelbajar = = = 
 Situated west of northern Karabakh , outside the official boundaries of the region , was the rayon of Kelbajar , which bordered Armenia . With a population of about 60 @,@ 000 , the several dozen villages were made up of Azeris and Kurds . In March 1993 , the Armenian @-@ held areas near the <unk> reservoir in Mardakert were reported to have been coming under attack by the Azeris . After successfully defending the Martuni region , Melkonian 's fighters were tasked to move to capture the region of Kelbajar , where the incursions and artillery shelling were said to have been coming from . 
 Scant military opposition by the Azeris allowed Melkonian 's fighters to gain a foothold in the region and along the way capture several abandoned armored vehicles and tanks . At 2 : 45 pm , on 2 April , Armenian forces from two directions advanced toward Kelbajar in an attack that struck Azerbaijani armor and troops entrenched near the Ganje @-@ <unk> intersection . Azerbaijani forces were unable to halt the advances made by Armenian armor and were wiped out completely . The second attack toward Kelbajar also quickly overran the defenders . By 3 April , Armenian forces were in possession of Kelbajar . President Elchibey imposed a state of emergency for a period of two months and introduced universal conscription . 
 On 30 April , the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) passed Resolution 822 , co @-@ sponsored by Turkey and Pakistan , demanding the immediate cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Kelbajar . Human Rights Watch concluded that during the Kelbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war , including the forcible exodus of a civilian population , indiscriminate fire , and taking of hostages . 
 The political repercussions were also felt in Azerbaijan when Huseynov embarked on his " march to Baku . " Frustrated with what he felt was Elchibey 's incompetence and demoted from his rank of colonel , his brigade advanced in early June from its base in Ganje toward Baku with the explicit aim of unseating the president . Elchibey stepped down from office on 18 June and power was assumed by then parliamentary member Heydar Aliyev . On 1 July , Huseynov was appointed prime minister of Azerbaijan . As acting president , Aliyev disbanded 33 voluntary battalions of the Popular Front , which he deemed politically unreliable . Aliyev became the President of Azerbaijan on 10 October 1993 . 
 = = = Agdam , Fizuli , <unk> and <unk> = = = 
 While the people of Azerbaijan were adjusting to the new political landscape , many Armenians were mourning Melkonian , who was killed earlier on 12 June in a skirmish with Azerbaijani light armor and infantry near the town of <unk> and given a state funeral in Yerevan . The Armenian side made use of the political crisis in Baku , which had left the Karabakh front almost undefended by the Azerbaijani forces . The following four months of political instability in Azerbaijan led to the loss of control over five districts , as well as the north of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . Azerbaijani military forces were unable to put up much resistance in the face of Armenian advances and abandoned most of their positions without so much as putting up a fight . In late June , they were driven out from Martakert , losing their final foothold of the enclave . By July , Armenian forces were preparing to attack and capture the region of Agdam , another rayon that fell outside of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , claiming that they were attempting to widen a barrier that would keep towns and villages and their positions out of the range of Azerbaijani artillery . 
 On 4 July artillery bombardment commenced against Agdam by Armenian forces , destroying many parts of the town . Soldiers , along with civilians , began to evacuate Agdam . Facing military collapse , <unk> attempted to mediate with the de facto Karabakh government and Minsk Group officials . In mid @-@ August , Armenians massed a force to take the Azerbaijani @-@ held regions of Fizuli and <unk> , south of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh proper . 
 In light of the Armenians ' advance into Azerbaijan , Turkey 's prime minister Tansu Çiller , warned the Armenian government not to attack Nakhichevan and demanded that Armenians pull out of Azerbaijan 's territories . Thousands of Turkish troops were sent to the border between Turkey and Armenia in early September . Russian Federation forces in Armenia in turn countered their movements and thus warded off the possible Turkish participation in the conflict . 
 By early September , Azerbaijani forces were nearly in complete disarray . Many of the heavy weapons they had received and bought from the Russians had been taken out of action or abandoned during the battles . Since the June 1992 offensive , Armenian forces had captured dozens of tanks , light armor , and artillery from Azerbaijan . For example , according to Monte Melkonian in a television interview in March 1993 , his forces in Martuni alone had captured or destroyed a total of 55 T @-@ 72s , 24 BMP @-@ 2s , 15 APCs and 25 pieces of heavy artillery since the June 1992 Goranboy offensive . " Most of our arms , " he stated , " [ were ] captured from Azerbaijan . " Serzh Sargsyan , the then military leader of the Karabakh armed forces , tallied a total of 156 tanks captured through the course of the war . By the summer of 1993 , Armenian forces had captured so much equipment that many of them were praising Elchibey , since he was , in effect , arming both sides . 
 Further signs of Azerbaijan 's desperation included the recruitment by Aliyev of 1 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 500 Afghan and Arab <unk> fighters from Afghanistan . Although the Azerbaijani government denied this claim , correspondence and photographs captured by Armenian forces indicated otherwise . A United States @-@ based petroleum company , MEGA <unk> , also hired several American military trainers as a prerequisite for Azerbaijan to grant it drilling rights at its oil fields . 
 = = Aerial warfare = = 
 The aerial warfare in Karabakh involved primarily fighter jets and attack helicopters . The primary transport helicopters of the war were the Mi @-@ 8 and its cousin , the Mi @-@ 17 and were used extensively by both sides . Armenia 's active air force consisted of only two Su @-@ 25 ground support bombers , one of which was lost due to friendly fire . There were also several Su @-@ 22s and Su @-@ 17s ; however , these aging craft took a backseat for the duration of the war . In total , throughout the war Armenians brought down 28 Azerbaijani warplanes and 19 military helicopters . 
 Azerbaijan 's air force was composed of forty @-@ five combat aircraft which were often piloted by experienced Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries from the former Soviet military . They flew mission sorties over Karabakh with such sophisticated jets as the MiG @-@ 25 and Sukhoi Su @-@ 24 and with older @-@ generation Soviet fighter bombers , such as the MiG @-@ 21 . They were reported to have been paid a monthly salary of over 5 @,@ 000 rubles and flew bombing campaigns from air force bases in Azerbaijan often targeting Stepanakert . 
 These pilots , like the men from the Soviet interior forces in the onset of the conflict , were also poor and took the jobs as a means of supporting their families . Several were shot down over the city by Armenian forces and according to one of the pilots ' commanders , with assistance provided by the Russians . Many of these pilots faced the threat of execution by Armenian forces if they were shot down . The setup of the defense system severely hampered Azerbaijan 's ability to carry out and launch more air strikes . The most widely used helicopter gunship by both the Armenians and Azeris was the Soviet @-@ made Mil Mi @-@ 24 <unk> .

 Below is a table listing the number of aircraft that were used by Armenia and Azerbaijan during the war .

 In October 1993 , <unk> was formally elected president and promised to bring social order to the country in addition to recapturing the lost regions . In October , Azerbaijan joined the CIS . The winter season was marked with similar conditions as in the previous year , both sides scavenging for wood and harvesting foodstuffs months in advance . Two subsequent UNSC resolutions on the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh conflict were passed , ( 874 and 884 ) , in October and November and , although <unk> the same points as the previous two , they acknowledged Nagorno @-@ Karabakh as a party to the conflict . 
 In early January , Azerbaijani forces and Afghan guerrillas recaptured part of the Fizuli district , including the railway junction of <unk> on the Iranian border , but failed to recapture the town of Fizuli itself . On 10 January 1994 an offensive was launched by Azerbaijan toward the region of Martakert in an attempt to recapture the northern section of the enclave . The offensive managed to advance and take back several parts of Karabakh in the north and to the south but soon petered out . In response , the Republic of Armenia began sending conscripts and regular Army and Interior Ministry troops to stop the Azerbaijani advance in Karabakh . To bolster the ranks of its army , the Armenian government issued a decree that instituted a three @-@ month call @-@ up for men up to age forty @-@ five and resorted to press @-@ gang raids to enlist recruits . Several active @-@ duty Armenian Army soldiers were captured by the Azerbaijani forces . 
 Azerbaijan 's offensives grew more desperate as boys as young as 16 , with little to no training , were recruited and sent to take part in ineffective human wave attacks ( a tactic often compared to the one employed by Iran during the Iran – Iraq War ) . The two offensives that took place in the winter cost Azerbaijan as many as 5 @,@ 000 lives ( at the loss of several hundred Armenians ) . The main Azeri offensive was aimed at recapturing the Kelbajar district , which would thus threaten the Lachin corridor . The attack initially met little resistance and was successful in capturing the vital Omar Pass . However , as the Armenian forces reacted , the bloodiest clashes of the war ensued and the Azeri forces were soundly defeated . In a single episode of that time 's clashes , Azerbaijan lost about fifteen hundred of its soldiers after the failed offensive in Kelbajar . Several Azeri brigades were isolated when the Armenians recaptured the Omar Pass , surrounded , then destroyed . 
 While the political leadership changed hands several times in Azerbaijan , most Armenian soldiers in Karabakh claimed that the Azeri youth , and Azeris themselves , were demoralized and lacked a sense of purpose and commitment to fighting the war . Russian professor Georgiy I. Mirsky lent credence to this view in his 1997 book , On Ruins of Empire , stating that " Karabakh does not matter to Azerbaijanis as much as it does to Armenians . Probably , this is why young volunteers from Armenia proper have been much more eager to fight and die for Karabakh than the Azerbaijanis have . " This view received further validation in a report filed by a journalist from the New York Times visiting the region , who noted that " In Stepanakert , it is impossible to find an able @-@ bodied man – whether volunteer from Armenia or local resident – out of uniform . [ Whereas in ] Azerbaijan , draft @-@ age men hang out in cafes . " Andrei Sakharov famously remarked on this at the outset of the conflict : " For Azerbaijan the issue of Karabakh is a matter of ambition , for the Armenians of Karabakh , it is a matter of life or death . " 
 = = = 1994 ceasefire = = = 
 After six years of intense fighting , both sides were ready for a ceasefire . Azerbaijan , with its manpower exhausted and aware that Armenian forces had an unimpeded path to march on to Baku , counted on a new ceasefire proposal from either the CSCE or Russia . As the final battles of the conflict took place near Shahumyan , in a series of brief engagements in <unk> , Armenian and Azerbaijani diplomats met in the early part of 1994 to hammer out the details of the ceasefire . On May 5 , with Russia acting as a mediator , all parties agreed to cease hostilities and vowed to observe a ceasefire that would go into effect at 12 : 01 AM on May 12 . The agreement was signed by the respective defense ministers of the three principle warring parties ( Armenia , Azerbaijan , and the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic ) . In Azerbaijan , many welcomed the end of hostilities . Sporadic fighting continued in some parts of the region but all sides vowed to abide by the terms of the ceasefire . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 Valuable footage of the conflict was provided by a number of journalists from both sides , including Vardan Hovhannisyan , who won the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival 's prize for best new documentary filmmaker for his A Story of People in War and Peace , and <unk> <unk> , who was posthumously awarded the title of National Hero of Azerbaijan . Armenian @-@ Russian journalist Dmitri <unk> who spent a year at the front line and filmed many of the battles later wrote that both Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists were preoccupied with echoing the official stands of their respective governments and that " <unk> was being sacrificed for ideology . " Armenian military commanders were eager to give interviews following Azerbaijani offensives when they were able to criticise the other side for launching heavy artillery attacks that the " small @-@ numbered but proud Armenians " had to fight off . Yet they were reluctant to speak out when Armenian troops seized a village outside Nagorno @-@ Karabakh in order to avoid justifying such acts . Therefore , Armenian journalists felt the need to be creative enough to portray the event as " an Armenian counter @-@ offensive " or as " a necessary military operation . " 
 Bulgarian journalist <unk> <unk> is noted for her coverage of Operation Ring . Some foreign journalists previously concerned with emphasizing the Soviet conceding in the Cold War , gradually shifted towards presenting the USSR as a country swamped by a wave of ethnic conflicts , the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh conflict being one of them . 
 Foreign reporters often referenced religious factors in the conflict , i.e. the fact that Armenians were predominantly Christian , and outside coverage of the conflict is often skewed by allegiances . 
 = = Post @-@ ceasefire violence and mediation = = 
 Today , the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh conflict remains one of several frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union , alongside Georgia 's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Moldova 's troubles with Transnistria . Karabakh remains under the jurisdiction of the government of the unrecognized but de facto independent Republic of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , which maintains its own uniformed military , the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Defense Army . 
 Contrary to media reports that nearly always mentioned the religions of the Armenians and Azeris religious aspects never gained significance as an additional casus belli , and the Karabakh conflict has remained primarily an issue of territory and the human rights of Armenians in Karabakh . Since 1995 , the co @-@ chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group has been mediating with the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan to settle for a new solution . Numerous proposals have been made which have primarily been based on both sides making several concessions . One such proposal stipulated that as Armenian forces withdrew from the seven regions surrounding Karabakh , Azerbaijan would share some of its economic assets including profits from an oil pipeline that would go from Baku through Armenia to Turkey . Other proposals also included that Azerbaijan would provide the broadest form of autonomy to Karabakh next to granting it full independence . Armenia has also been pressured by being excluded from major economic projects throughout the region , including the Baku @-@ Tbilisi @-@ Ceyhan pipeline and Kars @-@ Tbilisi @-@ Baku railway . 
 According to Armenia 's former president , Levon Ter @-@ Petrosyan , by giving certain Karabakh territories to Azerbaijan , the Karabakh conflict would have been resolved in 1997 . A peace agreement could have been concluded and a status for Nagorno @-@ Karabakh would have been determined . Ter @-@ Petrosyan noted years later that the Karabakh leadership approach was maximalist and " they thought they could get more . " Most autonomy proposals have been rejected , however , by the Armenians , who consider it as a matter that is not negotiable . Likewise , Azerbaijan has also refused to let the matter subside and regularly threatens to resume hostilities . On 30 March 1998 , Robert Kocharyan was elected president and continued to reject calls for making a deal to resolve the conflict . In 2001 , Kocharyan and Aliyev met in Key West , Florida for peace talks sponsored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe . While several Western diplomats expressed optimism , failure to prepare the populations of either country for compromise reportedly thwarted hopes for a peaceful resolution . 
 Refugees displaced from the fighting amount to nearly one million people . An estimated 400 @,@ 000 Armenians living in Azerbaijan fled to Armenia or Russia and a further 30 @,@ 000 came from Karabakh . Many of those who left Karabakh returned after the war ended . An estimated 800 @,@ 000 Azeris were displaced from the fighting including those from both Armenia and Karabakh . Various other ethnic groups living in Karabakh were also forced to live in refugee camps built by both the Azeri and Iranian governments . Although Azerbaijan has repeatedly claimed that 20 % of its territory has fallen under Armenian control and other sources have given figures as high 40 % , the actual percentage , taking into account the exclave of Nakhichevan , is estimated to be closer to 13 @.@ 62 % or 14 % ( the number comes down to 9 % if Nagorno @-@ Karabakh itself is excluded ) . 
 The Nagorno @-@ Karabakh war has given rise to strong anti @-@ <unk> in Azerbaijan and anti @-@ Azerbaijani sentiment in Armenia . The ramifications of the war were said to have played a part in the February 2004 murder of Armenian Lieutenant Gurgen <unk> who was hacked to death with an axe by his Azerbaijani counterpart , Ramil Safarov at a NATO training seminar in Budapest , Hungary . Upon his extradition in 2012 Safarov was pardoned by president Aliyev and greeted as a hero in Azerbaijan . 
 Azerbaijani enmity against anything Armenian led to the destruction of thousands of medieval Armenian gravestones , known as khachkars , at a massive cemetery in Julfa , Nakhichevan . This destruction was temporarily halted when first revealed in 1998 , but then continued on to completion in 2005 . Azerbaijan has likened Armenia 's control of the region to the Nazi occupation of the Soviet Union during World War II . 
 = = Current situation = = 
 In the years since the end of the war , a number of organizations have passed resolutions regarding the conflict . On 25 January 2005 , for example , PACE adopted a controversial non @-@ binding resolution , Resolution 1416 , which criticized the " large @-@ scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of mono @-@ ethnic areas " and declared that Armenian forces were occupying Azerbaijan lands . On 14 May 2008 thirty @-@ nine countries from the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 62 / 243 which called for " the immediate , complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Armenian forces from all occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan . " Almost one hundred countries , however , abstained from voting while seven countries , including the three co @-@ chairs of the Minsk Group , Russia , the United States , and France , voted against it . 
 During the summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) and the session of its Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs , member states adopted OIC Resolution № 10 / 11 and OIC Council of Foreign Ministers Resolution № 10 / 37 , on 14 March 2008 and 18 – 20 May 2010 , respectively . Both resolutions condemned alleged aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan and called for immediate implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 822 , 853 , 874 and 884 . As a response , Armenian leaders have stated Azerbaijan was " exploiting Islam to muster greater international support . " 
 In 2008 , the Moscow Defense Brief opined that because of the rapid growth of Azeri defense expenditures – which is driving the strong rearmament of the Azeri armed forces – the military balance appeared to be now shifting in Azerbaijan 's favor : " ... The overall trend is clearly in Azerbaijan 's favor , and it seems that Armenia will not be able to sustain an arms race with Azerbaijan 's oil @-@ fueled economy . And this could lead to the destabilization of the frozen conflict between these two states , " the journal wrote . Other analysts have made more cautious observations , noting that administrative and military deficiencies are obviously found in the Azerbaijani military and that the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Defense Army maintains a " constant state of readiness ... " 
 = = = Clashes = = = 
 In early 2008 , tensions between Armenia , the NKR Karabakh and Azerbaijan grew . On the diplomatic front , President Ilham Aliyev repeated statements that Azerbaijan would resort to force , if necessary , to take the territories back ; concurrently , shooting incidents along the line of contact increased . On 5 March 2008 a significant breach of the ceasefire occurred in Mardakert , when up to sixteen soldiers were killed . Both sides accused the other of starting the battle . Moreover , the use of artillery in the skirmishes marked a significant departure from previous clashes , which usually involved only sniper or machine gun fire . Deadly skirmishes took place during the summer of 2010 as well . 
 Tensions escalated again in July – August 2014 with ceasefire breaches by Azerbaijan taking place and the President of Azerbaijan , Aliyev , threatening Armenia with war . 
 Rather than receding , the tension in the area increased in April 2016 with the 2016 Armenian @-@ Azerbaijani clashes when the worst clashes since the 1994 ceasefire erupted . The Armenian Defense Ministry alleged that Azerbaijan launched an offensive to seize territory in the region . Azerbaijan reported that 12 of its soldiers were killed in action and that a Mil Mi @-@ 24 helicopter and tank were also destroyed . Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan stated that 18 Armenian soldiers were killed and 35 were wounded . 
 = = Misconduct = = 
 Emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union as nascent states and due to the near @-@ immediate fighting , it was not until mid @-@ 1993 that Armenia and Azerbaijan became signatories of international law agreements , including the Geneva Conventions . Allegations from all three governments ( including Nagorno @-@ Karabakh 's ) regularly accused the other side of committing atrocities which were at times confirmed by third party media sources or human rights organizations . Khojaly Massacre , for example , was confirmed by both Human Rights Watch and Memorial . <unk> Massacre was testified by British @-@ based organization Christian Solidarity International and by the Vice @-@ Speaker of the British Parliament 's House of Lords Caroline Cox in 1992 . Azerbaijan was condemned by HRW for its use of aerial bombing in densely populated civilian areas and both sides were criticized for indiscriminate fire , hostage @-@ taking and the forcible displacement of civilians . 
 The lack of international laws for either side to abide by virtually sanctioned activity in the war to what would be considered war crimes . Looting and mutilation ( body parts such as ears , brought back from the front as treasured war souvenirs ) of dead soldiers were commonly reported and even boasted about among soldiers . Another practice that took form , not by soldiers but by regular civilians during the war , was the bartering of prisoners between Armenians and Azerbaijanis . Often , when contact was lost between family members and a soldier or a militiaman serving at the front , they took it upon themselves to organize an exchange by personally capturing a soldier from the battle lines and holding them in the confines of their own homes . New York Times journalist Yo 'av Karny noted this practice was as " old as the people occupying [ the ] land . " 
 After the war ended , both sides accused their opponents of continuing to hold captives ; Azerbaijan claimed Armenia was continuing to hold nearly 5 @,@ 000 Azerbaijani prisoners while Armenians claimed Azerbaijan was holding 600 prisoners . The non @-@ profit group , Helsinki Initiative 92 , investigated two prisons in Shusha and Stepanakert after the war ended , but concluded there were no prisoners @-@ of @-@ war there . A similar investigation arrived at the same conclusion while searching for Armenians allegedly laboring in Azerbaijan 's quarries . 
 = = Cultural legacy = = 
 The conflict has come to be represented in different forms of media in Armenia and Azerbaijan . In June 2006 , the film <unk> ( Destiny ) premiered in Yerevan and Stepanakert . The film stars and is written by Gor Vardanyan and is a fictionalized account of the events revolving around Operation Ring . It cost $ 3 @.@ 8 million to make , the most expensive film ever made in the country , and was the first film made about the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War . In the summer of 2012 , Azerbaijanis in Azerbaijan released a video game entitled <unk> <unk> : <unk> ( Under Occupation : Shusha ) , a free first person shooter that allows the player to assume the role of an Azerbaijani soldier who takes part in the 1992 battle of Shusha . Commentators have noted that the game " is not for the faint of heart : there 's lots of killing and computer @-@ generated gore . To a great extent , it 's a celebration of violence : to advance , players must handle a variety of tasks , including shooting lots of Armenian enemies , rescuing a wounded Azerbaijani soldier , retrieving a document and blowing up a building in the town of Shusha . " Another opus followed , <unk> <unk> : <unk> , which was released in 2013 . This episode is very similar to the previous one , but this time it takes place in Agdam .

 = Abu Nidal = 
 Sabri Khalil al @-@ Banna ( May 1937 – 16 August 2002 ) , known as Abu Nidal , was the founder of Fatah – The Revolutionary Council , a militant Palestinian splinter group more commonly known as the Abu Nidal Organization ( ANO ) . At the height of its power in the 1970s and 1980s , the ANO was widely regarded as the most ruthless of the Palestinian groups . 
 Abu Nidal ( " father of struggle " ) formed the ANO in October 1974 after a split from Yasser Arafat 's Fatah faction within the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) . Acting as a freelance contractor , Abu Nidal is believed to have ordered attacks in 20 countries , killing over 300 and injuring over 650 . The group 's operations included the Rome and Vienna airport attacks on 27 December 1985 , when gunmen opened fire on passengers in simultaneous shootings at El Al ticket counters , killing 20 . Patrick Seale , Abu Nidal 's biographer , wrote of the shootings that their " random cruelty marked them as typical Abu Nidal operations . " 
 Abu Nidal died after a shooting in his Baghdad apartment in August 2002 . Palestinian sources believed he was killed on the orders of Saddam Hussein , while Iraqi officials insisted he had committed suicide during an interrogation . " He was the patriot turned psychopath , " David Hirst wrote in the Guardian on the news of his death . " He served only himself , only the warped personal drives that pushed him into hideous crime . He was the ultimate mercenary . " 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Family , early education = = = 
 Abu Nidal was born in May 1937 in Jaffa , on the Mediterranean coast of what was then the British Mandate of Palestine . His father , Hajj Khalil al @-@ Banna , owned 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 24 km2 ) of orange groves situated between Jaffa and Majdal , today Ashkelon in Israel . The family lived in luxury in a three @-@ storey stone house near the beach , later used as an Israeli military court . Muhammad Khalil al @-@ Banna , Abu Nidal 's brother , told Yossi Melman : 
 My father ... was the richest man in Palestine . He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe – especially to England and Germany . He owned a summer house in Marseilles , France , and another house in İskenderun , then in Syria and afterwards Turkey , and a number of houses in Palestine itself . Most of the time we lived in Jaffa . Our house had about twenty rooms , and we children would go down to swim in the sea . We also had stables with Arabian horses , and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool . I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool . 
 Khalil al @-@ Banna 's wealth allowed him to take several wives . According to Abu Nidal in an interview with Der Spiegel , his father had 13 wives , 17 sons and eight daughters . Melman writes that Abu Nidal 's mother was the eighth wife ; she had been one of the family 's maids , a 16 @-@ year @-@ old Alawite girl . The family disapproved of the marriage , according to Patrick Seale , and as a result Abu Nidal , Khalil 's 12th child , was apparently looked down on by his older siblings , although in later life the relationships were repaired . 
 In 1944 or 1945 his father sent him to Collège des Frères , a French mission school in Jaffa , which he attended for one year . The father died in 1945 when Abu Nidal was seven years old , and the family turned his mother out of the house . His brothers took him out of the mission school and enrolled him instead in a prestigious , private Muslim school in Jerusalem , now known as <unk> Elementary School . He attended for about two years . 
 = = = 1948 Palestine War = = = 
 On 29 November 1947 , the United Nations resolved to partition Palestine into an Arab and Jewish state . Fighting broke out immediately , and the disruption of the citrus @-@ fruit business hit the family 's income . In Jaffa there were food shortages , truck bombs and an Irgun mortar bombardment . Melman writes that the al @-@ Banna family had had good relations with the Jewish community , but it was war and the relationships did not help them . Abu Nidal 's brother told Melman : 
 My father was a close friend of Avraham Shapira , one of the founders of Hashomer , the Jewish self @-@ defense organization . He would visit [ Shapira ] in his home in Petah Tikva , or Shapira riding his horse would visit our home in Jaffa . I also remember how we visited Dr. Weizmann [ later first president of Israel ] in his home in Rehovot . 
 Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli troops in April 1948 , the family fled to their house near Majdal , but the Jewish militias arrived there too , and they had to flee again . This time they went to the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip , then under Egyptian control . Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents , dependent on UNRWA for an allowance of oil , rice and potatoes . The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal . 
 = = = Move to Nablus and Saudi Arabia = = = 
 The al @-@ Banna family 's commercial experience , and the money they had managed to take with them , meant they could set themselves up in business again , Melman writes . Their orange groves , however , had gone , now part of the new state of Israel , which had declared its independence on 14 May 1948 . The family moved to Nablus in the West Bank , then under Jordanian control . Abu Nidal graduated from high school there in 1955 , and joined the Arab nationalist Ba 'ath party . He began a degree course in engineering at Cairo University , but left without a degree after two years . 
 In 1960 he made his way to Saudi Arabia , where he set himself up as a painter and electrician , and worked as a casual laborer for Aramco . He remained close to his mother ; his brother told Melman that Abu Nidal would return to Nablus from Saudi Arabia every year to visit her . It was during one of those visits in 1962 that he met his wife , whose family had also fled from Jaffa . The couple had a son and two daughters . 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Abu Nidal was often in poor health , according to Seale , and tended to dress in zip @-@ up jackets and old trousers , drinking whisky every night in his later years . He became , writes Seale , a " master of disguises and subterfuge , trusting no one , lonely and self @-@ protective , [ living ] like a mole , hidden away from public view . " Acquaintances said that he was capable of hard work and had a good financial brain . Salah Khalaf ( Abu Iyad ) , the deputy chief of Fatah who was assassinated by the ANO in 1991 , knew him well in the late 1960s when he took Abu Nidal under his wing . He told Seale : 
 He had been recommended to me as a man of energy and enthusiasm , but he seemed shy when we met . It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits . He was extremely good company , with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors . I rather liked that ! I discovered he was very ambitious , perhaps more than his abilities warranted , and also very excitable . He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning . 
 Seale suggests that Abu Nidal 's childhood explained his personality , described as chaotic by Abu Iyad and as psychopathic by <unk> <unk> , the late Palestinian heart surgeon . His siblings ' scorn , the loss of his father and his mother 's removal from the family home when he was seven , then the loss of his home and status in the conflict with Israel , created a mental world of plots and <unk> , reflected in his tyrannical leadership of the ANO . Members ' wives ( it was an all @-@ male group ) were not allowed to befriend each another , and Abu Nidal 's wife was expected to live in isolation without friends . 
 = = Political life = = 
 = = = Impex , Black September = = = 
 In Saudi Arabia Abu Nidal helped found a small group of young Palestinians who called themselves the Palestine Secret Organization . The activism cost him his job and home : Aramco fired him , and the Saudi government imprisoned then expelled him . 
 He returned to Nablus with his wife and family , and joined Yasser Arafat 's Fatah faction of the PLO . Working as an odd @-@ job man , he was committed to Palestinian politics but not particularly active , until Israel won the 1967 Six @-@ Day War , capturing the Golan Heights , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . Melman writes that " the entrance of the Israel Defense Forces tanks into Nablus was a traumatic experience for him . The conquest aroused him to action . " 
 He moved to Amman , Jordan , setting up a trading company called Impex . Fatah asked him to choose a nom de guerre , and he chose Abu Nidal ( " father of struggle " ) after his son , Nidal . ( It is customary in the Arab world for men to call themselves " father of " ( Abu ) , followed by their first son 's name . ) He was described by those who knew him at the time as a well @-@ organized leader , not a guerrilla ; during fighting between the Palestinian fedayeen and King Hussein 's troops , he stayed in his office . 
 Impex acted as a front for Fatah , serving as a meeting place and conduit for funds . This became a hallmark of Abu Nidal 's career . Companies controlled by the ANO made him a rich man by engaging in legitimate business deals , while acting as cover for arms deals and mercenary activities . 
 Abu Iyad appointed Abu Nidal in 1968 as the Fatah representative in Khartoum , Sudan , then ( at Abu Nidal 's insistence ) to the same position in Baghdad in July 1970 , two months before Black September , when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein 's army drove the Palestinian fedayeen out of Jordan , with the loss of thousands of lives . Seale writes that Abu Nidal 's absence from Jordan during this period , when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians , raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself . 
 = = = First operation = = = 
 Shortly after Black September , Abu Nidal began accusing the PLO of cowardice over his Voice of Palestine radio station in Iraq for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein . During Fatah 's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971 , Abu Nidal joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji <unk> and Abu Daoud ( leader of the Black September Organization responsible for the 1972 Munich Massacre ) , calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against King Hussein . 
 In February 1973 Abu Daoud was arrested in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein 's life . This led to Abu Nidal 's first operation , using the name Al @-@ <unk> ( " the Punishment " ) ; on 5 September 1973 five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris , took 15 hostages and threatened to blow up the building if Abu Daoud was not released . The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight , still holding five hostages , then to Riyadh , threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft . They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September . Abu Daoud was released from prison two weeks later ; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid King Hussein $ 12 million for his release . 
 On the day of the attack , 56 heads of state were meeting in Algiers for the 4th conference of the Non @-@ Aligned Movement . According to Seale , the Saudi Embassy operation had been commissioned by Iraq 's president , Ahmed Hasan al @-@ Bakr , as a distraction because he was jealous that Algeria was hosting the conference . Seale writes one of the hostage @-@ takers admitted that he had been told to fly the hostages around until the conference was over . 
 Abu Nidal had carried out the operation without the permission of Fatah . Abu Iyad ( Arafat 's deputy ) and Mahmoud Abbas ( later President of the Palestinian Authority ) , flew to Iraq to reason with Abu Nidal that hostage @-@ taking harmed the movement . Abu Iyad told Seale that an Iraqi official at the meeting said : " Why are you attacking Abu Nidal ? The operation was ours ! We asked him to mount it for us . " Abbas was furious and left the meeting with the other PLO delegates . From that point on , Seale writes , the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as under the control of the Iraqi government . 
 = = = Expulsion from Fatah = = = 
 Two months later , in November 1973 ( just after the Yom Kippur War in October ) , the ANO hijacked KLM Flight 861 , this time using the name Arab Nationalist Youth Organization . Fatah had been discussing convening a peace conference in Geneva ; the hijacking was intended to warn them not to go ahead with it . In response , in March or July 1974 , Arafat expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah . 
 In October 1974 Abu Nidal formed the ANO , calling it Fatah : The Revolutionary Council . In November that year a Fatah court sentenced him to death in absentia for the attempted assassination of Mahmoud Abbas . Seale writes that it is unlikely that Abu Nidal had intended to kill Abbas , and just as unlikely that Fatah wanted to kill Abu Nidal . He was invited to Beirut to discuss the death sentence , and was allowed to leave again , but it was clear that he had become persona non grata . As a result , the Iraqis gave him Fatah 's assets in Iraq , including a training camp , farm , newspaper , radio station , passports , overseas scholarships and $ 15 million worth of Chinese weapons . He also received Iraq 's regular aid to the PLO : around $ 150 @,@ 000 a month and a lump sum of $ 3 – 5 million . 
 = = ANO = = 
 = = = Nature of the organization = = = 
 In addition to Fatah : The Revolutionary Council , the ANO called itself the Palestinian National Liberation Movement , Black June ( for actions against Syria ) , Black September ( for actions against Jordan ) , the Revolutionary Arab Brigades , the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims , the Egyptian Revolution , Revolutionary Egypt , Al @-@ <unk> ( " the Storm , " a name also used by Fatah ) , Al @-@ <unk> ( " the Punishment " ) , and the Arab Nationalist Youth Organization . 
 The group had up to 500 members , chosen from young men in the Palestinian refugee camps and in Lebanon , who were promised good pay and help looking after their families . They would be sent to training camps in whichever country was hosting the ANO at the time ( Syria , Iraq or Libya ) , then organized into small cells . Once in , <unk> <unk> and Michael Fischbach write , they were not allowed to leave again . The group assumed complete control over the membership . One member who spoke to Patrick Seale was told before being sent overseas : " If we say , ' Drink alcohol ' " , do so . If we say , ' Get married , ' find a woman and marry her . If we say , ' Don 't have children , ' you must obey . If we say , ' Go and kill King Hussein , ' you must be ready to sacrifice yourself ! " 
 Seale writes that recruits were asked to write out their life stories , including names and addresses of family and friends , then sign a paper saying they agreed to execution if discovered to have intelligence connections . If suspected , they would be asked to rewrite the whole story , without discrepancies . The ANO 's newspaper Filastin al @-@ Thawra regularly announced the execution of <unk> himself writes that Abu Nidal was admitted his organization was deeply penetrated by Israeli agents . The theory that he himself was one such agent is deemed to be far @-@ fetched , but Israel may have had an interest in undermining Palestinian groups disposed to the idea of making compromises . 
 = = = Committee for Revolutionary Justice = = = 
 There were reports of purges throughout the 1970s and 1980s . Around 600 ANO members were killed in Lebanon and Libya , including 171 in one night in November 1987 , when they were lined up , shot and thrown into a mass grave . Dozens were kidnapped in Syria and killed in the Badawi refugee camp . Most of the decisions to kill , Abu Daoud told Seale , were taken by Abu Nidal " in the middle of the night , after he [ had ] knocked back a whole bottle of whiskey . " The purges led to the defection from the ANO in 1989 of Atif Abu Bakr , head of the ANO 's political directorate , who returned to Fatah . 
 Members were routinely tortured by the " Committee for Revolutionary Justice " until they confessed to disloyalty . Seale writes that reports of torture included hanging a man naked , whipping him until he was unconscious , reviving him with cold water , then rubbing salt or chili powder into his wounds . A naked prisoner would be forced into a car tyre with his legs and backside in the air , then whipped , wounded , salted and revived with cold water . A member 's testicles might be fried in oil , or melted plastic dripped onto his skin . Between interrogations , prisoners would be tied up in tiny cells . If the cells were full , Seale writes , they might be buried with a pipe in their mouths for air and water ; if Abu Nidal wanted them dead , a bullet would be fired down the pipe instead . 
 = = = Intelligence Directorate = = = 
 The Intelligence Directorate was formed in 1985 to oversee special operations . It had four subcommittees : the Committee for Special Missions , the Foreign Intelligence Committee , the <unk> Committee and the Lebanon Committee . Led by Abd al @-@ Rahman Isa , the longest @-@ serving member of the ANO – Seale writes that Isa was unshaven and shabby , but charming and persuasive – the directorate maintained 30 – 40 people overseas who looked after the ANO 's arms caches in various countries . It trained staff , arranged passports and visas , and reviewed security at airports and seaports . Members were not allowed to visit each other at home , and no one outside the directorate was supposed to know who was a member . 
 Isa was demoted in 1987 , because Abu Nidal believed he had become too close to other figures within the ANO . Always keen to punish members by humiliating them , Abu Nidal insisted he remain in the Intelligence Directorate , forcing him to work for his previous subordinates , who according to Seale were told to treat him with contempt . 
 = = = Committee for Special Missions = = = 
 The job of the Committee for Special Missions was to choose targets . It had started life as the Military Committee , headed by Naji Abu al @-@ Fawaris , who had led the attack on Heinz <unk> , head of the Israel @-@ Austria Friendship League , who was shot and killed in 1981 . In 1982 the committee changed its name to the Committee for Special Missions , headed by Dr. Ghassan al @-@ Ali , who had been born in the West Bank and educated in England , where he obtained a BA and MA in chemistry and married a British woman ( later divorced ) . A former ANO member told Seale that Ali favoured " the most extreme and reckless operations . "

 = = = Shlomo Argov = = = 
 On 3 June 1982 , ANO operative Hussein Ghassan Said shot Shlomo Argov , the Israeli ambassador to Britain , once in the head as he left the Dorchester Hotel in London . Said was accompanied by Nawaf al @-@ <unk> , an Iraqi intelligence officer , and Marwan al @-@ Banna , Abu Nidal 's cousin . Argov survived , but spent three months in a coma and the rest of his life disabled , until his death in February 2003 . The PLO quickly denied responsibility for the attack . 
 Ariel Sharon , then Israel 's defence minister , responded three days later by invading Lebanon , where the PLO was based , a reaction that Seale argues Abu Nidal had intended . The Israeli government had been preparing to invade and Abu Nidal provided a pretext . Der Spiegel put it to him in October 1985 that the assassination of Argov , when he knew Israel wanted to attack the PLO in Lebanon , made him appear to be working for the Israelis , in the view of Yasser Arafat . He replied : 
 What Arafat says about me doesn 't bother me . Not only he , but also a whole list of Arab and world politicians claim that I am an agent of the Zionists or the CIA . Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB . The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini . During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime . Now they say that we are Syrian agents . ... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal . They wanted to find a weak point in his character . The result was zero . 
 = = = Rome and Vienna = = = 
 Abu Nidal 's most infamous operation was the 1985 attack on the Rome and Vienna airports . On 27 December , at 08 : 15 GMT , four gunmen opened fire on the El Al ticket counter at the Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport in Rome , killing 16 and wounding 99 . In Vienna International Airport a few minutes later , three men threw hand grenades at passengers waiting to check into a flight to Tel Aviv , killing four and wounding 39 . According to Seale , the gunmen had been told the people in civilian clothes at the check @-@ in counter were Israeli pilots returning from a training mission . 
 Austria and Italy had both been involved in trying to arrange peace talks . Sources close to Abu Nidal told Seale that Libyan intelligence had supplied the weapons . The damage to the PLO was enormous , according to Abu Iyad , Arafat 's deputy . Most people in the West and even many Arabs could not distinguish between the ANO and Fatah , he said . " When such horrible things take place , ordinary people are left thinking that all Palestinians are criminals . " 
 = = = United States bombing of Libya = = = 
 On 15 April 1986 , the US launched bombing raids from British bases against Tripoli and Benghazi , killing around 100 , in retaliation for the bombing of a Berlin nightclub used by US service personnel . The dead were reported to include Hanna Gaddafi , the adoptive daughter of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ; two of his other children were injured . 
 British journalist Alec Collett , who had been kidnapped in Beirut in March , was hanged after the airstrikes , reportedly by ANO operatives ; his remains were found in the Beqaa Valley in November 2009 . The bodies of two British teachers , Leigh Douglas and Philip Padfield , and an American , Peter Kilburn , were found in a village near Beirut on 17 April 1986 ; the Arab Fedayeen Cells , a name linked to Abu Nidal , claimed responsibility . British journalist John McCarthy was kidnapped the same day . 
 = = = Hindawi affair = = = 
 On 17 April 1986 – the day the bodies of the teachers were found and McCarthy was kidnapped – Ann Marie Murphy , a pregnant Irish chambermaid , was discovered in Heathrow airport with a Semtex bomb in the false bottom of one of her bags . She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London . The bag had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé Nizar Hindawi , who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married . 
 According to Melman , Abu Nidal had recommended Hindawi to Syrian intelligence . Seale writes that the bomb had been manufactured by Abu Nidal 's technical committee , who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence . It was sent to London in a diplomatic bag and given to Hindawi . According to Seale , it was widely believed that the attack was in response to Israel having forced down a jet , two months earlier , carrying Syrian officials to Damascus , which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians . 
 = = = Pan Am Flight 73 = = = 
 On 5 September 1986 , four ANO gunmen hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 at Karachi Airport on its way from Mumbai to New York , holding 389 passengers and crew for 16 hours in the plane on the tarmac before detonating grenades inside the cabin . Neerja Bhanot , the flight 's senior purser , was able to open an emergency door , and most passengers escaped ; 20 died , including Bhanot , and 120 were wounded . The London Times reported in March 2004 that Libya had been behind the hijacking . 
 = = = Relationship with Gaddafi = = = 
 Abu Nidal began to move his organization out of Syria to Libya in the summer of 1986 , arriving there in March 1987 . In June that year the Syrian government expelled him , in part because of the Hindawi affair and Pan Am Flight 73 hijacking . 
 He repeatedly took credit during this period for operations in which he had no involvement , including the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing , 1985 Bradford City stadium fire , and 1986 assassination of Zafir al @-@ Masri , the mayor of Nablus ( killed by the PFLP , according to Seale ) . He also implied that he had been behind the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster by publishing a congratulatory note in the ANO magazine , writes Seale . 
 Abu Nidal and Libya 's leader , Muammar Gaddafi , allegedly became great friends , each holding what Marie Colvin and Sonya Murad called a " dangerous combination of an inferiority complex mixed with the belief that he was a man of great destiny . " The relationship gave Abu Nidal a sponsor and Gaddafi a mercenary . Seale reports that Libya brought out the worst in Abu Nidal . He would not allow even the most senior ANO members to socialize with each other ; all meetings had to be reported to him . All passports had to be handed over . No one was allowed to travel without his permission . Ordinary members were not allowed to have telephones ; senior members were allowed to make local calls only . His members knew nothing about his daily life , including where he lived . If he wanted to entertain , Seale writes , he would take over the home of another member . 
 According to Abu Bakr , speaking to Al <unk> in 2002 , Abu Nidal said he was behind the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 , which exploded over Lockerbie , Scotland , on 21 December 1988 ; a former head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines was later convicted . Abu Nidal reportedly said of Lockerbie , according to Seale : " We do have some involvement in this matter , but if anyone so much as mentions it , I will kill him with my own hands ! " Seale writes that the ANO appeared to have no connection to it ; one of Abu Nidal 's associates told him , " If an American soldier tripped in some corner of the globe , Abu Nidal would instantly claim it as his own work . " 
 = = = Banking with BCCI = = = 
 In the late 1980s British intelligence learned that the ANO held accounts with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International ( BCCI ) in London . BCCI was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators in six countries after evidence emerged of widespread fraud . Abu Nidal himself was said to have visited London using the name <unk> Farhan ; a BCCI branch manager , who passed information about the ANO accounts to MI5 , reportedly drove him around several stores in London without realizing who he was . Abu Nidal was using a company called SAS International Trading and Investments in Warsaw as cover for arms deals . The company 's transactions included the purchase of riot guns , ostensibly for Syria , then when the British refused an export licence to Syria , for an African state ; in fact half the shipment went to the police in East Germany and half to Abu Nidal . 
 = = = Assassination of Abu Iyad = = = 
 On 14 January 1991 in Tunis , the night before U.S. forces moved into Kuwait , the ANO assassinated Abu Iyad , head of PLO intelligence , along with Abu al @-@ Hol , Fatah 's chief of security , and Fakhri al @-@ Umari , another Fatah aide ; all three men were shot in Abu Iyad 's home . The killer , Hamza Abu Zaid , confessed that an ANO operative had hired him . When he shot Abu Iyad , he reportedly shouted , " Let Atif Abu Bakr help you now ! " , a reference to the senior ANO member who had left the group in 1989 , and whom Abu Nidal believed had been planted within the ANO by Abu Iyad as a spy . Abu Iyad had known that Abu Nidal nursed a hatred of him , in part because he had kept Abu Nidal out of the PLO . But the real reason for the hatred , Abu Iyad told Seale , was that he had protected Abu Nidal in his early years within the movement . Given his personality , Abu Nidal could not acknowledge that debt . Seale writes that the murder " must therefore be seen as a final settlement of old scores . " 
 = = Death = = 
 After Libyan intelligence operatives were charged with the Lockerbie bombing , Gaddafi tried to distance himself from terrorism . Abu Nidal was expelled from Libya in 1999 , and in 2002 he returned to Iraq ; the Iraqi government later said he had entered the country using a fake Yemeni passport and false name . 
 On 19 August 2002 , the Palestinian newspaper al @-@ <unk> reported that Abu Nidal had died three days earlier of multiple gunshot wounds at his home in Baghdad , a house the newspaper said was owned by the Mukhabarat , the Iraqi secret service . Two days later Iraq 's chief of intelligence , Taher Jalil Habbush , handed out photographs of Abu Nidal 's body to journalists , along with a medical report that said he had died after a bullet entered his mouth and exited through his skull . Habbush said Iraqi officials had arrived at Abu Nidal 's home to arrest him on suspicion of conspiring with foreign governments . After saying he needed a change of clothes , he went into his bedroom and shot himself in the mouth , according to Habbush . He died eight hours later in hospital . 
 Jane 's reported in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents in his home about a U.S. attack on Iraq . When they raided the house , fighting broke out between Abu Nidal 's men and Iraqi intelligence . In the midst of this , Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed ; Palestinian sources told Jane 's that he had been shot several times . Jane 's suggested Saddam Hussein had him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him in the event of an American invasion . 
 In 2008 Robert Fisk obtained a report written in September 2002 , for Saddam Hussein 's " presidency intelligence office , " by Iraq 's " Special Intelligence Unit M4 . " The report said that the Iraqis had been interrogating Abu Nidal in his home as a suspected spy for Kuwait and Egypt , and indirectly for the United States .

 = Duke ( album ) = 
 Duke is the tenth studio album by English rock band Genesis , released in March 1980 on Charisma Records . It was the first album by the group to reach No. 1 in the UK charts and featured the singles " Turn It On Again " , " Duchess " , and " Misunderstanding " . 
 The album followed a period of inactivity for the band in early 1979 . Phil Collins moved to Vancouver , Canada , in an effort to salvage his failing first marriage , while Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford recorded solo albums . Collins returned to the UK after his marriage ended and wrote a significant amount of material , some of which was used for Duke and some was later reworked for his first solo album , Face Value . Duke contained a mix of individually @-@ written songs and tracks that evolved from jam sessions in mid @-@ 1979 , while recording took place at the end of the year . 
 The break in activity rejuvenated the band , and they found the album an easy one to work on . The album contained the first use of a drum machine by Genesis on " Duchess " , and as well as the hit singles included more experimental pieces such as the closing ten @-@ minute " Duke 's Travels " / " Duke 's End " suite . The album has since been certified Platinum in both the UK and U.S. 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1978 , Genesis were a trio of lead singer and drummer Phil Collins , keyboardist Tony Banks and guitarist / bassist Mike Rutherford . They had survived the loss of original frontman Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett and released the album ... And Then There Were Three ... , which included the top ten single " Follow You Follow Me " . The group were still touring successfully , and enjoyed the songwriting collaborations between the three of them . They decided to take a break before writing and recording a new album , which would be largely group @-@ written in a rehearsal room , without many pre @-@ conceived ideas . 
 The group 's touring schedule had put particular pressure on Collins , whose marriage was at risk of collapse due to him being away from home frequently . His wife , Andrea , had warned him that if he committed himself to the full ... And Then There Were Three ... tour , she would not be there when he returned . Collins , however , was convinced that Genesis were on the verge of an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future . By the end of 1978 , Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver , Canada with their children . Realising that his marriage was more important than the band , Collins held a meeting with Banks , Rutherford and manager Tony Smith . He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re @-@ build the family , and that the group would have to accommodate this . In an interview for Sounds , Collins said , " I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band . It was just that if I was going to be living in Vancouver then we 'd have had to organise ourselves differently . " He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed . 
 Banks and Rutherford suggested the band take an extended hiatus , hoping Collins would save his marriage and that the band could work with him in Vancouver . Banks recorded a solo album A Curious Feeling in Polar Studios , Stockholm with Genesis touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon , while Rutherford also recorded his first solo album , <unk> 's Day , at the same studio . In April 1979 , Collins returned to the UK after the attempt to salvage his marriage failed . With time to spare before working on the next Genesis album , he gigged with Brand X , and began work on demo tracks for what became his first solo album Face Value at his home in Shalford , Surrey . As well as playing piano and synthesizers , he had recently picked up a Roland drum machine and become interested in the possibilities of electronic drums . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 In autumn 1979 , Banks and Rutherford moved in with Collins in Shalford to start rehearsals on Duke . Collins had written a large number of songs , but he felt many of them would not suit Genesis , while Banks and Rutherford were short of material having just recorded their solo albums . The three decided each member should contribute two of their own songs for the band to work on . Banks put forward " <unk> " and " Cul @-@ de @-@ Sac " , Rutherford used " Man of Our Times " and " Alone Tonight " , and Collins had " Misunderstanding " and " Please Don 't Ask " . The remainder of the songs were written together in rehearsals . Banks later regretted not choosing Collins ' " In the Air Tonight " for the album . 
 The group found the writing process easier and more enjoyable than ... And Then There Were Three .... Rutherford summarised his time writing songs for Duke as " getting back to the basic stage of ideas being worked on jointly " . Banks reasoned much of the band 's refreshed attitude was " down to not having worked together in a while " which resulted in " good ideas " being put forward , something that he said had not " happened for some time . " Collins felt the band interacted " as a group much better ... there 's definitely a side to us coming out which wasn 't on the last album ; the playing side " . In contrast to earlier Genesis albums , most tracks were short with the exception of the ten @-@ minute " Duke 's Travels " / " Duke 's End " suite that closed the album . 
 In its original form , " Behind The Lines " , " Duchess " , " Guide Vocal " , " Turn It On Again " , " Duke 's Travels " , and " Duke 's End " were one 30 @-@ minute track that told a story of the fictional character " Albert " . The band decided against sequencing the tracks this way on the album , partly to avoid comparisons to their 23 @-@ minute track " Supper 's Ready " from Foxtrot , but also to have certain segments of the suite , such as " Duchess " and " Turn It On Again " released as singles . A " Duke Suite " was performed live on the album 's supporting tour with Collins introducing it as " The Story of Albert . " " Turn It On Again " was originally a short connecting piece in the middle of this medley , but the band enjoyed playing it so much , they decided to double its length and make it more of a standout track . The group considered placing the band written songs on side one and the individually written tracks on the other , but this was rejected . Rutherford described the final running order as " a very balanced album " . 
 The group went to Polar Studios to record the album , starting on 12 November 1979 , and recording up to the end of the year . As with several earlier albums , production duties were shared by the band and regular co @-@ producer David Hentschel . Collins used the Roland CR @-@ 78 drum machine for " Duchess " ; the first time he used one on a Genesis song . 
 The cover art was drawn by French illustrator Lionel Koechlin , featuring the character Albert . Koechlin 's artwork came from the book L <unk> d 'Albert , published in 1979 .

 Duke was released in the UK on 28 March 1980 and in the U.S. on 31 March . It was the band 's greatest commercial success at the time of its release ; it spent two weeks at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart and peaked at No. 11 on the U.S. Billboard 200 . The album spawned three singles ; " Turn It On Again " reached No. 8 in the UK and No. 58 in the U.S. ; " Duchess " reached No. 46 in the UK ; " Misunderstanding " reached No. 42 in the UK and No. 14 in the U.S. Duke was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry on 3 July 1980 and by the Recording Industry Association of America on 11 March 1988 .

 Duke received a mostly positive reception from music critics . In his review for Rolling Stone , David Fricke noted that " Turn It On Again " is " vibrant rock & roll " and thought that " Man of Our Times " , " Duchess " , " Duke 's Travels " , and " Duke 's End " " possess a refreshing urgency " . Fricke points out the band 's losses without Gabriel and Hackett in the line @-@ up , yet summarised Duke as " comforting : a reassurance that Genesis aren 't for an exodus yet . " Sounds ' Hugh Fielder gave the album four stars out of five , enjoying the opening of " Behind the Lines " and considering Collins 's vocals to be " more convincing than ... before " . He felt the first side was better than the second , and criticised some lyrics , but concluded " no Genesis fan could be disappointed " . The Los Angeles Times 's Steve Pond described the album 's music as " identifiably Genesis , but it is toned @-@ down " and a " a more confident and successful album than ... And Then There Were Three ... " . He criticised the album as inconsistent with a lack of " melodic invention " on side one , but thought " Duke 's Travels " and " Duke 's End " were " one of the best and most consistent pieces of music that band has made in some time " . 
 In a retrospective review , AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt Duke was the Genesis album that " leaped into the fray " of pop music but retained " a heavy dose " of progressive rock with the " Duke " suite . Erlewine thought the album comes off " a little bombastic " at times , " Misunderstanding " and " Turn It On Again " were the two tracks that " showcase the new version of Genesis at its absolute best " .

 A digitally remastered version of Duke was released on CD in 1994 on Virgin in Europe and Atlantic in the U.S. and Canada . The CD included the album 's original booklet , artwork and lyrics .

 PRR 4800 , nicknamed " Old Rivets " , is a GG1 @-@ class electric locomotive located at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania , outside of Strasburg , Pennsylvania in the United States . It is the prototype GG1 and was originally numbered 4899 . Built by General Electric in 1934 , the locomotive competed against a prototype , the R1 , built by rival company Westinghouse . 4800 was kept in service by the Pennsylvania Railroad and its successors , Penn Central and Conrail , until 1979 . It was sold the next year to a local chapter of the National Railway Historical Society . 4800 was dedicated in 1982 at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1983 . 
 = = Construction and testing = = 
 In 1933 , the Pennsylvania Railroad decided to replace the P5 , and instructed General Electric and Westinghouse to design an electric locomotive that was more powerful than the P5 , capable of speeds of 100 miles per hour ( 161 km / h ) , have a lighter axle load and to be double @-@ ended with a cab in the center of the carbody . Westinghouse designed the R1 # 4800 , and General Electric submitted the GG1 , then numbered 4899 . 
 The frames , running gear and riveted body for the prototype GG1 were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works . The partially built locomotive was then shipped to the General Electric factory in Erie , Pennsylvania for the installation of its electrical components . Twelve traction motors , two on each of the GG1 's six powered axles , produced 4 @,@ 620 horsepower ( 3 @,@ 450 kW ) that was transmitted to the 57 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 400 mm ) driving wheels by a quill drive . Unlike other GG1s , access steps were installed at each end of the locomotive to ease maintenance of the pantographs ; the pantographs were mechanically linked to a safety plate that blocked access to the steps when the pantographs were raised . The finished locomotive was 79 feet 6 inches ( 24 @.@ 23 m ) long and 16 feet ( 5 m ) tall , with both of its pantographs lowered . 
 GG1 4899 was extensively tested against the R1 from August to November 1934 ; both locomotives were substituted on regular passenger service between New York City and Philadelphia . Both locomotives were found to be capable of rapid acceleration with short @-@ term power outputs of up to 10 @,@ 000 horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) . The GG1 , however , did not exert as much lateral force on the rails as the R1 , because it was articulated , which allowed for a smaller turning radius than the rigid R1 . The Pennsylvania chose the GG1 over the R1 and immediately ordered another 57 locomotives . As the number scheme used by the Pennsylvania prevented the first locomotive in the class from being 4899 , the R1 and GG1 prototypes , essentially , swapped numbers . The Pennsylvania also enlisted the assistance of Raymond Loewy to refine the aesthetics of the GG1s . Loewy recommended that all subsequent models of the class should have a welded body rather than the riveted body on the prototype . This led to the nickname " Old Rivets " being given to 4800 .

 On January 28 , 1935 , 4800 inaugurated electric passenger service between Washington , D.C. and Philadelphia by pulling a charter train for railroad and government officials ; 4800 set a speed record of 102 miles per hour ( 164 km / h ) outside of Landover , Maryland on the return trip . Regular passenger service began on February 10 , 1935 . 4800 remained in regular passenger service with the Pennsylvania , until it joined production GG1s <unk> – <unk> in the pool of 90 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 140 km / h ) geared freight locomotives . It had its steam generator removed in June 1960 , about a year after hauling a National Railway Historical Society @-@ charted excursion to commemorate its 25th birthday . 
 4800 continued to haul freight for the Pennsylvania and its successors Penn Central and Conrail . In 1976 , Conrail gave 4800 a red , white and blue paint scheme to commemorate the United States Bicentennial . It was also the only GG1 to wear Conrail blue paint ; all the other Conrail GG1s remained in black . 4800 was eventually retired by Conrail in October 1979 after the locomotive 's main transformer failed , which was deemed too expensive to repair . 
 4800 was sold by Conrail in 1980 to the Lancaster @-@ chapter of the National Railway Historical Society for the scrap @-@ value price of $ 30 @,@ 000 . The locomotive was given a cosmetic restoration back to its 1935 appearance by the nearby Strasburg Rail Road and volunteers . 4800 was dedicated and put on display at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania on November 20 , 1982 . It was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ( ASME ) on April 23 , 1983 . 
 In 2012 , PRR 4800 was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame for its contribution to the railway industry . 
 = Belgrave Ninnis = 
 Inspector @-@ General Belgrave Ninnis CVO ( 1 September 1837 – 18 June 1922 ) was a Royal Navy surgeon , surveyor , Arctic explorer , and leading Freemason , from London . He graduated as a Doctor of Medicine from the University of St Andrews in 1861 , and the same year entered the navy as an Assistant Surgeon . From 1864 to 1866 , Ninnis served as part of a surveying expedition to the Northern Territory of South Australia , helping to chart the area to the west of the Adelaide River and returning biological specimens to Adelaide for study . In 1867 Ninnis was appointed to Greenwich Hospital ( later the Royal Naval College , Greenwich ) , and in 1875 he joined the British Arctic Expedition under Captain Sir George Nares , serving as Staff @-@ Surgeon on HMS Discovery . When disease spread among the expedition 's dogs , Ninnis was charged with investigating the cause ; his findings later formed the basis of a published work . At the conclusion of the expedition in 1876 he received the Arctic Medal for his service , and was promoted to Fleet @-@ Surgeon . 
 In his later career Ninnis served both on ships and in hospitals . He received Sir Gilbert Blane 's Gold Medal in 1879 , was promoted to Deputy Inspector @-@ General in 1883 , was appointed Principal Medical Officer at Melville Naval Hospital in 1892 , and was selected as a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of Saint John in 1895 . Upon his retirement in 1897 he was promoted to Inspector @-@ General , and in 1900 and 1902 served as President of the Section of the Navy , Army , and Ambulance of the British Medical Association . He was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order ( CVO ) in 1912 . Ninnis was initiated into the Freemasons 1872 , was a founder of several Lodges , and in 1901 became a Past Grand Deacon of England . He was the father of Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis , an explorer who was lost down a crevasse during the 1911 – 14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition .

 Ninnis graduated from the University of St Andrews as a Doctor of Medicine on 2 January 1861 , and became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons — <unk> ; a professional qualification — in April of the same year . On 1 August , he entered the Royal Navy Medical Service , as an Assistant Surgeon , and was appointed to HMS Pantaloon . In October 1862 Ninnis was transferred to the navy 's flagship HMS Victory , then moored in Portsmouth . He was posted aboard HMS <unk> , assigned to the Australian Station , in 1863 . 
 In 1864 , he was selected to serve as naturalist on a survey expedition to the Northern Territory of South Australia , aboard HMS Beatrice . The expedition , under Boyle Travers Finniss , was charged with surveying the coast in the area of the Adelaide River , with the aim of selecting a site for a future territory capital . Together with W. P. Auld , Ninnis was the first to survey the area to the west of the river , around what is now Darwin . In his role as naturalist , Ninnis collected specimens of reptiles and birds , which he presented to the South Australian Institute ( later the South Australian Museum ) , and timber , which was donated to the Adelaide Botanic Garden . Ninnis later reported to the Adelaide Philosophical Society on geological findings ; " the coast at the Northern Territory , " he said , " was generally composed of red and grey sandstone , with small quantities of quartz . " 
 Writing in the South Australian Register , George William Francis , director of the Botanic Garden , said that the 32 species of timber Ninnis had collected settled " that important question , is there timber around [ the proposed capital ] or not ? " Noting that the member of the expedition originally intended to return biological specimens to Adelaide had failed to do so , Francis wrote that " we are very much indebted to this gentleman [ Ninnis ] who has thus supplied us at a time when we have failed in obtaining information through the appointed channel . " Upon the conclusion of the expedition in 1866 , Ninnis received the thanks of the Parliament of South Australia for his work . His research on the expedition later formed the basis of a published work , Remarks on the Natural History , Meteorology , and Native Population of Northern Australia . 
 = = = British Arctic Expedition = = = 
 Upon his return to Britain , Ninnis qualified in January 1867 for the title of Surgeon in the Royal Navy by passing examinations at the Royal College of Surgeons ; the following month he was appointed to the Royal Hospital in Greenwich , where he remained until 1869 . On 21 December 1874 he was promoted to Staff @-@ Surgeon Second Class . In May 1875 he was appointed to HMS Discovery , one of two ships — the other HMS Alert — which comprised the British Arctic Expedition , led by Captain Sir George Nares . The expedition aimed to be the first to reach the North Pole , pushing north through Smith Sound , between Ellesmere Island and Greenland . The two ships made slow progress up the sound , repeatedly halted by dense pack ice . During August of the first year , the expedition 's Greenland Dogs began to show signs of disease ; the dogs experienced fits and " madness " , owing , it was assumed , " to close confinement , wet decks , and want of natural exercise . " Ninnis and Fleet @-@ Surgeon Thomas Colon of the Alert were charged with investigating the disease . Ninnis ' report to Nares noted the disease 's similarity to rabies , " but there is no instance recorded in Greenland of human beings who have been bitten having suffered from hydrophobia [ a symptom of advanced rabies ] , and the recovery of the animals in some instances is entirely opposed to the recorded experience of true rabies . " 
 On 26 August the two ships parted ; Alert continued to push north while Discovery waited in reserve . Ninnis ' biological work then extended to horticulture . He collected wheat seeds left in the area by the Polaris expedition four years previously , and planted them — together with mustard , cress and pea seeds — between the decks of the Discovery . In May of the second year they were transplanted to the shore , under glass . According to Robert Johnston , in his 1877 summary of the expedition , " This experiment succeeded very well ; but , evidently , such an attempt at fancy gardening , under difficulties , could not be relied on to supply the wants of an entire ship 's crew . " 
 The expedition returned to England in October 1876 , having failed to reach the pole . The gains it had made had not been without cost ; three men had died from scurvy alone . One of these deaths had occurred on a sledging party from Alert , the remaining two on Discovery , from which there had been no major sledging . A Committee of Inquiry investigating the expedition determined a lack of fresh lime juice had triggered the outbreak . Even so , fresh meat , of which there was a plentiful supply near Discovery , could have staved off the disease . Publicly , Nares defended his surgeons , Ninnis included : 
 Much as the attack of scurvy which visited us is to be regretted , it proved how valuable were the services of Fleet @-@ Surgeon Thomas Colan , M.D. , and Staff @-@ Surgeon Belgrave Ninnis , M.D. , who were so ably assisted by Surgeons Edward Lawton Moss , M.D. , and Richard William Coppinger , M.D. These officers are each of great talent and high character ... Any reward that it is in the power of their lordships to bestow on these gentlemen could not be given to more careful or zealous officers . 
 For his work on the expedition , Ninnis was awarded the Arctic Medal , and promoted to Fleet @-@ Surgeon . He later published a report , Diseases Incidental to the Eskimo Dogs of Smith 's Sound : Diagnosis and Treatment , on his findings during the expedition . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Ninnis spent the remainder of his career working on ships and in hospitals . His surgical notes from at least part of this time survive ; in November 1880 , for example , while serving aboard HMS Garnet , he recorded a failed attempt to revive a drowning victim , James Farley : " Brandy injected into the rectum and strychnine at the epigastrium [ the area immediately below the heart ] , brandy and ammonia to wet his mouth . " In 1879 he was awarded Sir Gilbert Blane 's Gold Medal , an honour reserved for Royal Navy medical officers . In 1883 he received his final active promotion , to Deputy Inspector @-@ General . He was appointed Principal Medical Officer at Melville Naval Hospital , Chatham in 1892 , and three years later was selected as a Knight of Grace to the Venerable Order of Saint John . He retired on 1 September 1897 , with an honorary promotion to Inspector @-@ General . 
 He continued to be active after his retirement from the Navy , twice serving — in 1900 and 1902 — as President of the Section of the Navy , Army , and Ambulance of the British Medical Association . In July 1900 , serving in this capacity , he delivered an introductory address at the annual meeting of the association . In the address , while arguing that light and fresh air were important for the treatment of wounded sailors , noted that they could " only be obtained in sufficient quantity above the water @-@ line , and to place the sick quarters above the water @-@ line , amidst the <unk> @-@ burly of a sea fight , traversed by projectiles and wrecked by exploding shells , is of course out of the question , even supposing that sufficient space could be spared . " Instead , he argued for dedicated hospital ships , which " during an action ... would keep out of range but sufficiently close to collect the wounded when the fight was over , and sailing under the regulations of the Geneva Convention would be free from molestation or capture . " A related article by Ninnis , " The Treatment of Wounded at Sea " , was published in the Philadelphia Medical Journal in August 1900 , and he expanded on the idea of hospital ships in a 1905 paper to the British Medical Association . 
 Ninnis presented another paper at the 1908 annual meeting of the association , entitled " The Position of St. John Ambulance Brigade as Regards Mobilization " , in his capacity as Chief Commissioner St. John Ambulance Brigade . On 14 June 1912 , at St James 's Palace , he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order ( CVO ) by King George V. 
 Ninnis died in Streatham on 18 June 1922 , aged 84 . He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Society of Antiquaries , and a member of the Army and Navy Club , the Royal Navy Medical Club , and the Folklore Society . In addition to the works previously mentioned , he was the author of a published work entitled Statistical and <unk> Report , with Remarks on the Sanitary Condition of the Welsh Colony of Chubut , South America .

 Ninnis was initiated into the Freemasons in 1872 . In 1901 he became a Past Grand Deacon of England , having previously been a Grand Standard Bearer of England . He was a Founder of the Quadratic Lodge , Hampton Court ; the <unk> Lodge , London ; the Navy Lodge , London ; and the Belgrave Chapter , London . He was a Past Master ( a former Worshipful Master , the senior officer of a Masonic Lodge ) of the Quadratic Lodge ; the <unk> Lodge ; the Prince of Wales Lodge ; the Phoenix Lodge , Jamaica ; and the Pentangle Lodge , Kent .

 Belgrave Ninnis was the fourth son of Paul Ninnis , originally of Cornwall . He was married to Ada Jane Sutton , with whom he had three sons and one daughter . One son , Walter Melville Ninnis , died , aged 17 months , of pneumonia , on 12 September 1886 . 
 Ninnis was the father of Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis , a Lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers and Antarctic explorer . B. E. S. Ninnis accompanied the 1911 – 14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition , under Douglas Mawson , as a dog handler . Along with Mawson and Xavier Mertz , he formed the Far Eastern Party , using sledge dogs to explore the area around the expedition 's base in Adélie Land . On 14 December 1912 , B. E. S. Ninnis died when the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a crevasse . When news of his death reached Australia in March 1913 , several Australian newspapers — including The Advertiser , the Western Argus and The Sydney Morning Herald — ran biographies of Belgrave Ninnis , noting his surveying work in the Northern Territory and Arctic exploration . When Mawson returned to Australia a year later , a telegram was sent on behalf of the Australian people to Ninnis senior , condoling him on his " great loss , but congratulating you on your son 's imperishable fame . " Ninnis replied the following day , " Grateful thanks to yourself and people of Australia for sympathetic message . " 
 = Millennium ( season 3 ) = 
 The third season of the serial crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium commenced airing in the United States on October 2 , 1998 , and concluded on May 21 , 1999 after airing twenty @-@ two episodes . It tells the story of retired FBI Agent Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) . Black had previously worked for a private investigative organization , the Millennium Group , but left after the Group unleashed a virus that resulted in the death of Black 's wife . Now working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation with agent Emma Hollis ( Klea Scott ) , Black seeks to discredit and expose the Group for their sinister motives . 
 The season saw the introduction of a new lead character in Hollis . Scott faced difficulty in securing the role , as Fox executives had desired a white actress for the part instead ; Scott 's agent fought for her to be given an audition , which proved successful . The season also brought in two new executive producers — Michael Duggan and Chip Johannessen , who had previously written episodes in earlier seasons . 
 Episodes from the third season have seen generally positive reviews from critics , as has the season as a whole . Stars Henriksen and Brittany Tiplady were nominated for several acting awards for their work on the season — a Golden Globe Award nod for Henriksen and two Young Artist Award nominations for Tiplady . In addition , series cinematographer Robert McLachlan was nominated for two American Society of Cinematographers awards during the season . Ultimately none of these nominations proved successful . 
 = = Production = = 
 When ending the second season , the producers and crew thought it would be the last ; Fox executives admitted that the decision to renew the series was " down to the wire " . However , to their surprise Millennium was renewed for a third season . Many of the cliffhanger plot threads from the season finale were written off as the hallucinations of Frank Black . When creating the third season , the writers wanted to go back to the standalone storytelling format used in the first season ; to do so they had Frank join the FBI and receive a new " skeptical " partner with whom he could work . 
 This led to the introduction of Klea Scott as Emma Hollis . Originally , the producers were looking for a white actress to play the part . Scott 's agent campaigned for her and guaranteed the series ' producers that if she was not considered for the role , he would never send another actor to the casting director of the show . Scott won the role , but producer Chip Johannessen recalled that " she wasn 't what the network were looking , they wanted Heather Locklear or something to come . That was kind of how that went down " . Fox backed down , and Scott got the role . 
 The season saw the introduction of Johannessen and Michael Duggan as executive producers ; both had previously worked as writers on earlier seasons of the series . The pair worked with series creator Chris Carter , who acknowledged that they had taken heed of past criticism of the series when writing new episodes , wanting to avoid the previous " serial @-@ killer @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " moniker the show had earned . To this end , the season ended with a seven @-@ episode story arc intended to reduce the series ' conflicts down to struggle between two men , rather than larger factions or groups — Black representing the viewer 's point of view and Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) representing the ideals of the Millennium Group , with both convinced their beliefs are the correct ones and wanting to bring the other to their side . Ultimately , the season did not attract enough viewers , and the series was cancelled by the network .

 Writing for Slant magazine , Keith Uhlich gave the season an overall rating of four stars out of five .

Uhlich felt that the episodes in the season were " challenging " and celebrated the abilities of the individual to forge a life for themselves . DVD Talk 's Randy Miller also awarded the season an overall four out of five stars , finding that although its concern about the then @-@ coming millennium made it very much a product of its time , it did not seem to have suffered from this and held up well in retrospect . Miller considered Henriksen 's portrayal of Frank Black to have been " masterful " ; however , he felt that the retcon of its second season finale alienated viewers and led to its dwindling popularity . 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated several episodes across the season highly , awarding five stars out of five to " Borrowed Time " , " Collateral Damage " , " Darwin 's Eye " and the series finale " Goodbye to All That " . However , several episodes also fared poorly in their opinion , including " Closure " , " ... Thirteen Years Later " and " Forcing the End " , all of which the pair rated only one star out of five . Writing for The A.V.

 = Cyclone Favio = 
 Cyclone Favio was the first known tropical cyclone that passed south of Madagascar to strike Africa as an intense tropical cyclone . Early on February 11 , 2007 , a zone of disturbed weather formed east of Madagascar . Four days later , Favio was named as intensified to a moderate tropical storm while moving southwest . On February 18 , the storm was upgraded into a severe tropical storm . Then , it turned west in the general direction of Mozambique . Continuing to intensify , Favio was upgraded to a tropical cyclone early on February 19 . Subsequently , the storm began to undergo rapid deepening ; the small storm reached intense tropical cyclone status the next day before peaking in intensity . However , the cyclone had weakened somewhat prior to making landfall on February 22 in the Inhambane Province in Mozambique . It rapidly weakened over land and dissipated the next day . 
 While strengthening , Favio brought heavy rains to southern Madagascar . After making landfall , Intense Tropical Cyclone Favio brought widespread damage to Vilanculos in Mozambique , where the cyclone killed four people and injured at least 70 in the town . About 80 % of the town was destroyed . Overall , a total of ten people were killed by the storm and nearly 100 others were injured , and combined with an earlier flood , the storm caused $ 71 million ( 2007 US $ ] ] ) in damage . Around 130 @,@ 000 homes suffered damage and 130 schools were leveled by the tropical cyclone . Across the nation , a total of 33 @,@ 000 people were left homeless during the system . Cyclone Favio destroyed 277 @,@ 000 ha ( 684 @,@ 480 acres ) of crops . In Zimbabwe , 400 electricity poles were downed . During the aftermath of the storm , a number of agencies provided assistance to victims of Cyclone Favio in Mozambique . One agency donated $ 626 @,@ 500 , helping transport 50 @,@ 000 mosquito nets to the devastated area . A total of 5 @,@ 500 bars of soap , 1 @,@ 600 buckets , 50 baths , and over 180 latrines were distributed to the victims of the devastated area . In all , the government was praised for how well they handled the disaster . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Cyclone Favio originated from a zone of disturbed weather that was first classified by the Météo @-@ France office on Réunion ( MFR ) at 1200 UTC February 11 , 2007 . Twelve hours later , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued their first advisory on the system . Midday on February 12 , MFR upgraded the system into a tropical disturbance and noted that its rating at that time on the Dvorak technique was 2 @.@ 0 . 
 According to the JTWC , an area of convection developed 340 mi ( 545 km ) south @-@ southwest of Diego Garcia . Initially , however , the convection was not very concentrated near the center . However , sea surface temperatures in the area were somewhat warm so gradual intensification was predicted and the storm was projected to become a severe tropical storm within 48 hours . Situated in an environment of low wind shear and good outflow , thunderstorm activity soon increased and thus started to consolidate around the storm 's atmospheric circulation . Continuing to encounter more favorable conditions , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) on February 14 . Meanwhile , MFR upgraded the system into a tropical depression . Eighteen hours later , the system was named Favio by the Meteorological Services of Mauritius as the system ; according to MFR , had intensified into a moderate tropical storm . 
 Moving very steadily southwest , the storm gradually intensified . Early on February 15 , the JTWC announced that that system had intensified into a tropical storm . After intensifying slightly ( based on JTWC data ) that evening , the storm briefly weakened overnight , only to re @-@ intensify the next morning . On February 16 , Favio turned southwest in response to a large subtropical ridge . Despite low wind shear , Favio remained a moderate tropical storm for several days ; however , on February 18 , MFR announced that Favio had intensified into a severe tropical storm . Subsequently , the storm turned west as the ridge merged with another one centered over South Africa . Two days later , the agency then upgraded the system into cyclone status . At 0000 UTC that day , on February 19 , the JTWC upgraded the system into a Category 1 hurricane @-@ equivalent on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) though not much additional intensification was predicted . 
 Upon becoming a hurricane , thunderstorm activity began to develop around an eye . Favio turned west @-@ northwest , traversing the Mozambique Channel while beginning to deepen . At 0000 UTC February 20 , the JTWC declared that Favio had intensified into a Category 2 hurricane @-@ equivalent on the SSHWS . Several hours later , Favio was then upgraded into an intense tropical cyclone by MFR as the system developed a very small eye . Simultaneously , Cyclone Favio was upgraded into a Category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS via the JTWC . During the afternoon hours of February 20 , the JTWC reported that Favio had developed winds equivalent to Category 4 intensity . That evening , MFR noted that Cyclone Favio had peaked in intensity , with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) , becoming the most intense tropical cyclone south of the 25th parallel over the Mozambique Channel since the satellite era began . Six hours later , the JTWC announced that Favio had peaked in intensity , with 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) winds . This made Favio equal to a mid @-@ level Category 4 hurricane . At the time of its peak , Favio had developed a well @-@ defined eye . 
 Shortly after its peak , Cyclone Favio began to weaken ; the core of the storm started to become disrupted on the northwestern quadrant . The JTWC expected Favio to continue to weaken , and dissipate within 48 hours over land . The eye disappeared off of satellite imagery , though by early February 22 , this feature had re @-@ developed . That afternoon , the storm was estimated to have made landfall in southern Mozambique . At that time , the JTWC reported winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) , a Category 1 system on the SSHWS . On the other hand , MFR estimated winds of 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) ( an intense tropical cyclone ) . Upon making landfall , it did so on the seventh anniversary of the last intense tropical cyclone , Eline , to strike Mozambique . Favio was also the first tropical cyclone to hit the country since Cyclone Japhet did during the 2002 – 03 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season . By early February 23 , winds had dropped below hurricane @-@ force according to the JTWC , while the storm dissipated later that day . Around that time , MFR stopped monitoring the system as well .

 Prior to the arrival of Favio , flooding swept over Mozambique weeks earlier , forcing 163 @,@ 000 persons to seek shelter . The floods started in late December 2006 when the <unk> Bassa Dam overflowed its banks . The floods escalated in February 2007 when the Zambezi River broke its banks , flooding the surrounding areas in Mozambique . A total of 80 @,@ 600 people were evacuated from their homes in the Tete , Manica , Sofala and Zambezia provinces on February 14 . Twenty @-@ nine people were confirmed dead due to the pre @-@ Favio flood . 
 While at peak intensity , the storm threatened Mozambique and forcing authorities to put the country on high alert . The British Foreign Office also issued a travel warning to Britons who were planning visits along the Bazaruto Archipelago . Additionally , the South African disaster management team was on full alert in the eastern portion of Mpumalanga . In addition , thousands of volunteers were placed on stand by . 
 Some residents of Vilankulo attempted to flee the area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to seek shelter on higher ground further inland before the storm hit . They evacuated many of the people who remained , taking them to tent camps . Officials said that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia , Malawi and Zimbabwe . Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning . Because of the topography of the region , meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in <unk> .

 Favio damaged the court in the resort town of Vilanculos in Southern Mozambique . Uprooted trees caused by the cyclone also blocked roads , cutting off access for rescuers to some homes . Power was also cut off to the city . The cyclone killed four people and injured at least 70 in the town , and thousands of homes were destroyed along with the hospital , where a total of 120 patients were evacuated .

 In Zimbabwe , the <unk> Mountains received heavy winds and rain . Throughout the country , damage was minimal and was mostly due to the uprooting of trees and not nearly as bad as Cyclone Leon – Eline , which devastated the nation seven years prior . However , electricity supplies were severely damaged . In one location , 400 wooden electricity poles were knocked down . Alongside moist air from the Intertropical Convergence Zone , Favio produced significant rains across much of Malawi , peaking at 121 @.@ 7 mm ( 5 in ) in Mimosa .

 During the aftermath of the storm , South Africa offered helicopters to Mozambique to deliver food to shelters and to help Mozambican officials assess the situation aerially . The disaster management minister of South Africa flew in to Mozambique to survey the damage . Due to the concern for potential disease epidemics including those of malaria and cholera , health officials raised public awareness through theaters and radio . A joint coalition of the United States Agency for International Development and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $ 626 @,@ 500 , enabling transportation of 50 @,@ 000 mosquito nets to the devastated area . Oxfam International distributed 18 @,@ 000 L ( 4 @,@ 800 US gal ) of clean water per day for 15 @,@ 000 displaced people in the <unk> and <unk> districts and housed 8 @,@ 000 residents in <unk> , where they also distributed 5 @,@ 500 bars of soap , more than 3 @,@ 000 mosquito nets , and 1 @,@ 600 buckets .

The agency also agreed to provide drinking water to the victims of Favio for four months . 
 The nation 's president flew in to the destructed area , lifting survivors ' spirits . Within 48 hours following Intense Tropical Cyclone Favio , roofs were being repaired , and power lines were gradually being restored . Hundreds of local red cross staff and volunteers were utilized ; they worked around the clock to assist survivors . Thirty @-@ one recovery centers opened , hosting 400 first aid volunteers . According to a South African website , the government was praised for how well and quickly they handled the crisis . Key food items ( rice , beans , corn meal , cooking oil , soap , and sugar ) were distributed to the affected areas . On March 5 , a plan was launched to provide victims for a total of $ 71 million worth of aid , of which $ 773 @,@ 000 was expected to be directed towards the health . Meanwhile , water levels began to recede throughout the affected region . Moreover , a total of 28 @,@ 000 lb ( 12 @,@ 700 kg ) of aid were distributed through the central part of the nation , and provided clean water for 6 @,@ 000 people . About 200 tents were provided for victims whose roofs of their homes were blown off . Furthermore , concerns rose about the potential outbreak of diseases like HIV . Within three months after the cyclone , 85 % of homes had used the aid they were given .

 Laird began his football career as a trainee at Plymouth Argyle 's centre of excellence . He made the hour journey to Plymouth from his Bridgwater home to train with the club every Tuesday and Thursday . Laird attracted interest from Scottish side Rangers in 2003 , with the SPL club enquiring about the player after his performances for Scotland in the Victory Shield . No move materialised , and he continued to progress through the youth system at Home Park , and was offered a professional contract at the age of 17 by manager Tony Pulis in February 2006 . During his time as an apprentice , Laird lived in a hotel " just for apprentices " with Luke Summerfield , Reuben Reid , and Chris <unk> , and described the experience as a " great way to grow into football " . 
 The following season , Laird joined Tiverton Town of the Southern Football League on an initial one @-@ month loan in September 2006 . He made his debut for the club in Tiverton 's 2 – 1 victory against Wealdstone , and played in the following game against Cheshunt . The loan was extended for a further five months , and Laird scored his first goal for the club in a 4 – 1 defeat at Hemel Hempstead Town on 5 April 2007 . Two days later , he scored twice in Tiverton 's 3 – 1 home win against Cirencester Town , netting both of his goals in the space of four minutes to give Tiverton a two @-@ goal lead . A week later , he scored again , netting the opening goal of the game as Tiverton lost 4 – 1 to King 's Lynn . Laird played a total of 21 games for the club , 17 in the league , scoring four times from a central midfield role . Laird returned to Plymouth ahead of the 2007 – 08 season , and was subsequently handed his Plymouth debut in a 2 – 1 victory over Wycombe Wanderers in the League Cup , playing the whole match and assisting Plymouth 's second goal . However , he did not appear in the first – team for Plymouth again and was loaned out to nearby Conference National side Torquay United a month later . Laird made his Torquay debut in a 5 – 2 victory against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough , and also featured in a 3 – 2 victory over Weymouth . Although his loan at Torquay was extended in November , he did not make any more first – team appearances for the club , and so played just twice for Torquay United during his two @-@ month loan spell . 
 = = = Stevenage = = = 
 A month after returning to his parent club , Laird was loaned out to another Conference National team in the form of Stevenage on 31 December 2007 . He made his Stevenage debut a day later in a 2 – 1 win over Rushden & Diamonds . Laird impressed under manager Peter Taylor and signed on a permanent basis at the start of February , for an undisclosed fee . He featured regularly at left – back during the second half of the 2007 – 08 season , and scored his first goal for Stevenage in a 4 – 1 victory away at Histon – a 35 @-@ yard strike into the top right hand corner of the net . The following season , under the new management of Graham Westley , Laird featured regularly again , playing 51 games in total for the Hertfordshire side , scoring three times in total . Laird scored his first goal of the 2008 – 09 season in Stevenage 's first win of the season ; a 3 – 1 victory away to Barrow in August 2008 . His second goal of the campaign came in an FA Cup tie against Horsham , while his third goal of the season came in Stevenage 's last regular Conference National fixture of the season in a 2 – 1 defeat away to Mansfield Town . Laird was also a key part in the side 's successful FA Trophy campaign , featuring in six matches . However , he missed the final at Wembley Stadium as a result of being sent – off in the defeat to Cambridge United in the Conference National play @-@ off semi @-@ final . In his absence , Stevenage beat York City 2 – 0 in the FA Trophy final . 
 Laird continue to impress at full @-@ back for Stevenage in the first half of the 2009 – 10 season . He scored his first goal of the season in a 2 – 0 victory over Histon at Bridge Road in August 2009 ; the ground he coincidentally scored his first ever Stevenage goal in 2008 . In September 2009 , Laird scored a highly significant goal when his 85th @-@ minute strike ensured Stevenage beat local rivals Luton Town 1 – 0 at Kenilworth Road in the first ever league meeting between the two clubs . He scored a similar looking goal in a 4 – 0 win over Barrow , before also scoring the winning goal in a victory over Oxford United ; stroking home a second half penalty to score the only goal of the game . Laird 's fifth goal of the season followed shortly after , when he converted another penalty in a 2 – 0 win against Forest Green Rovers . He scored another goal from the penalty spot ten days later in a 1 – 0 win over Gateshead . Laird made 53 appearances during Stevenage 's promotion @-@ winning campaign , more than any other player for the club during the season , scoring a total of six goals . He was also voted as Stevenage 's Player of the Year at the end of the season , as voted for by Supporters Association members and season ticket holders at the club . Laird signed a new two – year contract with the Hertfordshire club in May 2010 . He was voted as the 2009 – 10 Young Player of the Year at the National Game Awards . At the Football Conference 's Annual Presentation Dinner , Laird was also named in the Team of the Year , alongside fellow Stevenage defenders Ronnie Henry and Mark Roberts . 
 Ahead of the 2010 – 11 season , Laird scored in Stevenage 's pre @-@ season friendly victory over Histon . He started in the club 's first ever Football League fixture , a 2 – 2 home draw with Macclesfield Town . In September 2010 , in games against Cheltenham Town and Torquay United respectively , Laird was used as a left midfielder , as opposed to playing in his usual left @-@ back position . He reverted to the left @-@ back spot in Stevenage 's 1 – 0 win over Lincoln City at Sincil Bank . He scored his first goal of the 2010 – 11 season from the penalty spot , in a 2 – 1 win over Burton Albion in October 2010 . A week later , he missed the chance to double his goal tally for the season , missing a second @-@ half penalty in a 0 – 0 draw against Morecambe . Coincidentally , Laird 's second goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Morecambe in January 2011 ; he scored from close range following John Mousinho 's cross to give Stevenage the lead . Just three days later , Laird scored his third goal of the season , netting with a curling effort from 25 yards out to give Stevenage their third goal of a 3 – 0 win against Rotherham United . Laird was initially credited with scoring an 87th @-@ minute winner in Stevenage 's 1 – 0 away win at Crewe Alexandra on 19 February 2011 , but the goal was eventually given to team @-@ mate Byron Harrison . At the age of 22 , Laird captained Stevenage for the first time in their 1 – 0 loss to Hereford United on 8 March 2011 . In the club 's following match , against Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park , Laird was sent @-@ off for two bookable offences , although Stevenage held on to win the match 1 – 0 . Laird 's fourth goal of the campaign came in Stevenage 's 3 – 3 draw against Bury on 7 May 2011 , as he opened the scoring with a strike from 25 yards out . He played a total of 54 games during the 2010 – 11 season , scoring four goals . This included three appearances in the 2010 – 11 League Two play @-@ offs following Stevenage 's sixth @-@ placed finish . Following a 3 – 0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley , Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1 – 0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011 , with Laird playing the whole game . 
 Laird played in Stevenage 's first ever League One fixture on 6 August 2011 , playing the whole match in a 0 – 0 home draw against Exeter City . He was a crucial player in the club 's first win of the season , assisting Chris Beardsley in the 91st minute as Stevenage beat Bournemouth 3 – 1 at Dean Court . Laird 's first goal of the campaign came four days later , on 20 August , scoring with a header from Robin Shroot 's corner to ensure Stevenage came from two goals down to draw against Hartlepool United . He also scored against Huddersfield Town on 8 October , scoring with a first time finish to briefly restore parity in an eventual 2 – 1 loss . Laird 's impressive start to the 2011 – 12 season resulted in a " number of Championship clubs " tracking the player . Laird scored the winning goal in a 2 – 1 victory against Sheffield United on 5 November , converting from the penalty spot with eight minutes remaining . A week later , on 12 November , he scored the only goal of the game as Stevenage defeated Hartlepool United 1 – 0 in the FA Cup . Laird 's fifth goal of the campaign came on 26 December , scoring Stevenage 's fourth goal in a 6 – 1 away victory at Colchester United , calmly scoring from close range following a well @-@ worked free @-@ kick . He was on the scoresheet once again in Stevenage 's 4 – 2 home win against Milton Keynes Dons in January 2012 , heading in Luke Freeman 's cross to ensure Stevenage overcame an early deficit to take the lead . The left @-@ back scored his seventh goal of the campaign in manager Gary Smith 's first league game in @-@ charge , a 1 – 0 away victory at Sheffield Wednesday . He scored further goals in draws against Chesterfield and Sheffield United respectively , taking his goal tally to nine for the season . Laird finished as the club 's second highest goalscorer for the campaign , as Stevenage missed out on a third successive promotion following a play @-@ off semi @-@ final defeat . At the end of the season , it was announced that Laird had rejected an improved contract offer and would be leaving the club on a free transfer when his contract expired . Laird made 230 appearances during his four years with the club , scoring 23 goals . 
 = = = Preston North End = = = 
 In May 2012 , Laird signed for League One side Preston North End on a free transfer . The move reunited him with manager Graham Westley , who had previously managed Laird at Stevenage . He made his Preston debut in the club 's first game of the 2012 – 13 season , playing the whole match in 2 – 0 home win over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup . Laird scored his first goals for the club in a 5 – 0 win against Hartlepool United at Deepdale in September 2012 , netting twice within the space of three second @-@ half minutes . His third goal of the season came in a 3 – 1 away victory at Doncaster Rovers on 2 October 2012 , heading in Joel Byrom 's cross to restore Preston 's lead in the match . He added to his goal tally a month later , " acrobatically volleying in Chris Robertson 's knockdown " in a 1 – 1 home draw with Brentford . In the club 's next match , a home game against Notts County on 20 November 2012 , Laird suffered a broken leg following a challenge from Jamal Campbell @-@ Ryce . It was later revealed that Laird had broken his left tibia and would miss the remainder of the season . During his recovery , Laird stated that Campbell @-@ Ryce rang him on a weekly basis — " I knew him previously and he 's rung me every week to make sure I 'm alright . I 'm not one to hold grudges anyway and he 's been fine . I accept his apology " . Laird scored four times in 24 games during his first season with the club . 
 On 17 December 2013 , Laird extended his contract with Preston for a further twelve months , thus keeping him at the club until the summer of 2015 .

 Virgil Paul Brennan , DFC , DFM ( 6 March 1920 – 13 June 1943 ) was an Australian aviator and flying ace of the Second World War . Enlisting in the Royal Australian Air Force in November 1940 , he briefly served in the European Theatre before transferring to Malta . Over the next five months , Brennan was officially credited with the destruction of 10 Axis aircraft from a total of twenty @-@ four operational sorties . <unk> to England , he was assigned as a flying instructor and collaborated in the writing of Spitfires over Malta , a book about his experiences on the island . Returning to Australia during 1943 , Brennan was killed in a flying accident at Garbutt , Queensland , in June that year . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Brennan was born in Warwick , Queensland , on 6 March 1920 to Edgar James Brennan , a solicitor , and his wife Katherine ( née O 'Sullivan ) . He was educated at the Christian Brothers ' School in Warwick , before moving on to <unk> College at Toowoomba and later Brisbane State High School . After leaving school , Brennan studied part @-@ time at the University of Queensland , while simultaneously being employed as a law clerk in Brisbane . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 On 8 November 1940 , Brennan enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force for service during the Second World War . Accepted for pilot training , he received his initial flight instruction in Australia . He later embarked for Canada , where he completed his flight training before being posted to the United Kingdom in August 1941 , where he was appointed to an Operational Training Unit . On graduating from this course , he was allotted to No. 64 Squadron RAF . During this time , he was advanced to temporary flight sergeant on 4 January 1942 , prior to receiving a posting to the Mediterranean Theatre the following month . 
 = = = Malta = = = 
 On arrival in the Mediterranean , Brennan was posted to No. 249 Squadron RAF . On 7 March 1942 , Brennan was one of fifteen pilots sent to the island of Malta . Flying Supermarine Spitfires , the party took off from the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle ; they were to spend the next few months in the defence of the island . As the Axis forces commenced a major aerial assault on Malta later that month , the Allied fighter pilots on the island were forced to " contend with fatigue and inadequate rations while battling the enemy 's superior forces " . On 17 March , Brennan claimed his first aerial victory when he shot down a Messerschmitt 109 . 
 On 20 April 1942 , Brennan added a further two aircraft to his tally when he destroyed a Messerschmitt 109 , before bringing down a Junkers 88 later that day . Praised as " a most determined and courageous pilot " , Brennan was subsequently recommended for the Distinguished Flying Medal . The announcement and accompanying citation for the award was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 22 May 1942 , reading : 
 Air Ministry , 22nd May , 1942 . 
 ROYAL AIR FORCE . 
 The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the following awards in recognition of gallantry displayed in flying operations against the enemy : — 
 Distinguished Flying Medal . 
 Aus . <unk> Sergeant Virgil Paul <unk> , Royal Australian Air Force , No. 249 Squadron . 
 This airman is a most determined and courageous pilot . An exceptional shot , he always presses home his attacks with vigour . In 2 combats , he has destroyed at least 4 enemy aircraft and damaged others . 
 Brennan scored further aerial victories on 10 May . The following day , German Luftwaffe General Albert Kesselring ordered a contingent of 20 Stukas and 10 Junkers Ju 88s with a small escort of fighter aircraft to bomb Grand Harbour , Malta . A formation of 50 Royal Air Force aircraft — 37 Spitfires and 13 Hawker Hurricanes — were dispatched to intercept the group ; Brennan was piloting one of the Spitfires . Attacking one of the Stukas , Brennan later recorded that the aircraft " disintegrated , with huge chunks flying off in every direction " . During the battle , a total of 14 German aircraft were shot down , for the loss of 2 Spitfires . In an engagement the next day , Brennan was wounded in his left arm . He was commissioned as a pilot officer later that month . 
 By the conclusion of his combat tour in July 1942 , Brennan had flown a total of twenty @-@ two operational sorties and was credited with destroying 10 Axis aircraft over Malta , with one probably destroyed and a further 6 damaged . For his efforts in the destruction of Axis aircraft during this period , Brennan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . The notification of the decoration was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 6 October 1942 . 
 = = = Later war service and death = = = 
 Embarking from Malta during July 1942 , Brennan returned to the United Kingdom and was posted to No. 52 Operational Training Unit as an instructor with the rank of acting flight lieutenant . During this period , Brennan and fellow No. 249 Squadron pilot , Pilot Officer Ray <unk> , collaborated with journalist Henry Bateson on writing Spitfires over Malta , a novel relating the experiences of Brennan and <unk> during their time on Malta . On 17 April 1943 , Brennan was repatriated from the United Kingdom and returned to Australia . 
 Arriving back in Australia , Brennan was posted to the newly raised No. 79 Squadron , based at Laverton , Victoria , on 1 May 1943 . Later that month , the squadron was ordered to deploy to Goodenough Island , near New Guinea . During this time , Brennan related his previous combat experiences to fellow pilots , however his commanding officer , Squadron Leader Alan Rawlinson , noted that Brennan appeared " strained and tired " . An advance party of the squadron was moved up to Goodenough Island that month , while the pilots followed during June . 
 On 13 June 1943 , the pilots of No. 79 Squadron continued on their journey north , arriving at Garbutt airfield in Queensland . At approximately 14 : 00 , Brennan landed his Spitfire in the wake turbulence of the aircraft ahead of himself and touched down on the left side of the runway . Brennan was informed that he was cutting in on the path of the Spitfire following him , which was to land on the right side of the runway . Brennan landed his aircraft short , and at the conclusion of his landing run turned across the path of the second Spitfire . In the ensuing collision , Brennan sustained severe injuries and was rushed to hospital ; he died before arrival . Described as one with " an easy @-@ going nature , an engaging sense of humour and ... loyal to his friends " , Brennan was buried in Townsville War Cemetery .

 = Hygrophoropsis = 
 Hygrophoropsis is a genus of gilled fungi in the family Hygrophoropsidaceae . It was circumscribed in 1888 to contain the type species , H. aurantiaca , a widespread fungus that , based on its appearance , has been affiliated with Cantharellus , Clitocybe , and Paxillus . Modern molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that the genus belongs to the suborder <unk> of the order Boletales . 
 There are 16 accepted species of Hygrophoropsis , found in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes brown rot in the wood it colonises . The fruit bodies grow on the ground in woodlands , on moss , peat , and on woodchips . They are convex to <unk> ( funnel @-@ shaped ) and have decurrent , forked brightly colored gills . The spores are dextrinoid , meaning that they stain reddish @-@ brown in Melzer 's reagent . Because H. aurantiaca has orange gills , it has been mistaken for a chanterelle , and hence it has been called a false chanterelle . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Hygrophoropsis was originally circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a subgenus of Cantharellus . It contained a single species , the widespread H. aurantiaca , commonly known as the false chanterelle . German naturalist Bernhard Studer @-@ <unk> concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more appropriately placed in the genus Clitocybe , based on its white spores , decurrent gills , and lack of a ring on the stipe . This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer , who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a subgenus of Clitocybe . 
 French naturalist Emile Martin @-@ Sans elevated Hygrophoropsis to the status of genus in his 1929 publication L <unk> par les champignons et <unk> les intoxications dues aux <unk> du groupe des Clitocybe et du groupe des Cortinarius , while attributing authorship to his countryman René Maire . According to Martin @-@ Sans , he concurred with Maire 's assessment of Hygrophoropsis , suggesting that it represented a form intermediate between Cantharellus and Clitocybe , and was thus worthy of generic rank . The name Hygrophoropsis refers to a likeness ( Greek : <unk> , opsis ) to the genus Hygrophorus . 
 Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca has been confused with the true chanterelles ( genus Cantharellus ) because of overall similarities in appearance . A combination of characters — including forked gills , frequently off @-@ centre stipe placement , and dextrinoid spores — suggested to others a relationship with Paxillus . These characteristics prompted Singer to classify the genus Hygrophoropsis in the Paxillaceae in 1946 , although others placed it in the Tricholomataceae , a family that has been described as a wastebasket taxon . Singer initially included only two species , both with dextrinoid spores — H. aurantiaca and H. tapinia . He justified the placement of Hygrophoropsis in the Paxillaceae largely on fruit body morphology and spore size : " The discovery of a second species , H. tapinia , with smaller spores and an external appearance frankly suggesting Paxillus curtisii but never met with in Clitocybe , makes the affinity between Hygrophoropsis and Paxillus an established fact . " In 1975 , he added H. olida , a species with inamyloid but cyanophilous spores , whose characteristics otherwise aligned with the type species . 
 Hygrophoropsis is now the type genus of the family Hygrophoropsidaceae , circumscribed by Robert Kühner in 1980 to contain it and the genus Omphalotus . Singer considered this family to be " transient between <unk> and Boletales " . Molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed its affinity lay in the order Boletales in 1997 , though later research showed that it is not closely related to Paxillus or other gilled boletes . Instead , it is most closely related to the genus Leucogyrophana . Hygrophoropsis and Leucogyrophana are sister to <unk> , near the base of the cladogram representing the Boletales . 
 The presence of several pigments in the type species , including variegatic acid , variegatorubin , and several other derivatives of pulvinic acid , suggests a chemotaxic relationship with the Boletaceae , Coniophoraceae , and Paxillaceae — families of Boletales with members that have similar compounds . 
 = = Description = = 
 Hygrophoropsis species have fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled @-@ in edges . The texture of the cap surface ranges from somewhat tomentose to velvety . Typical fruit body colors are orange , brownish @-@ yellow ( fulvous ) or paler , buff , and cream . The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe . They are narrow with blunt edges , often multiply forked , and readily detachable from the stipe . The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface , or lighter . The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript , or similar to cultivated mushrooms . In contrast , H. rufa can have a distinct ozone @-@ like smell , reportedly reminiscent of the orchid <unk> <unk> or a photocopier . 
 The spore print colour ranges from whitish to cream . Microscopically , Hygrophoropsis lacks cystidia and has spores that are dextrinoid , meaning that they stain reddish @-@ brown in Melzer 's reagent . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . With respect to overall appearance , Hygrophoropsis species closely resemble those in genus <unk> ; the latter genus , however , has amyloid rather than dextrinoid spores . 
 = = Habitat , distribution , and ecology = = 
 Collectively , Hygrophoropsis is a widespread genus , found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres . Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species , found on several continents . The other species are not well @-@ known and have more limited ranges . Fruit bodies grow on the ground in woodlands , on moss , and peat , and on woodchips . Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus , and causes brown rot in the wood it colonises . Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal . 
 Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca secretes large amounts of oxalic acid — a reducing agent and relatively strong acid — into the soil around its woody substrate . This chemical stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil , as the organic matter in soil breaks down into smaller molecules .

 A 2008 estimate in the Dictionary of the Fungi placed five species in the genus . As of November 2015 , Index Fungorum accepts 16 species in Hygrophoropsis : 
 Hygrophorus pallidus , recorded by Charles Horton Peck in 1902 , is considered by mycologist Thomas Kuyper to be not validly published and " better regarded as a nomen <unk> " , a taxonomic opinion corroborated by Geoffrey Kibby . Now considered the type species for the genus <unk> , A. olida was formerly classified in Hygrophoropsis , but it lacks dextrinoid basidiospores , and phylogenetically it is classified in the Agaricales .

 = = History = = 
 Air Norway was founded in 2003 by Gunnar <unk> . Scheduled services from Ørland to Oslo commenced on 23 May 2003 . The company had originally planned to also operate aircraft between Ørland and Bodø Airport , to two main air stations of the Norwegian Air Force , but these plans were abandoned . Just after the route commenced , the owner became seriously ill , and marketing and sales efforts were neglected , causing a less @-@ than @-@ predicted cabin load . <unk> died on 26 December , and his heirs encouraged local businesses to purchase shares in the company . Air Norway commenced weekly flights from Oslo to Aalborg Airport in Denmark from 31 January 2004 . In February 2004 , the company received a loan for NOK 650 @,@ 000 from the municipality to operate pay off other debt . At the same time , the airline was sold to Sven <unk> . 
 By 2005 , the airline was still losing money . On 21 February , the Municipality of Ørland bought shares for NOK 1 million , while North Flying bought the remaining half of the company . Mayor Hallgeir <unk> ( Center Party ) stated that while it was a risky investment for a municipality with limited budget , the airline was of great strategic importance for Ørland and Fosen . When the European Union introduced new security rules for airports from 1 January 2005 , Ørland Airport was exempt , because of the small size of the aircraft . By April , the airport had received notice that 100 % security control would still have to be introduced , costing the municipality NOK 465 @,@ 000 per year . At the same time , Air Norway was still losing money , and applied to the municipality to not be charged landing fees at the airport . When this was granted , it saved the company NOK 540 @,@ 000 per year . In July , Air Norway transported its 10,000th passenger and signed a new contract with the Air Force , which was responsible for more than half the ridership . In November , the administration of the airline was moved from Drammen to Ørland and Fosen <unk> . Snorre <unk> was then hired as managing director . 
 In 2006 , the company experienced a 40 % passenger growth , and from 6 September , Air Norway also introduced services on Wednesday . The same year , the municipality started a NOK 1 @.@ 8 million upgrade to the airport . When it opened on 3 September 2007 , it became an international airport and allowed transit for passengers to Aalborg , plus increased security and a general renovation of the terminal building from 1978 . 
 Following the bankruptcy of Coast Air in January 2008 , Air Norway and North Flying were awarded an interim contract to operate the route from Fagernes to Oslo , with subsidies from the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications . At the same time , the airline started a route from Fagernes to Trondheim Airport , Værnes . In March , they won the public service obligation ( PSO ) contract , granting them the route until 31 March 2009 . During the first half of 2008 , ridership at Fagernes Airport was reduced by 27 @.@ 3 % , compared with the first half of the previous year . From 1 April 2009 , the Fagernes PSO contract was lost to DOT LT , and Air Norway terminated those routes . 
 In 2009 , Air Norway lost 1 @,@ 300 passengers after the Norwegian Air Force decided to not permit their employees to travel from Ørland , but instead have to take cheaper flights from Trondheim , located about a two @-@ hour drive away . The reduction in ridership , along with a strengthening of the Danish krone in relation to the Norwegian , caused Air Norway to lose NOK 100 @,@ 000 by August 2009 . The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a PSO . In February 2010 , the municipality granted NOK 62 @,@ 500 for Air Norway to run a television commercial during the semi @-@ final of Melodi Grand Prix . 
 = Bath Abbey = 
 The Abbey Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul , Bath , commonly known as Bath Abbey , is an Anglican parish church and a former Benedictine monastery in Bath , Somerset , England . Founded in the 7th century , Bath Abbey was reorganised in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries ; major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s . It is one of the largest examples of Perpendicular Gothic architecture in the West Country . 
 The church is cruciform in plan , and is able to seat 1200 . An active place of worship , with hundreds of congregation members and hundreds of thousands of visitors each year , it is used for religious services , secular civic ceremonies , concerts and lectures . The choir performs in the abbey and elsewhere . There is a heritage museum in the vaults . 
 The abbey is a Grade I listed building , particularly noted for its fan vaulting . It contains war memorials for the local population and monuments to several notable people , in the form of wall and floor plaques and commemorative stained glass . The church has two organs and a peal of ten bells . The west front includes sculptures of angels climbing to heaven on two stone ladders .

 In 675 Osric , King of the Hwicce , granted the Abbess Berta 100 hides near Bath for the establishment of a convent . This religious house became a monastery under the patronage of the Bishop of Worcester . King Offa of Mercia successfully wrested " that most famous monastery at Bath " from the bishop in 781 . William of Malmesbury tells that Offa rebuilt the monastic church , which may have occupied the site of an earlier pagan temple , to such a standard that King Eadwig was moved to describe it as being " marvellously built " ; little is known about the architecture of this first building on the site . Monasticism in England had declined by that time , but Eadwig 's brother Edgar ( who was crowned " King of the English " at the abbey in 973 ) began its revival on his accession to the throne in 959 . He encouraged monks to adopt the Rule of Saint Benedict , which was introduced at Bath under Abbot Ælfheah ( St. Alphege ) . 
 = = = Norman Conquest to the Dissolution = = = 
 Bath was ravaged in the power struggle between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087 . The victor , William II Rufus , granted the city to a royal physician , John of Tours , who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath . Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey 's grounds from the king , as well as the city of Bath itself . Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear . The abbey had recently lost its abbot , Ælfsige , and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city ; it was likely the abbey 's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery . By acquiring Bath , John also acquired the mint that was in the city . In 1090 he transferred the seat , or administration , of the bishopric to Bath Abbey , probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see . Bath was a rich abbey , and Wells had always been a poor diocese . By taking over the abbey , John increased his episcopal revenues . William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey , but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns . When John moved his episcopal seat , he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter , turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese . John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath , which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray 's rebellions . Permission was given to move the see of Somerset from Wells – a comparatively small settlement – to the then walled city of Bath . 
 When this was effected in 1090 , John became the first Bishop of Bath , and St Peter 's was raised to cathedral status . As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined , the monastery became a priory , run by its prior . With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status , it was felt that a larger , more up @-@ to @-@ date building was required . John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale , dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul , but only the ambulatory was complete when he died in December 1122 . He was buried in the cathedral . The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath ; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106 . 
 The half @-@ finished cathedral was devastated by fire in 1137 , but work continued under Godfrey , the new bishop , until about 1156 ; the completed building was approximately 330 feet ( 101 m ) long . It was consecrated while Robert of Bath was bishop . The specific date is not known however it was between 1148 and 1161 . 
 In 1197 , Reginald Fitz Jocelin 's successor , Savaric FitzGeldewin , with the approval of Pope Celestine III , officially moved his seat to Glastonbury Abbey , but the monks there would not accept their new Bishop of Glastonbury and the title of Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury was used until the Glastonbury claim was abandoned in 1219 . Savaric 's successor , Jocelin of Wells , again moved the bishop 's seat to Bath Abbey , with the title Bishop of Bath . Following his death the monks of Bath unsuccessfully attempted to regain authority over Wells . There were 40 monks on the roll in 1206 . 
 Joint cathedral status was awarded by Pope Innocent IV to Bath and Wells in 1245 . Roger of Salisbury was appointed the first Bishop of Bath and Wells , having been Bishop of Bath for a year previously . Later bishops preferred Wells , the canons of which had successfully petitioned various popes down the years for Wells to regain cathedral status . Bath Cathedral gradually fell into disrepair . In 1485 the priory had 22 monks . When Oliver King , Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495 – 1503 , visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church in ruins . He also described lax discipline , idleness and a group of monks " all too eager to succumb to the temptations of the flesh " . 
 King took a year to consider what action to take , before writing to the Prior of Bath in October 1500 to explain that a large amount of the priory income would be dedicated to rebuilding the cathedral . There are several stories that , on a visit to Bath , King had a dream in which he " saw the Heavenly Host on high with angels ascending and descending by ladder " which is now represented on the west front of the cathedral . However this interpretation , which first appeared in the writings of John Harington , around 100 years after it was supposed to have happened , has been challenged . 
 Robert and William Vertue , the king 's masons were commissioned , promising to build the finest vault in England , promising " there shall be none so <unk> neither in England nor France " . Their design incorporated the surviving Norman crossing wall and arches . They appointed Thomas Lynne to supervise work on site and work probably began the following spring . Oliver King planned a smaller church , covering the area of the Norman nave only . He did not live to see the result , but the restoration of the cathedral was completed just a few years before the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 .

 Prior Holloway surrendered Bath Priory to the crown in January 1539 . It was sold to Humphry Colles of Taunton . The church was stripped of lead , iron and glass and left to decay . Colles sold it to Matthew Colthurst of Wardour Castle in 1543 . His son Edmund Colthurst gave the roofless remains of the building to the corporation of Bath in 1572 . The corporation had difficulty finding private funds for its restoration . 
 In 1574 , Queen Elizabeth I promoted the restoration of the church , to serve as the grand parish church of Bath . She ordered that a national fund should be set up to finance the work , and in 1583 decreed that it should become the parish church of Bath . James Montague , the Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608 – 1616 , paid £ 1 @,@ 000 for a new nave roof of timber lath construction ; according to the inscription on his tomb , this was prompted after seeking shelter in the roofless nave during a thunderstorm . He is buried in an alabaster tomb in the north aisle .

 During the 1820s and 1830s buildings , including houses , shops and taverns which were very close to or actually touching the walls of the abbey were demolished and the interior remodelled by George Phillips Manners who was the Bath City Architect . Manners erected flying buttresses to the exterior of the nave and added pinnacles to the turrets . 
 Major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s , funded by the rector , Charles Kemble . The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave , which was not merely a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design . Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir , to a design by William and Robert Vertue . There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave , but that this plan was abandoned , probably for reasons of cost . In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed . Scott 's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front . 
 Work carried out in the 20th and 21st centuries included full cleaning of the stonework and the reconstruction of the pipe organ by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn . The stonework of the west front had been subject to natural erosion therefore a process of lime @-@ based conservation was carried out during the 1990s by Nimbus Conservation under the guidance of Professor Robert Baker who had previously worked on the west front of Wells Cathedral . Some of the damage to sculptures had been made worse by the use of Portland cement by previous work carried out in the Victorian era . A statue of St Phillip was beyond repair and was removed and replaced with a modern statue by Laurence Tindall . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The new church is not a typical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture ; the low aisles and nave arcades and the very tall clerestory present the opposite balance to that which was usual in perpendicular churches . As this building was to serve as a monastic church , it was built to a cruciform plan , which had become relatively rare in parish churches of the time . The interior contains fine fan vaulting by Robert and William Vertue , who designed similar vaulting for the Henry VII chapel , at Westminster Abbey . The building has 52 windows , occupying about 80 % of the wall space , giving the interior an impression of lightness , and reflecting the different attitudes towards churchmanship shown by the clergy of the time and those of the 12th century . 
 The cruciform abbey is built of Bath stone , which gives the exterior its yellow colour . It is an atypical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture , with low aisles and nave arcades and a tall clerestory . The walls and roofs are supported by buttresses and surmounted by battlements , pinnacles and pierced parapets , many of which were added by George Manners during his 1830 's restorations . 
 The nave , which has five bays , is 211 feet ( 64 m ) long and 35 feet ( 11 m ) wide to the pillars and rises to 75 feet ( 23 m ) , with the whole church being 225 feet ( 69 m ) long and 80 feet ( 24 m ) wide . 
 The west front , which was originally constructed in 1520 , has a large arched window and detailed carvings . Above the window are carvings of angels and to either side long stone ladders with angels climbing up them . Apart from the story mentioned above connecting it with Oliver King , Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495 – 1503 this is a direct reference to the dream of the prophet Jacob mentioned in the Bible and commonly called Jacobs Ladder . 
 Below the window a battlemented parapet supports a statue and beneath this , on either side of the door , are statues of St Peter and St Paul . Restoration work in the late 20th century involved cleaning with electronically controlled intermittent water sprays and ammonium carbonate poultices . One of the figures which had lost its head and shoulders was replaced . The sculptures on the West front have been interpreted as representing " spiritual ascent through the virtue of humility and descent through the vice of pride " and Christ as the Man of Sorrow and the Antichrist . During the 1990s a major restoration and cleaning work were carried out on the exterior stonework , returning it to the yellow colour hidden under centuries of dirt .

 The building has 52 windows , occupying about 80 percent of the wall space . The east end has a square @-@ framed window of seven lights . It includes a depiction of the nativity made by Clayton and Bell in 1872 , and was presented to the church by the Bath Literary Club . 
 The window of the Four Evangelists over the northwest door is a memorial to Charles Empson , who died in 1861 .

The abbey 's tower is now home to a ring of ten bells , which are – unusually – hung so that the order of the bells from highest to lowest runs anti @-@ clockwise around the ringing chamber . The tenor weighs 33 cwt ( 3 @,@ 721 lb or 1 @,@ 688 kg ) . Bath is a noted centre of change ringing in the West Country . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The interior fan vaulting ceiling , originally installed by Robert and William Vertue , was restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott between 1864 and 1874 . The fan vaulting provides structural stability by distributing the weight of the roof down ribs that transfer the force into the supporting columns via the flying buttresses . 
 Scott 's work in the 1870s included the installation of large gas chandeliers made by the Coventry metalworker Francis Skidmore . They were converted to electricity in 1979 . Other new features included a new pulpit and seating . A marble altarpiece from General George Wade in the sanctuary was removed and replaced with a decorative reredos . 
 In the 1920s Thomas Graham Jackson redesigned the Norman Chapel into a War Memorial Chapel , now Gethsemane Chapel , and added a cloister . New quire screens were installed in 2004 , partly to improve the acoustics , topped with 12 carved angels playing musical instruments .

 Within the abbey are 617 wall memorials and 847 floor stones .

Many of the monuments in the churchyard were carved between 1770 and 1860 by Reeves of Bath . War memorials include those commemorating the First Anglo @-@ Afghan War ( 1841 – 42 ) , the First World War ( 1914 – 18 ) , and the Second World War ( 1939 – 45 ) . The most recent memorial was installed in 1958 to commemorate Isaac Pitman , the developer of Pitman shorthand , who died in 1897 . 
 = = = = Main organ = = = = 
 The first mention of an organ in the abbey dates to 1634 , but nothing is known of that instrument . The first properly recorded organ in Bath Abbey was built by Abraham Jordan in 1708 . It was modified in 1718 and 1739 by Jordan 's son . The specification recorded in 1800 was one of twenty stops spread over three manuals . The compasses of the manuals were extended , one and a half octaves of pedals were added and the instrument renovated in 1802 by John Holland ; further repairs were effected by Flight & Robson in 1826 . This instrument was removed first to the Bishop 's Palace at Wells in 1836 , then to St Mary 's Church , Yatton , where it was subsequently rebuilt and extensively modified . 
 The abbey 's next organ was built in 1836 by John Smith of Bristol , to a specification of thirty stops over three manuals and pedals . This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill & Son of London in 1868 , to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals , although the Solo department , which would have brought the total to well over forty , was not completed . It was mostly removed to the Church of St Peter & St Paul , Cromer in 1896 , the remainder being kept for incorporation in the new abbey organ . 
 A new organ was supplied to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich . It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals , and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches , with the console standing on the floor next to the north @-@ west pier of the crossing . New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath , but were never executed . Norman & Beard re @-@ erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914 , with the addition of two stops to the Pedal . It was again rebuilt by them in 1930 , and then by Hill , Norman and Beard in 1948 , which brought the number of stops to 58 . In 1972 this was increased to a total of 65 speaking stops . The Positive division , with its separate case behind the console , was installed at the same time . Problems caused by the tonal scheme 's lack of coherence – the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972 – and with reliability , caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions , all difficult to access , led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again . 
 The organ was totally reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn , retaining the existing instrument as far as was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition , although the Positive division was kept . The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals , and is built largely on the <unk> principle of organ layout : the case is only one department deep , except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than the sides of the case . New 75 percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back , side walls and roof . Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale <unk> in <unk> , Suffolk , was provided to allow sound egress from the bottom of the case . The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all @-@ new manuals . Twenty @-@ two of the organ 's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument . Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework , and 21 contain 1895 pipework . Only two ranks are entirely of 1895 . Forty @-@ eight ranks contain some new pipework , 34 of which are entirely new . Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible . The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced . The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals , with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals . The stop action is electric throughout .

 A four @-@ stop continuo organ was built for the abbey in 1999 by Northampton @-@ based organ builder Kenneth Tickell .

A lever pedal can reduce the stops sounding to only the 8 ' stop and , when released , returns the organ to the registration in use before it was depressed .

 Delaware Route 54 ( DE 54 ) and Maryland Route 54 ( MD 54 ) are adjoining state highways in the U.S. states of Delaware and Maryland . Route 54 runs 41 @.@ 84 mi ( 67 @.@ 33 km ) from MD 313 in Mardela Springs , Maryland east to DE 1 in Fenwick Island , Delaware . In addition to two segments in which the highway is completely in Delaware and two segments in which the highway is completely in Maryland , Route 54 follows the Delaware / Maryland state line between the twin towns of Delmar , Maryland and Delmar , Delaware and the highway 's intersection with MD 353 and DE 26 . One section of the state line portion of Route 54 is maintained by the Delaware Department of Transportation ( DelDOT ) while three sections of the highway that follow the state line are maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) . 
 Route 54 was first numbered in two segments in Wicomico County , Maryland in the late 1930s . MD 467 was assigned to the segment around Mardela Springs while MD 455 was assigned to the state line road near Delmar . The Delaware portions of the highway remained unnumbered until the late 1960s , when DelDOT briefly assigned DE 32 to the highway along the southern edge of Sussex County before designating it DE 54 . The Maryland State Roads Commission ( now MDSHA ) immediately reciprocated by designating its portions MD 54 . Route 54 east of Selbyville has become an important route for seasonal beach traffic headed to and from Fenwick Island and Ocean City , with suburban development lining the road between DE 20 and the eastern terminus . DelDOT has signed DE 54 Alternate ( DE 54 Alt . ) as an alternate route to the beaches . Improvements have been made to the route west of Fenwick Island , including building a causeway to reduce flooding and adding a center left @-@ turn lane .

 Route 54 begins at an intersection with MD 313 in Mardela Springs in Wicomico County , Maryland . MD 313 heads north from the intersection as Sharptown Road and west as a short continuation of Delmar Road west to MD 313 's terminus with U.S. Route 50 ( US 50 ) ( Ocean Gateway ) . Route 54 heads east as two @-@ lane undivided Delmar Road , paralleling Barren Creek on the north toward the Delaware state line . After passing the stone marker indicating the intersection of the <unk> Line with the southern end of the Mason – Dixon Line , the highway enters the southwest corner of Sussex County , Delaware , where it intersects Columbia Road . Route 54 continues east until Old Racetrack Road , where the highway turns southeast toward the state line . At the intersection with Waller Road , the state highway begins to follow the state line , with Sussex County , Delaware on the north side of the road and Wicomico County , Maryland on the south , and MDSHA maintenance begins . Route 54 immediately enters the twin towns of Delmar , Delaware and Delmar , Maryland and the highway 's name changes to State Street . The highway crosses Norfolk Southern Railway 's Delmarva Secondary track south of Highball Signal and meets MD 675 ( Bi State Boulevard ) , the old alignment of US 13 , in the center of the towns . Route 54 continues east to modern US 13 , which is known as Sussex Highway in Delaware and Ocean Highway in Maryland . At US 13 , the highway leaves Delmar and DelDOT assumes maintenance for the highway . 
 Route 54 continues east from US 13 as Line Road through farmland and scattered residences along the state line . At Brittingham Road , maintenance jurisdiction returns to MDSHA . Around the intersection with Whitesville Road , Route 54 dips into Maryland for a short distance , then returns to following the state line until the intersection with MD 353 ( Gumboro Road ) and DE 26 ( Millsboro Highway ) . At that intersection , Route 54 turns northeast and joins DE 26 in a concurrency . From this point , the highway remains in Delaware . A short distance north of the state line , DE 30 ( Whitesville Road ) joins the concurrency . In Gumboro , DE 26 and DE 30 continue north while Route 54 turns east onto Cypress Road . Route 54 crosses Bald Cypress Branch and the Pocomoke River , then passes through the Great Cypress Swamp . After crossing the swamp , the highway intersects US 113 on the west edge of Selbyville . 
 Route 54 continues east into Selbyville as Cemetery Road and crosses the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad . The highway turns south into Main Street to pass through the central business district . After intersecting the southern terminus of DE 17 ( Bethany Road ) , Route 54 turns east onto Lighthouse Road . In the hamlet of Bunting , the highway intersects DE 54 Alt . ( Bunting Road ) , an alternate route from Selbyville to Bethany Beach . Route 54 begins to pass beach @-@ related suburban development as the highway intersects the east end of DE 20 ( Zion Church Road ) . Past this intersection , the route gains a center left @-@ turn lane and continues past more development . As the highway approaches Fenwick Island , it becomes two lanes again and crosses two tidal ponds on an elevated causeway before it crosses The Ditch between Assawoman Bay to the south and Little Assawoman Bay to the north . After passing to the north of the Fenwick Island Light , Route 54 reaches its eastern terminus at DE 1 ( Coastal Highway ) in Fenwick Island , one block west of the Atlantic Ocean and one block north of Ocean City on the other side of the state line . 
 Route 54 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 14 @,@ 866 vehicles at the Old Stage Road intersection in Delmar to a low of 1 @,@ 464 vehicles at the Parker Road intersection west of Selbyville . None of Route 54 is part of the National Highway System . 
 = = History = = 
 By 1920 , what is now Route 54 in Delaware existed as an unpaved county road . The portion of the current route along Millsboro Highway was proposed as a state highway by 1925 . This segment of state highway was completed by 1931 , along with the portions from south of Columbia to a point along the state line to the east of Delmar and between Selbyville and Williamsville . A portion of the route along the state line east of Delmar was paved as a county road . On July 1 , 1935 , the county @-@ maintained portions of the road in Delaware were taken over by the state . By 1936 , the roadway was paved between Williamsville and Fenwick Island . A portion of road to the west of Selbyville was paved by 1939 . By 1942 , the remainder of the road in Delaware between the Maryland border and south of Columbia and Gumboro and Selbyville were paved . 
 The first non @-@ concurrent portions of Route 54 to be numbered were in Maryland in 1939 , when MD 467 was marked on the portion around Mardela Springs and MD 455 was marked on the portion around Delmar , which extended from where Waller Road fully enters Maryland east to Brittingham Road . The portion of road between Brittingham Road and MD 353 was county @-@ maintained . MD 455 was extended east from Brittingham Road to DE 26 in 1958 . In 1968 , DE 32 was assigned to the entire highway within Delaware ; the Maryland sections were still marked as MD 467 and MD 455 . The whole highway was marked as Route 54 in 1969 . In addition to the concurrencies with DE 26 and DE 30 , Route 54 has been concurrent with DE 20 . DE 20 was extended east of Dagsboro to terminate in Fenwick Island along with Route 54 by 1994 . DE 20 's eastern terminus was rolled back to its present location in 2005 . In September 2001 , construction began to build an elevated causeway for Route 54 to the west of Fenwick Island in order to prevent flooding from high tides and storms . The project involved building the new causeway to the north of the original alignment , using pre @-@ cast concrete segments . The project , which cost over $ 15 million , was slated to be finished in August 2003 . In 2010 , a $ 10 million project began to add a center left @-@ turn lane along with bike lanes and sidewalks to the portion of Route 54 between DE 20 and Mallard Lakes , a section of road that was targeted for safety improvements due to rapid development ; this project was completed in 2012 .

 = Receptor antagonist = 
 A receptor antagonist is a type of receptor ligand or drug that blocks or dampens agonist @-@ mediated responses rather than provoking a biological response itself upon binding to a receptor . They are sometimes called blockers ; examples include alpha blockers , beta blockers , and calcium channel blockers . In pharmacology , antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors , and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors . Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active <unk> ( = right place ) site or to allosteric ( = other place ) sites on receptors , or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor 's activity . Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist – receptor complex , which , in turn , depends on the nature of antagonist – receptor binding . The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors . 
 = = Receptors = = 
 Biochemical receptors are large protein molecules that can be activated by the binding of a ligand ( such as a hormone or drug ) . Receptors can be membrane @-@ bound , occurring on the cell membrane , or intracellular , such as on the nucleus or mitochondrion . Binding occurs as a result of noncovalent interaction between the receptor and its ligand , at locations called the binding site on the receptor . A receptor may contain one or more binding sites for different ligands . Binding to the active site on the receptor regulates receptor activation directly . The activity of receptors can also be regulated by the binding of a ligand to other sites on the receptor , as in allosteric binding sites . Antagonists mediate their effects through receptor interactions by preventing agonist @-@ induced responses . This may be accomplished by binding to the active site or the allosteric site . In addition , antagonists may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor 's activity to exert their effects . 
 The term antagonist was originally coined to describe different profiles of drug effects . The biochemical definition of a receptor antagonist was introduced by <unk> and Stephenson in the 1950s . The current accepted definition of receptor antagonist is based on the receptor occupancy model . It narrows the definition of antagonism to consider only those compounds with opposing activities at a single receptor . Agonists were thought to turn " on " a single cellular response by binding to the receptor , thus initiating a biochemical mechanism for change within a cell . Antagonists were thought to turn " off " that response by ' blocking ' the receptor from the agonist . This definition also remains in use for physiological antagonists , substances that have opposing physiological actions , but act at different receptors . For example , histamine lowers arterial pressure through vasodilation at the histamine H1 receptor , while adrenaline raises arterial pressure through vasoconstriction mediated by alpha @-@ adrenergic receptor activation . 
 Our understanding of the mechanism of drug @-@ induced receptor activation and receptor theory and the biochemical definition of a receptor antagonist continues to evolve . The two @-@ state model of receptor activation has given way to <unk> models with intermediate conformational states . The discovery of functional selectivity and that ligand @-@ specific receptor conformations occur and can affect interaction of receptors with different second messenger systems may mean that drugs can be designed to activate some of the downstream functions of a receptor but not others . This means efficacy may actually depend on where that receptor is expressed , altering the view that efficacy at a receptor is receptor @-@ independent property of a drug . 
 = = Pharmacodynamics = = 
 = = = Efficacy and potency = = = 
 By definition , antagonists display no efficacy to activate the receptors they bind . Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor . Once bound , however , antagonists inhibit the function of agonists , inverse agonists , and partial agonists . In functional antagonist assays , a dose @-@ response curve measures the effect of the ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist . The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its EC50 value . This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist . <unk> an EC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar <unk> , however the dose @-@ response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar . The lower the EC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist , and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response . Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side @-@ effects . 
 = = = Affinity = = = 
 The affinity of an antagonist for its binding site ( Ki ) , i.e. its ability to bind to a receptor , will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity . The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in <unk> binding studies using the Cheng @-@ Prusoff equation . Schild regression can be used to determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non @-@ competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity , efficacy or concentration of the agonist used . However , it is important that equilibrium has been reached . The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account . The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects , such as in competitive neuromuscular @-@ blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding , cannot be analyzed using Schild regression . Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio , the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 in the presence of a competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve . Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio . In Schild regression , a plot is made of the log ( dose ratio @-@ 1 ) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations . The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the x @-@ axis on the regression plot . Whereas , with Schild regression , antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng @-@ Prusoff equation , agonist concentrations are varied . Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng @-@ Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki ( affinity constant for an antagonist ) from the shift in <unk> that occurs during competitive inhibition . The Cheng @-@ Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists . 
 = = Types = = 
 = = = Competitive = = = 
 Competitive antagonists ( also known as surmountable antagonists ) reversibly bind to receptors at the same binding site ( active site ) as the endogenous ligand or agonist , but without activating the receptor . Agonists and antagonists " compete " for the same binding site on the receptor . Once bound , an antagonist will block agonist binding . The level of activity of the receptor will be determined by the relative affinity of each molecule for the site and their relative concentrations . High concentrations of a competitive agonist will increase the proportion of receptors that the agonist occupies , higher concentrations of the antagonist will be required to obtain the same degree of binding site occupancy . In functional assays using competitive antagonists , a parallel rightward shifts of agonist dose – response curves with no alteration of the maximal response is observed . 
 The interleukin @-@ 1 receptor antagonist , IL @-@ <unk> is an example of a competitive antagonist . The effects of a competitive antagonist may be overcome by increasing the concentration of agonist . Often ( though not always ) these antagonists possess a very similar chemical structure to that of the agonist . 
 = = = Non @-@ competitive = = = 
 The term " non @-@ competitive antagonism " ( sometimes called non @-@ surmountable antagonists ) can be used to describe two distinct phenomena : one in which the antagonist binds to the active site of the receptor , and one in which the antagonist binds to an allosteric site of the receptor . While the mechanism of antagonism is different in both of these phenomena , they are both called " non @-@ competitive " because the end @-@ results of each are functionally very similar . Unlike competitive antagonists , which affect the amount of agonist necessary to achieve a maximal response but do not affect the magnitude of that maximal response , non @-@ competitive antagonists reduce the magnitude of the maximum response that can be attained by any amount of agonist . This property earns them the name " non @-@ competitive " because their effects cannot be negated , no matter how much agonist is present . In functional assays of non @-@ competitive antagonists , depression of the maximal response of agonist dose @-@ response curves , and in some cases , rightward shifts , is produced . The rightward shift will occur as a result of a receptor reserve ( also known as spare receptors , see in pharmacodynamics ) and inhibition of the agonist response will only occur when this reserve is depleted . 
 An antagonist that binds to the active site of a receptor is said to be " non @-@ competitive " if the bond between the active site and the antagonist is irreversible or nearly so . This usage of the term " non @-@ competitive " may not be ideal , however , since the term " irreversible competitive antagonism " may also be used to describe the same phenomenon without the potential for confusion with the second meaning of " non @-@ competitive antagonism " discussed below . 
 The second form of " non @-@ competitive antagonists " act at an allosteric site . These antagonists bind to a distinctly separate binding site from the agonist , exerting their action to that receptor via the other binding site . They do not compete with agonists for binding at the active site . The bound antagonists may prevent conformational changes in the receptor required for receptor activation after the agonist binds . <unk> has been shown to act as a reversible non @-@ competitive antagonist of <unk> receptor . 
 = = = Uncompetitive = = = 
 Uncompetitive antagonists differ from non @-@ competitive antagonists in that they require receptor activation by an agonist before they can bind to a separate allosteric binding site . This type of antagonism produces a kinetic profile in which " the same amount of antagonist blocks higher concentrations of agonist better than lower concentrations of agonist " . Memantine , used in the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease , is an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor . 
 = = = Silent antagonists = = = 
 Silent antagonists are competitive receptor antagonists that have zero intrinsic activity for activating a receptor . They are true antagonists , so to speak . The term was created to distinguish fully inactive antagonists from weak partial agonists or inverse agonists . 
 = = = Partial agonists = = = 
 Partial agonists are defined as drugs that , at a given receptor , might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy . Although they are agonists , partial agonists can act as a competitive antagonist in the presence of a full agonist , as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy , thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone . Clinically , their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity . Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant , weak level of activity , whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels . In addition , it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists . <unk> , a partial agonist of the μ @-@ opioid receptor , binds with weak morphine @-@ like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence . 
 = = = Inverse agonists = = = 
 An inverse agonist can have effects similar to those of an antagonist , but causes a distinct set of downstream biological responses . <unk> active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists , which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor . Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors . Antihistamines , originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Many antagonists are reversible antagonists that , like most agonists , will bind and unbind a receptor at rates determined by receptor @-@ ligand kinetics . 
 Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the receptor target and , in general , cannot be removed ; inactivating the receptor for the duration of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover , the rate of synthesis of new receptors . <unk> is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker — it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors , preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding . Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist dose @-@ response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non @-@ competitive antagonists . A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non @-@ competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs , as effects of non @-@ competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored . 
 Irreversible competitive antagonists also involve competition between the agonist and antagonist of the receptor , but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist . For some antagonist , there may be a distinct period during which they behave competitively ( regardless of basal <unk> ) , and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor , determined by receptor @-@ ligand kinetics . But , once irreversible bonding has taken place , the receptor is deactivated and degraded . As for non @-@ competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs , there may be a shift in the log concentration – effect curve to the right , but , in general , both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained . 
 = Aayirathil Oruvan ( 2010 film ) = 
 Aayirathil Oruvan ( English : One Man in a Thousand ) is a 2010 Indian Tamil adventure film <unk> and directed by Selvaraghavan in his fifth feature film . Produced by R. Ravindran , it features music composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar , cinematography by Ramji and editing by Kola Bhaskar . The film stars Karthi , Reemma Sen and Andrea Jeremiah in the lead roles with Parthiepan playing a pivotal role . 
 The film begins with an episode in 1279 AD , when the successor of the last great Chola Emperor , pending invasion , sends his people to a mystery location , to survive the threat . The story resumes with an archaeologist , a coolie and a member of the army going in search of the archaeologist 's father to the ruined city that was the place the exiled Chola Prince retreated to . An expedition is promptly arranged , and on the course they stumble on the lost Chola civilization and its king and find unexplained links between them and the culture . The shocking events and the problems that arise forms the crux of the story . 
 Aayirathil Oruvan languished in development hell due to slow progress of the shoot and the extensive pre- and post @-@ production works , evading release dates ranging one year . Shooting began in July 2007 , and took place in various locations with 2 @,@ 000 extras in areas including <unk> , Kerala and Jaisalmer , Rajasthan amongst other regions throughout India . Uncut , the film runs for over 220 minutes , but the theatrical release was heavily cut at 183 minutes . The film released coinciding with the festival of Thai Pongal on 14 January 2010 , with a Telugu dubbing version , titled <unk> Okkadu , following six weeks later . Upon release , the film received mixed reviews whilst proceeding to become a successful venture commercially . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1279 A.D. , the downfall of the Chola dynasty seems imminent as the Pandyas drive the Chola people out of their kingdom in southern India . To escape them and save the life of his successor the Chola emperor sends his son along with the Chola people to a secret territory . The refugees take along an idol sacred to the Pandyas , angering them . To capture the escaped Cholas and the stolen idol , the Pandyas extend their invasion to unexplored territories but cannot find them . 
 Centuries later , in 2009 , Indian archaeologists continue searching for the existence of the lost Chola group based on clues left by the ancient Pandyan warriors . All archaeologists who attempted to search for the secret land have disappeared . Archaeologist Chandramouli is the most recent person to have gone missing . 
 The Indian government organizes a search expedition led by officer Anitha to find Chandramouli and the Chola empire ; she is assisted by the Indian army led by Ravisekharan . They recruit archaeologist Lavanya , the estranged daughter of Chandramouli , because her insight is essential for the success of the expedition . She hands over crucial documents on the Chola dynasty , prepared by her father , with instructions on the route to reach the destination . 
 Along with the army , Anitha employs a group of porters headed by Muthu , to transport the baggage during the journey . The crew embark on their voyage leading them to an island , Min @-@ <unk> , near Vietnam . They face seven traps set by the Cholas : sea creatures , cannibals , warriors , snakes , hunger , quicksand and a village . Many porters and army men are killed by these traps . 
 Muthu , Anitha and Lavanya get separated from the others . They reach the ruins of a village where they are subjected to black magic and nearly go mad before reaching the secret hideout of the Chola . The three find an ethnic isolated primitive Tamil group , ruled by a Chola king . The king and his people are in hiding , awaiting the arrival of the fabled messenger who will bring glory and prosperity back to their land and lead them back to Thanjavur , their motherland . The king and the priest consult the gods for omens and order Muthu , Anitha and Lavanya to be burnt alive as sacrifices . 
 Anitha tells the king that she is the messenger sent from the homeland . Muthu and Lavanya are enslaved while Anitha is given a chance to prove herself . She tries to seduce and convince the Chola king to march towards the homeland in two days so he can be crowned properly as a king . He suspects her bona fides since none of her actions match those described by the king 's ancestors . The ancestors wrote that the messenger will be preceded by hail and following his ill @-@ treatment will eventually help the tribe . 
 Meanwhile , Anitha drugs the priest and poisons the water sources . She catches a glimpse of the Pandyas ' sacred idol and leaves , finally exposing her identity as a descendant of the Pandya Dynasty . For generations , her race has been trying to find the whereabouts of the Chola prince and his people . The central minister , who sponsors the expedition , is also shown to be a Pandyan . The Chola king is shattered for having believed in Anitha . <unk> who has escaped the traps and is the sole survivor gets backup and a larger army after getting an information from a hypnotized follower of Anitha from the Chola kingdom . The king discovers that Muthu is the true messenger who would save the Cholas from the clutches of Anitha and the army . The priest gives all of his magical powers , like invisibility and invulnerability to Muthu and dies . 
 The Cholas fight bravely , but eventually lose to technology and are taken prisoners . Their women are molested and raped by the army . The king is killed and the men drown in the seas with the kings body . Muthu is able to escape and save the Chola prince . The seed of the Chola dynasty is brought back to their motherland by the messenger as prophesied .

 After the reception to his 2006 gangster film , <unk> , Selvaraghavan took a sabbatical to plan future projects and set up a production company , White Elephants , whose first project Idhu Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam started in November 2006 . The film was co @-@ produced by new producer R. Ravindran , and the first schedule began with Karthi Sivakumar , whose first film , Paruthiveeran , was awaiting release , and Sandhya . The film was stalled in early 2007 due to cinematographer Arvind Krishna 's decision to leave White Elephants and the project was eventually shelved . In July 2007 , Selvaraghavan announced a new film with a new team of Karthi and Reemma Sen in the cast , with Ramji replacing regular Arvind Krishna as the cinematographer . Erum Ali , wife of actor Abbas , became the team 's head costume designer , whilst , Selvaraghavan 's sister @-@ in @-@ law and Rajinikanth 's daughter , Aishwarya Dhanush , was signed on as an associate director . The film was named after a popular M. G. Ramachandran film , Aayirathil Oruvan . The producer was announced to be R. Ravindran whilst Yuvan Shankar Raja was appointed as music director following five previous successful soundtracks in Selvaraghavan films . Despite early indications that the director 's brother Dhanush was going to play a guest role , it became evident that the role was subsequently given to R. Parthiepan . Andrea Jeremiah was also signed for a role in the film in October 2007 , in her second film after <unk> <unk> and director @-@ actor <unk> Perumal followed suit in November 2007 . 
 Nearly six months after filming began , Yuvan Shankar Raja left the project , because he could not spend as much time on this film as Selvaraghavan wanted . Subsequently , the role of the music director was handed to G. V. Prakash Kumar , for whom Aayirathil Oruvan became his biggest project to date . Rambo Rajkumar , the film 's stunt director , died in April 2009 and was posthumously praised for his action choreography . The film 's music released two months later to much appraisal in a well @-@ held audio release function . Soon after the filming finished , the lead actors moved onto other projects as did Selvaraghavan whilst post @-@ production continued . In August 2009 , Selvaraghavan divorced his wife , Sonia Agarwal with his close proximity to Andrea being a speculated cause . During the period , G. V. Prakash Kumar and Selva also worked on the music in Mumbai whilst re @-@ recording was also held in Austria and London . Towards the end of the year , the film began to announce release date of Christmas which was later further delayed to coincide with the Pongal festival . A date clash occurred with Karthi 's Paiyaa , with an eventual hearing leading to the Karthi 's latter film being delayed . Throughout December 2009 , release work began with a trailer and promotional songs being released on 13 December with Kamal Haasan and Surya Sivakumar attending as special guests . The film was subsequently censored before the end of the year by the Central Board of Film Certification and settled with an adult rating , after Selvaraghavan refused to get rid of gory scenes . On 31 December , it was announced that the film was sold worldwide for 350 million rupees for theatrical , television and other rights .

 After extensive development and pre @-@ production which took four months for scripting , the film started the first schedule in the forests of <unk> in Kerala with Karthi , Reemma Sen and Andrea during October 2007 . The project developed a reputation for its gruelling shoots , a novel concept in Tamil films , at an early stage of production . Thirty @-@ five days into the shoot , Selvaraghavan gave a statement that the film was forty percent over and the film should release by May 2008 whilst also mentioning that rains in Kerala led to the budget going over expectations two months into the project . In January 2008 , the unit moved to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to shoot in the deserts in the region , however they were delayed again by unseasonal rains . Missing its original release date , the film 's progress carried on through 2008 , with shooting occurring towards the end of the year inside sets at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad . In the studios , choreographer <unk> composed a classical dance for Reemma Sen and Parthiepan , and the sequence was shot over twenty days . Shooting carried on in sets for three more months with second half scenes being recorded . Shoots in all regions were tough and demanding for the crew as the film featured more than three thousand junior artistes from a variety of unions across India , with the language barrier becoming a problem . The project , eighteen months into shoot , soon began to face questions about its progress , with the producer , Ravindran , having to complain to the Tamil Film Producers Council that Karthi was trying to change his look for his next film , Paiyaa , following the long period he had spent with Aayirathil Oruvan . In February 2009 , filming was completed after 263 days of shooting ; therefore the producers signaled for a summer release but it was postponed by six months . 
 When inquired by the media in regard to the long periods of shoot , whilst in production , the lead actor expressed that they were also unaware of how long the film 's shoot was going to carry on . Reemma Sen originally signed for forty days whilst Andrea signed for three months , without knowing that the film would eventually take 263 days of filming . Furthermore , Parthiepan claimed to have been signed for forty days , whilst his segment lasted up to 140 days .
