 Leslie ( Amy Poehler ) , Tom ( Aziz Ansari ) and Ben ( Adam Scott ) start promoting the upcoming Harvest Festival on several Pawnee media outlets , starting with the local morning zoo radio show " Crazy Ira and The Douche " ( Matt Besser and Nick Kroll ) . The duo begin asking Ben questions about his time as a teen mayor in Partridge , Minnesota , having researched how he bankrupted the town . Ben responds awkwardly , stammering incomprehensibly and unable to defend himself to Crazy Ira and The Douche 's taunts . Tom proposes dumping Ben from future media interviews , but Leslie insists they cannot because he is the only one who can handle complicated questions about its budget . Meanwhile , April ( Aubrey Plaza ) accepts an offer from Chris ( Rob Lowe ) to move to Indianapolis to be his secretary . Andy ( Chris Pratt ) begs April to reconsider , offering to perform all the errands that she hates doing for a month . Ron ( Nick Offerman ) volunteers to help , claiming that he does not want to lose April as an assistant while denying he cares about April and Andy 's relationship . Ann ( Rashida Jones ) is increasingly frustrated that Chris has not asked her about coming to Indianapolis with him , and is concerned about where their relationship is headed . 
 Unfortunately , Ben 's past comes up again during Leslie 's interview with newspaper reporter Shauna Malwae @-@ Tweep ( Alison Becker ) , who asks why Pawnee should accept financial guidance from someone with a poor budget managing record like Ben . Tom and Ben go on the television show " Ya ' Heard ? with Perd " with Perd Hapley ( Jay Jackson ) in the hopes of recovering from the earlier debacle , but this interview is even worse , with Ben launching into a furious , incoherent rant when his past is brought up . As a result , several businesses consider pulling their sponsorships from the Harvest Festival . Leslie decides to use her upcoming interview on " Pawnee Today " with Joan Callamezzo ( Mo Collins ) to perform damage control . During the interview , Joan asks very biased questions about the festival and Ben 's past . Annoyed , Leslie brings Ben on stage to give him a final opportunity to explain himself . Ben again begins to freeze up at the questions from people calling in , but he finally gets over it and vigorously defends himself . By the end , the questions switch back from Ben to the festival itself , making the media blitz a successful one after all . 
 Chris tells Ann that after Indianapolis , he will be sent to a different city . The two agree they need to talk about the future of their relationship . Meanwhile , Andy 's difficult day of running errands for April culminates with him getting arrested after April 's sister Natalie ( Minni Jo Mazzola ) claims he is kidnapping her when he is merely picking her up from school . Ron approaches April and tells her that she should either forgive Andy or cut him loose , believing that she is only stringing Andy along and going to Indianapolis to spite him . When Andy returns , April finally forgives him and kisses him .

 " Media Blitz " was written by Harris Wittels and directed by David Rogers . Like all of the first six third season episodes , it was written and filmed almost immediately after the second season ended as part of an early shooting schedule due to Amy Poehler 's pregnancy . However , although finished early in anticipation of a September 2010 release date , Parks was ultimately placed on hiatus until early 2011 , many months after production on " Media Blitz " was already finished . " Media Blitz " featured guest appearances by Matt Besser and Nick Kroll as , respectively , " Crazy Ira and The Douche " , the hosts of a Pawnee morning zoo @-@ style radio show . Kroll is a stand @-@ up comedian who had appeared in shows like Cavemen and The League , while Besser is a comedian from the Upright Citizens Brigade , a sketch comedy show and troupe which also featured Amy Poehler . Parks and Recreation co @-@ creator Michael Schur said the Douche was invented because the Parks and Recreation staff liked Kroll and tried to find a way to work him into the show . The episode also featured several appearances by several frequent guest stars , including Mo Collins as television host Joan Callamezzo , Alison Becker as newspaper writer Shauna Malwae @-@ Tweep , and Jay Jackson as television reporter Perd Hapley . 
 Much of " Media Blitz " revolves around the backstory of Ben Wyatt , which was introduced in the second season episode " The Master Plan " , involving his attempts to rebuild his political career after a humiliating public spectacle as a teen mayor . This was originally a concept the Parks and Recreation creators considered for Leslie Knope 's background , but they ultimately abandoned the idea . " Media Blitz " marked the end of a plotline between April and Andy that began with the second season finale , " Freddy Spaghetti " , when Ann kissed Andy just as April had agreed to start dating him . April had been angry with Andy ever since , and Andy had been desperately trying to win her back , culminating with the events in " Media Blitz " . Schur called it a " key moment " for April and Andy , and said , " It 's almost like Andy ’ s a Knight of the Round Table , and he ’ s got a lot of different obstacles that he ’ s got to overcome in order to win the love of a fair maiden . " The episode also continued a development of Ron Swanson 's character as more of a father figure to his employees , particularly Andy and April , even though Ron himself outwardly claims not to care about affairs . This began in the episode " Flu Season " , where Ron offered advice to Andy about winning April back , and continued in " Media Blitz " with Ron giving April advice that ultimately led her to take Andy back .

 In one scene , Leslie claims she unsuccessfully tried to contact Oprah Winfrey , the popular billionaire television host , to seek publicity for the harvest festival . Upon failing to contact Winfrey , Leslie said , " I 'm putting it out there , like The Secret , and hopefully she 'll call me . " The Secret is a 2006 self @-@ help book by Rhonda Byrne that became a best @-@ seller after it was featured on two episodes of The Oprah Winfrey Show . At one point , Tom reveals he shops for clothes at Brooks Brothers Boys , the chain of Brooks Brothers that produces clothes specifically for young boys . Several Pawnee residents in " Media Blitz " refer to using the search engine AltaVista , a site that had not been popular for several years , prompting Ben to ask , " Why does everyone in this town use AltaVista ? Is it 1997 ? " The radio DJs Crazy Ira and The Douche play several sound effects during their show , and when Ben acts awkwardly during the interview , they play the sound effect used when Pac @-@ Man is killed in the maze arcade games .

 " Media Blitz " received generally positive reviews , with several commentators particularly praising the performance of Adam Scott , although some said the subplot with Chris and Ann was less effective . TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook wrote , " Party Down vet absolutely stole the show on Parks and Recreation . ... Scott was a machine of mania , a dork gone wild , who gave the rapidly unraveling Ben just the right amount of crazy while completely cracking us up . " Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said " Media Blitz " continue a long period of excellent Parks and Recreation episodes , although he said the problems were resolved too quickly at the end of the episode . Sundermann said Scott 's slightly over @-@ the @-@ top performance was made especially funny because he is normally such a straight man character . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Scott for his ability to be both a straight man and a more outrageously funny character , as during his meltdowns in media interviews . Sepinwall also complimented Aubrey Plaza 's performance and said the overall episode was very funny , but that the main storyline was resolved too quickly . 
 Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the episode continued the development of the town of Pawnee , which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons ' Springfield . Poniewozik said " Media Blitz " also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast , and called the " Crazy Ira and The Douche " interview " maybe the most perfect scene P & R has put together yet " . Likewise , Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben 's interview with Perd Hapley " one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done " . Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt 's backstory throughout the season , " then took it way over @-@ the @-@ top " . However , he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution . Zap2it writer Rick Porter , called the episode a " great showcase for Scott 's deadpan gifts " and wrote , " This show hasn 't had a real miss yet this season . " Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting , but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy . Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott 's character to the forefront , as well as for providing satire on small @-@ town politics without coming across as preachy . Kandell said of the April and Andy story , " If their kiss at the shoeshine stand , as expected and inevitable as it may have been , didn 't make your heart soar just a little bit , then you 're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early . " Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott , calling him a " current @-@ generation Bob Newhart " and " one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys everything you need to know about what his character is thinking " . Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile , but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because , regarding morning zoo radio shows , " it 's hard to parody something that 's already a parody of itself " . 
 The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott 's performance , as well as how the writers have " smartly underplayed " the relationship between Leslie and Ben . Meslow also liked that the April @-@ Andy subplot was now resolved , as he called it the " weakest plotline of the season " , but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in " Media Blitz " were a rehash of the previous episode . Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott 's performance , calling him a master at the straight man role , but said he was funnier the previous week in " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " : " The laughs weren 't as loud on " Media Blitz , " as it was more of a squirm @-@ inducing half hour of television . " Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was " dominated , in a good way , by its softer , sweeter moments " , particularly the kiss between Andy and April , which he said " was so damn sweet that I just couldn 't resist it " . Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview , Fowler said he did not find Scott 's performance otherwise especially funny . Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott 's performance , adding , " Did anyone else 's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie ’ s face when Ben found his voice ? " Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled , as April 's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character . Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot , of which she said , " Wake me up when something actually happens . "

 " Rain " is a song by American singer Madonna from her fifth studio album Erotica ( 1992 ) . The song was released on August 5 , 1993 by Maverick Records as the album 's fifth single internationally and the fourth single in North America . It was later included on her ballad compilation album Something to Remember ( 1995 ) . The song was written and produced by Madonna and Shep Pettibone . A pop ballad with influence from trip hop and new @-@ age music , " Rain " features a more " friendly " composition than the other singles released from the album . Lyrically the song likens rain to the empowering effect of love , and as with water 's ability to clean and wash away pain . Like the other songs on Erotica , sexual contact is also a possible interpretation of the song . 
 " Rain " received positive response from music critics , who noted it as an exceptional ballad amongst the overtly sexual content on Erotica . It peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States , while becoming a top @-@ ten hit in Australia , Canada , Ireland , Italy , Japan , and the United Kingdom . The accompanying music video was shot in black and white by director Mark Romanek and colored manually with blue tones . It features Madonna singing the song against various backdrops on a set . The music video was praised by many critics for its innovation and cinematography . Madonna has only performed the song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993 , while a remixed version of the song was used as a video interlude during her 2008 – 09 Sticky & Sweet Tour .

 After the completion of filming A League of Their Own , Madonna began working on her fifth studio album Erotica with Shep Pettibone . " Rain " was one of the first songs developed for the album , alongside " Deeper and Deeper " , " Erotica " , and " Thief of Hearts " , during the writing session in October and November 1991 . According to Pettibone , these songs were essentially Madonna 's stories and the things she wanted to say . " Rain " was written and produced together by Madonna and Pettibone . She had initially written the song for a musical version to be directed by Alek Keshishian based on the 1939 film , Wuthering Heights . Pettibone also sequenced , programmed , and played keyboards for the song . The recording process was <unk> by P. Dennis Mitchell and Robin Hancock , while the mixing was engineered by Goh Hotoda . Another musician involved was Tony Shimkin , who provided the drum programming . 
 " Rain " was released as the fifth single from Erotica on August 5 , 1993 . The song served as the album 's fourth single in the United States and Canada since the previous single , " Fever " , was not commercially released there . The single release featured a previously unreleased track , " Up Down Suite " , which is a 12 @-@ minute dub version of " Goodbye to Innocence " , an omitted track recorded during the Erotica sessions . This version of the single also included a Danny Saber remix of the album track " Waiting " which features a rap by Everlast . In the United Kingdom , the single included the 1986 track " Open Your Heart " which was being used in a Peugeot car commercial at the time . " Rain " was later included on Madona 's ballads compilation Something to Remember ( 1995 ) and has not appeared on any other compilation since . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Rain " is a pop ballad with influence from trip hop and new @-@ age music . Styled in adult contemporary format , the song is more " friendly " in its sound than the other singles released from Erotica . According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing , the song is written in the key note of E ♭ major . The song 's tempo is set in a moderate pace , but not too fast and has a metronome of 92 beats per minute . " Rain " begins with Madonna singing " I feel it , it 's coming " , and followed by the chord progression of E ♭ sus2 – A ♭ 6 / 9 – B ♭ sus in the chorus and later A ♭ – B ♭ – E ♭ in the verse . A dark sounding C minor string and an echoing hi @-@ hat accompanies Madonna 's vocals , which are sung in her lowest register . The song 's arrangement captures turbulent elements associated with rain ( such as thunder ) , orchestral stabs that invokes crisp lightning bolts , and a surging bridge segue driven by what sounds like electric guitar snarls . A key change happens towards the end from B ♭ major to C major , followed by two spoken parts and a harmony along side it . The coda has another melody with it , and the song ends in a group chorus without the harmonies . 
 Lyrically , Madonna compares rain with feelings of love . Just as rain washes away dirt , love washes clean the sorrows of the past , leaving a person and their lover to focus on their feelings of the present moment . Richard Harrington from The Washington Post described " Rain " as " an optimistic Peter Gabriel @-@ like ballad in which water is a metaphor for love ( ' Wash away my sorrow , take away my pain ' ) . " According to Stephen Sears from music website Idolator , " the synths turbo @-@ charge at 2 : 46 into a sleek middle eight that features dueling Madonnas reciting lines of poetry out of the left and right channels [ play it on earbuds ] . ' By sheer force of will / I 'll raise you from the ground ' , she says softly , ' And without a sound , you 'll appear and surrender to me , to love ' . " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine thought lyrically the ballads on Erotica to be primarily concerned with sex , saying that some might even view " Rain " as an extended metaphor for ejaculation , though he didn 't subscribe to that knee @-@ jerk interpretation . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Upon release , " Rain " received generally positive feedback . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called " Rain " among " Madonna 's best and most accomplished music . " Jose F. Promis from the same media credited the song in " paving the way for the " softer " Madonna to emerge in the mid- ' 90s . " Arion Berger from Rolling Stone described the song as a " yearning ballad " . Tony Power from Blender picked it as one of the stand @-@ out tracks from Erotica . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote , " Madonna 's rarely acknowledged harmonies glide atop the frosty beats , thunder @-@ claps of percussion , and skyward drone of the sonorous ' Rain ' . " Annie Zaleski from The A.V. Club stated that " Rain " established Madonna as " a sensual New Age goddess . " Stephen Holden from The New York Times described it as " one happy , open @-@ hearted love song . " While reviewing the album for Billboard , Paul Verna called the song " a lovely pop ballad . " In a separate review of the single on the magazine , Larry Flick wrote : 
 A <unk> , romantic moment from [ Madonna ] ' s sorely underappreciated Erotica opus . A slow and seductive rhyme base surrounded by cascading , sparkling synths inspires a sweet and charming vocal . Though not as lyrically daring as the previous " Bad Girl " , this is a wonderfully constructed , memorable tune that deserves as much attention ( and airplay ) as it can garner . 
 Writing for The Huffington Post , Matthew Jacobs placed the track at number 43 of his list " The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles " and felt the track was a departure from the previous " carnal " releases from Erotica ; " It 's not terribly distinctive from the other ballads Madonna released in the early ' 90s , but then there 's the sultry chorus with the uplifting lilt ' Here comes the sun ' . " Stephen Sears from music website Idolator called the song as " the album 's sole expression of pure love " , which " revisits the oceanic sonic landscape of her epic 1986 ballad " Live To Tell " . Charles Aaron from Spin wrote that the song " works a timeless , wrenching scenario : Our heroine waits on a mountaintop for love to wash away her sorrow . " Scott Kearnan from website Boston.com felt that the song is an example of " what she lacks in [ singing ] technique she 's always tried to make up for with earnestness . " He also praised her phrasing , saying that " Madonna sings like she believes in every word . " 
 Matthew Rettenmund , author of Encyclopedia Madonnica complimented the vocals on the song , calling them " elegantly layered ... and an inventive , overlapping vocal rap that makes it a standout production " . Chris Wade , author of The Music of Madonna felt that " Rain " was placed in the perfect sequence on Erotica , " to lift the album from its arguable slight drop in quality [ with previous tracks ' Waiting ' and ' Words ' ] " . Rikky Rooksby , author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna complimented the radio friendly sound of the song , but felt that the lyrics " had been used in countless songs " , rendering them incoherent . Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times criticized the song 's lyrics , saying : " Despite having crafted some of the best singles of the ' 80s , and despite being a genuine wit , Madonna can tend toward terribly banal rhymes . " Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine dismissed the song as a " slushy rewrite of that year 's ' This Used to Be My Playground ' , itself a slushy rewrite of Like a Prayer 's ' Promise to Try ' . "

 The music video for " Rain " was filmed by director Mark Romanek during May 16 – 19 , 1993 at a Santa Monica Airport hangar in Santa Monica , California . Other production crews include Krista Montagna as the producer , Harris Savides as the director of photography , Jon Peter Flack as the production designer , Robert Duffy as the editor , and David Bradshaw as the wardrobe stylist . The video was entirely shot in black and white and then hand @-@ painted with blue tones . It displays Madonna during a filming process with Ryuichi Sakamoto as a director and a group of Japanese technicians . Romanek and Madonna initially wanted to get Jean @-@ Luc Godard or Federico Fellini to play the director in the video . Romanek commented : " I came up with the basic idea of setting it in Tokyo and showing the film crew . It was very Zen , very stripped away . She was this accessible , vulnerable creature surrounded by the high @-@ tech and the global . " The director 's primary inspiration came from watching a commercial by Jean @-@ Baptiste Mondino , starring actress Catherine Deneuve . Madonna was also seen reclining on a riveted aluminium chaise lounge known as the Lockheed Lounge , designed by then unknown Marc Newson . 
 The video begins with Madonna in a studio , lying on a sofa with headphones on her ears composing a song , following a sequence in which she sings in front of a microphone , which alternates with those of her receiving instructions from the director . She then appears in front of a background of bright lights , representing the sun @-@ lit sky , and also in a scene of her kissing a man behind glass on which water falls . The video ends with an air view of open umbrellas covering the entire floor . Madonna introduced another completely new persona for the video . She wore a wig which provides " a waif @-@ like cap of short black hair with spiky bangs . " She also removed her trademark mole and got her eyebrows back , which had been virtually invisible in her previous videos . The look took inspirations from Paris in the 1940s , cabaret singer Édith Piaf and <unk> in general . Rei <unk> of Comme des <unk> provided the minimalist black clothes in the video , while the ethereal white clothes was designed by Vivienne Westwood . 
 The video premiered on June 21 , 1993 on MTV , and later won two categories for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards . It was ranked number 70 on Slant Magazine 's " 100 Greatest Music Videos " list . Sal Cinquemani from the publication called it as one of Madonna 's most beautiful music video and said , " The waterlogged clip was a simple and refreshing break from the singer 's visually sex @-@ drenched Erotica period . " He also pointed out that despite its innocent look , " it 's difficult to separate the images from the song 's double entendres . " Jef Rouner from Houston Press called the video " one of Romanek 's more light @-@ hearted and definitely the most ... purple of his work , " as well as " a fascinating treatise on the act of creating a music video itself . " Bryant Frazer from Studio Daily described it as a futuristic , overexposed look influenced by Japanese fashion imagery . " He noted that the video " pushed the boundaries of telecine work at the time . " Rettenmund called the video a " masterpiece about art and artifice " . He noted that although Romanek expressed to create a video " devoid of nostalgia " , instead the " Rain " clip " created a modern enigma [ out of Madonna ] who herself was no stranger to overexposure " . The video was later commercially available on Madonna 's video albums The Video Collection 93 : 99 ( 1999 ) and Celebration : The Video Collection ( 2009 ) .

 Madonna has only performed the song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993 . For the performance , Madonna and her back up singers , Niki Haris and Donna De Lory , appeared onstage wearing long black see @-@ through robes . Haris recalled in Lucy O 'Brien 's book Madonna : Like an Icon , " that was the first time [ on stage ] we sat down together and felt our harmonies . Madonna 's voice was starting to get strong and she was into trying new things . " During the bridge , a fragment of Motown group The Temptations ' 1971 hit " Just My Imagination ( Running Away with Me ) " , was included . In his review of the concert in New York City , The New York Times 's Jon Pareles felt that during the performance the music was reminiscent of " Motown , girl groups and James Brown . " After the song was finished , an interlude , featuring a pierrot and several dancers dressed in black outfits and holding umbrellas began . Set to an instrumental version of the song , the interlude featured a choreography partially inspired in the classic Gene Kelly musical Singin ' in the Rain . According to author Michelle Morgan , Kelly himself advised Madonna on some of the choreography . The performance on the November 19 , 1993 show at Sydney Cricket Ground was recorded and released on VHS and Laserdisc on April 26 , 1994 , as The Girlie Show : Live Down Under . 
 Fifteen years later , " Rain " was used as a video interlude for Madonna 's Sticky & Sweet Tour . The song was remixed using elements of Eurythmics ' 1984 hit " Here Comes the Rain Again " and featured the Japanese dancing duo <unk> Serve . The video featured a pixie finding shade under a petal during a rainstorm and witnessing the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly . This performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release , recorded during Madonna 's shows in Buenos Aires , Argentina , in December 2008 . In 2000 , British gothic rock band Rosetta Stone covered " Rain " for Madonna 's tribute album , Virgin Voices : A Tribute to Madonna , Vol . 2 .

 Route 52 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey . The highway runs 2 @.@ 74 mi ( 4 @.@ 41 km ) from 9th Street in Ocean City , Cape May County north to U.S. Route 9 ( New Road ) in Somers Point , Atlantic County . It is composed mostly of a series of four @-@ lane undivided bridges over Great Egg Harbor Bay from Ocean City to Somers Point known as the Howard S. Stainton Memorial Causeway , also known as the Ninth Street Bridge . The remainder of the route is a four @-@ lane undivided surface road called MacArthur Boulevard that runs from the causeway to U.S. Route 9 . This section of the route formerly included the Somers Point Circle , now a traffic light , where Route 52 intersects County Route 559 and County Route 585 . 
 Route 52 was originally designated in 1937 to run from the Somers Point Circle northwest to Mays Landing . This routing never came about and in 1953 , Route 52 was designated onto its current alignment . County Route 585 ran concurrent with the route south of the Somers Point Circle until 1971 , when it was truncated to end at the Somers Point Circle . The circle was removed in 2010 as part of the bridge reconstruction . In 2006 , construction began on the replacement of the Route 52 causeway that was built in the 1930s over the Great Egg Harbor Bay , beginning with guardrail repairs that reduced traffic to two lanes . In 2008 , the northbound lanes of the causeway were opened to traffic . Construction on the southbound lanes was completed in late 2009 . The entire project was completed in 2012 , including other improvements such as the construction of fishing piers , boat ramps , bike paths , walking trails , gateways , and a new Ocean City Visitor Center . In addition , improvements were made to MacArthur Boulevard that include the addition of a center left @-@ turn lane and the replacement of the Somers Point Circle with a traffic light . This project received $ 70 million from the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009 .

 Route 52 begins along Ninth Street in Ocean City , Cape May County , 0 @.@ 01 miles ( 0 @.@ 016 km ) south of <unk> Avenue . Past the southern terminus of Route 52 , 9th Street heads southeast and terminates at Ocean City ’ s boardwalk along the Atlantic Ocean . From the beginning of state maintenance , the route continues to the northwest as a four @-@ lane , undivided road . Immediately after beginning , Route 52 becomes the Howard S. Stainton Memorial Causeway , also known as the Ninth Street Bridge , which crosses over Great Egg Harbor Bay on a high @-@ level bridge and then the longer Rainbow Harbor Channel . In between these two channels is an island where the Ocean City Visitor Center is located . After crossing the Rainbow Harbor Channel , the road runs along another island before crossing over the Great Egg Harbor Thoroughfare ( part of the Intracoastal Waterway ) and then a ship channel on another high @-@ level bridge , where the route enters Somers Point in Atlantic County . 
 After the ship canal , Route 52 crosses onto the mainland and intersects with County Route 559 ( Mays Landing Road ) and County Route 585 ( Shore Road ) , formerly at the Somers Point traffic circle . In October 2010 , the circle was eliminated and replaced by a traffic light . Beyond the former Somers Point Circle , Route 52 becomes a two @-@ lane road known as MacArthur Boulevard that heads north through commercial areas before entering residential areas . Route 52 comes to an end at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( New Road ) , where the road continues northwest as West Laurel Drive , which heads through a residential neighborhood to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway .

 The causeway between Ocean City and Somers Point was built in the 1930s with four lanes and no shoulders . Route 52 was designated 1937 to run from the Somers Point Circle northwest to Route 48 ( now U.S. Route 40 ) and Route 50 in Mays Landing . However , Route 52 was never built to run to Mays Landing . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 52 was designated to run from the Ocean City side of the Great Egg Harbor causeway north to U.S. Route 9 in Somers Point . With the creation of the 500 @-@ series county routes in New Jersey in 1952 , County Route 585 was designated to run along Route 52 between the southern terminus and the Somers Point Circle as part of its route between Route 109 in Lower Township and U.S. Route 30 and Route 157 in Absecon . Eventually , the southern terminus of County Route 585 was truncated to the Somers Point Circle . 
 Between 2006 and 2012 , a new $ 400 million causeway was built to replace the 1930s bridges over the Great Egg Harbor Bay . The original causeway was in need of replacement due to deteriorating conditions of the bridges , increasing automobile and marine traffic on the Great Egg Harbor Bay , flooding from storms , and a high accident rate due to narrow lanes and a lack of shoulders . The causeway also contained two drawbridges , which led to traffic jams during the summer months . On January 16 , 2006 , the New Jersey Department of Transportation reduced traffic on the existing bridges from four lanes to two lanes to limit the weight on the old structures . The highway was reopened to four lanes of traffic after guardrail repairs were made on May 17 , 2006 , with a new speed limit of 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) . After years of delays , construction began on the new bridge in September 2006 . Crews began the project by clearing a staging area on <unk> Island near the Ocean City side . The northbound bridge was completed in April 2008 and the southbound bridge was completed in April 2009 . In May 2012 , construction of the causeway was completed , with all four lanes opened to traffic . 
 In addition to the new causeway , the project also called for the construction of fishing piers , boat ramps , bike paths , walking trails , and gateways at each end of the causeway , including a new visitor center with a scenic overlook on the Ocean City side . Also , other improvements were made to the MacArthur Boulevard portion of Route 52 including the addition of a center left @-@ turn lane and the replacement of the Somers Point Circle with a traffic light , which was eliminated in October 2010 . As a result of the stimulus bill signed into law by President Barack Obama on February 17 , 2009 , $ 70 million , or about 8 percent of the money allocated to New Jersey in the bill , went to the construction of the second half of the Route 52 causeway project .

 = Columbian half dollar = 
 The Columbian half dollar is a coin issued by the Bureau of the Mint in 1892 and 1893 . The first United States commemorative coin , it was issued both to raise funds for the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition and mark the <unk> of the first voyage to the Americas of Christopher Columbus , whose portrait it bears . The Columbian half dollar was the first American coin to depict a historical person . 
 The coin stems from the desire of the Columbian Exposition 's organizers to gain federal money to complete construction of the fair . Congress granted an appropriation , and allowed it to be in the form of commemorative half dollars , which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium . Fair official James Ellsworth wanted the new coin to be based on a 16th @-@ century painting he owned by Lorenzo Lotto , reputedly of Columbus , and pushed for this through the design process . When initial sketches by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber proved unsatisfactory , fair organizers turned to a design by artist Olin Levi Warner , which after modification by Barber and by his assistant , George T. Morgan , was struck by the Mint . 
 Some 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 half dollars were struck , far beyond the actual demand , and half of them were melted . The appropriation did not cure the fair 's financial woes , as fewer than 400 @,@ 000 were sold at the premium price , and some 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 were released into circulation , where they remained as late as the 1950s . The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $ 20 ; coins in near @-@ pristine state sell for about $ 1 @,@ 000 , far less than the $ 10 @,@ 000 the makers of the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck . 
 = = Exposition = = 
 In 1890 , Congress passed legislation giving federal sponsorship to an exposition to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World . The act had established a World 's Columbian Exposition Commission to oversee the fair . Leading citizens of Chicago established a World 's Columbian Exposition Company ( " the Company " ) to organize the construction , and the Company generally emerged as successful in the resulting infighting as to which group would be in charge . Had it not been for Daniel Burnham , head of the Company 's Board of Architects , the fair might never have been built . Burnham , whose favorite saying was , " Make no little plans ; they have no magic to stir men 's blood " , became the czar of the exposition 's construction . 
 An undeveloped site of 686 acres ( 278 ha ) on the shores of Lake Michigan was selected for the fairgrounds . The buildings were in the classical style , reflecting Greek and Roman influences , and were composed of a combination of plaster of paris and hemp called " staff " which resembled marble . President Benjamin Harrison invited " all the world " to take part ; many foreign countries erected buildings , and every US state and territory was represented . 
 = = Inception = = 
 Efforts to promote a commemorative coin for the exposition began around January 1892 . They were strongly advocated by the head of the Company 's Committee on Liberal Arts , James Ellsworth , who was particularly interested as he had recently purchased a 16th @-@ century painting by Lorenzo Lotto of a learned man , said to be Columbus . Ellsworth wanted the portrait to be the basis of the coin . In this , he was advised by author and journalist William <unk> Curtis , also a fair official . In April 1892 , partisans had gained the support of the Director of the Bureau of the Mint , Edward O. Leech , who envisioned a coin carrying a visage of Columbus on one side , and a suitable inscription on the other . Curtis was well aware of the difficulties with the Mint 's failed competition for new silver coins in 1891 , which had led to the issuance of the Barber coinage , designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber . The new coins were widely criticized , and Curtis counseled Ellsworth to gain control of the commemorative coin 's design process , to ensure both a better design and the use of the Lotto portrait . No United States coin had depicted an actual person , although the goddess of Liberty had often been portrayed . 
 By May 1892 , it was apparent that additional funds were needed to complete the fair 's buildings . The Company had sold stock , and the City of Chicago had issued bonds to pay for the exposition , but the construction budgets had been greatly underestimated . The Company sought a subsidy of $ 5 million from the federal government to complete the work . When a direct appropriation met congressional opposition , supporters proposed that the $ 5 million be in the form of special half dollars which could be sold as souvenirs . The United States had never struck a commemorative , and it was anticipated by organizers that the coins could be sold to the public at double their face value . The bullion would come from the melting of underweight and obsolete silver coins already held by the Treasury , so there would be no expense to the government beyond the costs of production . During the debate over the bill in the Senate , Iowa Senator William B. Allison foresaw , " they would not only be souvenirs for this day and generation but would be transmitted ... to the 200 millions that were to dwell here in the future . Children would cry for them and the old men would demand them . " But Ohio Senator John Sherman warned , " the enormous number of [ such ] half dollars would destroy their value as souvenirs " . With Congress anxious to escape the summer Washington heat , the matter was compromised and the amount cut to $ 2 @.@ 5 million , thus five million half dollars . Congress passed authorizing legislation on August 5 , 1892 . 
 In July 1892 , Curtis sent a photograph of the Lotto painting to Leech , who consulted with Barber and replied that the engraver could not work from a painting in which the subject faces forward . So Barber could depict Columbus in profile , Curtis arranged for a little @-@ known Washington , D.C. sculptor , Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar , to create a bust based on the painting at the Company 's expense ; when complete it was forwarded to Barber in Philadelphia . Barber prepared sketches based on the bust on August 15 , and presented them to Acting Mint Director Robert E. Preston ( Leech was on vacation ) , who forwarded them to fair authorities in Chicago . Ellsworth showed them to artists working on the exposition , and to the press . The artistic reaction was negative , and the newspapers suggested that the sketches resembled more a long @-@ haired professor than the celebrated mariner . This controversy , coupled with his anger from public debate over whether the painting actually was of Columbus , caused Ellsworth to refuse permission for his painting to be used . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Even before the appearance of Barber 's sketches , other designs were being considered for the half dollar . Artist Frank Millet proposed to the fair 's Director of Decorations , Olin Warner , in early August , that Warner design the coin . Warner modeled one depicting a profile of Columbus , not based on the Lotto portrait . His reverse showed a caravel ship , symbolizing the Santa María , Columbus 's flagship , above two globes representing the hemispheres , though they lacked the continental outlines . Warner 's proposal was praised by artists working on their sculptures at the fairgrounds . Leech also weighed in once he returned from vacation on August 26 , sending fair organizers a woodcut engraving based on the official Spanish medal for the 400th anniversary of Columbus ' first voyage , and arranging with the State Department for the American Embassy in Madrid to get one . A medal was duly obtained and was subsequently placed in the Mint 's collection . 
 The Mint was willing to defer to the Company on the design ( Ellsworth withdrew his threat not to allow his painting to be used by the end of August ) , but the Company 's Finance Committee was unable to reach a decision on what design to use . Warner returned to work on the badges to be worn by the fair 's directors at the dedication ceremony in October — the fair itself would not open to the public until May 1893 . These badges included a round disk with a portrait of Columbus in high relief based on the Lotto portrait , and when one was displayed it was immediately spoken of as a possible basis for the half dollar . The Company also considered a design with three ships , and another with a single ship and a depiction of the Western Hemisphere , both provided by the Mint . Contemporary accounts also mention a reverse design considered by the Company which depicted a building at the Exposition . 
 Tiring of the back and forth , fair leaders demanded a meeting with Mint officials to settle the matter of the design . The Company was in severe financial straits , and money from the sale of the coins was needed . Leech agreed to send Barber to Chicago , where he met with the Finance Committee on September 23 , 1892 . It was agreed that the obverse would be based on the badges , and the reverse on Warner 's caravel concept . 
 The badge lacked the inscriptions required for coins ; to accommodate them , Barber shrank the design , surrounding it with letters . The ship on the reverse did not have sufficient detail in Warner 's version ; Barber requested a photograph of the caravel to be exhibited at the fair from Ellsworth , then turned the reverse over to his assistant , George T. Morgan . The chief engraver had discerned Ellsworth 's desire to have the Lotto portrait used , and several times in October wrote warmly to him , <unk> him of progress . By October 17 , Barber had completed test dies ; by the 31st , trial strikes were made and Barber informed Ellsworth that Leech had pronounced them the best @-@ looking coins ever struck by the Mint . The Mint Director had micromanaged the fine @-@ tuning of the designs for the Barber coinage the previous year ; this time he did not intervene , and departed on November 9 for a monetary conference in Brussels . 
 On November 11 , Barber sent Ellsworth cardboard impressions of the latest versions of the coin ; Ellsworth expressed pleasure at their appearance . The chief engraver made final adjustments directly to the master die , rather than modifying a larger model to be placed in a reducing lathe . This <unk> was the technique his father and predecessor as chief engraver had used ; it was also the way Charles Barber preferred to work . Barber added his monogram " B " to the design ; it is on the cut @-@ off of the bust above the letter B in " Columbian " , while Morgan 's " M " is hidden in the rigging of the ship on the reverse .

 The Chicago Tribune described the scene as the first Columbian half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint on November 19 , 1892 : 
 James W. Ellsworth of the World 's Fair Commission represented [ the Company ] ... Over 2 @,@ 000 of the souvenirs were struck today , and the work will continue until all of the 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 donated by Congress are completed ... Unfortunately , the first attempt was a failure — a little flaw caused the coin 's rejection ... Again the coin was lifted from the face of the steel die and critically examined by [ Philadelphia Mint Chief ] Coiner [ William S. ] Steele , Engraver Barber , and [ Philadelphia Mint ] Sup [ <unk> ] t [ Oliver ] Bosbyshell . Every line was sharply defined , and the strong features of the discoverer of America , which adorn the coin , seemed to look approvingly on the work . 
 Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen , in their encyclopedia of early commemoratives , suggested that the " flawed " first specimen was not destroyed , but was given to Ellsworth , a noted coin collector who possessed rarities such as the Brasher doubloon and two specimens of the 1804 dollar . They deemed it unlikely that experienced Mint workers would have selected a flawed planchet to use in the first strike , and that Ellsworth obtained the piece with Bosbyshell 's agreement . 
 On December 15 , the Mint shipped five kegs of the new coins , each holding 10 @,@ 000 pieces , to Chicago . Each keg held five bags with a thousand coins each , though in one keg , one bag was intentionally short four coins , as also in that keg was a cigar box containing four envelopes , with coins number 1 , 400 , 1492 , and 1892 from the first day of production . The kegs were taken to the Chicago Sub @-@ Treasury , and on December 19 at 1 : 00 pm conveyed to Room 404 of the Rand McNally Building , the exposition 's headquarters . There , Harlow N. Higinbotham , president of the Exposition Company , took mallet and chisel in hand and opened the keg , removing the cigar box . Placing three of the envelopes in his pocket , he displayed the first coin to the assembled crowd , then exchanged it for a check — Wyckoff , Seamans & Benedict ( later the Remington Typewriter Company and makers of the official typewriter of the fair ) , was purchasing the first coin struck for $ 10 @,@ 000 as a publicity stunt . That coin was donated to the newly established Columbian Museum ( today the Field Museum ) . The Company immediately put the pieces on sale for $ 1 each , and the first shipment was soon all sold to those who lined up to buy them , had ordered them by mail , or had purchased them at local banks that were given allocations . No official packaging was provided ; the pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks . 
 Much of the press coverage at the time focused on the fact that half dollars would be sold for twice face value . The Colorado Sun commented , " The World 's Fair people count upon making a good thing by selling their five million souvenir half dollars at premium . The Chicago propensity for speculating in futures cannot be restrained . " The Philadelphia Call concurred , " Perhaps the proposition to sell the 50 ¢ souvenirs at the World 's Fair for $ 1 is an evidence of what visitors to Chicago may expect in the general increase in prices . " The design was also a source of comment . The Philadelphia Ledger suggested , " If it were not known in advance whose vignette adorns the Columbian souvenir half dollar , the average observer would be undecided as to whether it is intended to represent Daniel Webster or Henry Ward Beecher . " The Boston Globe noted , " The first view of the new Columbian souvenir coin inevitably leads to expression of regret that Columbus wasn 't a better looking man . " The Galveston Daily News opined of the new half dollars : 
 The front side of the coin has an elegant likeness of the late Sitting Bull . This , however , is said to be meant for Columbus ... There is also a likeness of Columbus ' ship under full sail . At first blush the ship seems to be on wheels , but closer examination shows that the two wheels are the eastern and western hemispheres . The ship seems to be surrounded by a herd of porpoises , but probably this is meant for waves . There is also a fishing pole rigged out of an after port in the cabin of the ship , and one gathers an idea that the venturesome mariner is either baiting his hook and lying about a bite he has just had , or has hauled in a fish , for the line is taken aboard ship . The figures 1492 appear beneath the vessel . The coin is of the same size and weight as the old run of half dollars , and for all they are sold at a heavy premium , the purchasing power is but ten [ nickel ] beers .

 Ellsworth clipped one article criticizing the new coin and sent it to both Barber and Warner . Barber responded angrily with a five @-@ page rebuttal , and suggesting that the Chicago newspapers not print " the opinions of people who display a deplorable amount of ignorance and likewise seem inclined to say ' Stinking Fish ' " . Warner reacted with resignation , stating that he had not yet seen the new coin " but I 'll wager it doesn 't look like the model " . A major objection by critics was that Barber had lowered the relief of Warner 's badge to ensure the new coins met the standards of circulating coins and could stack properly ; critics saw this as unnecessary as the coins were to be merely souvenirs , unlikely to enter circulation . 
 A number of proof coins were issued at the suggestion of Barber and Superintendent Bosbyshell . Ellsworth was enthusiastic , intending the special strikes as gifts , but was forced to share them with Company president Higinbotham , to Ellsworth 's dismay . The proof coins for the year 1892 represented the first hundred coins struck , as well as numbers 400 , 1492 , and 1892 . The total number of proof coins struck for 1893 is less certain : R.S. Yeoman 's A Guide Book of United States Coins states that approximately 100 proofs were struck for 1893 , but numismatist Ira Goldberg in a 2011 article gives the number as fewer than ten . The first coin struck in the year 1893 , in proof , is in the possession of the Chicago Historical Society . The Mint gave consideration to including the Columbian half dollar in proof sets , but at the time it sold proof coins for only a few cents above face value , and it would have to sell the proof Columbians for more than $ 1 so as to avoid devaluing the uncirculated commemoratives . Mint authorities decided against a public sale of proof Columbians . 
 With the New Year , the coins were dated 1893 ; just over four million of the authorized mintage were struck with an 1893 date , with the remainder dated 1892 . A total of 5 @,@ 002 @,@ 105 Columbian half dollars were struck , with the excess over the authorized mintage designated for inspection by the annual Assay Commission . By February 1893 , sales had fallen off dramatically . The Exposition Company deposited 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 half dollars in Chicago banks as security for loans . In March , Congress impounded an additional 1 @,@ 141 @,@ 700 half dollars to cover costs advanced by the government , such as the expense of judging exhibits and providing medals to the exhibitors . The Company could redeem the half dollars if it agreed to fund that expense , which it refused to do , calling the government 's action a breach of faith . In return , the Company stated it was no longer bound by a provision of the 1892 act , which forbade the fair from opening on Sundays . 
 Sales during the fair itself were promoted by such stunts as constructing a model of the Washington , D.C. Treasury Building out of the new half dollars , 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) long and 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) high . These coins were available for purchase , but could not be claimed until after the fair closed . In June 1893 , fair authorities had half dollars stacked as a model of the Washington Monument , 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) tall . When the fair closed in October , large quantities of the half dollar remained in the hands of exposition organizers , the Treasury , and the Chicago banks — only 358 @,@ 645 were sold to the public at the $ 1 price . 
 With the fair closed , the question remained what to do with the some 4 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 half dollars which had not been sold . Organizers did not wish them to be issued , to preserve the premium price paid by purchasers . Those remaining in the Company 's hands were redeemed by the Mint , which melted them ; the fee for this service was forgiven by act of Congress . The coins which had been impounded by the Treasury were offered for sale at face value beginning in October 1894 ; when there were few takers , they were released into circulation . A million coins held by the Chicago banks were also placed in circulation . Although 2 @,@ 501 @,@ 700 half dollars were melted ( all dated 1893 ) , this still left a like number of Columbians in public hands . Coin dealer and numismatic historian Q. David Bowers recalls that when he began collecting coins as a boy in the 1950s , the Columbians were among the most common 19th @-@ century pieces remaining in circulation . It was not until the 1930s that the pieces , in uncirculated condition , commanded the original price of $ 1 . Prices began to rise as silver coins were replaced by base metal ones in the 1960s . In the 2012 version of Yeoman 's catalog , both pieces are listed at under $ 20 in almost uncirculated ( AU @-@ 50 ) condition , with specimens in near @-@ pristine MS @-@ 66 selling for over a thousand dollars . 
 One reason for the lack of sales , and for the poor condition of many surviving specimens , was that while the fair was open , the economic Panic of 1893 began , one of the worst depressions in the nation 's history — fifty cents could make the difference between a family eating or starving at a time when the average visitor to the fair spent $ 1 @.@ 18 . <unk> were disinclined to exchange a dollar for a fifty @-@ cent piece , and those who had bought before the crash often spent their souvenirs . 
 = Typhoon Nabi = 
 Typhoon Nabi , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Jolina , was a powerful typhoon that struck southwestern Japan in September 2005 . The 14th named storm of the 2005 Pacific typhoon season , Nabi formed on August 29 to the east of the Northern Mariana Islands . It moved westward and passed about 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of Saipan on August 31 as an intensifying typhoon . On the next day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to super typhoon status , with winds equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The Japan Meteorological Agency estimated peak ten @-@ minute winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) on September 2 . Nabi weakened while curving to the north , striking the Japanese island of Kyushu on September 6 . After brushing South Korea , the storm turned to the northeast , passing over Hokkaido before becoming extratropical on September 8 . 
 The typhoon first affected the Northern Marianas Islands , where it left US $ 2 @.@ 5 million in damage , while damaging or destroying 114 homes . The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government . While passing near Okinawa , Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage . Later , the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan , South Korea , and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US $ 115 @.@ 4 million in damage . About 250 @,@ 000 people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm , and there were disruptions to train , ferry , and airline services . In Kyushu , the storm left ¥ 4 @.@ 08 billion ( US $ 36 @.@ 9 million ) in crop damage after dropping 1 @,@ 322 mm ( 52 @.@ 0 in ) of rain over three days . During the storm 's passage , there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi 's precipitation . The rains caused flooding and landslides , forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close . Across Japan , Nabi killed 29 people and caused ¥ 94 @.@ 9 billion ( US $ 854 million ) in damage . Soldiers , local governments , and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage . After affecting Japan , the typhoon affected the Kuril Islands of Russia , where it dropped the equivalent of the monthly precipitation , while also causing road damage due to high waves . Overall , Nabi killed 35 people , and its effects were significant enough for the name to be retired .

 On August 28 , a large area of convection persisted about 1 @,@ 035 km ( 645 mi ) east of Guam . Located within an area of moderate wind shear , the system quickly organized while moving westward , its track influenced by a ridge to the north . At 00 : 00 UTC on August 29 , a tropical depression formed from the system , classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) as Tropical Depression 14W . In initial forecasts , the agency anticipated steady strengthening , due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area . At 12 : 00 UTC on August 29 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) upgraded it to a tropical storm . As such , the JMA named the storm Nabi . About 12 hours later , the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a severe tropical storm , after the convection organized into spiral rainbands . At 18 : 00 UTC , Nabi intensified to typhoon status , reaching ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . 
 On August 31 , Nabi passed about 55 km ( 35 mi ) north @-@ northeast of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands during its closest approach . The typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west @-@ northwest . On September 1 , the JTWC upgraded the storm to a super typhoon and later estimated peak one @-@ minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) ; this is the equivalent of a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . By contrast , the JMA estimated peak ten @-@ minute winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) on September 2 , with a barometric pressure of 925 mbar ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) . While at peak intensity , the typhoon developed a large 95 km ( 60 mi ) wide eye . For about 36 hours , Nabi maintained its peak winds , during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of PAGASA ; the Philippine @-@ based agency gave it the local name " Jolina " , although the storm remained away from the country . 
 On September 3 , Nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north , the result of an approaching trough weakening the ridge . Later that day , the winds leveled off at 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , according to the JMA . On September 5 , Nabi passed near <unk> and Yakushima , part of the Daitō and Ōsumi island groups offshore southern Japan . Around that time , the JTWC estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) . After turning due north , Nabi made landfall near Isahaya , Nagasaki around 05 : 00 UTC on September 6 , after passing through the Izumi District of Kagoshima . Shortly thereafter , the storm entered the Sea of Japan . The typhoon turned to the northeast into the mid @-@ latitude flow , influenced by a low over the Kamchatka Peninsula . At 18 : 00 UTC on September 6 , the JTWC discontinued advisories on Nabi , declaring it extratropical , although the JMA continued tracking the storm . On the next day , Nabi moved across northern Hokkaido into the Sea of Okhotsk . The JMA declared the storm as extratropical on September 8 , which continued eastward until dissipating on September 10 south of the Aleutian Islands . The remnants of Nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern Alaska on September 12 .

 After Nabi formed as a tropical depression on August 29 , the local National Weather Service office on Guam issued a tropical storm watch for the islands Tinian , Rota , Sapian , and Agrihan . On August 30 , the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for Rota and Agrihan , while a typhoon warning was issued for Tinian and Saipan . On all four islands , a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared . The government of the Northern Mariana Islands advised Tinian and Saipan residents along the coast and in poorly @-@ built buildings to evacuate , and several schools operated as shelters . About 700 people evacuated on Saipan , and the airport was closed , stranding about 1 @,@ 000 travelers . As a precaution , schools were closed on Guam on August 31 , after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior . The island 's governor , Felix Perez Camacho , also declared a condition of readiness 2 , as well as a state of emergency . Due to the typhoon , several flights were canceled or delayed at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam . 
 Ahead of the storm , United States Forces Japan evacuated planes from Okinawa to either Guam or mainland Japan to prevent damage . Officials at the military bases on Okinawa advised residents to remain inside during the storm 's passage . While Nabi was turning to the north , the island was placed under a Condition of Readiness 2 . At the military base in Sasebo , ships also evacuated , and several buildings were closed after a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared . 
 In Kyushu , officials evacuated over a quarter of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan . These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides . The first order during the storm took place in the <unk> district . In Miyazaki City , 21 @,@ 483 households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river . Another 10 @,@ 000 residences were vacated in Nobeoka following similar reports . The entirety of the West Japan Railway Company was shut down . Canceled train services affected 77 @,@ 800 people on Shikoku . Ferry service was also shut down , cutting off transportation for tens of thousands of people . In addition , at least 723 flights were cancelled because of the storm . Japan 's second @-@ largest refinery , <unk> <unk> , stopped shipments to other refineries across the area , and Japan 's largest refinery , Nippon Oil , stopped all sea shipments . The Cosmo Oil Company , Japan 's fourth largest refinery , stopped all shipments to Yokkaichi and Sakaide refineries . About 700 schools in the country were closed . Approximately 1 @,@ 500 soldiers were dispatched to Tokyo to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi 's arrival , and to clean up after the storm . Officials in the Miyazaki Prefecture issued a flood warning for expected heavy rains in the area . 
 In South Korea , the government issued a typhoon warning for the southern portion of the country along the coast , prompting the airport at Pohang to close , and forcing 162 flights to be canceled . Ferry service was also disrupted , and thousands of boats returned to port . The storm also prompted 138 schools to close in the region . Earlier , the storm spurred fears of a possible repeat of either typhoon Rusa in 2002 or Maemi in 2003 , both of which were devastating storms in South Korea . Officials in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning for Vladivostok , advising boats to remain at port .

 While passing between Saipan and the volcanic island of Anatahan , Nabi brought tropical storm force winds to several islands in the Northern Mariana Islands . Saipan International Airport reported sustained winds of 95 km / h ( 59 mph ) , with gusts to 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Also on the island , Nabi produced 173 mm ( 6 @.@ 82 in ) of rainfall . The storm destroyed two houses and left 26 others uninhabitable , while 77 homes sustained minor damage , largely from flooding or roof damage . Nabi damaged 70 – 80 % of the crops on Saipan and also knocked down many trees , leaving behind 544 tonnes ( 600 tons ) of debris . The entire island was left without power , some without water , after the storm . On Tinian to the south , Nabi damaged or destroyed nine homes , with heavy crop damage . On Rota , there was minor flooding and scattered power outages . Farther south , the outer reaches of the storm produced sustained winds of 69 km / h ( 43 mph ) at Apra Harbor on Guam , while gusts peaked at 101 km / h ( 63 mph ) at <unk> . Gusts reached 72 km / h ( 45 mph ) at the international airport on Guam , the highest during 2005 . The storm dropped 115 mm ( 4 @.@ 53 in ) of rainfall in 24 hours on the island . Flooding covered roads for several hours and entered classrooms at <unk> Middle School , forcing hundreds of students to evacuate . Damage in the region was estimated US $ 2 @.@ 5 million . After Nabi exited the region , it produced high surf for several days on Guam and Saipan . 
 Later in its duration , Nabi brushed southeastern South Korea with rainbands . Ulsan recorded a 24 ‑ hour rainfall total of 319 mm ( 12 @.@ 6 in ) , while Pohang recorded a record 24 ‑ hour total of 540 @.@ 5 mm ( 21 @.@ 28 in ) . The highest total was 622 @.@ 5 mm ( 24 @.@ 5 in ) of rainfall . The periphery of the storm produced gusts of 121 km / h ( 75 mph ) in the port city of Busan , strong enough to damage eight billboards and knock trees over . Heavy rains caused several traffic accidents and injuries in Busan , while strong waves washed a cargo ship ashore in Pohang . Throughout South Korea , the storm led to six fatalities and caused US $ 115 @.@ 4 million in damages . 
 In the Kuril Islands of Russia , Nabi dropped about 75 mm ( 3 in ) of rain , equivalent to the monthly average . Gusts reached 83 km / h ( 51 mph ) , weak enough not to cause major damage . During the storm 's passage , high waves washed away unpaved roads in Severo @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = Japan = = = 
 The outer rainbands of Nabi began affecting Okinawa on September 3 . The storm 's strongest winds ended up bypassing the island , and wind gusts peaked at 85 km / h ( 53 mph ) . Two elderly women were injured from the wind gusts . There were minor power outages and some houses were damaged . In the Amami Islands between Okinawa and mainland Japan , Nabi produced gusts of 122 km / h ( 76 mph ) in Kikaijima . Waves of 9 m ( 30 ft ) in height affected Amami Ōshima . 
 While moving through western Japan , Nabi dropped heavy rainfall that totaled 1 @,@ 322 mm ( 52 @.@ 0 in ) over a three @-@ day period in Miyazaki Prefecture , the equivalent to nearly three times the average annual precipitation . The same station in Miyazaki reported a 24 ‑ hour rainfall total of 932 mm ( 36 @.@ 7 in ) , as well as an hourly total of 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) . Within the main islands of Japan , Nabi dropped 228 @.@ 6 mm ( 9 in ) of rainfall per hour in the capital Tokyo . 
 During the storm 's passage , there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi 's precipitation across Japan . The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood . The amount of sediment displaced by the rains was estimated at 4 @,@ 456 m3 / km2 , over four times the yearly average . A total of 630 m3 ( 2 @,@ 066 ft3 ) of driftwood was recorded . However , the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures . In addition to the heavy rainfall , Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland , peaking at 115 km / h ( 72 mph ) in Muroto . A station on <unk> in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119 km / h ( 74 mph ) . The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki , which damaged several buildings . In <unk> , Ishikawa , Nabi produced a Foehn wind , causing temperatures to rise quickly . 
 Throughout Japan , Nabi caused damage in 31 of the 47 prefectures , leaving over 270 @,@ 000 residences without power . Torrential rains caused flooding and landslides throughout the country . The storm destroyed 7 @,@ 452 houses and flooded 21 @,@ 160 others . Several car assembly plants were damaged in southwestern Japan , while others were closed due to power outages , such as Toyota , Mazda , and Mitsubishi . In addition , the storm wrecked about 81 ships along the coast . On the island of Kyushu , damage in Ōita Prefecture on Kyushu reached ¥ 11 @.@ 7 billion ( US $ 106 million ) , the fifth highest of any typhoon in the preceding 10 years ; about 20 % of the total there was related to road damages . In nearby Saga Prefecture , crop damage totaled about ¥ 1 @.@ 06 billion ( US $ 9 @.@ 6 million ) , mostly to rice but also to soybeans and various other vegetables . Crop damage as a whole on Kyushu totaled ¥ 4 @.@ 08 billion ( US $ 36 @.@ 9 million ) . 
 In the capital city of Tokyo , heavy rainfall increased levels along several rivers , which inundated several houses . Strong winds damaged ¥ 28 @.@ 8 million ( US $ 259 @,@ 000 ) in crop damage in Gifu Prefecture , and ¥ 27 @.@ 1 million ( US $ 244 @,@ 000 ) in crop damage in Osaka . In Yamaguchi Prefecture on western Honshu , Nabi damaged a portion of the historical <unk> Bridge , originally built in 1674 . In Yamagata Prefecture , the winds damaged a window in a school , injuring several boys from the debris . One person was seriously injured in Kitakata , Fukushima after strong winds blew a worker from scaffolding of a building under construction . Effects from Nabi spread as far north as Hokkaido , where heavy rainfall damaged roads and caused hundreds of schools to close . In <unk> , an overflown river flooded a hotel , and a minor power outage occurred in <unk> . 
 Ahead of the storm , high waves and gusty winds led to one drowning when a woman was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu , Kagawa . A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes , killing three people . A man who was listed as missing was found dead in a flooded rice field . In Tarumi , a landslide buried a home in mud , killing two people . Nabi caused a portion of the San 'yō Expressway to collapse in Yamaguchi Prefecture , killing three people . In Fukui Prefecture , the winds knocked an elderly man off a bicycle , killing him . Overall , Nabi killed 29 people in Japan and injured 179 others , 45 of them severely . Damage was estimated at ¥ 94 @.@ 9 billion ( US $ 854 million ) .

 After the storm , members of Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni provided $ 2 @,@ 500 to the town of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief . Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest , after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines . The local government of <unk> distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses . Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country . Following the storm , the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥ 58 @.@ 8 billion ( US $ 53 million ) , the tenth @-@ highest for any natural disaster in the country . Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥ 12 @.@ 6 billion ( US $ 11 @.@ 4 million ) . The total was split between ¥ 49 billion ( US $ 44 million ) in housing claims and ¥ 7 @.@ 9 billion ( US $ 71 million ) in car claims . The Japanese government provided food , water , and rescue workers to the affected areas in the days after the storm , along with Japan Post , the local post system ; trucks were mobilized to affected towns , accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent . 
 On November 8 , nearly two months after the dissipation of Typhoon Nabi , President George W. Bush declared a major disaster declaration for the Northern Mariana islands . The declaration allocated aid from the United States to help restore damaged buildings , pay for debris removal , and other emergency services . Federal funding was also made available on a cost @-@ sharing basis for the islands to mitigate against future disasters . The government ultimately provided $ 1 @,@ 046 @,@ 074 @.@ 03 to the commonwealth . 
 Due to the damage of the storm in Japan , the Typhoon Committee of the World Meteorological Organization agreed to retire the name Nabi . The agency replaced it with the name <unk> , effective January 1 , 2007 . 
 = Temple of Garni = 
 The Temple of Garni ( Armenian : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> het ’ <unk> <unk> , lit . " pagan temple of Garni " ) is a classical Hellenistic temple in Garni , Armenia . It is perhaps the best @-@ known structure and symbol of pre @-@ Christian Armenia . It was probably built by king Tiridates I in the first century AD as a temple to the sun god Mihr . 
 After Armenia 's conversion to Christianity in the early fourth century , it was converted into a royal summer house of Khosrovidukht , the sister of Tiridates III . According to some scholars it was not a temple but a tomb and thus survived the universal destruction of pagan structures . It collapsed in a 1679 earthquake . Renewed interest in the 19th century led to excavations at the site in mid @-@ 20th century and its eventual reconstruction between 1969 and 1975 . It is the only known Greco @-@ Roman colonnaded building in Armenia and the only standing such building in the former Soviet Union . It is one of the main tourist attractions in Armenia and the central shrine of Armenian neopaganism . 
 = = Location = = 
 The temple is at the edge of a triangular cliff and is part of the fortress of Garni ( Armenian : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) . One of the oldest fortresses in Armenia , it is mentioned as <unk> in the first @-@ century Annals of Tacitus . The site is near the village of Garni , in Armenia 's <unk> Province and is officially known as the Garni Historical and Cultural Museum Reserve ( Armenian : « <unk> » <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , which includes the temple , a bath complex , a royal summer palace , the seventh century church of St. Sion and other minor items ( e.g. , medieval khachkars ) . In total , the list of intangible historical and cultural monuments approved by the government of Armenia includes 11 items . It occupies 3 @.@ 5 hectares ( 8 @.@ 6 acres ) and is supervised by the Service for the Protection of Historical Environment and Cultural Museum Reservations , an agency attached to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Armenia . 
 = = History = = 
 The precise construction date of the temple is unknown and is subject to debate . The dominant view is that it was built in 77 AD , during the eleventh year of the reign of king Tiridates I. In 1945 the painter Martiros Saryan discovered a Greek inscription , which named Tiridates the Sun ( Helios ) as the founder of the temple . The inscription , which probably came from the fortress wall of Garni and not the actual temple , is damaged and various readings are possible . One reading and translation is : 
 Early medieval historian Movses Khorenatsi attributed the inscription to Tiridates III . Most scholars now attribute the inscription to Tiridates I. Considering that the inscription says the temple was built in the eleventh year of reign of Tiridates I , the temple is believed to have been completed in 77 AD . This date was proposed by Alexander Sahinian and has since gained general acceptance in Armenia . The date is primarily linked to the visit of Tiridates I to Rome in 66 AD , where he was crowned by Roman emperor Nero . To rebuilt the city of Artaxata ( Artashat ) , destroyed by the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo , Nero gave Tiridates 50 million drachmas and provided him with Roman craftsmen . Upon his return to Armenia Tiridates began a major project of reconstruction , which included rebuilding the fortified city of Garni . It is during this period that the temple is thought to have been built . The temple is believed to have been dedicated to Mihr , the sun god in the Zoroastrian @-@ influenced Armenian mythology and the equivalent of Mithra . Tiridates , like other Armenian monarchs , considered Mihr their patron . Some scholars have argued that the historical context during which the temple was built , i.e. after returning from Rome as king , it is natural that Tiridates dedicated the temple to his patron god . James R. Russells finds the view of the structure being a temple of Mihr baseless . Russell is also sceptical that the inscription refers to the temple . 
 According to a different interpretation of the extant literary <unk> and the evidence provided by coinage , the erection of the temple started in 115 AD . The pretext for its construction would have been the declaration of Armenia as a Roman province and the temple would have housed the imperial effigy of Trajan . 
 A newer alternative theory proposed by Wilkinson ( 1982 ) suggests that the building is a tomb , probably constructed circa 175 AD . This theory is based on a comparison to Graeco @-@ Roman buildings of western Asia Minor ( e.g. Nereid Monument , <unk> Mausoleum , Mausoleum at Halicarnassus ) , the discovery of nearby graves that date to about that time , the discovery of a few marble pieces of the Asiatic sarcophagus style , and other arguments such as the unlikelihood that a pagan temple would survive destruction during Armenia 's conversion to Christianity when all other such temples were destroyed . It might have been the tomb of an Armeno @-@ Roman ruler such as Sohaemus or possibly Aurelius Pacorus ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 In the early fourth century when Armenian King Tiridates III adopted Christianity as a state religion virtually all known pagan places of worship were destroyed . The Temple of Garni is the only pagan and Hellenistic structure to have survived the widespread destruction . It remains unknown why the temple was exempted from destruction , but philosopher Grigor <unk> argues that its status as a " masterpiece of art " possibly saved it from destruction . He suggests that the temple was perceived to be a " quintessence of an entire culture . " Robert H. Hewsen suggested that the reason why it was not destroyed is because it was not a temple , but a tomb of a Roman @-@ appointed king of Armenia . He also noted that in the seventh century a church was built immediately next to it and not in its place . 
 According to Movses Khorenatsi the temple was at the time converted into the summer house of Khosrovidukht , the sister of Tiridates III . As its purpose changed the temple underwent some changes . The sacrificial altars in the outside of the temple and the cult statue in the cella were removed . The opening in the roof for skylight was closed . The stone structures for removal of water from the roof were also removed , while the entrance of the temple was transformed and adjusted for residence . Almost nothing is known about the subsequent history of the temple . 
 = = = Destruction and reconstruction = = = 
 The entire colonnade of the temple collapsed in a devastating June 4 , 1679 earthquake , the epicenter of which was , according to many scholars , located in gorge of Garni . Most of the original building blocks remained scattered at the site , allowing the building to be reconstructed . 
 European travelers mentioned the temple in their works as early as the 17th century . Jean Chardin ( 1673 , who visited Armenia before the earthquake ) and James Morier ( 1810s ) both incorrectly described it through local informants since they never actually visited the site . Upon Robert Ker Porter 's visit the fortress was called " Takht @-@ i Tiridates " ( " Throne of Tiridates " ) by the locals . Ker Porter described what he saw as follows : " a confused pile beautiful fragments ; columns , architraves , capitals , friezes , all mingled together in broken disorder . " Another European to visit and document the ruins of the temple was Dubois de <unk> , who referred to the fortress as " Takh <unk> " . In his 1839 book he proposed a reconstruction plan . 
 The first known proposal to reconstruct the temple was made by the archaeologist Aleksey Uvarov at the fifth All @-@ Russian Archaeological Congress in 1880 . He proposed its stones be moved to Tiflis ( in Georgia ) and be reconstructed there according to de <unk> 's plan . Lori <unk> suggests that the plan " could be read as an attempt at co @-@ opting Armenia 's Roman past to the glory of Russia through the relocation of its most iconic monument to the nearest administrative center . " The governor of Erivan , citing technical difficulties , did not implement the plan . 
 In the subsequent decades scholars such as <unk> <unk> , Babken <unk> , and Nikolay <unk> studied the temple . In 1909 – 11 , during an excavation led by Nicholas Marr , the temple ruins were uncovered . <unk> sought to reconstruct the temple in the 1930s . 
 In 1949 the Armenian Academy of Sciences began major excavations of the Garni fortress site led by Babken <unk> . Architectural historian Alexander Sahinian focused on the temple itself . It was not until almost twenty years later , on December 10 , 1968 , that the Soviet Armenian government approved the reconstruction plan of the temple . A group led by Sahinian began reconstruction works in January 1969 . It was completed by 1975 , almost 300 years after it was destroyed in an earthquake . The temple was almost entirely rebuilt using its original stones , except the missing pieces which were filled with blank stones intended to be easily recognisable . In 1978 a monument dedicated to Sahinian was erected not far from the temple .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 The temple follows the style of classical Ancient Greek architecture which began developing in the seventh century BC . Scholars have variously described the structure as Greek , Roman or Greco @-@ Roman and have usually linked it to Hellenistic art , often pointing out its distinct features and local Armenian influence . Some scholars have emphasized the Armenian influence on its architecture , calling it " Armenian @-@ Hellenic " ( Sahinian ) , while others have completely dismissed this view , calling it a " foreign structure on Armenian soil " . Toros <unk> , for instance , stressed the singularity of the temple as a Roman @-@ style building on the Armenian Highlands and " remarked that the Garni construction essentially had no influence on contemporary or subsequent Armenian architecture . " Sahinian , on the other hand , called it a " product of the architectural @-@ constructional art of the Hellenistic period " that entirely resembles the 9th century BC <unk> <unk> temple . 
 More specifically , it is a <unk> ( a temple surrounded by a portico with columns ) built on an elevated podium . It is constructed of grey basalt quarried locally . The temple is composed of a portico ( pronaos ) and a cella ( naos ) . The temple is supported by a total of twenty @-@ four 6 @.@ 54 @-@ metre ( 21 @.@ 5 ft ) high columns of the Ionic order : six in the front and back and eight on the sides ( the corner columns are listed twice ) . Based on a comparative analysis Sahinian proposed that the columns of the temple of Garni have their origins in Asia Minor .

 The triangular pediment depicts sculptures of plants and geometrical figures . The staircase has nine unusually high steps — 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) high , about twice as high as the average height of stairs . <unk> suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending the staircase to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar . On the both sides of the staircase there are roughly square pedestals . Atlas , the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth , is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders . It is assumed that , originally , pedestals held up altars ( sacrificial tables ) . 
 The exterior of the temple is richly decorated . The frieze depicts a continuous line of acanthus . Furthermore , there are ornaments on the capital , architrave , and <unk> . The stones in the front cornice have projecting sculptures of lion heads . A fragment of the architrave bearing a lion head was removed by Captain J Buchan Telfer in the late nineteenth century and bequeathed by him to the British Museum in 1907 .

Due to the relatively small size of the cella , it has been proposed that a statue once stood inside and the ceremonies were held in the outside . Furthermore , white marble sculptures of bull hooves have been discovered some 20 metres ( 66 ft ) from the temple which could possibly be the remains of a sculpture of the god Mihr , who was often portrayed in a fight with a bull . 
 The cella is lit from two sources : the disproportionately large entrance of 2 @.@ 29 by 4 @.@ 68 metres ( 7 ft 6 in by 15 ft 4 in ) and the opening in the roof of 1 @.@ 74 by 1 @.@ 26 metres ( 5 @.@ 7 by 4 @.@ 1 ft ) .

 The temple of Garni , along with the nearby medieval monastery of Geghard , is one of the main tourist attraction sites in Armenia . Most people visiting Garni also visit Geghard . The two sites are often collectively known as Garni @-@ Geghard ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) . In 2013 some 200 @,@ 000 people visited the temple . In recent years many notable individuals have visited the temple , such as Cypriot President <unk> <unk> , Polish First Lady Anna <unk> , Austrian President Heinz Fischer , Spanish opera singer Montserrat Caballé , Greek President <unk> <unk> , American TV personalities Khloé and Kim Kardashian , American keyboardist Derek Sherinian , American comedian Conan O 'Brien .

 = Garage rock = 
 Garage rock is a raw and energetic style of rock and roll that flourished in the mid @-@ 1960s , most notably in the United States and Canada but also elsewhere . At the time it had no specific name and was not recognized as a separate genre , but critical recognition in the early 1970s , and the particularly release of the 1972 compilation album Nuggets did much to define and memorialize the style . The term derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage , though many were professional . The phrase garage band is often used to refer to musical acts in this genre . 
 The style , a precursor to psychedelic rock , is often characterized by aggressive and unsophisticated lyrics and delivery , sometimes using guitars distorted through a fuzzbox . Surf rock and subsequently the Beatles and the beat groups of the British Invasion motivated thousands of young people to form bands in the US and elsewhere from 1963 through early 1968 . Hundreds of acts produced regional hits , and a handful had national chart hits . With the advent of psychedelia , a number of garage bands incorporated exotic elements into the genre 's primitive stylistic framework , but after 1968 , as more sophisticated forms of rock music overtook the marketplace , garage rock records largely disappeared from the national and regional charts . 
 In an effort to identify and recognize the music as a distinct genre , certain critics in the early 1970s began to retroactively refer to the style as " punk rock " , the first form of music to bear this description ; and it is sometimes called " garage punk " , " protopunk " , or " ' 60s punk " to distinguish it from the more commonly known punk rock of the mid- and late @-@ 1970s that it influenced . Garage rock has experienced various revivals over the last several decades and continues to influence many modern acts who prefer a " back to basics " and " do it yourself " musical approach . 
 = = Background and characteristics = = 
 = = = Milieu = = = 
 Use of the term " garage rock " stems from the perception that many of its performers were young and amateurish , and often rehearsed in the family garage . While numerous bands were made up of middle @-@ class teenagers from the suburbs , others were from rural or urban areas or were composed of professional musicians in their twenties . The earliest attested use of the term " garage band " dates from March 1971 , in a review by John Mendelsohn in Rolling Stone ; later the same year , the term was also used by Lenny Kaye in the same magazine . Garage bands performed in a variety of venues . Less @-@ established groups typically played at parties , school dances , and teen clubs . For acts of legal age ( and in some cases younger ) , bars , nightclubs , and college fraternity socials also provided regular engagements . Occasionally , local groups had the opportunity to open at shows for famous touring acts passing through their cities and towns . Certain garage rock bands went on tour , particularly the better @-@ known acts who scored nationwide hits , but also lesser @-@ known groups receiving bookings and / or airplay beyond their local vicinity . Groups often competed in " battles of the bands " , which gave musicians an opportunity to gain exposure and , if lucky enough , a chance to win a prize , such as free recording time in a local studio . Battles of the bands were held , locally , regionally and nationally , and the most prestigious contest was held annually by the Tea Council of the U.S.A , usually in Lambertville , New Jersey . In 1967 the event took place in Los Angeles at Gary <unk> 's Hullabaloo and is chronicled in a short documentary by Paul <unk> , which focuses on that year 's third place finalists , the Good Guys , who are seen playing two songs in the film . 
 = = = Stylistic features = = = 
 Performances often sounded amateurish , naïve or intentionally raw , with typical themes revolving around the traumas of high school life and songs about " lying girls " being particularly common . The lyrics and delivery were notably more aggressive than the more polished acts of the time , often with nasal , growled , or shouted vocals , sometimes punctuated by shrieks or screams at climactic moments of release . Instrumentation was characterized by the use of electric guitars often distorted through a fuzzbox , teamed with bass and drums . Guitarists sometimes played using aggressive @-@ sounding bar chord riffs , sometimes referred to as power chords . Organs such as the Farfisa were commonly used as well as mouth harmonicas or hand @-@ held percussion such as tambourines . Occasionally , the tempo would be sped up in certain passages sometimes referred to as " <unk> " . Garage rock acts were nonetheless diverse in both musical ability and in style , ranging from crude two- and three @-@ chord music ( such as the Seeds and the <unk> ) to near @-@ studio musician quality ( including the Knickerbockers , the Remains , and the Fifth Estate ) . There were also regional variations with flourishing scenes , particularly in California , the base of Strawberry Alarm Clock , the Electric Prunes , the Music Machine , the Standells , and Texas , offering bands such as Sir Douglas Quintet , the 13th Floor Elevators , Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs ( whose " Wooly Bully " reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and charted for almost four and a half months in 1965 ) , and Fever Tree . The north @-@ western states of Idaho , Washington and Oregon had perhaps the most defined regional sound with bands such as the <unk> , the Sonics and Paul Revere & the Raiders . Florida had a significant number of near studio quality bands , such as the Impacts , the Tropics , the Tempests and the Outlaws .

 In the late 1950s , the initial impact of rock and roll on mainstream American culture waned as major record companies took a controlling influence and ought to market more conventionally acceptable recordings . However , some young people were still inspired by musicians such as Chuck Berry , Little Richard , Bo Diddley , Jerry Lee Lewis , Buddy Holly , and Eddie Cochran , whose recordings of often self @-@ written and relatively unsophisticated and hard @-@ driving songs from a few years earlier had proclaimed personal independence and freedom from parental controls and conservative norms . Ritchie Valens ' 1958 hit " La Bamba " helped jump @-@ start the Chicano rock scene in Southern California and provided a three @-@ chord template for the songs of numerous 1960s garage bands . Guitarist Link Wray , best known for his 1959 instrumental " Rumble " , used innovative guitar techniques and effects such as power chords , distortion , and tremolo and is also often cited as an early influence in the development of the garage rock sound . Electric musical instruments ( particularly guitars ) and amplification were becoming more affordable , allowing young musicians to form small groups to perform in front of local audiences of their peers ; and in some areas there was a breakdown , especially among radio audiences , of traditional black and white markets , with more white teenagers able to hear and purchase R & B records . By the end of the 1950s regional scenes were abundant around the country and would influence much of the music of the 1960s . 
 = = = = Pacific Northwest 1958 @-@ 1963 = = = = 
 According to Lester Bangs , " the origins of garage rock as a genre can be traced to California and the Pacific Northwest in the early Sixties " . The Pacific Northwest , which encompasses Washington , Oregon , and Idaho , played a critical role in the inception of garage rock , hosting the first scene to produce a sizable number of acts , and pre @-@ dated the arrival of the British Invasion by several years . The signature garage sound of the Pacific Northwest is sometimes referred to as " the Northwest Sound " and had its origins in late 1950s , when a handful of R & B and rock & roll acts sprung up in various cities and towns in an area stretching from Puget Sound to Seattle and Tacoma , and beyond . There and elsewhere , groups of teenagers were inspired directly by touring R & B performers such as Johnny Otis and Richard Berry , and began to play cover versions of R & B songs . The Playboys were a racially integrated R & B group hailing from Seattle and featured Ron Holden and were one of the popular bands that would also influence later acts . The <unk> from Seattle had several instrumental hits , such as " Werewolf " in 1960 , which featured the presence of " clanging " guitar chords indicative of much of what was to come . During the late 1950s there were a host of other instrumental groups playing in the region , such as the Ventures , formed in 1958 in Tacoma , Washington , who specialized in a surf rock sound . The Blue Notes from Tacoma , Washington , fronted by " Rockin ' Robin " Roberts , specialized in a hard @-@ driving R & B sound and were one of the city 's first teenage rock & roll bands . The Wailers ( often billed as the Fabulous Wailers ) , were one of their chief rivals in Tacoma , and eventually exceeded them in popularity with their national chart hit in 1959 , the instrumental " Tall Cool One " . After the demise of Blue Notes , " Rockin ' Robin " did a brief stint with the Wailers , and with him on vocals in 1962 , they recorded a version of Richard Berry 's 1957 song " Louie Louie " , which became an unofficial anthem for practically every band in the region . It was Portland group the Kingsmen 's 1963 off @-@ the @-@ cuff version of " Louie Louie " , largely based on the Wailers ' arrangement , that took off , first as a regional hit in Seattle , then rising to # 1 on the national charts and becoming a hit overseas , making it the de facto " big bang " for three @-@ chord rock . Berry 's song was written as an ode to the lovelorn confessions of a drunken Jamaican sailor , to be sung as if a monologue to a bartender , and displays Latin influences with its " El Loco Cha @-@ Cha " riffs which were subsequently pared down to a more basic and primitive rock arrangement in the Kingsmen 's version , providing a stylistic model for countless garage rock bands to come . Paul Revere & the Raiders , who also recorded a version of " Louie Louie " around this time , were originally from Boise , Idaho , but relocated to Portland , Oregon , when Revere returned from a stint in the armed forces in 1962 . ] The Sonics , who formed in Tacoma in 1960 , would later record a rendition of Berry 's " Have Love , Will Travel " . 
 = = = = Elsewhere 1958 @-@ 1963 = = = = 
 Elsewhere , regional scenes of teenage bands playing R & B @-@ oriented rock , and often competing against each other in " battle of the bands " contests , were particularly well established several years before the " British Invasion " , in Texas and the Midwest . In Milwaukee , the Nomads were formed in the late 1950s , influenced by rockabilly and blues recordings . A rival band were the <unk> , a band led by guitarist Larry Lynne and based in a newly built middle @-@ class suburb . Lynne said that he was inspired to form a band by the R & B radio stations broadcasting from the South , together with the experience of seeing some of the original rock and roll acts , such as Gene Vincent , perform when he was younger . With its use of " cheesy " sounding Farfisa organ riffs and banging drums , the 1962 hit " Let 's Dance " by Chris Montez featured stylistic elements that anticipate the garage sound . By 1963 singles by several such bands were creeping into the national charts , including the Trashmen , from Minneapolis , and the Rivieras , from South Bend , Indiana . At the same time , in southern California , bands such as the Nomads ( not the Milwaukee band ) formed , playing raucous <unk> and saxophone @-@ driven instrumentals . Many bands were heavily influenced by surf rock and hot rod music , and there was a cross @-@ pollination between these influences resulting in an energetic and upbeat sound . This is sometimes referred to as frat rock , which can be viewed as an early subgenre of garage rock , and it is often associated with many Pacific Northwest acts , such as the Kingsmen , but also thrived elsewhere . Writer Neil Campbell commented : " There were literally thousands of rough and ready groups performing in local bars and dance halls throughout the US prior to the arrival of the Beatles ... [ T ] he indigenous popular music which functioned in this way ... was the protopunk more commonly identified as garage rock " . 
 = = = Impact of the Beatles and the British Invasion = = = 
 As the mid @-@ 1960s approached , garage rock entered a new period reflecting a different set of influences and circumstances . On February 9 , 1964 , during their first visit to the United States , the Beatles made a historic appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show watched by a record @-@ breaking viewing audience of a nation mourning the recent death of President John F. Kennedy . For many , particularly the young , the Beatles ' visit re @-@ ignited the sense of excitement and possibility that had been momentarily taken by his assassination . Much of this new excitement would be expressed in music , sometimes much to the chagrin of parents and elders . Following the Beatles ' first visit , a subsequent string of successful , and increasingly bold , British Invasion acts emerged between 1964 and 1966 . These had a profound impact , leading many ( often surf or hot rod groups ) to respond by altering their style , and countless new bands to form , as teenagers around the country picked up guitars and started bands by the thousands . In many cases , garage bands were particularly influenced by the British " beat groups " with a harder , blues @-@ based attack , such as the Kinks , the Who , the Animals , the Yardbirds , the Small Faces , the Pretty Things , Them , and the Rolling Stones , often resulting in a raw and primitive sound . Numerous garage rock bands were formed in countries outside North America , such as England 's the Troggs who enjoyed worldwide success with " Wild Thing " . Another influence was the folk @-@ rock of the Byrds and Bob Dylan , especially on bands such as the Leaves . 
 = = = Peak of popularity = = = 
 Thousands of garage bands were extant in the US and Canada and hundreds produced regional hits , in an era where it was not uncommon for a band to participate in a battle of the bands or cut a record and have it receive airplay on the local AM radio station . Some acts were lucky enough to gain exposure on the national charts just long enough to have one or a couple of hits . The mid @-@ 1960s was an era rife with one @-@ hit wonders . One of the earliest bands to enjoy national success was the Beau Brummels with " Laugh , Laugh " and " Just a Little " , which both reached the top 15 in 1965 . Other examples include : " Fortune Teller " by Des Moines 's the Image ( 1967 ) , " The Witch " by Tacoma 's the Sonics ( 1965 ) , " Where You Gonna Go " by Detroit 's Unrelated Segments ( 1967 ) , " It 's Cold Outside " by Cleveland 's the Choir , " Girl I Got News for You " by Miami 's Birdwatchers ( 1966 ) , " Dirty Water " by Los Angeles @-@ based the Standells ( 1966 ) , " I Need Love " by Canton , Illinois ' , the Third Booth , and " 1 – 2 – 5 " by Montreal 's the Haunted . 
 The November 12 , 1966 issue of Billboard stated that sales of the " 96 Tears " single by Question Mark & the Mysterians , a band from Michigan , had attained sales of one million copies . Boston 's Remains , though only able to make it onto Billboard 's Bubbling Under charts , had enough of a following and reputation to open for the Beatles during their 1966 US tour . The Count Five scored a number five hit on the Billboard charts that year with " Psychotic Reaction " , which in turn was featured on their album of the same name . Michigan 's Shondells released a minor regional hit in 1964 before disbanding . When it was unearthed by a Pittsburgh Disc Jockey in 1965 , the resulting success of " Hanky Panky " revived the moribund career of Tommy James , who formed a new group of Shondells . Tommy James and the Shondells followed up with twelve more top 40 singles . Tommy also had success as a solo artist , scoring a top ten hit with " Draggin ' the Line " in 1971 .

 Garage rock was not an exclusively male phenomenon — it fostered the emergence of all @-@ female bands whose members played their own instruments . One of the first such acts was New York 's Goldie and the <unk> , who accompanied Chubby Checker on his 1962 European tour , and later toured with the Rolling Stones , the Animals , the Beatles , the Yardbirds , the Hollies and the Kinks , among others . The Pleasure Seekers , from Detroit , later known as Cradle , featured Suzi Quatro and her sisters . Quatro would subsequently go on to greater fame as a solo act in the early 1970s . The Luv 'd Ones , also from Michigan , signed with Chicago 's Dunwich Records , and are best known for the song " Up Down Sue " . San Francisco 's the Ace of Cups became a fixture in the Bay Area scene in the late 1960s . The <unk> hailed from the Beatles ' home city of Liverpool , England , but became best known in Germany , often performing in Hamburg 's Star @-@ Club . Other notable female groups were the Daughters of Eve , from Chicago , the Feminine Complex , from Nashville , and The Heart Beats from Lubbock , Texas . In many ways , bands such as these anticipated later all @-@ female acts , such as the Runaways and the Slits , that would be associated with the 1970s punk movement .

 In 1964 and 1965 the impact of the Beatles and the British Invasion shifted the tectonic plates of the musical landscape , presenting , not only a challenge , but also a new impetus for teenagers in the Pacific Northwest to form bands , as many of the more experienced acts adapted to the new climate , often reaching greater levels of commercial and / or artistic success than previously , yet generally without losing their regional distinctiveness . The Kingsmen would go through a significant roster shake @-@ up in 1964 , while unwittingly becoming the target of an FBI investigation in response to complaints about the alleged use of profanity in the nearly inaudible lyrics of their ramshackle hit version of " Louie Louie " . With the new lineup featuring former drummer Lyn Eastman on vocals , they continued to be active until the end of the decade , recording a string of singles that included " Long Green " ( 1964 ) , " Giver Her Lovin ' " ( 1965 ) , and " Trouble " ( 1967 ) . After relocating to Portland , Paul Revere & the Raiders became the first rock & roll act to be signed to Columbia Records in 1963 , but did not achieve their commercial breakthrough until 1965 with the song " Steppin Out " , which was followed by string of chart @-@ topping hits such as " Just Like Me " , originally recorded by the Wilde Knights and " Kicks " . The Sonics , who formed in Tacoma in 1960 , went through several personnel shifts until they achieved their classic lineup in 1964 when vocalist Gerry Rosalie and saxophonist Rob Lind joined the group , perfecting their tough R & B @-@ based rock sound . They signed to the Wailers ' label , Etiquette Records and proceeded to wax their inaugural single , the driving , overdriven " The Witch " ( 1964 ) . The song was re @-@ issued again in 1965 , this time with the even more intense " Psycho " on the flip side . They released two albums on Etiquette , Here Are The Sonics ! ! ! ( 1965 ) an Boom ( 1966 ) , followed by Introducing the Sonics ( 1967 ) on Jerden Records . They are also known for several other " high @-@ octane " rockers such as " Cinderella " and the power @-@ chorded proto @-@ punk " He 's Waitin ' " . 
 Prompted by the Sonics , the Wailers entered the mid 1960s with a harder @-@ edged approach as evidenced in songs such as the fuzz @-@ driven " Hang Up " and " Out of Our Tree " . In 1964 keyboardist Don Gallucci , whose signature electric piano riffs punctuated the hit version of " Louie Louie " , left the Kingsmen to start his own combo , Don and the Goodtimes , whose initial lineup briefly included fellow ex @-@ Kingsman Jack Ely , who had sung lead vocal their hit version of " Louie Louie " , before he went form Jack Ely & the Courtmen in 1966 . Don and the Goodtimes sported top hats on stage and specialized in a keyboard @-@ driven garage sound on heard on their earlier records , such as " I 'm Real " and " You Were a Child " both released in 1966 , and landed an engagement as the house band on Dick Clark 's Where the Action is television program , promoting the band to name an album after the TV show , specializing in R & B @-@ flavored Northwest fare . After undergoing key lineup changes , they moved to Los Angeles in 1967 , where they were teamed with producer Jack <unk> to record the album So Good , known for his arrangements on many of Phil Spector 's 1960s hits , who preferred to use session players from Los Angeles ' A @-@ list , the Wrecking Crew in place of the band members on certain cuts . <unk> helped them fashion a more layered sound , and moving ever more in a progressive direction , the band changed their name to Touch and released a self @-@ titled LP ( under that name ) in 1968 . 
 Paul Bearer & the <unk> , who were from Albany , Oregon , signed to Etiquette Records , supplied the overdriven power chords of " I 've Been Thinking " . Other acts on the label were the <unk> , the Rooks , and the Galaxies . " The Liberty Party , released the single " Get Yourself Home " on Jerden Records and recorded other songs such as " It 's Not Too Late " . The <unk> , from <unk> , Washington , were also on <unk> and issued " Louise " , an R & B infused frat rock number , and " I Believed " . The <unk> are known for several proto @-@ punk songs , such as " Why Don 't You Love Me " ( 1964 ) , featuring a nasal " <unk> " vocal not unlike that later heard in Johnny Rotten and " Circuit Breaker " , an which starts off slowly , then speeds up to a pounding drive . The Impacts from Ranier , Oregon recorded a string of singles , including " Don 't You Dare " . The Velvet Illusions were from Yakima , Washington , where they became a popular regional act before briefly relocating to Los Angeles , and managed put out five singles during their two @-@ year tenure , beginning with " Acid Head " , which got banned in some markets due to its drug @-@ referenced lyrics , as well as the band 's own theme song " Velvet Illusions " , the upbeat " Mini @-@ <unk> " , and " Hippy Town " , commenting on the California bohemian lifestyle they had witnessed in the streets and " coffee shops " of Los Angeles . Other groups from Washington were the Bards from Moses Lake , The Mercy Boys from Everett , as well as Billy and the Kids and the Chargers , both from Wenatchee . Billy & the Kids were middle school @-@ aged and their ranks included twin brothers Bill and Bob Burns . They recorded two singles featuring the hard @-@ driving A @-@ sides " Say You Love Me " in 1966 and " When I See You " in 1967 .

 Though Pacific Northwest provided the initial flurry of garage rock bands , other parts of the United States and Canada were soon to follow , particularly in response to the impact of the Beatles and the British Invasion , which would result in a widespread grassroots rock explosion . One of the next regions to experience a proliferation of bands was Boston and New England . The Barbarians , from Cape Cod , wearing sandals and long hair , and cultivating an image of " noble savages " , recorded an album and several singles , such as the partly self @-@ referential , " Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl " . Impossible to ignore was the sight of their drummer , Victor " <unk> " Moulton , who played the drums holding one of his sticks with a prosthetic clamp in place of his left hand , worn as the result of an earlier accident . In 1964 the group appeared on the <unk> Show , on same bill as famous acts such as the Rolling Stones and James Brown , playing the joyfully primitive " Hey Little Bird . " In 1966 , while the other members of the band were away , Moulton recorded " <unk> " , a spoken monologue set to music , in which he recounted the travails of his disfigurement , released under the Barbarians ' name , but backed by future members of the Band . The Remains ( sometimes called Barry and the Remains ) , from Boston , led by Barry <unk> , were also popular in the region , and in addition to touring with the Beatles in 1966 , recorded a self @-@ titled album for Epic that year just before breaking up . During their years of activity they recorded several songs which have subsequently become highly regarded , such as " Don 't Look Back " and " Why do I Cry " . Also from Boston , the Rockin ' Ramrods recorded a number of songs , including the distortion @-@ driven protopunk of " She Lied " , in 1964 . The <unk> from Ipswich , Massachusetts , were popular in the New England and Upstate New York area and released the single , " My World is Upside Down " in 1966 . The Squires , from Bristol , Connecticut , released the song , " All the Way " on Atco Records in 1966 . All three songs are now regarded as a garage classics .

The Birdwatchers , from West Palm Beach , achieved national airplay with " I 'm Gonna Love you Anyway " , and made an appearance on Dick Clark 's TV show , Where the Action Is . The <unk> , from Daytona Beach , had a folk rock @-@ influenced sound and released several singles , but are best known for " Little Black Egg " , which became a minor hit on the national charts . From Miami came the Montells and Evil , whose members knew each other well , and who both at different times used the services of drummer Jeff Allen , who made regular trips to England , and was able to keep both bands abreast on the latest happenings in the London scene . Both bands had opportunities to cut records . The Montells , under the name the H.M. Subjects , recorded a version of the Pretty Things " Don 't Let Me Down , " which ended up in swirl of controversy over its apparently sexually suggestive lyrics , to some degree opportunistically fueled by the record 's benefactor , Morton Downey , Jr . , then a disc jockey at Miami 's <unk> and later of talk show fame . The Montells recorded two songs previously done by the Who , " Daddy Rolling Stone " and " I Can 't Explain " as well as original material such as " You Can 't Make Me " . Evil specialized in an even harder , sometimes thrashing sound , epitomized in such protopunk anthems as the posthumously released outtakes , " I 'm Movin ' On " and " From a <unk> " . They released a single featuring their rendition of the Small Faces ' " Whatcha Gonna Do About It " b / w " Always Runnin ' Around " , which was re @-@ released on Capitol a few months later . Also from Miami were the <unk> who recorded " Don 't Be Late " and the Echoes of Carnaby Street cut " No Place No Time " . The Painted Faces were from Fort Myers and released four singles including " Faces " , which Mojo Magazine included in their top 100 psychedelic songs of all time . From Tampa came the Tropics , who were also relatively prolific and cut songs such as " For a Long Time " and " As Time 's Gone " as well as the Rovin ' Flames , whose string of singles began with their rendition of " Gloria " and included " How Many Times " , " I 'm Afraid to Go Home " , and " I Can 't " . The Seeds of Time , from Monroeville , Alabama cut the proto @-@ punk " She 's Been Travelin ' Round the World " on Morgan Records in 1966 . The Tikis , from <unk> , Alabama released the single " Somebody 's Son " , which angrily denounces the injustices faced by an abandoned orphan . It was backed with " Little Miss Lovelight " . The Gants , from Greenwood , Mississippi , were the most popular group in the state and recorded three albums and a string singles , such as the blues @-@ drenched rocker , " ( You Can 't Blow ) Smoke Rings " and the Beatles @-@ inspired ballad , " I Wonder " . 
 In New Orleans two of the popular nightspots were the <unk> on Napoleon Ave . , which hosted regular battles of the bands , and the <unk> , a suburban teen club in Metairie . The <unk> <unk> had a local hit with an upbeat song previously recorded by the Glass Cans from Houston , " Stick With Her " , but its flip @-@ side , " Rebecca <unk> " , provided a dark counterpoint , recounting the unpleasant saga of a fictional female protagonist who dies in the aftermath of an illegal and botched abortion — perhaps rock 's first song dealing with the controversial topic . The group 's second single featured the stylistically innovative " No One Cares " , which experimented with odd and shifting time signatures , and was backed with the ballad " Clouds Don 't Shine " . The Better Half @-@ Dozen cut the " I Could Have Loved Her " backed with " I 'm Gonna Leave You " . The Palace Guards ( Louisiana band ) whose drummer , Frank Bua , later went on to play with the <unk> , were a regular fixture at the <unk> and recorded four singles , which included " I 'm Sorry " , Better Things to Do " , and " No Comin ' Back " . Dr. Spec 's Optical Illusion had a gritty , hard @-@ driving sound and cut the single " Tryin ' To Mess With My Mind " b / w " She 's the One " on Flambeau Records . The Greek Fountains , from Baton Rouge , were one of the most popular bands in the state , and drummer Cyril Vetter co @-@ wrote " Double Shot of My Baby 's Love " , which would later provide a hit for the The Swingin ' <unk> . They recorded " Howlin ' for My Darlin ' " and a version of " I 'm Not Your Stepping Stone " . The Basement Wall , sometimes sporting white Beatle boots , became one of the most popular bands in the region and recorded " Orange " , " Never <unk> " , as well the ska @-@ <unk> instrumental " Basement Exit " . Lafayette 's the Rogues released a single credited as the Dry <unk> , " She 's a Drag " backed with " You ’ re Through " , produced by Cyril Vetter of the Greek Fountains , then followed it up with another 45 , listed this time as the Rogues , featuring " Put You Down " . The Persian Market were also from Lafayette and in 1967 released the single " Flash in the Pan " . The Bad Roads from Lake Charles went to Floyd Soileau 's studio in Ville Platte to record their first single featuring " Blue Girl " .

 Memphis , which had already established a strong reputation for its blues and rockabilly , became a major center of soul music in the 1960s and was the home of Stax Records . However , the city also had a vibrant garage band scene , with as many 400 @-@ 500 groups playing in the area , and a core of approximately eighty bands that played regularly at the better venues , some of which hosted battles of the bands , many acts cut records . The <unk> , whose membership included Laddie <unk> , formerly of one of Memphis earliest garage bands of the early 1960s , the <unk> , went to Los Angeles , where they recorded the Phil Spector @-@ produced " Hey You " and " I Don 't Believe " at the Gold Star Studios then returned to Tennessee , and drove to Nashville to record " Wild Child ' . The Hombres were another popular Memphis group and had a hit with their song " Let It Out ( Let It All Hang Out ) " , which reached # 12 on the national charts . The Breakers had a regional hit with " Don 't Bring Me No Flowers ( I Ain 't Dead Yet ) " , which went to # 1 on the local charts . The <unk> recorded " I Tell No Lies " and " Mad , Mad , Mad " . The Jesters , blank who cut the single " Cadillac Man " , recorded for Sam Phillips Sun label and specialized in a rockabilly @-@ oriented style of garage rock that , unlike other garage bands , displayed little Beatles or British Invasion influence . Randy and the <unk> issued two singles beginning with " Peek @-@ a @-@ Boo " in early 1965 , then followed it up later that year with " My Way of Thinking " , which featured insistent power chords . Lawson and Four More cut the eerie and brooding " If You Want Me You Can Find Me " , written and produced by noted songwriter and session musician Jim Dickinson . Flash & the Memphis Casuals recorded the highly energetic " Uptight Tonight " . After the Casuals , Flash went on the form Flash & the Board of Directors . The <unk> were from Pine Bluff , Arkansas and cut the single " The Light Won 't Shine " . 
 North Carolina experienced a garage rock boom comparable to other states . In Charlotte , the Paragons ( not to be confused with the Jamaican ska group of the same name ) were one of the most popular bands in town , and went to Arthur Smith 's studio to record their single on Bobbi Records featuring , " Abba " , which was characterized by the sound of crackling 12 @-@ string guitar riffs and became an enormous hit in the local area , reaching # 1 on the local charts and leading to their appearance on The Village Square , a nationally syndicated TV show broadcast by WBTV in Charlotte , where they did a lip @-@ synched performance of " Abba " , which is now regarded as a garage rock classic . The <unk> , also from Charlotte , released two singles featuring the fuzz @-@ drenched " Catch a Ride " and " Keep Dreamin ' " . The <unk> drove from Charlotte to Winston @-@ Salem to record the In Our Time LP for the vanity label , Justice Records , whose assortment of blues and folk @-@ inspired tracks included eerie ballads such as " Just A Toy " , " It Won 't Be Wrong " , and a version of George Gershwin 's " Summertime " , as well an upbeat material such as " You Lied " and " What a Shame " . The <unk> recorded " Get Away Girl " . Sounds Unlimited , from Winston @-@ Salem , recorded the song , " Cool One " , which flaunted braggadocious semi @-@ spoken lyrics recited over a grinding two @-@ chord proto @-@ punk guitar riff accompanied by a bell @-@ muted trumpet . The <unk> from Chapel Hill were formed in 1963 by Alex Taylor , the older brother of James Taylor , who briefly joined the group before leaving to attend a boarding school in Massachusetts . The group became a popular fixture for several years at fraternity parties at the University of North Carolina . The <unk> , from Greenville , South Carolina , specialized in hard @-@ driving numbers such as " Go Ahead and Go " and Hippie Times " , and the Elite UFO , from Stanton , Kentucky , recorded " Now Who 's Good Enough " . 
 = = = = Canada = = = = 
 Like the United States , Canada had a large and vigorous garage rock phenomenon . Vancouver , British Columbia , perhaps due to its proximity to the US Pacific Northwest , was one of the principal hotbeds of activity in the 1960s . The Northwest Company from Haney , a suburb of Vancouver , cut a string of singles including , " Hard to Cry " . The Painted Ship specialized in a Rolling Stones @-@ influenced brand of proto @-@ punk heard in songs such as " She Said Yes " , " Frustration " and " Lies " . The Guess Who , from Winnipeg , Manitoba , began in 1958 and entered the mid @-@ 1960s essentially as a garage rock unit , enjoying a hit with Johnny Kidd & the Pirates ' " Shakin ' All Over " , which would later be covered by the Who . In 1965 they had a hit in both the US and Canada with a version of British band Johnny Kidd & the Pirates ' 1960 UK hit " Shakin ' All Over " . As the 1960s progressed they would evolve to a more sophisticated approach , for which they became better known . The Quid , another Winnipeg band , recorded " Crazy Thing " . The <unk> cut the psychedelic single , " Smiling <unk> " , in 1967 . The Ugly Ducklings , from Toronto , Ontario , had a hard @-@ driving R & B sound , and toured with the Rolling Stones in 1966 . They recorded several songs that are highly regarded by enthusiasts of garage including " Nuthin ' " and " Just in Case You 're Wondering " , from 1966 and " Gaslight " from 1967 . The Haunted , from Montreal , specialized in a gritty blues @-@ based sound influenced by the Rolling Stones and released the single " 1 – 2 – 5 " , which has been re @-@ issued in the Pebbles compilation series . Two other bands from Toronto were the Paupers and the <unk> Birds . The Paupers released two albums and numerous songs , such as " If I told You Baby " and " Think I Care " . The <unk> Birds featured the unique combination of Rick James on lead vocals and Neil Young , who would both go on to fame as solo acts , as well as Bruce Palmer who later accompanied Young to California to join Buffalo Springfield in 1966 . They landed a contract with Motown Records and recorded a number of songs such as " I 've Got You In My Soul " , " It 's My Time " and " It 's a Long Time Baby " . M.G. & the Escorts were from Montreal and recorded " A Someday Fool " . 
 = = = = Elsewhere in the Americas = = = = 
 Outside of the mainland , garage rock also became a fixture in the islands and territories adjacent to the continent . The Savages , from Bermuda , recorded an album which is considered seminal in the genre , Live ' n Wild , recorded live at a Bermuda nightclub , and it includes the song " The World Ain 't Round It 's Square " , which has been cited as a classic anthem of youthful defiance . In Mike <unk> 's <unk> Mayhem , according to the polling of a handful of the most preeminent garage rock writers and experts , the song is rated as a ten out of ten , and ranked at number 4 in the list of the 1000 greatest garage rock records , placing it in the top five of all time , according to that poll . The Gents and the <unk> were two other bands from Bermuda who , like the Savages , recorded for Duane Records . The Gents released the 1966 single featuring the proto @-@ punk " If You Don 't Come Back " baked with a highly emotional lament , " If I Cry " . In 1965 the <unk> cut a 45 featuring " Don 't Call My Name " . From Honolulu , Hawaii , the Mop Tops recorded " I Tried " , " Never Change Your Mind " , and a version of the Who 's " The Kids are Alright " . 
 = = = Garage and its counterparts worldwide = = = 
 The garage phenomenon , though most often associated with North America , was not exclusive to it . Its attributes were present in much of the beat music played in various countries throughout the world , as bands proliferated in the wake of the British Invasion . The particular countries involved had grass @-@ roots rock movements which essentially served as counterparts to what was happening in the North America , several of which are sometimes retroactively referred to as freakbeat , Nederbeat , Uruguayan Invasion , or Group Sounds , or in other cases as " beat " or " garage rock " . 
 = = = = Britain and Ireland = = = = 
 Although Britain did not develop a distinctly defined garage rock genre in the same way as the United States , some British bands shared characteristics with the American bands who often attempted to emulate them , and are sometimes seen as counterparts to US garage bands , particularly in the subgenre known retrospectively as " freakbeat " . 
 Beat music had emerged in Britain in the early 1960s , as musicians who had originally come together to play rock and roll or skiffle assimilated American rhythm and blues influences and adopted new forms of amplification . The genre provided the model for the format of many later rock groups , based around a lead singer with guitars and drums . Many groups formed to perform this music in local venues – according to Bill Harry , the Liverpool area alone had some 300 performance venues and 500 bands by around 1961 , though this intensity was not replicated elsewhere in the country . The Beatles emerged from this beat music boom , and their energetic approach served as a template for the formation of countless groups . Some bands developed a distinctively British rhythm and blues style – there were estimated to be 300 rhythm and blues bands in England at the start of 1964 , and over 2 @,@ 000 by the end of the year . Nationally popular beat and R & B groups included the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds from London , the Animals from Newcastle , the Spencer Davis Group ( featuring Steve Winwood ) from Birmingham , and Them ( featuring Van Morrison ) , from Belfast in Northern Ireland . From about 1965 , bands such as the Who and the Small Faces tailored their appeal directly to the burgeoning mod subculture in London . 
 Particularly after the " British Invasion " of the US , musical cross @-@ fertilization developed between the two continents . In their 1964 transatlantic hits " You Really Got Me " and " All Day and All of the Night " , the Kinks took the influence of the Kingsmen 's version of " Louie Louie " and applied greater volume and distortion , which in turn , influenced the approach of many American garage bands . Their influence continued with several more hard @-@ driving , yet increasingly despondent songs , such as " Where Have All the Good Times Gone " , as well as " I 'm Not Like Everybody Else " , later covered by the Chocolate Watchband . The Pretty Things , who took their name from the title of a Bo Diddley song , were known for their raw approach to blues @-@ influenced rock , as exhibited in songs such as Diddley 's " Midnight to Six Man , " as well as " Don 't Bring Me Down " . The Downliners Sect were if anything even more brazen in their approach . Northern Ireland 's Them , recorded two songs that would become widely covered by American garage bands : " Gloria " , which would become a big hit for Chicago 's the Shadows of Knight , and " I Can Only Give You Everything " which was covered by numerous American acts , such as the MC5 and the Little Boy Blues . The Wheels , who were also from Belfast , recorded the original version of " Bad Little Woman " , which like Them 's " Gloria " before it , would be covered in 1966 by the Shadows of Knight . 
 The Troggs scored a massive worldwide hit with " Wild Thing " ( written by American Chip Taylor ) in 1966 . <unk> the virtues of their seemingly unrepentant primitivism and sexually charged innuendo , the Troggs were the British band that Lester Bangs would single out as perhaps the quintessential " punk " ( i.e. garage ) band of the 1960s . The Equals , a racially integrated band from North London featuring guitarist Eddy Grant , specialized in an upbeat style of rock ; their 1966 recording " Baby Come Back " was a hit in Europe before becoming a British number one in 1968 . The <unk> , whose ranks included Steve Howe , later of Yes , recorded several sides including " Crawdaddy Simone " and the protopunk , " What to Do " . The Renegades , from Birmingham , never had much success in their native country , but became considerably better known in Finland and Italy . They recorded an album and several singles , including a grinding version of Bill Haley 's " 13 Women " . 
 In keeping with the popularity of blues @-@ based rock and the onset of psychedelic music in the mid @-@ 1960s , some of the harder @-@ driving and more obscure bands associated with the mod scene in the UK are sometimes retroactively referred to as <unk> , which is sometimes viewed as the more stylish British parallel to garage rock . Several bands often mentioned as <unk> are the Creation , the Action , the Move , the Smoke , the Sorrows , the Red Squares , Wimple Winch , and the Birds , featuring Ron Wood , later of the Rolling Stones . Rhino Records ' 2001 box @-@ set compilation Nuggets II : Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond , 1964 @-@ 1969 contains many of the better @-@ known songs performed by obscure British beat and freakbeat acts of this era . 
 = = = = Continental Europe = = = = 
 The beat boom swept through continental Europe , resulting in the emergence of numerous bands who played in styles sometimes cited as European variants of garage rock . The Netherlands had one of the largest scenes , sometimes retroactively described as Nederbeat . The Outsiders , from Amsterdam , featured Wally Tax on lead vocals , and recorded three albums and a string of singles which included songs such as " Thinkin ' About Today " " Sun 's Going Down " , and " Lying all the Time " . <unk> from the Hague recorded extensively and lasted well into the 1970s , waxing the highly invective " I <unk> You " in 1966 . Also from the Hague came the Golden Earrings , later to gain greater fame in the 1970s and 1980s as Golden Earring . <unk> and the Blizzards , the Shoes , and the Motions were also fixtures in the Dutch rock scene of the time . 
 Having nurtured the Beatles ' early development in Hamburg , Germany was well @-@ positioned to play a key role as the beat craze overtook the Continent . Bands from Britain and around Europe would travel to there to gain exposure , playing in clubs and appearing on popular German television shows such as Beat Club and Beat ! Beat ! Beat ! . The Lords , founded in Düsseldorf in 1959 , pre @-@ dated the British Invasion by several years , but would adapt their sound and look to reflect the influence of the British groups , even singing in English , but providing a comic twist to the proceedings in their renditions of songs such as " Greensleeves " and " Shakin ' All Over " . The Rattles , from Hamburg , also had a lengthy history , but were more serious in their approach . The German Bonds were another fixture in the German rock scene and recorded a number of songs such as " We 're Out of Sight " , but failed to gain traction on the record charts . The Monks were a transplanted band founded by American G.I.s who had been stationed in Germany . They would replicate the appearance of monks by donning modified habits and having their heads tonsured . The Monks had an avant @-@ garde garage rock sound , with lyrics often filled with irony , social criticism , and anti @-@ war sentiments , and have been cited as an influence on later acts . Sweden had an active scene with bands such as the <unk> Stars , who featured future member of the 1970s pop group Abba , Benny Anderson , as well as the Merrymen . From Belgium came the Pebbles and John Wooley and the Just Born . 
 Even during the Franco regime there were numerous bands active in Spain , such as Los <unk> , who scored a worldwide hit with " Black Is Black " , as well as Los <unk> and Los <unk> . Micky y los Tonys , led by Micky ( Miguel Ángel Carreño <unk> ) , were known for their sometimes irreverent and satirical approach . They recorded " Ya no <unk> , which appeared in the 1965 film , <unk> Ye Yé 1965 , as well as songs such as " El <unk> de mis <unk> " , " <unk> de <unk> " . The compilation , Algo Salvaje : Untamed 60 's Beat and Garage Nuggets from Spain Vol . 1 @.@ features a number of Spanish bands from this period , including Los Hurricanes ( " El <unk> " ) , Los Botines ( " Eres un <unk> " ) , Los <unk> ( " A tu vera " ) , Los <unk> ( " La <unk> " , their version of Pretty Things ' " <unk> " ) , Los Sirex ( " Acto de <unk> " ) , and <unk> Matic ( " It 's My World " ) . The Trans World Punk Rave @-@ Up compilation series is devoted to covering 1960s garage rock and primitive beat music in continental Europe . 
 = = = = Latin America = = = = 
 Latin America had a significant amount of musical activity in the worldwide beat craze . And , Mexico was no exception , creating its own homegrown equivalent of American garage . The nation 's proximity to the United States was detectable in the raw sounds being produced by a number of groups . Mexico had often absorbed American musical influences and trends and would embrace the British Invasion . One of Mexico 's hottest acts were Los Dug Dug 's , who recorded a number of albums and stayed active well into the 1970s . Los <unk> dressed in monk habits , much like the American band , the Monks , who played in Germany . Los Sinners , who had been a surf group , were also a popular at the time and known for their 1964 instrumental " Rebel Radioactive " , and made an appearance in the riotous finale of director Luis Buñuel 's 1965 film , Simon of the Desert . Los Sleepers recorded " Zombie " . 
 The beat boom flourished in Uruguay during the mid @-@ 1960s in a period often referred to as the Uruguayan Invasion . Two of the best known acts were Los Shakers and Los <unk> , who essentially played the role of surrogate Beatles and Rolling Stones , with Los Shakers , the more popular of the two bands , playing in the melodic style of the Beatles and Los <unk> playing harder more blues @-@ based fare more akin to the Stones . Peru was host to an active scene . Los Saicos were one of the first bands to gain national prominence . Their 1965 song " ¡ <unk> ! " with its humorously anarchistic lyrics was a huge hit in Peru and is today considered a protopunk classic . AllMusic , writing about Los Saicos , noted that " The guitars sound like nothing so much as fountains of sparks , the drums have a tribal post @-@ surf throb , and the vocals are positively unhinged " and " These guys were a punk rock band , even if nobody outside Lima knew it at the time " . After the breakup of Los Saicos , Los Yorks , would become the most popular group in Peru . Colombia had a number of bands . Los Speakers from <unk> recorded several albums of material and recorded " Te <unk> " . Los Gatos <unk> , who came from Rosario , Argentina , were one of the country 's first beat groups and recorded " la <unk> " and a handful of other songs . Two of their members would go on to form Los Gatos , who became a popular act in Argentina during the late 1960s . The Los <unk> compilation series covers Latin American beat and garage rock of the 1960s .

 The far East was not immune to the beat group bug , and Japan was no exception , particularly after the Beatles ' 1966 visit , when they played two shows at Tokyo 's famed Budokan . The popular rock movement in Japan during the 1960s is often referred to as Group sounds ( or GS ) . The Spiders are one of the better @-@ known groups and recorded songs such as " Furi Furi " and " Monkey Dance " . The Out Cast are known for rocking material such as " Everything 's Alright " and " You Gat a Call Me " . The <unk> and are known for songs such as " Chu Chu Chu " , " <unk> Sandy " , " Give Me Lovin ' " , " Love Only You " . The <unk> recorded songs such as " Himitsu No <unk> " , " Kono <unk> Ni <unk> " , and " Bokutachi Tenshi " , The <unk> did " <unk> " , as well as the Jaguars who recorded " Dancing Lonely Night " , " Seaside Bound " , " Stop the Music " , and " Beat Train " . The Golden Cups from Yokohama recorded several albums of material and cut a version of the Leaves ' " Hey Joe " , as well as " I Can 't Keep From Crying " . The Tigers , another group in Japan during this era , would enjoy chart success . The compilations , GS I Love You : Japanese Garage Bands of the 1960s and its successor GS I Love You Too , feature the music from the Japanese beat / garage boom of the 1960s . 
 = = = = India = = = = 
 Despite famine , economic hardship , and political instability , India experienced its own proliferation of garage bands in the 1960s , even persisting into the beginning of the next decade , with the 1960s musical style intact , after it had fallen out of favor practically elsewhere else . As in so many places the Beatles mid @-@ 1960s success made a major impact on India 's youth and resulted in the formation of numerous groups . Bombay ( now known as Mumbai ) , with its hotels , clubs , and nightlife , had a large beat group scene . The Jets , who were active from 1964 to 1966 , were perhaps the first beat group to become popular in Bombay . Also active in Bombay were the Trojans , who became one of the most popular acts there and featured Biddu ( full name Biddu <unk> ) , originally from Bangalore , who would later move to London and become a solo act , later writing the song " Kung Fu Fighting " , which would provide a hit for Carl Douglas . The Mascots were another popular act in Bombay , as well as the Savages who played at venues such as Blow Up and the Taj <unk> Hotel . Later in the decade , the <unk> became a popular act and recorded " Watch Her " and " Some Peace of Mind " . Calcutta had an active scene . The Flintstones were one of its best @-@ known acts . The Mustangs came from Madras ( now known as Chennai ) . 
 As the 1960s progressed Junior Statesman , became a popular magazine with India 's young and it would remain popular well into the 1970s . Its pages were devoted to the latest trends in the ever @-@ changing youth culture , often including articles and interviews with bands . Every year the annual Simla Beat Contest was held in Bombay by the Imperial Tobacco Company to promote their Simla brand of menthol cigarettes . Groups from all around India would compete for first prize . The Simla Beat 70 / 71 compilation includes recordings of some of the bands who attended in 1970 and 1971 . On the album , the Eruptions , from Cuttack , perform " You Can 't Judge a Book by the Cover " . The <unk> , from Madras , sing " Voice from the Inner Soul " . The Dinosaurs , from Bombay , do a version of the Troggs ' " You Can 't Beat It " , as well as " Sinister Purpose " . The Genuine Spares perform " Proper Stranger " and " What 's Going On " . The <unk> , from Shillong , won first prize in 1970 and are heard doing the " Simla Beat Theme " and the garage ballad , " Until the Dawn " . The Mini Beats perform " Gypsy Girl " . Other bands included on the compilation are the <unk> , Purple Flower , from Ahmedabad , and Hypnotic Eye . The Velvet Fog , from Bombay , won second prize at the contest in 1971 . Atomic Forest was another popular band of the time and recorded a proto @-@ punk version of Deep Purple 's " Mary Long " . 
 = = = = Australia and New Zealand = = = = 
 Australia and New Zealand experienced a huge garage and beat explosion in the mid @-@ 1960s . The garage boom in those countries has been the subject of compilations such as Down Under Nuggets : Original Australian Artyfacts 1965 – 1967 . Before the British Invasion hit , the land down under had enjoyed a sizable surf rock scene , with popular bands such as the Atlantics , who scored hits in the Australian charts with " <unk> " and " the Crusher " in 1963 , as well as the Aztecs , and the Sunsets . In late 1963 and early 1964 British Invasion influence started permeating the music scenes of Australia and New Zealand . June 1964 the Beatles made an historic visit to Australia and were greeted by a crowd of an estimated 300 @,@ 000 in Adelaide . In response , many of the prior surf bands adapted by adding vocals over guitars , and a host of new bands formed . The first wave of British @-@ inspired bands , such as Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs , from Sydney , and Ray Columbus & the Invaders from Christchurch , New Zealand , tended to be more pop @-@ oriented in the Mersey beat mold . However , with rise in popularity of bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Animals , a second wave of Australian bands emerged who favored a harder , blues @-@ influenced approach . 
 In Australia , Sydney was the host to numerous acts during this time . Though the Atlantics had begun as an instrumental surf group , after the advent of the British Invasion , they brought in veteran singer Johnny Rebb , formerly with Johnny Rebb and His Rebels , to supply vocals . " Come On " is the song done during Rebb 's tenure for which they are best known . Also from Sydney , the Easybeats became the most popular group in Australia during the mid @-@ sixties . Most their pre @-@ 1967 songs were written by vocalist Stevie Wright and guitarist George Young , the older brother of Angus Young and Malcolm Young later of AC / DC fame . Several of their songs of the period were " I 'm Happy " , " Hey Babe " , and the previously unissued " Keep Your Hands Off My Babe " . In late 1966 , they re @-@ located to London and signed with the Beatles ' manager Brian Epstein and his NEMS organization in hopes of gaining an international audience . They recorded the riff @-@ driven " Sorry " and had a worldwide hit with " Friday on My Mind " , but were unable to duplicate its success . Vince Maloney who had been a member of Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs before starting a duo with Tony Barber which eventually led to the formation of his own band , the Vince Maloney Sect , who recorded a song previously done by Ron Wood 's London @-@ based band the Birds , " No Good Without You " . 
 One Sydney 's most notorious acts was the Missing Links , who throughout 1965 managed to go through a complete and total lineup change within the relatively short intervening time between the release their first single , " We 2 Should Live " , in March and the subsequent releases on the Philips label later that year , which would include brazenly primitivist anthems such as " Wild About You " and " You 're Drivin ' Me Insane " as well as their self @-@ titled LP , The Missing Links , which would arrive just in time for Christmas . They released the EP , Unchained in 1966 , but disbanded shortly thereafter , with several of the members going onto other acts such as Running Jumping Standing Still , the Masters Apprentices , and the Richard Wright Group . The Throb had a hit in Australia with their 1966 version of " Fortune Teller " , originally recorded by Benny Spellman , then later by the Rolling Stones . Later that year they released a single featuring " Black " , a brooding version of a traditional folk ballad b / w " Turn My Head " . Though the single failed to chart , their rendition of " Black " , with its evocation of mood and use of guitar feedback , has been mentioned as a significant achievement . The Black Diamonds from Lithgow cut " I Want , Need , Love You " that same year . Former surf band the Sunsets from Newcastle released the single " Hot Generation " in 1967 . 
 Originally from Brisbane , though they would later re @-@ locate to Sydney , the <unk> featured two lead singers , " brothers " Bob London and Bill London , who later replaced by Shane Hales . They cut several songs including " Last Night " , their version of " Gloria " , " Hurtin ' All Over " , and " Security " . Also from Brisbane , the Purple Hearts released " Of Hopes and Dreams and Tombstones " , in February 1966 then in August followed it up with another single featuring a hypnotic rendition of the traditional " Early in the Morning " backed with Rosco Gordon 's " Just a Little Bit " . Toni McCann , originally a native of London , established a career in Brisbane in the 1960s , specializing in a hard @-@ driving brand of R & B @-@ based rock : " All the other women at the time were wearing the pretty dresses ... So when I came out with the music of the Rolling Stones and started screaming my head off , people went , ' What the heck 's that ? ' " She released the single " My Baby " b / w " No " in which Tony <unk> 's support group , the Blue Jays played the backup . The <unk> from Maryborough , Queensland , were known for playing loud and in 1967 cut distortion @-@ laden " By My Side " . 
 From Melbourne came the Pink Finks who featured Ross Wilson on vocals and Ross Hannaford on lead guitar . They cut a version of " Louie Louie " as well as " Nowhere to Run " and " You 're Too Good for Me " . Wilson and Hannaford would go on form bands groups as the Party Machine in 1967 and later the popular 1970s Australian act , Daddy Cool . Also from Melbourne , the Moods released the single " Rum Drunk " in 1966 . The Loved Ones , who grew out of a prior traditional jazz combo , switched to rock and recorded several songs such as " The Loved One " , " <unk> ' Man " , and " Sad Dark Eyes " . The Wild Cherries released " Krome Plated <unk> " , " That 's Life " , and " Gotta Stop Lying " for Festival Records . Steve and the Board were led by the American @-@ born Steve Kipner and are known for several songs such as " I Want " , " Giggle @-@ Eyed Goo " , the ballad " Lonely Winter " . In 1967 , their drummer Colin Peterson would join the Bee Gees for several years during the late 1960s . The Chimney Sweeps , who hailed from the suburbs of Melbourne , did not release any records during the time when they were active as a group , however they recorded practice demos on a home tape recorder , which would later be released on the Devil Girl album in 2002 , which featured the ragged protopunk of songs such as " Give Your Lovin ' to Me " and " Devil Girl " . The Creatures , from Mildura , Victoria , were one of the more notorious groups , sometimes dying their hair , which was considered outrageously long for the times . They recorded hard @-@ driving blues @-@ based songs such as " All I Do is Cry " and " Ugly Thing " . The Masters Apprentices were from Adelaide , and had a long career that spanned into the 1970s . While in later years they would move in a more progressive direction , their early sound was largely R & B @-@ influenced garage and psychedelic rock . Two of their best known early songs are " Wars or Hands of Time " and the protopunk " Buried and Dead " . 
 After the initial success of Ray Columbus and the Invaders , a number of more aggressive and blues @-@ based groups would emerge from New Zealand . Chants R & B , were from Christchurch , and specialized in a raw R & B @-@ influenced sound heard in such songs as " I 'm Your <unk> " , previously done by John Mayall and " Neighbour Neighbor " . The Blue Stars from Auckland cut the defiant protopunk " Social End Product " which anticipated some of the thematic concerns of later punk acts in the 1970s . The La De Das from <unk> near Auckland , recorded a version of the Changin ' Times ' " How is the Air Up There ? " The group would remain active into the 1970s , but would evolve towards a more progressive funk @-@ based sound .

 Throughout 1966 , but particularly in the later months of the year , partly due to the growing influence of marijuana and other mind @-@ expanding drugs such as LSD , many bands began to expand their sound , sometimes employing eastern scales and various sonic effects to achieve exotic and hypnotic soundscapes in their music . In the spring of that year , the Byrds had a huge hit with musically innovative John Coltrane @-@ inspired " Eight Miles High " . The " buzzword " for this exiting new sound was " psychedelic " . It was nonetheless the result of a longer musical evolution growing out of folk rock and other forms — with certain early elements detectable even in surf rock , such as the mention of LSD in the title of the Gamblers , 1960 instrumental " LSD @-@ 25 " and Dick Dale 's use of the Phrygian scale in 1962 's " <unk> " . The first musical act to use the term was the New York @-@ based folk group the Holy Modal Rounders on their version of Lead Belly 's " Hesitation Blues " ( there pronounced as " psycho @-@ <unk> " ) in 1964 . As the decade progressed , psychedelic influences became increasingly pervasive in much of garage rock . 
 By the mid @-@ 1960s numerous garage rock bands began to employ tone @-@ altering devices such as <unk> on guitars often for the purpose of enhancing the music 's sonic palate and adding an aggressive edge , using loudly amplified instruments to create a barrage of " clanging " sounds , often expressing anger and defiance . A certain sense of despondency and restlessness entered the psyche of the youth in the United States ( and elsewhere ) , with a growing rise of alienation creeping into the collective mindset — even in the largely conservative suburban communities which produced so many garage bands . The garage bands , though generally apolitical , were nonetheless reflective of the tenor of the times . Nightly news reports entering living rooms across the country had an cumulative affect on the mass consciousness . <unk> in much of the music from this era is a combination of disparate emotions , particularly in light of President Kennedy 's assassination and the ongoing of escalation of troops into Vietnam , yet often while displaying an accompanying spirit of innocence . In 1965 , the influence of artists such as Bob Dylan , who had already superseded political protest by experimenting with surreal and abstract imagery , plugged in and went electric , became even more pervasive across the musical landscape , affecting a number of genres including garage rock . The members of garage bands , like so many musicians of the 1960s , were part of a generation that was largely born into the paradigm and customs of an older time , but that with the advent of television , nuclear weapons , civil rights , the Cold War , and space exploration , began to conceive , both individually and collectively , of a higher order of human relations and to reach for a set of transcendent ideals , sometimes experimenting with drugs , in a process that , while set to a backdrop of events that would ultimately prove disillusioning , held for a time great promise in the minds of many . While testing the previously uncharted frontiers of what the new world had to offer , 1960s youth ultimately had to accept the limitations of living in the new reality which was for some a painful " crash course " in history , yet often did so while experiencing the ecstasy of a difficult but apparently exalted moment when the realm of the infinite seemed somehow possible and within reach .

 Tapping into the psychedelic zeitgeist of the times , musicians found ways to push boundaries and explore new horizons . Garage acts , while generally lacking the budgetary means to produce musical extravaganzas on the scale of Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band or the instrumental virtuosity of acts such as Jimi Hendrix or Cream , nonetheless managed to combine esoteric elements with basic primitive rock . The 13th Floor Elevators from Austin , Texas , led by Roky Erickson infused their garage sound with psychedelic impulses , and are usually thought of as the first band to use the term " psychedelic " in their promotional literature with the phrase " psychedelic rock " appearing on their business card as early as January 1966 . On February 10 that year the Austin American Statesman claimed that " Unique Elevators shine with psychedelic rock " . The band would use the term in the title of their debut album released in November , The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators . The album featured the track " You 're Gonna Miss Me " which had been a regional hit for the band , along with other numbers such as " Fire Engine " and " Monkey Island " . The 13th Floor Elevators were not the first band to use the word " psychedelic " in an album title . In August 1966 , the Deep , a group of musicians assembled and led by Rusty Evans , traveled from New York to recorded a set of hallucinogenic songs at Cameo @-@ Parkway 's recording facility in Philadelphia for the resulting album , Psychedelic Moods : A Mind @-@ Expanding Phenomena released in October 1966 , one month before the 13th Floor Elevators ' debut LP , and whose all @-@ night sessions produced mind @-@ expanding stream of consciousness ramblings such as " Color Dreams " and " Pink Ether " , and " When Rain is Black " . 
 The Electric Prunes were one of the most identifiable garage rock bands to incorporate psychedelia into their sound . After the disappointing sales of their first single , they were placed under supervision of producer and recording engineer , David Hassinger , who teamed them with songwriters Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz and tailored psychedelic soundscapes for the group to fit the new songs , first resulting in a massive hit with " I Had Too Much To Dream ( Last Night ) " , whose opening featured a tremolo @-@ laden fuzz @-@ toned guitar suggesting the sound of a buzzing bee . They followed it up with " Get Me to the World on Time " , and both songs were included on their self @-@ titled debut album . Their second album , Underground , saw the band exercising a greater degree of creative freedom . However , after the album 's disappointing sales , the act became increasingly subordinate to the directives of Hassinger , who enlisted David Axelrod to compose the Gregorian chant @-@ influenced but ill @-@ fated Mass in F Minor in 1968 , eventually replacing the band 's members with session players , resulting in the " New Improved " Electric Prunes of the following year , yet allowing the new members to write much of their own material ' for 1969 's Just Good Old Rock and Roll . 
 The Chocolate Watchband 's music , while solidly grounded in Rolling Stones @-@ influenced protopunk , would occasionally stretch into whimsical flights of fantasy . Lead by guitarist Mark Loomis and fronted by charismatic lead singer David Aguilar signed with Capitol 's Tower label in 1966 and released several singles in 1967 , including " Are You Gonna Be There ( at the Love In ) " , which was also featured on their debut album No Way Out , which came out that same year not long after the band had appeared in the movie , Riot on Sunset Strip . The album 's opening cut was a feverish rendition of " Let 's Talk About Girls " , written by Manny <unk> and previously recorded by the Tongues of Truth ( aka the <unk> ) . The band briefly broke up but would return with a different lineup and recorded a second LP in 1968 The Inner Mystique , which featured their even more exotic reworking of We the People 's " In the Past " . The Blues Magoos came from the Bronx and had a breakout hit in 1966 with " ( We Ain 't Got ) Nothin ' Yet " . They would cut several albums , of which their debut Psychedelic Lollipop , released in November 1966 , was one of the first , along with those by the 13th Floor Elevators and the Deep , to use the term " psychedelic " in its title . It featured their extended version of the " Tobacco Road " , formerly recorded by England 's the Nashville Teens . They ventured even further into psychedelic on 1967 's Electric Comic Book , then followed with the more straightforward Basic Blues Magoos , released the following year . Strawberry Alarm Clock emerged from the ashes of garage outfit Thee Sixpence , who had recorded several sides for All @-@ American Records , such as the protopunk " My Flash on You " , originally written by Arthur Lee and recorded by Love , then as Strawberry Alarm Clock , scored a # 1 hit in 1967 with " Incense and Peppermints " . Guitarist Ed King played in both Thee Sixpence and Strawberry Alarm Clock and later re @-@ emerged in the 1970s as a member of Lynyrd Skynyrd . There were countless other garage rock acts who incorporated psychedelic influences into their music in the mid to late @-@ 1960s , such as The Third Bardo , from New York City , who released a single in 1967 for Roulette Records featuring " I 'm Five Years Ahead of My Time " , which was written by the Deep 's Rusty Evans . The song was banned by some radio stations for alleged LSD connotations , which band members denied . The Mystic Tide cut five singles , including the intensely overdriven " Frustration " , which was released on the Solid Sound label in March 1967 .

 Certain acts of the era conveyed a world view perceptibly removed from the implicit innocence of much psychedelia and suburban @-@ style garage , often infusing their work with subversive political and / or philosophical messages , dabbling in in seemingly radical concepts such as nihilism and new left ideology . Stylistically , such artists shared various characteristics with the garage bands in their use of primitivistic instrumentation and arrangements , as well as proto @-@ punk elements , while displaying psychedelic rock 's affinity for exploration — essentially creating a more urbanized , intellectual , and avant garde version of garage rock . New York City was the home to several such groups . The Fugs , who formed in 1963 , were one of rock 's first experimental bands and its core members were singer , poet , and social activist , Ed Sanders , along with Tuli <unk> , and Ken Weaver . They specialized in a highly satirical mixture of amateurish garage @-@ sounding rock , jug band , folk , and psychedelic laced with political commentary , as indicated on their 1965 debut , The Fugs First Album , featuring tracks such as " I Couldn 't Get High " , as well as " C.I.A. Man " , which later appeared as a CD bonus track . Their next album , The Fugs ( afterward re @-@ titled The Fugs Second Album ) , was released in 1966 and included the likes of " Kill for Peace " , " Dirty Old Man " , " Group Grope " , and " Frenzy " . In a 1970 interview , Ed Sanders would become the first known musician to describe his music as " punk rock " . The Godz were another New York group of the time who specialized in a highly experimental mixture of sounds , beginning with their rough @-@ hewn folk @-@ influenced first album , Contact High with the Godz , followed @-@ up by Godz II in 1967 , which made greater use of eclectic amplification in songs such as " Radar Eyes " , " New Song " and " Soon the Moon " , as well as their 1968 album The Third Testament . 
 The Velvet Underground , whose best @-@ known lineup consisted of Lou Reed , John Cale , Sterling Morrison , and Maureen Tucker , are now generally considered to be the foremost experimental rock group of this period . At the time of recording their first album , they were involved with Andy Warhol , who produced some its tracks , and his assemblage " <unk> " at the Factory , including model @-@ turned @-@ singer Nico . She briefly accompanied them on the resulting album , which was entitled , The Velvet Underground & Nico . The album 's lyrics , though generally apolitical , deal with hard drugs in songs such as " Waiting for My Man " and " Heroin " , and other topics considered taboo at the time . Their follow up , White Light / White Heat , saw the group stretching even further into the experimental realm , but after John Cale 's subsequent departure from the group , they began to move into a less avant garde direction on their next two albums . Henry Flynt & The <unk> were another New York @-@ based experimental rock combo headed by philosopher and multi @-@ media artist Henry Flynt , who had spent time working with <unk> artists such as Yoko Ono , and is sometimes credited with coining the phrase " conceptual art " and whose philosophy he has described as " cognitive nihilism " . For a short time in 1966 Flynt played with the Velvet Underground before forming his own group and proceeding record a series of tracks later that year , subsequently released almost forty years later on the retrospective album I Don 't Wanna . Like the Fugs , Henry Flynt & the <unk> ' lyrics were laced with agit prop and antiwar sentiments . Outside of New York , were the Monks , from Germany , whose members were American and former US servicemen , that chose to remain in Germany , where in 1965 they developed a highly experimental form of garage rock on their album Black Monk Time . The group sometimes wore habits and <unk> , mimicking the look of monks and specialized in a style of music featuring chanting and hypnotic percussion , but with nihilistic and anti @-@ war lyrics .

 In the wake of psychedelia , as rock music became increasingly sophisticated , garage rock began to decline in popularity . Though scores of garage bands had been signed to regional and major labels during the period of 1963 @-@ 1968 , most failed to achieve national success , for instance " Going All the Way " by the Squires was issued on a national label under Atco and is now regarded as a genre classic , but was not a hit anywhere . It is generally agreed that garage rock peaked both commercially and artistically around 1966 . In the wake of Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club and other late @-@ 1960s big @-@ production spectaculars , rock albums became increasingly elaborate and were now expected to display maturity , complexity , and sophistication , while the 45 single ceded to the long @-@ play album as the preferred medium . Progressive album @-@ oriented FM stations eventually overtook AM radio in popularity , and as the large major @-@ label record companies became more powerful and less willing to sign new acts , the once plentiful " mom and pop " independent labels of the mid @-@ 1960s began to fold one by one . Teen clubs that had served as reliable and steady venues for young groups began to close their doors . The garage sound disappeared at both the national and local level as amateur musicians faced college , work or the Vietnam War draft . New styles had either evolved out of garage rock or replaced it , such as psychedelic rock , acid rock , progressive rock , heavy metal , country rock , and bubblegum . By the end of 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts . The minor hit " Question of Temperature " by the Balloon Farm was one of the last examples of the form to garnish a degree of airplay around the country .

 The garage rock boom fizzled out at the end 1960s , but a handful of maverick acts , carried its torch into the next decade , seizing on its rougher edges , but brandishing them with increased audacity while employing a more aggressive approach to the form . Such acts , often retroactively described as " proto @-@ punk " worked in a variety of rock genres and came from different places , perhaps most notably Michigan , where in the wake of the mid @-@ 1960s garage scene , emerged a handful of hard @-@ rocking bands that specialized in a style that was heavy , yet highly energetic and primitive , as opposed the more sophisticated forms of hard rock typical of the period that often relied on long instrumental soloing and jams . In 1969 , debut albums by MC5 and the Stooges , both released on Electra Records , are now regarded as classic examples of post @-@ psychedelic proto @-@ punk . In January , MC5 , who had just a few years earlier recorded a fuzz @-@ driven rendition of Van Morrison 's " I Can Only Give You Everything " , released Kick Out the Jams , which was recorded live in 1968 . In August 1969 , the Stooges , fronted by Iggy Pop from Ann Arbor , premiered with a self @-@ titled album . The album was produced by John Cale , a former member of New York 's experimental rock group the Velvet Underground . Also from Ann Arbor came , the Up , who lived with the members of MC5 in White Panther Party founder John Sinclair 's commune and recorded a handful of songs including " Like an Aborigine " and " " I Don 't Need You " later issued on the Killer Up compilation . 
 The Stooges recorded their follow @-@ up with Funhouse in 1970 , produced by Don <unk> , previously in the original lineup of the Kingsmen and later his own group , Don and the Goodtimes . After being dropped from Electra Records , Iggy Pop landed a deal with Columbia as a solo artist but proceeded to make an album with the Stooges anyway ( now billed as Iggy & the Stooges ) called Raw Power ( 1973 ) , which began with the proto @-@ punk anthem " Search and Destroy " and was followed by a set of unrelenting " pounders " in that vein . Alice Cooper 's ( a.k.a. Vince Furnier 's ) garage band , the Spiders , who had become one of the most popular bands Phoenix , in 1967 relocated to Los Angeles in hopes of achieving wider success , but to no avail , so they changed their band name to Alice Cooper and in 1969 moved to Furnier 's home town of Detroit , where they began to take off , sporting a new " shock rock " image , which served their prospects well , and recorded 1971 's Love It to Death , which featured their breakout hit " I 'm Eighteen " . Though Alice Cooper 's appeal has become more commonly associated with heavy metal , he would be credited by Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols as a key influence and is sometimes considered proto @-@ punk . In 1974 , another Detroit band Death , made up of brothers David , Bobby , and <unk> Hackney , who were African American , recorded a series of demos in their home rehearsal space and went to Detroit 's United Sound Studios to record seven tracks to an album that would take over thirty years to be released , ... For the Whole World to See , which includes the proto @-@ punk anthems " Freakin ' Out " and " Rock n ' Roll Victim " . The following year they released single on their own label , <unk> , taken from the United sessions : " Politicians in My Eyes " b / w " Keep on Knocking , " pressed in a small run of 500 copies . Several of the band 's home demo tracks such as " Views " and " The Masks " are included on the Spiritual • Mental • Physical anthology . In the waning days of the Detroit scene , a group called the Punks recorded a batch of songs , including " My Time 's Comin ' " , " Q1 " , and " Drop Dead " , that display a thrashing sound indicative of later punk and hardcore , which was posthumously released on their 2003 anthology The Most Powerful Music on Earth . 
 In Boston , the Modern Lovers , led by Velvet Underground devotee Jonathan Richman , gained attention with their minimalistic style . In 1974 , an updated garage rock scene began to coalesce around the newly opened Rathskeller club in Kenmore Square . The Real Kids were founded founded by former Modern Lover John Felice and their roster included Willie Alexander and the Boom Boom Band , whose lead singer had been a member of the Velvet Underground for a few months in 1971 , as well as Mickey Clean and the Mezz . In the period between 1969 @-@ 1974 , there were other movements further removed from the American garage rock tradition , such as Glam and pub rock in Great Britain , as well as Krautrock in Germany , that nonetheless displayed hallmarks of proto @-@ punk and had an influence on the mid @-@ late 1970s punk movement . 
 = = = Critical identification and recognition = = = 
 When it was performed and recorded in the 1960s , garage rock was not thought of as a genre , but merely as typical rudimentary rock of the period , and had no name . However , in the early 1970s , certain rock critics began to speak nostalgically of the mid- ' 60s garage bands ( as well bands that they considered as continuing in their line , such as MC5 and the Stooges ) as a loosely defined but tangible genre , which they referred to as " punk rock " . Dave Marsh was the first music critic to employ the term in the May 1971 issue of Creem , when he described ? and the Mysterians as providing a " landmark exposition of punk rock " . Later in 1971 , in the fanzine Who Put the Bomp , Greg Shaw wrote about " what I have chosen to call ' punkrock ' bands — white teenage hard rock of ' 64 – 66 " . Robert Christgau writing for the Village Voice in October 1971 referred to " mid @-@ 1960s punk " as a historical period of rock @-@ and @-@ roll . Conjuring up a more innocent time , Lester Bangs in his June 1971 Creem essay , " Psychotic Reactions and <unk> Dung , " remarked about the mid @-@ 1960s garage bands : " ... then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds ' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter ... oh , it was beautiful , it was pure folklore , Old America , and sometimes I think those were the best days ever " . 
 Much of the revival of interest in garage rock can be traced to the release of the 1972 two @-@ disk album Nuggets compiled by rock journalist and future Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye , which drew together both commercially successful and relatively obscure tracks from the mid @-@ 1960s . In his general liner notes to Nuggets , Kaye used the term " punk rock , " to describe the genre of 1960s garage bands , and in the track @-@ by @-@ track notes , he mentioned the phrase " classic garage @-@ punk " to describe a song recorded in 1966 by the Shadows of Knight . In the January 1973 Rolling Stone review of Nuggets , Greg Shaw commented " Punk rock at its best is the closest we came in the 1960s to the original rockabilly spirit of Rock ' n Roll ... " In 1973 , Billy Altman launched the short @-@ lived punk magazine , which pre @-@ dated the better @-@ known 1975 publication of the same name , but , unlike the later magazine , was largely devoted to discussion of 1960s garage and psychedelic acts . 
 Though the phrase " punk rock " was the favored generic term in the early 1970s , " garage band ( s ) " was also occasionally used , mainly in reference to individual groups . In John Mendelsohn 's March 1971 Rolling Stone review of a Faces album where he alluded to " ... every last punk teenage garage band having its Own Original Approach ... " Since the advent of the New York and London scenes of 1975 – 78 , the term " punk rock " is now most commonly applied to groups emerging after 1974 , while sixties garage bands are now most often described as " garage rock " , but sometimes as " garage punk " , " ' 60s punk " , or along with successors , such as MC5 , the Stooges , and others , " protopunk " . 
 = = = Emergence of punk aesthetic and movement = = = 
 The 1972 Nuggets compilation would exert a marked degree of influence on the subsequent punk movement of the mid @-@ late 1970s . As a result of the popularity of Nuggets , and critical attention being paid to primitive @-@ sounding rock of past and present , a self @-@ conscious musical aesthetic began to emerge around the term , " punk " , that , with the eventual arrival of the New York and London scenes , grew into a subculture , having its own look , iconography , identity , and values . Iggy and the Stooges and others of their generation carried garage rock and protopunk into the early 1970s . But , the mid- to late @-@ 1970s saw the arrival of the bands most often viewed as the quintessential punk rock acts , most notably the Ramones , from New York , some of whose members had played in 1960s garage bands , . Book mentions that three of the original members of the Ramones had been in 1960s garage bands : Johnny and Tommy had been members of the Tangerine Puppets and Joey had been in the <unk> and who are usually considered the first punk band as the term is now commonly understood , as well as the Sex Pistols , from London . Both bands would spearhead the popular 1970s punk movement from their two respective locations . Though garage rock and protopunk influenced many of the bands from the New York and London scenes of this period , punk rock now emerged as a movement with a subculture all of its own , and the garage band era of the 1960s came to be viewed as a distant forerunner . 
 = = = Revivals 1980 @-@ present = = = 
 In the 1980s a more pronounced garage rock revival saw a number of acts earnestly attempting to replicate the sound , style , and look of the 1960s garage bands , such as the Chesterfield Kings , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the Lyres , in a way that was linked to the underground music scene of the period . This trend coincided with a similar surf rock revival , and both styles fed in into the alternative rock movement and future grunge explosion , which was partly influenced by 1960s garage bands from the Tacoma area such as the Sonics and the Wailers . 
 The revival movement evolved into an even more primitive form of garage rock that became known as garage punk by the late 1980s , thanks to bands such as the Gories , thee Mighty Caesars , the Mummies and thee <unk> . Bands playing garage punk differ from the garage rock revival bands in that they do not necessarily attempt to replicate the exact look and sound of 1960s garage bands and their overall approach tends to be even louder and rawer , often infusing elements of Stooges @-@ era protopunk and 1970s punk rock . But , the garage rock revival and garage punk have coexisted throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s , with many independent record labels releasing thousands of records by bands playing various styles of primitive rock and roll all around the world . Some of the more prolific of these independent record labels included Estrus , Get Hip , Bomp ! , and Sympathy for the Record Industry . 
 In the early 2000s , a garage rock or post @-@ punk revival achieved the airplay and commercial success that had eluded garage rock bands of the past . This was led by four bands : the Strokes of New York City , the Hives of <unk> , Sweden , the Vines of Sydney , and the White Stripes from Detroit , Michigan , christened by the media as the The bands , or " The saviours of rock ' n ' roll " . Other products of the Detroit rock scene included ; the Von Bondies , Electric 6 , the Dirtbombs and the Detroit Cobras Elsewhere , other acts such as Billy Childish and the Buff Medways from Chatham , England , the ( International ) Noise Conspiracy from Umeå , Sweden , the 5 @.@ 6 @.@ 7 @.@ 8 's from Tokyo , Japan , and Jay Reatard and the <unk> from Memphis , US enjoyed moderate underground success and appeal . A second wave of bands that managed to gain international recognition as a result of the movement included the Black Keys , Black Rebel Motorcycle Club , the Yeah Yeah Yeahs , the Killers , Interpol , and Kings of Leon from the US , the Libertines , Arctic Monkeys , Bloc Party , the Editors , and Franz Ferdinand from the UK , Jet from Australia , and the Datsuns and the D4 from New Zealand . 
 The mid @-@ 2000s saw several underground bands achieve some mainstream prominence . Artists such as Ty Segall , Thee Oh Sees , Black Lips and Jay Reatard , who initially released their records on traditionally garage punk labels such as In the Red Records , began signing to larger , more well @-@ known independent labels . Several bands followed them in signing to larger labels such as Rough Trade and Drag City .

 = Hurricane Fran ( 1973 ) = 
 Hurricane Fran , also referred initially as Subtropical storm Bravo , was a long @-@ tracked Category 1 hurricane that caused little damage during its existence in early October 1973 . Originating from a tropical wave that developed off the coast of Hispaniola on October 1 , the precursor to Fran slowly developing during the first week of October . By October 4 , a surface low formed within the system and convective activity increased . The system was eventually classified as a subtropical depression on October 8 and was upgraded to Subtropical Storm Bravo shortly thereafter . Bravo became increasingly tropical throughout the day as it intensified . Following a reconnaissance mission into the storm on October 10 , it was deemed fully tropical and upgraded to a hurricane , at which time it was renamed Fran . 
 Hurricane Fran rapidly tracked towards the northeast in response to an area of low pressure within the westerlies . By October 11 , the hurricane attained its peak winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and its lowest barometric pressure of 978 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 88 inHg ) after bypassing the Azores islands . Situated over exceedingly cold waters , Fran transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on October 12 as it neared the French coastline . Shortly before reaching land , the system was absorbed by a cold front . Throughout its existence , Fran had little effect on land . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Fran originated from a tropical wave associated with an area of convection north of Hispaniola on October 1 . The system tracked westward at 15 mph ( 24 km / h ) but gained little strength and the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) did not anticipate development of the storm . By October 4 , the system interacted with a mid @-@ tropospheric trough near the southeast United States , resulting in the formation of a surface low . Tracking eastward , showers and thunderstorms began to develop around the circulation ; however , the structure of the system was not fully tropical . On October 7 , ships in the vicinity of the low reported decreasing barometric pressures , indicating a strengthening system . Satellites monitoring the system depicted a disorganized storm with mainly subtropical characteristics . Late on October 8 , the cyclone had become sufficiently organized to be classified a subtropical depression . 
 Cold air from the remnants of a cold front became entrained within the circulation ; however , the cold air gradually warmed . On October 9 , winds increased to gale @-@ force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm , at which time it was given the name Bravo . By October 10 , Bravo had intensified substantially , as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane @-@ force winds roughly 15 mi ( 25 km ) from the center of the storm . Following this finding , the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran , dropping its previous designation of Bravo . Upon becoming tropical , Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands . Additionally , the storm had developed a 35 mi ( 55 km ) wide eye . 
 Steered generally eastward by a deep surface low in the westerlies , Fran accelerated towards the Azores Islands . The storm traveled at a rapid pace of 30 to 35 mph ( 48 to 56 km / h ) but continued to organize . By October 11 , the hurricane began to undergo an extratropical transition as it continued to move unusually fast towards the northeast . Around this time , Fran attained its peak winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Shortly after bypassing the Azores islands on October 12 , the system moved over an area with sea surface temperatures around 60 ° F ( 16 ° C ) , well below what is required for tropical cyclone development . Later that day , the central pressure of Fran decreased to 978 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 88 inHg ) , the lowest recorded in relation to the hurricane . Shortly after reaching this intensity , the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and quickly merged with a cold front off the coast of France . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Although Fran passed near the Azores as a hurricane , winds on the islands only reached 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and no damage was recorded . On October 12 , a French ship encountered the storm , recording sustained winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) and an air pressure of 981 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 97 inHg ) . Ships near the English and French coastlines recorded winds up to 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) as the extratropical remnants of Fran passed through the region .

 Ronald Paul " Ron " Fedkiw ( / <unk> / ; born February 27 , 1968 ) is a full professor in the Stanford University department of computer science and a leading researcher in the field of computer graphics , focusing on topics relating to physically based simulation of natural phenomena and level sets . His techniques have been employed in over twenty motion pictures . He has earned recognition at the 80th Academy Awards as well as from the National Academy for Science . 
 His Oscar was awarded for developing techniques that enabled many technically sophisticated adaptations including the visual effects in 21st century movies in the Star Wars , Harry Potter , Terminator , and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises . Fedkiw has designed a platform that has been used to create many of the movie world 's most advanced special effects since it was first used on the T @-@ X character in Terminator 3 : Rise of the Machines . Although he has won an Oscar for his work , he does not design the visual effects that use his technique .

 On February 9 , 2008 in the Academy Scientific and Technical Award ceremony at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills , California , Fedkiw was awarded an 80th Academy Award for Technical Achievement for the development of the Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) fluid simulation system . He shared the award with Nick Rasmussen and Frank <unk> Petterson . Fedkiw does physics @-@ based simulation that enable better water effects . Previous representations had varying levels of success . They often did well at surface representation , but were less efficient at smaller particles such as breaking waves . Fedkiw 's team 's innovative “ particle level set method ” allows both smooth surfaces and water breakdown renderings including water spray . Fedkiw has worked with Industrial Light and Magic , Pixar Animation Studios , Intel Corporation , Honda and Sony Pictures Imageworks . Fedkiw commented that when he was informed that he would be presented his award by Jessica Alba he was quoted by the Associated Press as follows : " They said I got 60 seconds so I might just spend the last 15 realizing I 'm 10 feet away from the most beautiful woman on the planet . . . and no restraining order this time .

 Fedkiw and his colleagues have designed a C + + code library for Physics Based Modelling ( <unk> http : / / <unk> ) that facilitates the creation of better special effects for movies , including water , smoke , fire , cloth , rigid bodies and deformable bodies . Fedkiw often receives screen credit for consulting with special effects engineers , technicians and movie executives . His research has focused on the design of new computational algorithms that can be used for many purposes , including computational fluid dynamics and soft body dynamics , computer graphics , computer vision and computational biomechanics . In fact , the system can also be used for a range of applications from motion capture to rendering , but Fedkiw 's main emphasis is on physics @-@ based simulation . 
 Fedkiw has described his work as follows : 
 It is an exhaustive task to prescribe the motion of every degree of freedom in a piece of clothing or a crashing wave . . <unk> these motions are governed by physical processes , it can be difficult to make these phenomena appear natural .

 = John Wheelwright = 
 John Wheelwright ( <unk> – 1679 ) , was a Puritan clergyman in England and America , and was most noted for being banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Antinomian Controversy , and for subsequently establishing the town of Exeter , New Hampshire . Born in Lincolnshire , England , he was raised in a family with substantial means , and received both a B.A. and M.A. at Sidney Sussex College , Cambridge where he was a noted athlete and where Oliver Cromwell was a college friend . Ordained in 1619 , he became the vicar of the church in Bilsby , Lincolnshire , and held this position for ten years until removed for simony . 
 Leaving for New England in 1636 , he was warmly welcomed in Boston , where his brother @-@ in @-@ law 's wife , Anne Hutchinson , was beginning to attract negative attention for her religious outspokenness . Soon he and Hutchinson , as adherents of Reverend John Cotton 's " covenant of grace " theology , accused the majority of the colony 's ministers and magistrates of espousing a " covenant of works " . As the pitch of this controversy reached a peak , both Hutchinson and Wheelwright were banished from the colony . Wheelwright went north with a group of followers during the harsh winter of 1637 – 1638 , and in April 1638 established the town of Exeter in what would become the Province of New Hampshire . Wheelwright 's stay in Exeter lasted only a few years , because Massachusetts activated an earlier claim on the lands there , forcing the banished Wheelwright to leave . He went further east , to Wells , Maine , where he was living when his order of banishment was retracted , though it was done in a way that still placed guilt upon him . From Wells he returned to Massachusetts to preach at Hampton ( later part of the Province of New Hampshire ) , where in 1654 his parishioners helped him get the complete vindication that he sought from the Massachusetts Court for the events of 17 years earlier . 
 In 1655 Wheelwright moved back to England with his family , and preached near his home in Lincolnshire . While in England he was entertained by two of his very powerful friends , Oliver Cromwell , who became England 's Lord Protector , and Sir Henry Vane , who occupied several key positions in the government . The political tide turned markedly during the more than six years he was there , and following Cromwell 's death and Vane 's execution , Wheelwright returned to New England to become the minister in Salisbury , Massachusetts , where he spent the remainder of his life . He was characterized as being contentious and unbending , but also forgiving , energetic and courageous . His sincere piety was never called into question , even by those whose opinions differed greatly from his . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Wheelwright , born about 1592 , was the son of Robert Wheelwright of <unk> and <unk> in Lincolnshire , England . When his father died in 1612 , Wheelwright administered the estate , and was also the heir to some property in Lincolnshire . His grandfather was also named John Wheelwright , and died at <unk> in 1611 . Young Wheelwright was educated at Sidney Sussex College , Cambridge , receiving his B.A. in 1614 / 5 and his M.A. in 1618 . When in college , Wheelwright had noteworthy athletic abilities , and Cotton Mather , the celebrated American Puritan , wrote , " when Wheelwright was a young spark at the University he was noted for more than an ordinary stroke at wrestling " . A friend and college mate of Wheelwright was Oliver Cromwell , who later gained prominence as the Lord Protector of England . 
 After college , Wheelwright was ordained a deacon on 19 December 1619 , and the following day was ordained a priest in the Anglican Church . On 8 November 1621 he married Mary Storre , the daughter of Thomas Storre , who was the vicar of Bilsby . In 1623 , upon the death of his father @-@ in @-@ law , Wheelwright became the Bilsby vicar and held this position for ten years . His first wife died in 1629 , and was buried in Bilsby on 18 May of that year . He soon thereafter married Mary Hutchinson , a daughter of Edward Hutchinson of Alford , and a sister of William Hutchinson , whose wife was Anne Hutchinson . 
 After ten years as the vicar , Wheelwright was suspended in 1633 following his attempt to sell his Bilsby ministry back to its patron to get funds to travel to New England . Instead of procuring the necessary funds , he was convicted of simony ( selling church offices ) , and completely removed from his office . After his removal from Bilsby he was likely in <unk> in June 1633 where his daughter Elizabeth was baptized . He then preached for a short while at Belleau , Lincolnshire , but was soon silenced by the Anglican authorities for his Puritan opinions , and began making plans for his emigration from England . Wheelwright left England in 1636 with his second wife , her mother Susanna Hutchinson , and his five living children . 
 = = Massachusetts = = 
 Wheelwright arrived in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony on 26 May 1636 , and was admitted to the Boston church on 12 June 1636 , with his wife , Mary , and her mother , Susanna Hutchinson . During the year of his arrival , several of the Puritan ministers of Massachusetts had taken notice of the religious gatherings that his relative by marriage , Anne Hutchinson , had been holding at her house , and they also began having questions about the preaching of John Cotton whose Boston parishioners seemed to them to be harboring some theologically unsound opinions . Wheelwright was a strong advocate of Cotton 's theology , as was Hutchinson , but their views differed from those of the majority of the colony 's ministers , and they soon became embroiled in a major clash over this issue . 
 = = = Theological views = = = 
 After his arrival in New England , Wheelwright preached primarily to the Boston settlers who owned land at Mount Wollaston , still considered a part of Boston , but located about ten miles south of the Boston meetinghouse . Within months , someone had alerted magistrate John Winthrop , a lay person in the Boston church , that Wheelwright was harboring familist and antinomian doctrines . <unk> , the theology of the Family of Love , involved one 's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit , coupled with freedom from both sin , and the responsibility for it . Antinomianism , or being freed from moral law under the covenant of grace , was a form of familism . Most of the New England Puritan ministers were adamantly opposed to these theological doctrines , seeing them as the cause of the violent and bloody ravages of the <unk> in Germany during the Münster Rebellion of the 1530s . When confronted with accusations of familism , Wheelwright denied preaching such a doctrine . While Winthrop and many of the colony 's ministers may have viewed Wheelwright as a familist , Cotton saw him as an orthodox minister . 
 = = = Antinomian Controversy = = = 
 As early as spring 1636 the minister of Newtown ( later renamed Cambridge ) , Thomas Shepard , began a correspondence with Boston minister John Cotton , and in his letters Shepard notified Cotton of his concern about Cotton 's theology , and of some strange opinions circulating among the members of the Boston church . Cotton , who advocated that God 's free grace was the only path to salvation , differed from all of the colony 's other ministers , who felt that sanctification ( works ) was a necessary ingredient to salvation . When Wheelwright arrived in the colony , he became a firm ally of Cotton in these theological differences . Opinions that were first shared in private correspondence soon began to find their way into Shepard 's sermons to his Newtown congregation . This " pulpit aggression " did not go unnoticed by Wheelwright , and soon his own sermons began taking a critical view of the " covenant of works " being preached by Shepard . 
 Theological tension was mounting in the colony , but it wasn 't until October 1636 when it became noticeable enough for Winthrop to record an entry in his journal . On or shortly after 21 October 1636 he noted the rising disunity , but instead of pointing fingers at one of the godly ministers , he instead put the blame on Wheelwright 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , writing , " One Mrs. Hutchinson , a member of the church at Boston , a woman of a ready wit and a bold spirit , brought over with her two dangerous errors : 1 . That the person of the Holy Ghost dwells in a justified person . 2 . That no sanctification can help to evidence to us our justification " . 
 Late in October the colony 's ministers confronted the question of religious opinions directly and had a " conference in private " with Cotton , Hutchinson , and Wheelwright . The outcome of this meeting was favorable , and the parties were in agreement . Cotton , whose theology rested on a covenant of grace , gave satisfaction to the other ministers that sanctification ( a covenant of works ) did help in finding grace in the eyes of God , and Wheelwright agreed as well . However , the effects of the conference were short @-@ lived , because a majority of the members of the Boston church , Cotton 's parishioners , held the free grace ideas strongly , and they wanted Wheelwright to become the church 's second pastor behind Cotton . The church already had another pastor , Reverend John Wilson , who was unsympathetic to the free grace advocates . Wilson was a friend of Winthrop , who was a layman in the church , and it was Winthrop who took advantage of a rule requiring unanimity in a church vote to thwart Wheelwright 's appointment . Though Winthrop " thought <unk> " of Wheelwright 's talents and piety , he felt that he was " apt to raise doubtful disputations [ and ] he could not consent to choose him to that place " . This was Winthrop 's way of suggesting that Wheelwright maintained familist doctrines . 
 In December 1636 the ministers met once again , but this meeting did not produce agreement , and Cotton warned about the question of sanctification becoming essentially a covenant of works . When questioned directly , Hutchinson accused the other ministers of preaching works and not grace , but did this only in private . These theological differences had begun to take their toll in the political aspects of the colony , and the Massachusetts governor , Henry Vane , who was a strong free grace advocate , announced his resignation to a special session of the deputies . While citing urgent matters back in England as being his reason for stepping down , when prodded , he broke down , blurting out his concern that God 's judgment would " come upon us for these differences and dissensions " . The members of the Boston church successfully induced Vane to withdraw his resignation , while the General Court began to debate who was responsible for the colony 's troubles . The General Court , like the remainder of the colony , was deeply divided , and called for a general fast to take place on 19 January in hopes that such repentance would restore peace . 
 = = = = Fast @-@ day sermon = = = = 
 During the appointed day of fasting on Thursday , 19 January 1637 , John Cotton preached in the morning , focusing his sermon on the need for pacification and reconciliation . Wheelwright then spoke in the afternoon , and while in the eyes of a lay person his sermon may have appeared benign and non @-@ threatening , to the Puritan clergy it was " censurable and incited mischief " . Historian Michael Winship more pointedly called it a " bitterly uncharitable sermon " and the " most notorious Boston contribution to the escalation of pulpit rhetoric " . There was no immediate reaction to the sermon , other than Winthrop noting in his journal that " the ministers were now disputing the doctrinal issues in their pulpits " . He also noted that Cotton alone was of one party against the other ministers , not even thinking of Wheelwright as being a player in the developing controversy . 
 As word of Wheelwright 's sermon circulated , however , Winthrop was made much more aware of its incendiary character , and he then wrote that Wheelwright " inveighed against all that walked in a covenant of works , " and concerning those who preached works , he " called them <unk> , and stirred up the people against them with much bitterness and <unk> " . The free grace advocates , on the other hand , were encouraged by the sermon , and intensified their crusade against the " legalists " among the clergy . During church services and lectures they publicly asked the ministers about their doctrines which disagreed with their own beliefs , and Henry Vane in particular became active in challenging the doctrines of the colony 's divines . 
 = = = = March trial = = = = 
 During the next two months the other ministers made several doctrinal charges against Wheelwright , noting not only his fast @-@ day sermon , but also his sermons at Mount Wollaston . When the General Court next met on 9 March , Wheelwright was called upon to answer for his fast @-@ day sermon . There were 12 magistrates and 33 deputies sitting on the court at the time , and of the magistrates , Henry Vane , William Coddington and Richard Dummer were strong Wheelwright partisans . Four of the other magistrates , John Humphrey , Simon Bradstreet , Richard Bellingham , and John Winthrop , Jr. were all known for their tolerance of religious diversity compared with their fellow magistrates . It was the deputies who led the case against Wheelwright , and the charge they brought against him was " preaching on the Fast Day a Heretical and Seditious sermon , tending to mutiny and disturbance " . After more charges and countercharges , Wheelwright presented a transcript of his fast @-@ day sermon to the court , and was then dismissed for the day . Following his departure , his supporters presented the court with a petition signed by more than forty people challenging the court 's right to try a case of conscience before it was heard by the church . The petition was rejected . 
 The next morning Wheelwright was given a private session with the court at which time he asked who his accusers were . The court 's answer was that his sermon was the accuser . That afternoon , the court was opened to the general public , and the colony 's ministers were also present . One of the lines of attack used against Wheelwright was identifying his doctrine , and that of Cotton , as being " False Doctrine " because of its difference from that of all of the other New England ministers . Cotton 's angry response to this was , " Brother Wheelwright 's Doctrine was according to God , " letting the court know that by going after Wheelwright they were going after him as well , and this essentially ended that line of attack . After some additional ineffective prosecutorial attempts , the court hit on the idea of asking the colony 's ministers if they felt they were attacked by Wheelwright 's sermon . Following an evening to discuss this among themselves , the ministers returned to the court the next day . With Cotton dissenting , the other ministers said that they did " walk in " and teach what Wheelwright called a covenant of works , and therefore they were the <unk> alluded to in the sermon . 
 To their credit , the ministers presented Wheelwright with a means to gracefully back down from the ordeal , and this greatly impressed Winthrop , who noted their " humanity and respect " . Wheelwright was intransigent , however , and not interested in any reconciliation , so the court continued with its course . Coddington later noted that " the priests got two of the magistrates on their side , and so got the major part with them " . With the deputies then casting their votes , Wheelwright was declared guilty of " contempt & sedition " for having " purposely set himself to kindle and increase " bitterness within the colony . Though sentencing was deferred to the next court , the controversy now became a political issue . 
 Wheelwright 's conviction did not pass without a fight , and his friends protested formally . Governor Vane and some of the magistrates and deputies who did not concur with the ruling wanted their dissenting opinion entered into the court record , but the court refused . They then tendered a protest which was also rejected . For this reason a remonstrance was prepared , penned by William Aspinwall , but the initial version was so belligerent that further edits had to be made to tone down the rhetoric . Even the final version veered dangerously away from being deferential , suggesting that the court was " meddling against the prophets of God " thus inviting the Lord 's retribution . However , the resentment over Wheelwright 's conviction was so high that over 60 men signed the document . Those who signed were not of little consequence either ; most of them were freemen , a large number of them held office or were among the colony 's wealthier inhabitants , and most had been in the colony more than three years . This petition became the pretext for severe penalties later inflicted upon the signatories .

 As the political aspects of the controversy intensified , Governor Vane was unable to prevent the Court from holding its next session in Newtown , where the orthodox party of most of the magistrates and ministers stood a much better chance of winning if the elections were held away from Boston . During election day , 17 May 1637 , Governor Vane wanted to read a petition in defense of Wheelwright , but Winthrop and his party insisted the elections take place first , and then the petition be heard . Following clamor and debate , the majority of freemen , wanting the election to take place , went with Winthrop to one side of the Newtown common and elected him governor in place of Vane . After this , additional measures were taken against the free grace advocates , and in the election of magistrates , those who supported Wheelwright were left out . In addition , the Court passed a law that no " strangers " could be received within the colony for longer than three weeks without the Court 's permission . Winthrop declared this law as being necessary to prevent new immigrants from being added to the number of his " free grace " opponents . 
 = = = = Order of banishment = = = = 
 When the court met again in August 1637 , Wheelwright was informed that if he would retract his obnoxious opinions " he might expect favor " . To this he responded that if he were guilty of sedition , he ought to be put to death , and if the court intended to sentence him , he should appeal to the king . No further action was taken , and his sentencing was again deferred . 
 The next session of the General Court began on the 2nd of November 1637 at the meeting house on Spring Street in Newtown . Wheelwright biographer Charles Bell wrote that the purpose of the meeting was to " rid the colony of the sectaries who would not be <unk> into the abandonment of their convictions " . One of the first orders of business on that Monday was to deal with Wheelwright , whose case had been long deferred by Winthrop in hopes that he might finally see the error of his ways . When asked if he was ready to confess his offenses , Wheelwright responded that " he was not guilty , that he had preached nothing but the truth of Christ , and he was not responsible for the application they [ the other ministers ] made of it " . Winthrop painted a picture of a peaceful colony before Wheelwright 's arrival , and how after his fast @-@ day sermon Boston men refused to join the Pequot War effort , Pastor Wilson was often slighted , and controversy arose in town meetings . The court urged him to leave the colony voluntarily , but this he would not do , seeing such a move as being an admission of guilt . Wheelwright was steadfast in his demeanor , but was not sentenced as the court adjourned for the evening . On Tuesday , after further argument in the case , the court declared him guilty and read the sentence : 
 Mr. John Wheelwright being formerly convicted of contempt and sedition , and now justifying <unk> and his former practise , being to the disturbance of the <unk> peace , hee is by the Court <unk> and banished . 
 Wheelwright was initially given until March to leave the colony , but when ordered not to preach during the interim , he refused , and was then given two weeks to depart the jurisdiction . When asked to give security for his peaceful departure , he declined , but later realized the futility of defiance after spending a night in custody . When directed not to preach during his two weeks of preparation , he again refused , and this time the court determined that such an injunction was not worth pursuing .

 Following the events of the Antinomian Controversy , some families went north with Wheelwright into the Province of New Hampshire , and others went south with the Hutchinsons to Aquidneck Island . With some loyal friends , Wheelwright removed to the Piscataqua region about 50 miles ( 80 km ) north of Boston and spent the severe winter of 1637 to 1638 at <unk> . Following the winter , he purchased the rights of the Indian <unk> of <unk> and his son , and founded the town of Exeter , New Hampshire on 3 April 1638 . His wife , children , and mother @-@ in @-@ law left Mount Wollaston to reach the embryo settlement at about this time . About 20 married men were there by spring 1638 , about half of whom had ties with Wheelwright back in Lincolnshire , England . Almost immediately a house of worship was built with Wheelwright as the pastor . The need of a government soon became apparent , and in 1640 a combination ( governing agreement ) was drawn up by Wheelwright and signed by himself , the members of the church , and other area inhabitants . By contrast to the turmoils that infected the settlement at Aquidneck , Wheelwright 's Exeter community began smoothly . 
 = = = Wells = = = 
 Wheelwright 's stay in Exeter was short @-@ lived , however , as the Bay Colony planted a settlement at Hampton , which included Wheelwright 's purchase in its jurisdiction , and this put the banished Wheelwright in Massachusetts territory . He then began looking for a new place to settle , and two of his partners from the 1638 purchase , Samuel Hutchinson and Nicholas Needham , began prospecting the region to the northeast . On 24 September 1641 they obtained a license from Thomas Gorges , the deputy governor of Maine , for a property that became Wells , Maine . 
 Wheelwright purchased 400 acres ( 1 @.@ 6 km2 ) of land on the <unk> River and almost immediately built a sawmill and a house for his large family . His mother @-@ in @-@ law , Susanna Hutchinson , accompanied the family , and died there not long afterward . A considerable number of his Exeter parishioners accompanied him to Wells so a church was built at once , and he was its pastor . The people he left behind in Exeter continued to hold Wheelwright in the highest regard , and were slow to give up their hope that he might return to them . 
 = = = = Lifting of banishment = = = = 
 Wheelwright probably felt that he could make peace with Massachusetts without undue difficulty . In September 1642 , while still in Exeter , an application for reconciliation was made on his behalf , to which the Bay Colony replied that he would be given safe conduct to return to Boston and petition the court . While he does not appear to have acted in that regard , Massachusetts was interested in mending fences , and without solicitation they again invited him to the General Court to be held on 10 May 1643 . This prompted him to communicate with some of the ministers there , and they were so pleased with his demeanor that they likely coached him on how to frame a letter to the General Court . He wrote this letter on 10 September , and it reached Boston on 4 October 1643 . The court was heavily inclined to retract the order of banishment , and again he was offered safe conduct to present his case to the court . John Winthrop had even sent a personal letter to him , to which he responded . In this letter Wheelwright , who may have come across as being too submissive in his first letter , now rested his claim for acquittal on justice , rather than mercy . He was not willing to desert his principles , though he " made a manly concession of his error , to bring about reconciliation and peace , as was eminently becoming his sacred calling " . Upon receipt of Wheelwright 's second letter , Winthrop recommended that he appear in court in person , but this he was not willing to do . The matter then rested until 29 May 1644 when the legislature acted without Wheelwright 's physical presence , and made the following pronouncement : 
 that Mr. Wheelwright ( upon <unk> , <unk> and serious <unk> & concession by letter , of his <unk> carriages & of ye Ct 's justice upon him for them ) hath his <unk> taken of , & is received in as a member of this commonwealth . 
 The added italics show that the Court perverted the honest intent of his letters , and extended to him their grace based on an admission he never made .

 While this correspondence was taking place , another issue arose when , in early 1644 , a publication entitled A Short Story of the Rise , reign and ruin of the Antinomians , Familists & Libertines that infected the Churches of New England ... was published in London . The author of the work was never stated , though the Reverend Thomas Weld provided the introduction and preface . Scholars through the years have almost unanimously attributed the authorship of this work to John Winthrop , and John Cotton said as much in a book he published in 1648 . It was hardly a balanced account of events , and Wheelwright biographer Charles Bell wrote that " it may be characterized as a very bitter and partisan production , even for that day " . 
 Wheelwright received intelligence concerning this publication at about the time he received the letter lifting his banishment with its unwarranted assumptions . He was deeply stung by the tenor of this work , coming at a time when he was making serious inroads into putting the events of the controversy behind him with the help and encouragement of some influential magistrates and ministers in the Bay Colony . He did not want his friends and relatives in England to get their impressions of his time in New England from this unfair account of those who had opposed him . To defend his character , Wheelwright obtained the assistance of some friends to help him publish a response to Short Story . In 1645 , Mercurius Americanus was published in London under the name of John Wheelwright , Jr . , presumably his son , who was in England attending Jesus College , Cambridge at the time . Bell says of this work , " in tone and temper , it is incontestably superior to the Short Story , and , while devoted especially to the vindication of its author 's doctrinal views , agreeably to the school of polemics then in vogue , it contains some key retorts upon his detractors , and indicates a mind trained to logical acuteness , and imbued with the learning of the times " .

 After more than five years at Wells , Wheelwright received an invitation from the church and town of Hampton , then under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts , to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a pastor of the church there . Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town . He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts , or 24 June 1647 by another . The job afforded the 55 @-@ year @-@ old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did , an important consideration given the large size of his family . No longer in a frontier setting , he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement , more aligned with his educational background . 
 = = = = Vindication by the court = = = = 
 While the town acknowledged his service with gifts of land and remuneration , their greatest gift came in a different form — a vindication from the Massachusetts General Court . The Short Story , prefaced by Reverend Weld , was largely accepted in England , and had been endorsed by the prominent Scottish divine , Reverend Samuel Rutherford . Wheelwright had probably long felt that some reparation was due for the attitudes conveyed in both the Short Story and in his release from banishment , and his Hampton townsmen were likely well aware of this . On 1 May 1654 they drafted a petition to the legislature , and on 3 May the General Court made the following declaration : that they were 
 not willing to recall those uncomfortable differences that formerly passed betwixt this Court and Mr. Wheelwright , concerning matters of religion or practise , nor do they know what Mr. Rutherford or Mr Wells [ Weld ] hath charged him with , yet they <unk> <unk> to <unk> that Mr. Wheelwright hath long since given such satisfaction both to the Court & elders generally as that he is now , & so for many years hath bin , an officer in ye church at Hampton <unk> [ sic ] o [ u ] r jurisdiction , & yt w [ i ] <unk> offence to any so far as we know & as we are informed , he hath been a useful & <unk> [ sic ] instrument of <unk> much good in that church . 
 = = = = Self published vindication = = = = 
 While his vindication from the Massachusetts court allowed Wheelwright to mend his relationships with his brethren in New England , he still felt stung by the accusations of the authors of the Short Story , and of Samuel Rutherford in his 1648 work , A Survey of the Spiritual Antichrist ... , and he was intent in clearing his name with people back in England . In 1658 Edward Cole of London published Wheelwright 's A Brief and Plain Apology , whose lengthy subtitle read " Wherein he doth vindicate himself , From al those Errors , Heresies , and <unk> Crimes , <unk> to his charge by Mr. Thomas Weld , in his short story , And further <unk> upon him by Mr. Samuel Rutherford in his Survey of <unk> " . 
 Wheelwright 's purpose in publishing this work was so that his innocence and the unfairness of his trial be recognized , and that " his views on the process by which the saved acquired grace be accepted as correct , even orthodox " . He chose to emphasize seven theological issues which he divided into three " propositions , " and four " theses " . The three propositions consisted of the substance of Wheelwright 's doctrine , which provided the basis for his fast @-@ day sermon . Following the propositions , but before the theses , are nine pages of text recounting the events and personalities of the Antinomian Controversy . Here Wheelwright says that justice was not served , and that he was accused of the political crimes of sedition and contempt , when the real reason for his banishment was doctrinal differences with the other ministers . He goes on to accuse his prosecutors of engaging in " underhanded dealings , " and working in secret . He had learned of these dealings through a magistrate friend ( possibly William Coddington ) who secretly transcribed some of these proceedings and gave them to him . In this section Cotton 's defense of Wheelwright is included : " I do conceive and profess that our Brother Wheelwright 's Doctrine is according to God ... " ( these words published by Cotton in his 1648 Way of Congregational Churches Cleared ) . Wheelwright then wraps up this middle section by " vehemently accusing Weld of lying , " and deceiving his readers . 
 The four theses stem from the synod of 1637 , and herein Wheelwright portrays himself as an orthodox minister following the lead of such early reformers as Calvin , Zanchi , the Synod of Dort , Beza , Perkins and others . As his theses become repetitious of his propositions , they become abbreviated , and he returns to the accusations made in Short Story . He ends his work claiming that he was right all along , and that he was not an Antinomian . 
 The writing of Wheelwright 's Brief and Plain Apology may have commenced as early as 1644 when Short Story was published , but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654 . In the first half of this work , Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person , clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece . Later in his Apology , however , Wheelwright refers to the authors ( plural ) of Short Story , realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material . Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld , he certainly had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop , since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside . Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader , respected in both England and the colonies , and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name . 
 = = England = = 
 In late 1655 , Wheelwright moved back to England with his family , to the home town of his wife , Mary . He had received his final salary payment from the Hampton church in the late summer , but was preaching in Alford , Lincolnshire by 12 December when a salary augmentation of £ 60 was to be granted " to John Wheelwright , minister of Alford , co . Lincoln , who has a great charge of children ... " This remuneration was in addition to a £ 40 salary already allowed . 
 Extraordinary events had recently transpired in England , with King Charles I executed , power in the hands of a commoner , and freedom of the pulpit given to Puritans . The commoner in power was a personal friend of Wheelwright , the Lord Protector , Oliver Cromwell , with whom Wheelwright had gone to college . Henry Vane , who had been very close to Wheelwright during the events of the Antinomian Controversy , had also reached high positions in government . These two prominent men had been working side by side for political and religious liberty , but became estranged and hostile towards each other in the early 1650s . Vane had retired from public life while Cromwell moved into the highest position of authority in England . Wheelwright was well received by Cromwell , who once described his classmate this way : " I remember the time when I was more afraid of meeting Wheelwright at football than I have been since of meeting an army in the field , for I was infallibly sure of being tripped up by him " . Wheelwright wrote a letter to his church in Hampton , dated 20 April 1658 , in which he described his meeting with Cromwell , writing , " I had discourse in private about the space of an hour . All his speeches seemed to me very orthodox and gracious " . 
 Wheelwright probably spent most of his time in England in Lincolnshire , and besides preaching in Alford he likely preached at Belleau , the estate of Sir Henry Vane " who had greatly noticed him since his arrival in the kingdom " . It is possible that Vane encouraged Wheelwright to publish his Apology . After the death of Cromwell in 1658 , events became less favorable for England 's Puritans . When the monarchy returned to power under King Charles II in 1660 , Vane was imprisoned for his role during England 's Interregnum and then executed in June 1662 . With this situation , Wheelwright returned to New England in the summer of 1662 with several other ministers who had been visiting the kingdom . 
 = = Salisbury = = 
 Wheelwright 's position at the church in Hampton had , as expected , been filled during his absence , but he was quickly called by residents of the neighboring town of Salisbury to be their pastor , and on 9 December 1662 , when 70 years old , he was installed there . This became Wheelwright 's longest pastorate in his varied life , lasting nearly 17 years . 
 Probably the most noteworthy event of his tenure in Salisbury occurred very late in his life when Major Robert Pike , a layman and very prominent member of his church , collided with him during the winter of 1675 to 1676 . There may have been multiple reasons for the severe friction between the men , one of them being that Wheelwright was against the Quaker insurgence into New England , whereas Pike was much more tolerant of their evangelism . Another reason may have been that during the election of 1637 , Pike traveled all the way from Newbury to Newtown to vote Governor Vane out of office . A more recent and local cause of dissension was likely over the division of Salisbury when the town of Amesbury was created from it several years earlier . Pike had made certain claims of Wheelwright , to which Wheelwright wrote a petition to the court , and on 10 March 1676 the court sided with Wheelwright . Not easily rebuked , Pike enlisted support from other members of the church and town , following which Wheelwright called for intervention by civil authorities . 
 The intervention did not occur immediately , leaving the two sides to cast aspersions at each other . While a majority of church members supported Wheelwright , a large minority were in support of Pike , and when the brethren attempted to subject Pike to discipline for misconduct , he contemptuously refused the judgment , and Wheelwright then excommunicated him from the church . In the spring of 1677 several disaffected members of the church and town petitioned the court that Wheelwright was the cause of the disturbance , and that his preaching had a tendency to pit one person against another , and requested he be removed from the ministry . Pike 's biographer wrote in 1879 that Pike " opposed Wheelwright , and the arbitrary devices of his church polity , to the extent of incurring excommunication " . The legislature appointed a committee , earlier proposed by Wheelwright , and through much effort was able to establish a peace . Both parties were assigned fault in the matter , Pike was required to make a concession of his faults , and the church was prompted to return him to communion . From all that is known , the matter was resolved , and did not recur . 
 In October 1677 , Wheelwright sold his property in Lincolnshire , ( purchased of Francis Levett , gentleman ) to his son @-@ in @-@ law Richard Crispe , the husband of his youngest daughter , Sarah . In June 1679 , Wheelwright was given , following a much earlier recommendation , an assistant , the Reverend George Burroughs , who later became the only minister executed during the Salem witch trials . 
 At nearly 87 years old , Wheelwright died of apoplexy on 15 November 1679 and was buried at the East Village Graveyard , where no marker had been placed for the next 200 years . The graveyard became the Colonial Burying Ground of Salisbury , and memorials have since been installed recognizing Wheelwright 's historical significance . 
 = = Wheelwright deed of 1629 = = 
 In 1707 a deed was found among the ancient files of York County , Maine , near where Wheelwright had brought his flock to settle in Wells . The deed , dated 17 May 1629 , showed Wheelwright as being one of several recipients of land from the Indian <unk> of southern New Hampshire , and a signer of the document . The deed thus implied that Wheelwright was present in New England in 1629 , even though he was known to be the vicar of Bilsby in Lincolnshire at the time . While many historians declared the deed to be a forgery , Charles H. Bell , in his biography of Wheelwright in 1876 , presented the case that the deed could be legitimate . It was known that as the vicar of Bilsby , Wheelwright was required to send a transcript of the parish registers to a central repository once a year , and this was done in March . However , of the several transcripts found with Wheelwright 's signature attached , the one for March 1629 could not be found , leaving the door wide open to the possibility that Wheelwright had come to New England during this time frame and then returned to England . Sometime after Bell published his book on Wheelwright , the missing transcript was found , proving almost conclusively that Wheelwright had never left England during his ministry at Bilsby , and demonstrating with certainty that the deed of 1629 was a forgery . Sometime before his death , Governor Bell acknowledged the sequence of events and that the deed was an ingenious fabrication , and stated this in an undated letter to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Charles Bell , in his biography of Wheelwright , provided a mixed assessment of the character of Wheelwright , calling him contentious , lacking a conciliatory spirit , and never one to shrink from controversy . In Massachusetts he was to blame for much of the temper and spirit which he displayed , when " by a more moderate carriage he might have mitigated the bitterness of the strife ... " However , Bell found him to be neither intractable nor unforgiving , and called him notably energetic , industrious and courageous . His sincere piety was never called into question , even by those with whom he differed most widely . 
 Governor Winthrop , although he favored the proceedings against Wheelwright , said publicly that " he did love that brother 's person , and did honor the gifts and graces of God in him " . New England divine and historian Cotton Mather spoke of him as " being a man that had the root of the matter in him " . Historian and Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson called him " a zealous minister , of character both for learning and piety " and New Hampshire historian Jeremy Belknap styled him " a gentleman of learning , piety and zeal " . 
 Wheelwright Hall at Phillips Exeter Academy , the Wheelwright room at the Exeter Town Office , Wheelwright Pond in Lee , New Hampshire , site of a battle during King William 's War , and Wheelwright Avenue in Exeter are all named for him .

 Wheelwright had 12 children , 10 of whom survived to adulthood . With his first wife , Mary Storre , Wheelwright had four children , three of whom survived childhood , and came to New England . The oldest child of this marriage , John Wheelwright ( military officer ) , lived in Wells and was a Colonel in the Maine militia , involved in the Indian wars at home . With his second wife , Mary Hutchinson , Wheelwright had eight more children . The first three were baptized in England , and two survived , leaving him with five children during his immigration to New England . They had five more children born after arriving in New England , all of whom survived and married . 
 = PTV ( Family Guy ) = 
 " PTV " is the fourteenth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Family Guy . It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 6 , 2005 . The episode sees the U.S. Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) censor the shows on television after a controversial wardrobe malfunction at the Emmy Awards . Peter starts to create his own TV network which he calls PTV , broadcasting classic shows unedited and uncut , as well as original programming . PTV is a big success and Stewie and Brian join him creating shows for the network . Lois calls the FCC to close PTV as she is concerned over the issue of how children will be influenced by Peter 's programming . Not only do the FCC close down the network , but they also start censoring the citizens of Quahog , so the Griffin family travels to Washington , D.C. and convince the Congress to have the FCC 's rules reversed . 
 The episode was written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild and was directed by Dan Povenmire . The episode is a response to the FCC 's measures to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy . Show creator Seth MacFarlane commented that the episode 's plot was inspired by the rage of the Family Guy crew towards the strict rules that the FCC made after the controversy . The episode contains a sequence of various scenes from different previous episodes . Many of the scenes were cut from the episodes they were originally made for owing to Fox 's internal censors . " PTV " gained a Nielsen rating of 4 @.@ 4 , making it the week 's 19th most @-@ watched program . The episode gained mostly positive responses from critics , and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Animated Program ( for Programming Less Than One Hour ) as well as an Annie Award nomination for directing . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In a lengthy sequence completely unconnected to the main plot of the episode , after preventing Osama bin Laden from sending a hostile message to the United States , Stewie , parodying the opening scene for The Naked Gun , rides off on his tricycle , cycling through scenes from various movies and video games . He eventually arrives at his house and bikes into the garage where he runs over Homer Simpson , then Peter comes through the door , greets Stewie , looks down on the floor and wonders , " Who the hell is that ? " 
 Peter wakes up Lois by noisily installing a red carpet in his bedroom , anticipating watching the Emmy Awards , but Lois forces him to go to Meg 's school play . Her school play is supposed to be a reference to musical Godspell . The next day , Peter learns about David Hyde Pierce 's wardrobe malfunction at the Emmys and gets angry at Lois for missing the Emmy Awards and not being able to see it . Having received a small number of phone calls from citizens concerning the incident , The FCC decides to censor any content from television even the slightest that could be feared harmful to viewers under the orders of their straightforward chairman , Cobra Commander . Peter is enraged at the FCC 's actions , and on the advice from Channel 5 News reporter Tom Tucker , he decides to start his own TV network , which he calls PTV , on which he broadcasts classic shows unedited and uncut , and later introduces original programming such as Glenn Quagmire 's Playboy After Dark @-@ esque Midnight Q , Dogs Humping , and The Peter Griffin <unk> Hour . 
 PTV becomes a huge success , and Brian and Stewie , impressed by the hits , join in to help Peter expand his television programming , as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV . Lois is furious about everyone 's lust for perverted TV , as she is concerned over the issue of how children will be influenced by his programming ( in the episode 's DVD release , Peter and Cleveland , in a parody of Jackass , defecate on top of Lois 's car ) . Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV . Regardless of that , Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down . This prompts Peter , Brian , and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC 's regulations are . Despite being impressed with the song , the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV . When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can 't stop people from being who they are or how they live their lives , they decide to take on the challenge . 
 As such , the FCC representatives start to censor any foul language and inappropriate behavior in Quahog , ruining their times of privacy ; for instance , a black " censor 's bar " is pulled over Peter 's genitals by FCC employees as he leaves the shower , all expletives are overdubbed with an air horn , and audible farts are banned in public ( replaced with a dubbing of Steven Wright punchlines ) . Everyone in Quahog is angered by this , except for Lois , who approves of the FCC 's actions , believing that everyone in Quahog needs a lesson in decency . However , she realizes that the FCC 's presence puts her and Peter 's sex life to a stop after they prevent her and Peter from having any real sex , even if no one 's watching ( specifically banning thrusting , tongue @-@ kissing , moaning and any movement whatsoever ) . Peter angrily blames her , thus causing her to become guilty for letting this happen . They lobby Congress to have the FCC 's rulings reversed . At first they disagree due to their strong support of the FCC , but they relent when Peter angrily retorts by making them realize the resemblance of many Washington buildings to various private parts and any other body parts associating with it , such as the Capitol Building to a breast . The oppression of the FCC is finally gone , Lois congratulates Peter for beating the FCC on its tracks , and the family settles down to watch an uncensored episode of The Brady Bunch that features bathroom jokes .

 The episode was co @-@ written by Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild . Patrick Meighan , John Viener , Cherry Chevapravatdumrong , Tom Devanney and Kirker Butler acted as staff writers in the episode . The episode was shown in the William S. Paley TV Fest . The plot of " PTV " is a parody of the FCC 's measures after Janet Jackson 's incident in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy . In an interview MacFarlane was asked where the inspiration to the episode ’ s plot came from , in his response he commented that " In the case of ' PTV ' it came out of rage . Rage over all the crap we have to deal with since Janet Jackson showed her 67 year old boob . " 
 The episode was directed by Dan Povenmire , while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director . Various scenes in " PTV " were taken out of the episode due to Fox 's international censors . As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up , as the Chicago Tribune describes it , " horse trading " with Fox , removing a body @-@ part reference in exchange for a dirty word . While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode , they were happy with the final result . The opening sequence , of which Family Guy 's creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud , was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short . The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons ; Povenmire recalled the sequence ; about it he stated that " I just found those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in . Basically because I didn 't want to draw all those things ! I found the most disgusting images from the first three seasons . And we actually got network notes on two of them saying , ' You 're gonna have to cut that ! ' And I went , ' This has been on the air ! And I 'm only showing 8 frames of it ! ' And it turns out we cut them now when they 're on the air . So apropos for the FCC episode . "

 Robert D. " Bob " McEwen ( born January 12 , 1950 ) is a lobbyist and American politician of the Republican Party , who was a member of the United States House of Representatives from southern Ohio 's Sixth District , from January 3 , 1981 to January 3 , 1993 . Tom <unk> of Cleveland 's Plain Dealer described him as a " textbook Republican " who is " opposed to abortion , gun control , high taxes , and costly government programs . " In the House , he criticized government incompetence and charged corruption by the Democratic majority that ran the House in the 1980s . McEwen , who had easily won three terms in the Ohio House , was elected to Congress at the age of thirty to replace a retiring representative in 1980 and easily won re @-@ election five times . 
 After a bruising primary battle with another incumbent whose district was combined with his , in which McEwen faced charges of bouncing checks on the House bank , he narrowly lost the 1992 general election to Democrat Ted Strickland . Following an unsuccessful run in the adjacent Second District in 1993 , McEwen was largely absent from the Ohio political scene for a decade , until in 2005 he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Congress in the Second District special election to replace Rob Portman , who beat him in 1993 , and finished second to the winner in the general election , Jean Schmidt . McEwen 's 2005 platform was familiar from his past campaigns , advocating a pro @-@ life stance , defending Second Amendment rights , and promising to limit taxes and government spending . In 2006 , he unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the Second District .

 Born in Hillsboro , Ohio , McEwen graduated from Hillsboro High School in 1968 . He earned a Bachelor 's in Business Administration from the University of Miami in Coral Gables , Florida in 1972 . He also attended The Ohio State University 's College of Law for one year from 1972 to 1973 . 
 McEwen is married to the former Elizabeth " Liz " <unk> and has four children : Meredith , Jonathan , Robert , and Elizabeth . He is a member of many fraternal organizations and civic groups , including Sigma Chi , the Farm Bureau , the Grange , Rotary International , the Jaycees , and the Optimist Club . He is a member of the Church of Christ . 
 After two years in his wife 's family real estate business , serving as a vice president of <unk> , Inc . , he was elected at the age of twenty @-@ four to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1974 from the 72nd House District representing southern Ohio . McEwen 's district contained parts of Clinton , Fayette , Greene , and Highland Counties and all of Madison County . He was re @-@ elected to two more two @-@ year terms . In 1976 , his plurality against Democrat L. James Matter was 14 @,@ 816 votes , a number larger than the votes cast for Matter . ( McEwen received 27 @,@ 657 to Matter 's 12 @,@ 841 . ) McEwen was a supporter of the state lottery in the House . Having previously directed Sixth District Congressman Bill Harsha 's re @-@ election campaigns to Congress in 1976 and 1978 , McEwen ran for Harsha 's seat when he retired in 1980 . Harsha was neutral in the eight @-@ man primary that McEwen won but supported McEwen in the general election where he defeated psychologist and minister Ted Strickland , Harsha 's opponent in 1976 and 1978 , who went on to become Governor of Ohio . 
 = = Congressional career = = 
 In Congress , McEwen , who " had a reputation as a man who thinks about politics every waking moment , " claimed Congressional Quarterly , was a staunch conservative , advocating a strong military . In addition , he was a strong advocate for government works in his district — dams , roads , locks and the like much as Harsha had been — as McEwen was on the House 's Public Works and Transportation Committee . The Chillicothe Gazette would salute him for his work on funding for U.S. Route 35 , a limited access highway linking Chillicothe to Dayton . In general , however , McEwen advocated reduced government spending . 
 A vehement anti @-@ Communist , he visited Tbilisi in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia in 1991 to help tear down the hammer @-@ and @-@ sickle iconography of the Communist regime . That year he also called for the House to establish a select committee to investigate the Vietnam War POW / MIA issue – whether any soldiers declared " missing in action " in the Vietnam War and other American wars were still alive – by sponsoring H.

 When McEwen was first elected in 1980 , the Sixth District of Ohio consisted of Adams , Brown , Clinton , Fayette , Highland , <unk> , Pike , Scioto , and Ross Counties plus Clermont County outside the city of Loveland , Harrison Township in Vinton County and the Warren County townships of <unk> , Deerfield , Hamilton , Harlan , Massie , Salem , and Wayne . The Washington Post described the Sixth as " a fail @-@ safe Republican district . " It had been in Republican hands since a 1959 special election . 
 The Ohio General Assembly redrew the Sixth District following the results of the 1980 Census . The boundaries from 1983 to 1987 included all of Adams , Clinton , Fayette , Highland , Hocking , Jackson , Pike , Ross , Scioto , Vinton and Warren Counties , plus Waterloo and York Townships in Athens County ; Wayne Township in Clermont County ; Concord , Jasper , Marion , Perry , Union , and Wayne Townships in Fayette County ; and Washington Township and the Cities of Miamisburg and West Carrollton in Montgomery County . 
 Effective with the 100th Congress in 1987 , adjustments were made by the legislature to the boundaries . A small part of the Montgomery County territory was detached , as were parts of Fayette County in Washington Court House in Union Township and the townships of Jasper and Marion . Part of Brown County was added , Jackson and Eagle Townships . These were the boundaries for the rest of McEwen 's service in Congress . 
 The district was largely rural and agricultural with no large cities . One of the major industries was the United States Department of Energy 's Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant at <unk> , which manufacted uranium for nuclear weapons . The district was 97 % white with a median household income of $ 21 @,@ 761 .

" When McEwen was late in 1990 to the House because of a massive traffic jam on the I @-@ 495 beltway around Washington , D.C. , he said on the House floor on February 21 that the District of Columbia 's government should be replaced : 
 The total incompetence of the D.C. government in Washington , DC , has become an embarrassment to our entire Nation . This experiment in home rule is a disaster . All of us who serve in this Chamber , well over 95 % of us , have held other positions in government . We have been mayors . We have been township trustees , State legislators , and the rest . I am convinced , Mr. Speaker , that there are well over 2 @,@ 000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs , could blindfolded do a better job of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated , that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city . 
 After McEwen was criticized for his remarks , he delivered a thirty @-@ minute speech in the House on March 1 , 1990 , on " The Worst City Government in America " . Because of the crime problem in the District , McEwen also attempted to pass legislation overturning the District council 's ban on mace , saying people in the District should be able to defend themselves . During the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , McEwen introduced legislation to end President Gerald Ford 's ban on U.S. government employees assassinating foreign leaders ( Executive Order 12333 ) in order to clear the way for Saddam Hussein 's removal , McEwen objecting to the " cocoon of protection that is placed around him because he holds the position that he holds as leader of his country . "

 In October 1987 , encouraged by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas , McEwen announced he would challenge Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum , a Democrat , in his 1988 bid for re @-@ election , but McEwen found he lacked statewide support and would face a strong primary challenger in Cleveland mayor George V. Voinovich . He dropped out of the race in December . McEwen 's name was floated in 1991 as a possible challenger in 1992 to Ohio 's other senator , John Glenn , another Democrat , but McEwen did not enter the race .

 McEwen was easily re @-@ elected to the House in every election but his last .

In the rematch , McEwen outspent Roberts twenty @-@ to @-@ one , $ 884 @,@ 754 to $ 43 @,@ 485 . McEwen in 1990 beat his opponent , Raymond S.

The tally was 117 @,@ 200 to 47 @,@ 415 in a race where Mitchell was outspent seventeen @-@ to @-@ one , McEwen spending $ 196 @,@ 934 and Mitchell $ 11 @,@ 171 . Congressional Quarterly 's Politics in America pronounced him " invincible " in his district . 
 = = = In the spotlight in his last term = = = 
 McEwen served on the Public Works and Transportation and Veterans ' Affairs Committees from his election to 1991 . By 1989 , he had risen to be the ranking minority member of the Public Works Committee 's Economic Development Subcommittee and was sixth in seniority on the full committee . During the 99th and 100th Congresses , he was also a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence . During his last term , in the 102nd Congress , he left Public Works and Veterans ' Affairs for the powerful Rules Committee and served on its Legislative Process Subcommittee . He was chosen for the Rules Committee by Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois , but McEwen would grumble that " the Committee on Rules is stacked in a partisan manner 2 to 1 plus 1 " by the Democratic majority . During the 102nd Congress , he was also on the Select Committee on Children , Families , and Youth . 
 Late in his Congressional career , he began regular appearances on public affairs programs such as Nightline and the MacNeil @-@ Lehrer NewsHour and was often a guest on C @-@ SPAN and the Cable News Network . Martin Gottlieb of the Dayton Daily News , a Democratic newspaper , thought McEwen 's performances showed why he had remained in the background previously : 
 In the past , McEwen 's ambition has taken the form of interest in higher office . Twice he made feints about seeking statewide office . But he didn 't want to risk his congressional seat . Now he 's found a way to nurse a healthy level of ambition without taking that risk . He has , of course , a pronounced tendency to be wrong about the issues . . . . Most typically , he appears as an ideological combatant . He seems to be selling himself to the nation 's conservatives as an attractive spokesman . He 's got enough talent to do it . In the days when McEwen was content to be a back @-@ bencher , he was criticized on this page for his irrelevance on the important issues . Now , however , it is clear that the nation as a whole was better off when he was keeping his views to himself . 
 In his decade in Congress , McEwen compiled a conservative voting record , usually scoring in the single digits in the annual Americans for Democratic Action ratings and 85 % or higher in the American Conservative Union 's similar polls , though McEwen was never one of the most conservative Republicans in the House nor the most conservative Republican in the Ohio delegation . 
 McEwen often joined his fellow Republicans in making special order speeches in the House , which occur after the business for the day has concluded and are made to a nearly empty chamber . McEwen 's ally Newt Gingrich of Georgia had discovered that , thanks to the C @-@ SPAN cable network 's promise of " gavel @-@ to @-@ gavel coverage " of the House , he and his fellow conservatives such as McEwen , Mississippi 's Trent Lott , California 's Robert K. Dornan , and Pennsylvania 's Robert S. Walker could speak directly to Americans . Congressional Quarterly wrote viewers often found " McEwen playing the trusty sidekick Sancho Panza to Bob Dornan of California , both tilting at the latest liberal windmill . "

 = = = New district lines = = = 
 McEwen easily won re @-@ election in every race save his last and was seen as unbeatable in his district . However , Ohio lost two seats in the 1990 reapportionment . The Democrats and Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly struck a deal to eliminate one Democratic and one Republican district , as one congressman from each party was expected to retire . The Republican expected to retire was Clarence E. Miller , a thirteen @-@ term veteran called " chairman of the caucus of the obscure " for his invisibility on Capitol Hill . However , Miller surprised everyone by deciding to run for a fourteenth term . The Democrats in the Statehouse would not reconsider the deal and Miller 's Tenth District was obliterated . 
 The new district map was not agreed upon by the General Assembly until March 26 , 1992 , one week before the filing deadline for the primary originally scheduled for May 5 . Governor George Voinovich signed the new map into law on March 27 , and on April 1 the General Assembly moved the primary to June 2 . Miller 's hometown of Lancaster was placed in freshman David Hobson 's Springfield @-@ based Seventh District , but Miller chose to run in the Sixth District against McEwen since the largest piece of his old district — five counties — was placed in the new Sixth . Miller 's decision was also impacted by his strong personal distaste for McEwen . 
 After being hurt in a fall in his bathtub after slipping on a bar of soap , Miller was expected to withdraw and the Republican leadership hoped for a deal as late as May 15 , the day Miller was to hold a press conference Ohio political observers thought he would use to announce his withdrawal . However , Miller stayed in the race and the two incumbents faced each other in the Republican primary on June 2 , 1992 . 
 = = = House banking scandal = = = 
 McEwen was caught up in the House banking scandal , which had been seized upon by Newt Gingrich , a like @-@ minded conservative House Republican , as an example of the corruption of Congress ; members of the House had been allowed to write checks on their accounts , which were paid despite insufficient funds and without penalty . Martin Gottlieb of the Dayton Daily News said " McEwen was collateral damage " to Gingrich 's crusade . McEwen initially denied bouncing any checks . Later , he admitted he had bounced a few . Then when the full totals were released by Ethics Committee investigators , the number was revealed to have been 166 over thirty @-@ nine months . McEwen said that he always had funds available to cover the alleged overdrafts , pointing to the policy of the House sergeant at arms , who ran the House bank , paying checks on an overdrawn account if it would not exceed the sum of the Representative 's next paycheck . In 1991 , McEwen had also been criticized for his use of the franking privilege and his frequent trips overseas at taxpayer expense , but McEwen defended the trips as part of his work on the Intelligence Committee and in building relationships with legislatures overseas . 
 = = = Miller and McEwen spar = = = 
 The primary race was bitter . Miller called McEwen " Pinocchio , " and McEwen said of Miller , " His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan . I tried to be his best friend in the delegation . I am deeply disappointed at the meanness of his effort . " Tom <unk> of Cleveland 's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues : " both are textbook Republican conservatives , opposed to abortion , gun control , high taxes , and costly government programs — unless located in their districts . " Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank , saying , " the score is 166 to nothing . " McEwen said " every one of my checks was free and clear . Every month 's statement had a balance . " McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long @-@ time congressman " has fallen out of touch with Ohio " and " doesn 't live in our district and isn 't even registered to vote here . " Miller struck back in a live @-@ television interview by taking a Wheat Thin , claiming it to be McEwen , and then taking a bite out of it . 
 = = = Close results = = = 
 The 1992 primary was so close it forced a recount and prompted a lawsuit . When Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft dismissed Miller 's charges of voting irregularities in Highland , Hocking and Warren counties , Miller filed suit in the Ohio Supreme Court . Miller dropped his court challenge in August and then only because his campaign treasury was exhausted . In the final count , McEwen won 33 @,@ 219 votes to Miller 's 32 @,@ 922 , a plurality of 297 votes . In the end , McEwen 's geographic advantage ( he retained 59 % of his old territory ) put him over the top . Ominously , however , Miller trounced him in the five counties that had been in Miller 's old district . 
 After the final result , Miller refused to endorse McEwen , though McEwen tried to soothe feelings by introducing H.R. <unk> in the House to name the dam and locks on the Ohio River near <unk> after Miller . Miller carried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the United States Supreme Court , insisting district lines should be drawn on a politically neutral basis . 
 = = = Defeated in the general election = = = 
 The old Sixth District was centered in southwestern and south @-@ central Ohio around McEwen 's hometown , Hillsboro . After redistricting , McEwen found himself running in a huge area stretching from Lebanon to Marietta . This new district was very difficult to campaign in . It spilled across six media markets , meaning that McEwen had to buy ads in cities where most of the viewers couldn 't vote in the district . It also lacked any large cities and possessed few unifying elements . His Democratic opponent was psychologist Ted Strickland , whom he had defeated in his initial run in 1980 . 
 Pat Buchanan , the conservative columnist who challenged President Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries , came to Ohio to campaign for McEwen , as did Vice President Dan Quayle and Oliver North . Though George H. W. Bush won the district , McEwen was narrowly defeated by Strickland in the general election on November 3 . While he won 55 @-@ 45 in the area he once represented , McEwen did not win in any of the counties that had once been in Miller 's district , losing the unfamiliar territory 59 @-@ 41 . Strickland received 122 @,@ 720 votes to McEwen 's 119 @,@ 252 , a plurality of only 3 @,@ 468 . " I think McEwen 's loss was a case of bounced checks and some arrogance , " said Alfred <unk> , a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati who runs the Ohio Poll . " He just had a certain personal arrogance about him that didn 't go down well in a poor district . " Strickland said , " I ran against Pat Robertson , Pat Buchanan , the National Rifle Association and Right @-@ to @-@ Life . They threw everything at me . I 'm just so happy I beat back those guys . I think they 're so divisive . " 
 = = Runs in the Second District in 1993 = = 
 McEwen then sought election to the House in the Second District near Cincinnati , immediately west of his former district , and which contained some territory he represented in the 1980s . The election was to fill the vacancy caused by Willis D. <unk> 's resignation to become a lobbyist for the insurance industry on January 31 , 1993 , three months after his re @-@ election . " It 's important that we have an experienced person to fight for jobs for Southwest Ohio . We need to bring economic growth to our area , " McEwen said . " It 's important that we have someone who can hit the ground running , representing our values of economic growth and low taxes . " Though a congressman does not need to live in the district he represents , McEwen put his home in Hillsboro up for sale and rented a home in Bethel in Clermont County . 
 In the Republican primary on March 16 , McEwen faced trade lawyer Rob Portman , who had worked in the White House under President George H. W. Bush ; real estate developer Jay Buchert , the president of the National Association of Home Builders ; and several lesser known candidates : real estate appraiser Garland Eugene Crawford of Loveland ; pro @-@ life activist Ken Callis of the Cincinnati suburb of Wyoming ; Robert W. Dorsey , a professor at the University of Cincinnati and township trustee in Hamilton County 's Anderson Township ; and Ku Klux Klan leader Van Darrell Loman of Cheviot . Three other candidates filed and qualified but withdrew from the primary , former Madeira mayor Mary Anne Christie ; Lebanon attorney Bruce <unk> , a member of the Warren County Republican Party 's central committee ; and Donnie Jones , city auditor in Norwood . 
 In February the press reported that , according to campaign finance filings , McEwen trailed both Buchert and Portman in funds , Buchert having three times the treasury McEwen did . McEwen was endorsed by Oliver North , whose prosecution in the Iran @-@ Contra Affair McEwen had labeled a " political witch hunt " when he was in Congress . McEwen also criticized Portman for lobbying Congress to pass the tax increase President George H. W. Bush supported when Portman was a White House aide . He also criticized Portman for being a lobbyist for Oman . McEwen brought his former House colleague Jack Kemp to Ohio to campaign for him . 
 McEwen faced questions about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank . Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen 's checks , the expenses of his Congressional office , and his campaign finance disclosures , while noting Portman was " the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd " and was " a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington , " labeling Portman and McEwen " Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob . " McEwen , who had taken a hard @-@ line on his checks in 1992 , relented in the campaign . Martin Gottlieb wrote , " McEwen says now that his problem was a form of excessive pride . He says he used to ' demand perfection ' of himself . " McEwen also said , " I felt I could never admit a mistake . . . . I am very , very sorry . I should have watched it more carefully . . . . I have learned a great deal . " Les Spaeth , chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor , said , " People very much disliked the check overdraft thing , but I think they don 't see it as happening again . I think it 's past . He made a mistake and he got caught . But that 's overridden by the service he 's given , particularly to our county . " 
 After his successor in Congress , Ted Strickland , found election @-@ related files on his office computers , questions were raised about whether McEwen had been illegally using his House office in his re @-@ election campaign in 1992 . McEwen 's former chief of staff said McEwen knew nothing about it , and the chief of staff admitted " a technical violation of the rules . " 
 McEwen won four of the five counties in the district — Adams , Brown , Clermont and Warren . In Adams , once part of his district , he received 77 % of the vote , sixty @-@ seven points ahead of Portman . However , McEwen finished third in the largest county in the district , Hamilton , one he had never represented and which contained 57 % of the Second District 's registered voters . In the primary , Portman won only Hamilton County , but by a large enough margin to win the primary with 17 @,@ 531 votes ( 35 @.@ 61 % ) , while McEwen received 14 @,@ 542 ( 29 @.@ 54 % ) , Buchert 12 @,@ 488 ( 25 @.@ 37 % ) , Dorsey 2 @,@ 947 ( 5 @.@ 99 % ) , the rest scattering . The race in the Second District , one of the most Republican in the country , was determined in the primary — six times as many Republicans as Democrats voted in the primary — and Portman easily defeated attorney Lee Hornberger 53 @,@ 020 ( 70 @.@ 1 % ) to 22 @,@ 652 ( 29 @.@ 1 % ) in the special election on May 4 . 
 Following the primary , the Dayton Daily News criticized McEwen for having voters return absentee voter request forms to his campaign office rather than directly to the county boards of elections . The Daily News also said the " primary was completely about personalities , rather than issues . "

 After his defeat , McEwen remained active in politics , but press accounts said he spent most of his time in the Washington , D.C. , area residing in northern Virginia . Since 1997 , he has been a partner with eleven other former Members of Congress in the Washington firm Advantage Associates , a lobbying and consulting firm . He founded <unk> International , an international investment banking firm based in Washington , D.C. McEwen took to the lecture circuit , delivering speeches for $ 10 @,@ 000 apiece . During the 2004 presidential election , McEwen traveled widely to speak for George W. Bush , focusing on Ohio . In 2006 , he joined the law firm of <unk> , Doll , and McDonald as a consultant in its Cincinnati and Washington offices . 
 = = 2005 congressional run = = 
 Days after President George W. Bush nominated Second District Congressman Rob Portman to be United States Trade Representative in March 2005 , McEwen announced he would run for Portman 's seat . He then moved from his home in Fairfax Station , Virginia and purchased a second residence , a condominium in Hamilton County 's Anderson Township , east of Cincinnati . McEwen drew upon his connections and quickly had high @-@ profile endorsements from Focus on the Family leader James Dobson , former United States Attorney General Edwin Meese , Cincinnati Bengals player Anthony Muñoz , American Family Association president Donald Wildmon , Citizens for Community Values anti @-@ pornography crusader Phil Burress , and former New York congressman Jack Kemp , who came to the district to campaign for him . Kemp said in a rally in Clermont County on May 20 that " Bob and his wife Liz are like part of our family . " Dobson wrote in his endorsement letter , " I have rarely been more excited about a candidate running in a highly significant race than I am about Bob McEwen for Congress . . . . If Bob returns to the House of Representatives , he will once again emerge as a tireless champion for the family and for traditional conservative values . " 
 Ed Meese came to Cincinnati on May 31 to campaign for McEwen saying " Ronald Reagan relied on him heavily . " Rival candidate Pat DeWine , a Hamilton County Commissioner and the son of Senator Mike DeWine , the same day questioned McEwen 's post @-@ Congressional career as a lobbyist , issuing a press release saying " no one who has ever served in Congress ought to be allowed to become a lobbyist . Ever . " Congressman John Boehner , whose Eighth District was to the west of the Second , endorsed McEwen on June 7 . Boehner was a freshman in McEwen 's final term . He said , " Bob is the most qualified to step in and represent that district . " The Congressmen from other neighboring districts , Steve Chabot and Mike Turner , were silent in the primary race . McEwen a week before the primary was reported to have raised $ 366 @,@ 429 , McEwen donating $ 250 @,@ 000 to his campaign ; DeWine 's total was $ 743 @,@ 407 . 
 DeWine focused his attention on the most experienced candidate , McEwen . DeWine attacked McEwen with charges used against him in his last two campaigns . <unk> charged McEwen had " wasted taxpayers ' money " by having the most expensive Congressional office of any Ohio member of the U.S. House and criticized McEwen 's bouncing of 166 checks on the House bank . DeWine also tried to depict McEwen as a carpetbagger , asking in television advertisements " If Bob McEwen really cares about us , why has he spent the last twelve years living in Virginia ? " McEwen denied he had bounced any checks , repeating what he had claimed in 1992 and insisted that he had continued to reside in Ohio since he lost his re @-@ election bid , noting he had never voted in Virginia nor held a Virginia drivers license . ( McEwen did not live in the second district until April 11 , when he bought a condominium in Anderson Township ; but DeWine did not live in the district until he bought a home there on April 6 . ) DeWine quoted correspondence from the Highland County Board of Elections claiming the Board had cancelled McEwen 's voter registration for living in Virginia . 
 DeWine also questioned McEwen 's record on taxes , sending out mailings criticizing McEwen 's vote on May 24 , 1982 in the 97th Congress " in support of a Democrat budget that raised out taxes by $ 233 billion . " Two mailings focused on this issue , one featuring a photograph of Ronald Reagan that was captioned " When President Reagan Needed Votes to Keep Taxes Low , Bob McEwen Said ' NO ' " , the other asking " Are We Still the Party of Lower Taxes ? " 
 Jean Schmidt , a former member of the Ohio House , benefited from the conservative vote being split by McEwen and Tom Brinkman . The official returns showed Schmidt had won with 14 @,@ 331 votes ( 31 % ) . McEwen finished second with 11 @,@ 663 ( 25 % ) , Brinkman was third with 9 @,@ 320 ( 20 % ) , and DeWine , who spent $ 1 million on his campaign , finished a distant fourth with 5 @,@ 467 ( 12 % ) . The remaining vote was split by the seven others , none of whom received more than 5 % . Following the primary , McEwen campaigned with Schmidt in the general election against the Democratic nominee , attorney Paul Hackett .

 On October 12 , 2005 , the Internet domain name <unk> was registered . McEwen also considered a campaign for Lieutenant Governor as the running mate of Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell , who sought to replace Bob Taft as Governor . On December 16 , 2005 , The Cincinnati Enquirer reported McEwen was considering challenging Schmidt for her congressional seat in 2006 and had formed an exploratory committee . " I am in serious consideration , " he told the newspaper . On January 18 , 2006 , McEwen confirmed that he would run in the May 2 primary against Jean Schmidt . He started his campaign with little in the way of reserve cash . " I won 't let this distract me from my duties as a congresswoman , " Schmidt told The Cincinnati Enquirer upon McEwen 's announcement . " I have a job to do . I can 't worry about this . " Anti @-@ pornography activist Phil Burress told the Associated Press that a race between Schmidt and McEwen would be tough . " They are two totally different types of personalities . Bob is a statesman , and I love that . Jean will get in your face in a heartbeat , and I like that too , " said Burress . Also running were Deborah A.

So I 'm knowledgeable of the issue and what 's going on .

 " Nature Boy " is a song first recorded by American jazz singer Nat King Cole . It was released on March 29 , 1948 , as a single by Capitol Records , and later appeared on the album , The Nat King Cole Story . The song was written in 1947 by eden ahbez and is partly autobiographical . It is a tribute to ahbez 's mentor Bill Pester , who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophies , which ahbez practised . When Cole was performing in 1947 at the Lincoln Theater , ahbez wanted to present the song to him , but was ignored . He left the copy with Cole 's valet , and from him the singer came to know of " Nature Boy " . After receiving appreciation for his performance of the song , Cole wanted to record it . 
 The recording took place on August 22 , 1947 , and featured an orchestra conducted by Frank De Vol — the in @-@ house arranger of Capitol Records . He used strings and flute as instrumentation in the song , to capture the " enchanting " vibe of the track . The lyrics are a self @-@ portrait of ahbez and his life . The final line — " The greatest thing you 'll ever learn , Is just to love and be loved in return " — is considered a poignant moment in the song , with multiple interpretations of it . " Nature Boy " was released amidst the American Federation of Musicians ( AFM ) ban of 1948 , but became commercially successful , reaching the top of the Billboard music charts and selling over a million copies . Receiving critical acclaim also , " Nature Boy " helped to introduce Cole to a wider audience , especially the white music market , and generated royalties for ahbez . In 1999 , the song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame Award . However , " Nature Boy " was also the subject of lawsuits , with Yiddish composer Herman Yablokoff claiming that it was plagiarized from his song " <unk> <unk> harts " ( " Hush My Heart " ) , which he wrote for his play <unk> ( 1935 ) . In the end , ahbez and Yablokoff settled out of court . 
 Following Cole 's success with the song , rival record companies released cover versions of " Nature Boy " by other artists like Frank Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan , which were also successful . It ultimately became a pop and jazz standard , with many artists interpreting the song , including Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga , who recorded it for their jazz collaborative album , Cheek to Cheek ( 2014 ) . It was also used in numerous films like The Boy with Green Hair , The Talented Mr. Ripley and the 2001 musical , Moulin Rouge ! , for which singer David Bowie recorded a techno version .

 In 1941 , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the <unk> , a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard . The café was owned by John and Vera Richter , who followed a Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophy influenced by the Wandervogel movement in Germany . Their followers , known as " Nature Boys " , wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables . McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name " eden ahbez " , writing and spelling his name with lower @-@ case letters . It was there , while living in a cave near Palm Springs , that ahbez wrote " Nature Boy " . Partly autobiographical , the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester , who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform . 
 In 1947 , at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer , ahbez approached Nat King Cole 's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles , handed him a tattered copy of " Nature Boy " , and asked him to show it to Cole . However , his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of " Nature Boy " with Cole 's valet , Otis Pollard . From him , Cole came to know of the song and loved it . Cole began playing " Nature Boy " for live audiences , and he received much acclaim . Irving Berlin , who was present during one of the performances , initially offered to buy the track from Cole , but Cole decided to record it for himself . He needed to get permission from ahbez , however , before releasing it as a single , but he was not able to find the songwriter since ahbez had disappeared without providing any contact details . After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign , Cole got his permission and recorded the song .

 Cole 's recording , which took place on August 22 , 1947 , featured an orchestra conducted by Frank De Vol — the in @-@ house arranger of Capitol Records . He used strings and flute as instrumentation in the song , to capture the " enchanting " vibe of the track . The first two measures of the song 's melody parallel the melody of the second movement in composer Antonín Dvořák 's Piano Quintet No. 2 ( 1887 ) . Written as a pop ballad , " Nature Boy " follows an " A , B " format , with the primary three notes descending on a minor triad above the pickup note . An ascending line over the diminished ii chord returns to the initial minor triad . The harmonic structure makes frequent use of the standard ii – V – I progression in the key of D minor . The second 4 @-@ bar section featured a chromatic descending line based on the lowering of the tonic ( Dm – <unk> – Dm7 – <unk> ) . The same descending line then continues through <unk> – Dm , then finally ending with a whole @-@ step down to the G in the chord Em7 ♭ 5 . 
 The lyrics of the song relate to a 1940s Los Angeles @-@ based group called " Nature Boys " , a subculture of proto @-@ hippies of which ahbez was a member . Instrumentalist Chris <unk> noted that the lyrics are a musical self @-@ portrait of ahbez , with the lines like " There was a boy , A very strange , enchanted boy , They say he wandered very far , Very far , over land and sea " . But he believed that it was the song 's last line that made it the most poignant : " The greatest thing you 'll ever learn , Is just to love and be loved in return " . Various interpretations of the line are given by academics , with the eponymous nature boy being a child , advising on love and relationship , or an adult hippie talking about his journey and inner @-@ love . According to author Jeffrey P. Dennis , the song presented a homo @-@ romantic theme , with the eponymous nature boy visiting Cole on a " magic day " and explaining that " the greatest thing you 'll ever learn , is just to love and be loved in return " . Author Raymond Knapp described the track as a " mystically charged vagabond song " whose lyrics evoked an intense sense of loss and <unk> , with the final line delivering a universal truth , described by Knapp as " indestructible " and " salvaged somehow from the perilous journey of life " . According to Joe Romersa , an engineer / drummer in Los Angeles , whom ahbez bequeathed with master tapes , photos , and final works , ahbez wanted a correction made to the lyrics saying " To be loved in return , is too much of a deal , and there 's no deal in love . " , and that instead it should read " The greatest thing you 'll ever learn is to love and be loved , just to love , and be loved . " Romersa has stated that because these lyrics did not fit with the original ending melody , <unk> re @-@ wrote it . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 In 1948 , a second " Petrillo ban " on music recording was enforced by American Federation of Musicians ( AFM ) in response to the Taft – Hartley Act . Capitol Records was desperate to release something for sustaining any profit , and ultimately released " Nature Boy " as a single on March 29 , 1948 , with catalog number <unk> . Crestview Music , which owned publishing right for Cole 's songs , sold the rights for " Nature Boy " to Burke @-@ Van Heusen , who acted as distributor and selling agent . The record debuted on the Billboard charts of April 16 , 1948 , and stayed there for 15 weeks , ultimately peaking at number one . It also reached a peak of number two on the R & B charts . " Nature Boy " went on to sell a million copies in 1948 and Billboard DJs listed it as the greatest record of the year , with the song accumulating a total of 743 points . The 1940s , American music market was divided by race and for a black artist to cross over to mainstream pop music was difficult . Author <unk> Gabbard noted in his book Jammin ' at the Margins : Jazz and the American Cinema that Cole had to wear white makeup while filming for the performance of the song . Although he had come into prominence in 1930 as a leader of the jazz trio named King Cole Trio , it was with " Nature Boy " that he received widespread recognition , and it was his rendition that appealed to the white audience . Cole would later use the success of the song to cancel the trio and pursue a solo recording career ; he later described " Nature Boy " as one of his favorites among his recordings . The success of the song allowed ahbez to accumulate about US $ 20 @,@ 000 ( $ 196 @,@ 981 in 2016 dollars ) in royalty . However , Billboard reported that ahbez kept only 50 % of the royalty for himself , and distributed the rest among people who had helped him in bringing the song to limelight . About 25 % was shared with Mrs. Loraine Tatum for helping him with the lyrics and the rest with Pollard , for bringing the song to Cole 's notice . 
 " Nature Boy " has received wide acclaim from critics and contemporary reviewers . Author Ted Gioia noted in his book , The Jazz Standards : A Guide to the Repertoire , that all the musicians " who had created the golden age of American popular song had their quirks and idiosyncrasies , but eden ahbez demands pride and place as the most eccentric of them all " . He added that along with promoting the hippie culture , with " Nature Boy " , ahbez and Cole was able to introduce a new era of black artists in white popular music . In his book Sinatra ! the Song is You : A Singer 's Art , author Will Friedwald complimented Cole 's version , saying that it had been the " <unk> fresh " combination of the singer 's vocals along with the string section , which had made " Nature Boy " a hit . Stephen Cook from AllMusic said that the song transformed Cole into " one of the most famous and beloved pop singing stars of the postwar years . " Billboard noted that such was the popularity of the song that audiences would only stay in theaters to see Cole perform " Nature Boy " , and leave once he finished . A 1975 poll by the magazine listed it as the " Greatest All @-@ Round Record " as well as the " Favorite Pop Recording " of the previous years . In 1999 , the song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame , a special Grammy Award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty @-@ five years old and that have " qualitative or historical significance " . Steve Erickson from Los Angeles magazine gave a detailed positive review of the song : 
 " Nature Boy " is so otherworldly in its melody and lyric that any number of interpretations over the decades , from Nat Cole 's to Alex Chilton 's , have never been able to make it ordinary . It sounds like something that , from the minute it was written , existed out of time and place — all thousand and one Arabian Nights compressed into two and a half minutes as mediated by a cracked Mojave Debussy slugging down the last of the absinthe from his canteen . 
 Yiddish theatre composer Herman Yablokoff claimed in his biography , Memoirs of the Yiddish Stage , that the melody to " Nature Boy " was plagiarized from his song " <unk> <unk> harts " ( " Hush My Heart " ) , which he wrote for his play <unk> ( 1935 ) . When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the <unk> , ahbez first proclaimed his innocence , and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he " had heard the melody as if angels were singing it ... in the California mountains . He offered me $ 10 @,@ 000 to withdraw the suit . I said that the money was not important , but I wanted him to admit that the song was <unk> [ stolen ] ; and if he heard angels , they must have bought a copy of my song . " Eventually ahbez 's lawyers offered to have an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement , offering $ 25 @,@ 000 ( $ 227 @,@ 917 in 2016 dollars ) to Yablokoff , which he accepted . <unk> remarked that " it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming " . 
 = = Other versions = = 
 The success of " Nature Boy " soon led to the release of a number of cover versions of the track . However , due to the AFM ban , other record companies could not release full versions with strings , only a capella tracks . Following Cole 's version of " Nature Boy " , the Dick Haymes recording was released by Decca Records as catalog number <unk> . The record first appeared on the Billboard charts on June 4 , 1948 , and peaked at number 11 . 
 Frank Sinatra also recorded a <unk> version , which was his only recording during the ban . Sinatra 's version of " Nature Boy " replaced the string sounds of the original recording with a choir conducted by Jeff Alexander , which , according to Friedwald , made the song sound like a Gregorian chant . The recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number <unk> . It debuted on the Billboard charts on May 28 , 1948 , and peaked at number seven . Sinatra later performed the song on the radio show , Your Hit Parade , accompanied by a choir and orchestral arrangement . RCA Records planned to release versions by singers Perry Como and Bing Crosby , but they were subsequently cancelled due to the ban . <unk> Records released Sarah Vaughan 's a cappella version on April 8 , 1948 . It was a commercial success , selling 20 @,@ 000 copies on the first day and peaking at number 11 on the Billboard chart . 
 A parody named " <unk> <unk> " was recorded by The Unnatural Seven , an offshoot of Red Ingle and his Natural Seven that did not include Ingle due to the 1948 AFM recording ban . " <unk> <unk> " featured vocals from Karen Tedder and Los Angeles DJ Jim Hawthorne . It was released by Capitol with catalog number <unk> , reached the Billboard charts on October 1 , 1948 , and stayed there for a total of four weeks , peaking at number 24 . 
 In 1955 , Miles Davis recorded the song with Charles Mingus as bassist . The recording for the song was filled with tension due to an ongoing conflict between Davis and Mingus , resulting in a charged version of the song . They were assisted by Teddy Charles on vibraphone and Elvin Jones on drums . Another version was recorded by singer Bobby Darin , released in 1961 . A psychedelic rock version was recorded in 1965 by 1960s San Francisco rock band The Great Society , with lead vocals from singer Grace Slick , released on their 1968 post @-@ breakup album How it Was . Same year , Marvin Gaye recorded and released his version on the Cole tribute album , A Tribute to the Great Nat " King " Cole . 
 Peggy Lee 's version of " Nature Boy " was recorded in 1948 , but released in 1995 as part of the compilation album , Why Don 't You Do Right ? Peggy Lee , 1947 – 1948 . Abbey Lincoln recorded a version of the song for her 1995 album A Turtle 's Dream . Howard Reich from Chicago Tribune was impressed with the cover saying that " the mood of reverie and awe [ that Lincoln ] expresses in ' Nature Boy ' epitomize this album 's haunting appeal . " 
 Celine Dion performed the song as part of her A New Day ... concert at Caesars Palace . The song appeared on her 2002 studio album , A New Day Has Come , and on her 2004 live album , A New Day ... Live in Las Vegas . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include " Nature Boy " in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song 's appearance in Baz Luhrmann 's musical , Moulin Rouge ! ( 2001 ) . With Billboard , Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track : " This is the one I had the most kick out of in the studio . I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing . We were following each other , this is the real thing . This was such my pleasure . " Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post @-@ production , but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole 's version . 
 Aaron Neville 's interpretation of the track was released in 2003 on his jazz standard album , titled Nature Boy : The Jazz Album . That year in December , Harry Connick , Jr. released a holiday themed rendition of " Nature Boy " , on his holiday album , Harry for the Holidays . At the tenth season of American Idol , contestant Casey Abrams presented a jazz version of the song , which was received with a standing ovation from the audience , but faced criticism from the media for the " strange " musical arrangements . 
 = = = Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga version = = = 
 After recording the jazz standard " The Lady Is a Tramp " , American singer Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga began working on a collaborative jazz album , titled Cheek to Cheek . The recording took place over a year in New York City , and featured jazz musicians associated with both artists . Bennett 's quartet was present , including Mike Renzi , Gray Sargent , Harold Jones and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier . Along with Evans , jazz trumpeter Brian Newman , a long @-@ time friend and colleague of Gaga , played on the album with his New York City based jazz quintet . Tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and flautist Paul Horn were also enlisted as musicians . The songs were handpicked by Bennett and Gaga ; they selected tracks from the Great American Songbook including " Nature Boy " . It features instrumentation from flutes and drums , and has an orchestral arrangement . According to Kory Grow of Rolling Stone , Gaga sings in a Liza Minnelli inspired voice with a breathy range , followed by Bennett complimenting her with the story of meeting the titular character . 
 " Nature Boy " was released for streaming on Gaga 's Vevo channel from September 16 , 2014 . Preceding the release , Gaga tweeted about the background of the song , about the death of flautist Horn , as well as about ahbez , saying " This composer was part of a sub @-@ culture of nomadic hippies ! We channeled our own Gypsy lives in this performance " . Gil Kaufman from MTV News gave a positive review , saying that " This song sounds like what you imagine a smoky jazz club in 1940s New York would feel like . " Grow praised it as " sublime " , describing the track as a " <unk> " version Gaga and Bennett 's collaboration . Dave Lewis from HitFix believed that the " magic " of the song really happened once Bennett 's vocals were heard , following Gaga 's singing and the orchestration . Lewis said that " It 's not exactly ' Do What You Want With My Body ' , but Gaga and Bennett generate a different kind of heat . " Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that the song was " treated with the greatest delicacy " . He praised the flute sounds and the contrast between Gaga 's " vulnerable " vocals and Bennett 's " assured " one . Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave a negative review , saying that her timbre in " Nature Boy " appeared inconsistent , " shifting from soft and almost pleasant to parodic and comical , often within just a few short bars . " " Nature Boy " debuted on the Billboard Trending 140 Chart at number five and within a few hours , rose to number one . It also debuted at number 22 on the Billboard Jazz Digital Songs chart . 
 = = Usage in films = = 
 The song was a primary theme of the film score for The Boy with Green Hair ( 1948 ) , for which the original version was used . The producers of the film reportedly paid $ 10 @,@ 000 to ahbez for using the song , which was cumulatively more than what the author of the story , Betsy Beaton , was paid . A recording by Kate Ceberano was featured in the film The Crossing ( 1990 ) . The tune and lyrics feature prominently in the film Untamed Heart ( 1993 ) , for which Cole 's version was used during the closing credits , while a piano version by Roger Williams served as the opener for the film . The song was also played in intermediate scenes featuring the principal cast . 
 Miles Davis ' recording of " Nature Boy " was used in the film The Talented Mr. Ripley ( 1999 ) . In the book Music , Movies , Meanings , and Markets : <unk> , author Morris Holbrook described the song as a " nondiegetic performance " , exemplifying the plot development and sexual tension in the scene featuring Matt Damon and Jude Law play chess , naked and later in a bathtub scene . The song is performed at a jazz club in the film Angel Eyes , ( 2001 ) . A version recorded by Jon Hassell on trumpet and <unk> Majumdar on flute is featured on the soundtrack .

Callum Keith Rennie played ahbez , writing the song for Cole , played by Terence Carson , after falling in love with a woman named Anna Jacobs , portrayed by Tanya Allen . 
 The song was a central theme in Luhrmann 's Moulin Rouge ! " Nature Boy " was initially arranged as a techno song with singer David Bowie 's vocals , before being sent to the group Massive Attack , whose remix was used in the film 's closing credits . Bowie described the rendition as " slinky and mysterious " , adding that Robert ' 3D ' Del Naja from the group had " put together a riveting piece of work , " and that Bowie was " totally pleased with the end result . " Both Bowie 's version and Massive Attack 's remix appeared on the soundtrack . The version used in Moulin Rouge ! was sung by John Leguizamo , as Henri de Toulouse @-@ Lautrec , during the introductory scenes , as well as by Ewan McGregor 's character , Christian . Some of the film 's premise was based on the lyrics , in particular the opening lines . The closing lyric , " The greatest thing you 'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return " is used throughout the film . While reviewing Moulin Rouge ! , Erickson noted that " [ by ] itself , [ ' Nature Boy ' ] redeems the wonderful idea behind Luhrmann 's flawed but often wonderful movie . " 
 The song was performed by Rodrigo Santoro in the film <unk> ( 2012 ) , during the radio interview when he asks if he could sing a song for his wife and son . Cole 's version was again played at the start of Mike Tyson 's one @-@ man show , Mike Tyson : Undisputed Truth , directed by Spike Lee that aired on HBO .

 The series consists of six single @-@ player only games , and a seventh that includes multiplayer . Each game typically features a third @-@ person , fixed cinematic camera . The player controls the character Kratos in a combination of combat , platforming , and puzzle game elements to achieve goals and complete the story . A first @-@ person camera is featured in God of War III and Ascension . Betrayal is the only installment to feature a 2D side @-@ scrolling view . 
 Kratos ' main weapon is a pair of double @-@ chained blades that appear in three iterations throughout the series : the Blades of Chaos , the Blades of Athena ( or Athena 's Blades ) , and the Blades of Exile . They each perform similarly , but differ in the types of combos and amount of damage each yields , as well as cosmetic differences . Other weapons ( such as the Blade of Artemis in God of War ) are also obtained during the games . Magic is also used , and four abilities ( such as Poseidon 's Rage , Medusa 's Gaze , Zeus ' Fury , and Army of Hades in God of War ) are typically acquired . God of War III differs in that instead of separate abilities , there are four primary weapons that possess their own respective magic offensive . The game also featured " Items " — additional secondary weapons with limited usage , such as the Bow of Apollo . With each new game , most weapons and magic are lost via a plot device , and a new arsenal of weapons and abilities are acquired during gameplay . God of War : Ascension differed from previous games in that instead of acquiring new weapons that are kept throughout the entire game , the player collects up to five World Weapons ( such as a sword or a javelin ) that have limited usage . When there is not a World Weapon equipped , the player can punch or kick foes as part of a new mechanic added to the game . 
 The series offers combo @-@ based combat , and includes a quick time event ( QTE ) feature , also called context sensitive attacks , which is initiated when the player has weakened a foe . It allows limited control of Kratos during the QTE cinematic sequence ; success ends the battle , while failure usually results in damage to the player . As well as the QTE system , Ascension features a prompt @-@ less free @-@ form system , allowing players the choice of when to attack or dodge based on the enemy 's actions . A grab maneuver can be used on minor foes . 
 Relics , which the player can use in successive games ( such as Poseidon 's Trident obtained in God of War allowing Kratos to swim underwater for extended periods ) are also found and necessary for game progression . Kratos often has a special ability , which provides temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage . This ability has become an ongoing feature of gameplay throughout the series — Rage of the Gods in God of War and Ascension , Rage of the Titans in God of War II , Rage of Sparta in God of War III , and Thera 's Bane in Ghost of Sparta . This ability can be recharged by building hits on foes in combat , and gaining game @-@ specific orbs . Thera 's Bane , however , is recharged automatically . 
 Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers , found throughout the game in unmarked chests ( white chests in Ascension ) , increase the maximum amount of health and magic , respectively . Minotaur Horns , which increase the Items and Fire meter 's maximum length , are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta , respectively . The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons , called Items , and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera 's Bane . The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes , Feathers , and Horns are found . Other chests contain green , blue , or red orbs . Green orbs replenish the player 's health , blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage , and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new , more powerful attacks , and replenish the Rage meter in God of War . Gold orbs are found in God of War II and Ascension and replenish the rage meter instead of red orbs ( white orbs replaced the gold orbs in God of War III ) . Chests with changing colors , which allow players to choose which meter to replenish , have also been available . Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects . Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick @-@ time feature . 
 With the exception of Ascension , each installment offers a challenge mode , which yields extra red orbs , secret costumes , and behind @-@ the @-@ scenes videos . Bonus content can also be unlocked by defeating the game 's difficulty levels . Battle arenas , which allow players to set difficulty levels and choose their own opponents , are included in God of War II , Betrayal , God of War III , and Ghost of Sparta . A quick @-@ time sex mini @-@ game is also included in each installment except Betrayal and Ascension . 
 Ascension introduced online multiplayer to the series for both competitive and cooperative play . Up to eight players on two teams of two to four players ( or a four to eight player deathmatch ) battle for control of a map in order to earn rewards from the gods . Players can also fight each other in one @-@ on @-@ one matches . Players must sell their champion 's soul to either Zeus , Hades , Ares , or Poseidon , which allows players to try different weapons , armor sets , and powers inspired by the god of their choice , and extras can be unlocked .

 After the success of their first game Kinetica ( 2001 ) , SIE Santa Monica Studio began development of God of War in 2002 , and unveiled it two years later at SCEA Santa Monica Gamers ' Day 2004 . Game director and creator David Jaffe said that although the idea for God of War was his own , the concept owed a debt to Capcom because he had played Onimusha and said " let 's do that with Greek Mythology " . He was inspired in part by the 1981 feature film , Clash of the Titans , saying , " the real high concept for me was ... merging it with Heavy Metal magazine " . He said he liked both " the kids stuff ... with Greek Mythology " and the idea of adding more adult themes such as sex and violence . He was also inspired by the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark . Although the game is based on Greek mythology , the development team gave themselves " lots of freedom " to modify the myths , and Jaffe said they took the " coolest aspects of the subject " and created art and story using those elements . Director of visual development and lead concept artist , Charlie Wen , drew inspiration from these films as well as more contemporary films such as Gladiator ( 2000 ) for tonal inspiration to lead the visual design of Kratos , other characters , and the world of God of War . GameSpot said the developers described the gameplay " as merging the action of Devil May Cry with the puzzle @-@ solving of Ico " and noted that players would be able to " sunder enemies with a single move , such as by ripping them in half " . The game uses Santa Monica 's Kinetica engine , which they developed for Kinetica . 
 A sequel to God of War was first teased at the end of its credits , which stated , " Kratos Will Return " . God of War II was officially announced at the 2006 Game Developers Conference ( GDC ) . David Jaffe stepped down and became the creative director of its sequel and God of War 's lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of game director . Barlog said that in the game , players would see " a larger view of Kratos ' role within the mythological world . " Like God of War , the game uses Santa Monica 's Kinetica engine . Magic attacks became an integral part of the combat system and it was more refined . New creatures and heroes from the mythology , and more boss battles were added . Both Jaffe and Barlog said that they did not view God of War II as a sequel , but rather a continuation of the previous game . Jaffe said that they did not want to include the Roman numeral number two ( II ) in the title for this reason , but they did not want the title to convey the impression it was an expansion pack . Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason God of War II appeared on the PlayStation 2 instead of the PlayStation 3 — which was released four months prior to God of War II — was because " there 's a 100 million people out there that will be able to play God of War II as soon as it launches . " Barlog assured that the game would be playable on the newer platform , which had PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility . 
 God of War III was first mentioned by Cory Barlog at a God of War II launch event , and it was officially announced at the 2008 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) . After the first eight months of development , Barlog left Santa Monica for unexplained reasons and Stig Asmussen ( lead environment artist and art director on God of War and God of War II , respectively ) became director . Asmussen said that one of the greatest challenges in developing God of War III for the PlayStation 3 was the " complexity of everything " ; individual tasks , such as designing Helios ' decapitation , could take a year because the " level of detail [ that was ] expected [ was ] so high and intricate , it [ crossed ] multiple departments . " He said that the PlayStation 3 's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment . The engine for God of War III was ported from the first two installments to the PlayStation 3 . As the game was being developed , the code department swapped out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components . They replaced the renderer , the particle system , and the collision system . Although they were re @-@ using the engine from God of War II , the core engine for God of War III was brand new . Between E3 2009 and the time the game shipped , morphological anti @-@ aliasing ( MLAA ) was added , which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said " improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame @-@ rate . " Diamand also said that " depth @-@ of @-@ field , motion blur , crepuscular ' god ' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed " during that same time period . 
 On April 12 , 2012 , Sony released a teaser image for Ascension on its official PlayStation Facebook page , which was followed by the game 's announcement on April 19 on PlayStation.Blog. Todd Papy , who had previously worked as a designer on God of War and God of War II and as design director on God of War III , assumed the role of game director ; God of War III director Stig Asmussen was busy with another project at Santa Monica and did not work on Ascension . The announcement officially confirmed the game 's title and Papy said it was not titled God of War IV to avoid confusion because it is a prequel , rather than a sequel , to the trilogy . The game features a retooled God of War III engine , enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players . The decision to add multiplayer came about from curiosity , according to lead combat designer Jason McDonald . The multiplayer was first tested using Kratos , and McDonald said the testers had " a lot of fun " . Seeing their reaction made the team feel that the multiplayer had value and they then began to put the " God of War spin on it " . In the developmental transition from God of War III to Ascension , one of the graphics engineers , Cedric Perthuis , noted that the limits of the God of War III engine restricted artist creativity , so they " tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance . " Ascension did not have a graphical leap over its predecessor like God of War III did . Dynamic lighting was added , which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic . Particle effects were also greatly improved upon from God of War III .

 Game developer Ready at Dawn pitched the idea of a God of War game for the PlayStation Portable to Santa Monica Studio soon after the original God of War launched . Cory Barlog officially confirmed the development of Chains of Olympus at a God of War II launch event , stating " It is its own story that connects to the overall story . " Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary , in @-@ house engine referred to as the Ready at Dawn engine , which expanded on the engine created for their previous game , Daxter ( 2006 ) . Originally designed for the PlayStation Portable 's restricted 222 megahertz ( MHz ) processor , Ready at Dawn convinced Sony to increase the clock speed of the PSP to 333 MHz , which they did in a firmware upgrade . The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects , lighting effects , and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence , but noticeably decreased battery life . After the game 's completion , game director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles , characters , and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints . 
 Ghost of Sparta was announced on May 4 , 2010 , on PlayStation.Blog. According to Sony , Ready at Dawn utilized " state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art visual technologies " that allowed " higher quality environments and characters . " Ghost of Sparta offers " over 25 % more gameplay " than Chains of Olympus , while adding more enemies on screen and more boss encounters . Development of Ghost of Sparta took 23 months to complete . Due to Weerasuriya 's schedule at Ready at Dawn , he could not return to direct ; Dana Jan , the lead level designer for Chains of Olympus , became director for Ghost of Sparta . At Comic @-@ Con 2010 , Jan noted that when development began in 2008 , the goal was to make the game bigger than Chains of Olympus , which had apparently pushed the PSP to its functional limits . Jan stated that Ghost of Sparta has taken the PSP to its " absolute capacity " , with another feature being more on @-@ screen foes . The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the platinum trophy from God of War III . The trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall.com , which became the official site for Ghost of Sparta on May 4 . Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between God of War and God of War II was because " It seemed to make a lot of sense to fill in that void . "

 Betrayal was announced by Sony Online Entertainment at a press conference in Los Angeles in May 2007 . The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series ' three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) graphics . Game director Phil Cohen said that although the game was enjoyable to develop , the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred kilobytes , and that met Santa Monica Studio 's high standards . Cohen wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005 , and revisited it in August 2006 , the month development started . The versions for high @-@ end handsets were completed in April 2007 , with final versions for low @-@ end handsets completed by June 2007 . The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks . Both David Jaffe and Cory Barlog ensured that the Betrayal development team captured the feel of the combat and visual style , and were " helpful with feedback and positive support " .
