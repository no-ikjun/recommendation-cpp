 The idea of parallel lives has been explored before in films such as Run Lola Run ( 1998 ) and Sliding Doors ( 1998 ) which influenced Van Dormael 's writing . Unlike any of those , Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect , pigeon superstition , and the space @-@ time continuum . Van Dormael stated , " My starting point was a 12 @-@ minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi . A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices : to go with his mother or with his father . From there we follow two possible futures . I started one version based on the fact that a woman jumps or doesn 't jump on a train . Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out , followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer . I had to find something else . And that 's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary , that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices . With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities . Beyond this , I wanted to find a different way of telling a story . I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past . I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema , which is a simplifying medium . While reality around us is more and more complex , the information is more and more succinct , political speeches are more and more simplistic . What interests me is complexity . Not the simple answers , which are reassuring but bound to be false . " 
 While producing the film , Van Dormael took the unique step of publishing his screenplay . The director described the scale of the film , " My producers don 't like me saying it , but it 's really a big @-@ budget experimental film about the many different lives one person can live , depending on the choices he makes . It 's about the infinite possibilities facing any person . There are no good or bad choices in life . It 's simply that each choice will create another life for you . What 's interesting is to be alive . "

 Jaco Van Dormael hired visual effects supervisor Louis Morin , known for his work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ( 2004 ) , to create visual effects for Mr. Nobody . All five hundred visual effects shots were produced in Quebec by Quebec companies . Modus FX announced having delivered 121 digital visual effects shots for the film . The company was entrusted with complex sequences which could not be captured on film , involving the digital reproduction of entire cities , villages and other @-@ worldly settings . Modus FX also worked on several complex transitions between the different worlds and multiple lives of Nemo Nobody . Modus FX 's post @-@ production contributions involved 37 digital artists and technicians across a six @-@ month period . A long list of software , including Autodesk 's Softimage and Maya , Side Effects ' Houdini and The Foundry 's Nuke , and the creation of a multitude of in @-@ house tools , programs and techniques was required for the shots delivered . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Like Van Dormael 's previous films , the score for Mr. Nobody was written by Pierre Van Dormael . He worked on simple themes and out of synch loops , " a mixture of superficial simplicity and underlying complexity . " He wrote themes that overlapped to form new ones , each theme continuing to exist while being mixed with the others . The director did not want the music to be overtly emotional , so he and Pierre chose a minimalist orchestration , more often than not just a single guitar . Van Dormael said , " We wanted the instrument and the player to be felt . This stance actually sums up the whole adventure : a maximalist project with a minimalist approach . " Mr. Nobody is the last film of composer Pierre Van Dormael before his death in 2008 . His music won the Magritte Award for Best Original Score in 2012 . 
 The soundtrack features songs by Pierre Van Dormael , Buddy Holly , Hans Zimmer , Otis Redding , Eurythmics , Pixies , Wallace Collection , Nena , Ella Fitzgerald , and The Andrew Sisters , as well as versions of " Mr. Sandman " performed by The <unk> , The King Brothers , Emmylou Harris , and Gob , and recordings of compositions by Erik Satie and Benjamin Britten , among others .

 Mr. Nobody is a tale about choice . Nemo , a nine @-@ year @-@ old boy , has been thrust into a position where he must make an impossible decision – to choose between his mother and father . In the seconds preceding the rest of his life , he wonders where each choice will take him . The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy 's overactive imagination . The dilemma that causes the film 's main problem ( not knowing the future ) once solved makes it all the more difficult – " I don 't know the future , therefore I cannot make a decision . Now that I know the future I still cannot make one . " The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality , is epitomized by the constant change in storyline , between young boy , adolescent man , and mature man . The film takes a four @-@ <unk> view of the nature and existence of life in the universe . Each decision thus branching off creating an entirely separate alternative universe . Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time . How actions have universal consequences , how the past inevitably shapes the future in a very impacting way – every single choice , no matter its simplicity or complexity can make , alter or change a lifetime . 
 The film also makes substantial use of chaos theory , string theory , and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses . Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo is subject to the whims of chance , often plunging into water , a place where humans lack all control . This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition . The theories are used to compound reality in the film , it is why the smoke never goes back into the cigarette , time is always moving in one direction . At the end when it assumes that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos , making use of the Big Crunch theory , time halts , and it begins to reverse . Thus signalling the absolute freedom Nemo had been seeking – being able to live a life without choice , for while you never choose all things remain possible . The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices , whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if we could go back and change them . In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn 't matter what we choose , because each choice , once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice . The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance , to the dimensions by which we construct our reality ( height , length , width and time ) , and to the imagination of our former selves . And once the boy Nemo knows the outcomes of either choice , he instinctively opts for another . 
 The different colors used in the film have symbolic meanings . Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and <unk> to each other . Color differentiation can be traced as far back as Nemo 's childhood , where three girls sit on a bench . They are his possible future wives : Jeanne , Elise , and Anna ; one in yellow , the other in blue , and the third in a red dress . In his life with Elise , Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair , themes associated with the color blue . Choosing Jeanne , Nemo seeks material well @-@ being and independence : yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this . The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna 's dress . It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world . White contains all colors of the visible spectrum ; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made . By the end of his life , Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding ( room , clothes , doctor ) . This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started , the point at which everything is possible .

 = = Critical reception = = 
 Upon its premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival , Mr. Nobody was positively received with a ten @-@ minute standing ovation from the audience . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 67 % of critics have given the film a positive review , with its consensus saying " Mr. Nobody 's narrative tangles may <unk> as much as they entertain , but its big ambitions and absorbing visuals make for an intriguing addition to director Jaco Van Dormael 's filmography . " 
 Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail praised the film , stating " Van Dormael holds this fractured fairy tale together by giving it an emotional core and delivers two hours of time travel with a playful spirit and at a mostly hyperkinetic pace , sprinkling it with amusing side journeys and sometimes letting a scene unfold at a more natural tempo . " Bruce Kirkland of Jam ! gave the film four stars out of five and wrote , " Expect the unexpected . Try to answer the unanswerable question that writer @-@ director Van Dormael poses . It is a worthwhile exercise . " He also described Leto 's acting as a " marvelously full @-@ blooded , brain @-@ spinning , tour @-@ de @-@ force performance . " Ken Eisner from The Georgia Straight summarized the film as " a dazzling feat of philosophical fancy , and it attempts nothing less than the summing up of an entire life , and an epoch or two , with its free @-@ spinning take on recent human history as projected into possible futures . " 
 Niels Matthijs , writing for Twitch Film , stated that " It 's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little cinematic event . There is hardly filler here , no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes . Every scene matters and every scene is made to look like it matters . The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested in the life of the main protagonist , Nemo Nobody . " Fred Topel , writing for Screen Junkies , praised the film 's artistry , saying " All of Nemo 's lives are painful . No matter what he chooses , he experiences heartbreak , death of loved ones , his own death , and clinical depression . My future seems brighter , but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile . The goal isn 't to choose the easiest path . It 's to live . " Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that " Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about . You may love it you may hate it , but you can bet that you will never forget it . " Exclaim ! ' s Robert Bell called the film " a powerful movie about what it means to be alive . " 
 Boyd van <unk> of Variety magazine was more critical , writing " Though a lot of it is well written and directed and , quite often , funny or poignant , the individual scenes rarely become part of a larger whole . " He praises Leto 's acting , stating " The closest the film comes to having a gravitational center are in the scenes set in 2092 . What makes them soar is not the imaginative staging of the future , but Leto 's performance . His acting talent really comes into full view in his scenes as the last dying man on Earth . " He also praised Regbo and Temple , saying " Regbo , as the teenage Nemo , and Juno Temple , as the teenage Anna , are impressive , bringing the hormonal battles of adolescence vividly to life . " Film critic Eric Lavallée listed Regbo as one of his " Top 10 New Faces & Voices " of 2009 Toronto International Film Festival . He notes that " newbie Toby Regbo might easily be Mr. Nobody 's most " alive " character . Playing Nemo at age 16 , the actor is mostly paired with Juno Temple – their unique love story is the film 's heart pumping portions and plays a lot better than the artery clogging other brushes of romance . " 
 AlloCiné , a French cinema website , gave the film an average of three out of five stars , based on a survey of 24 reviews . Xavier <unk> from Le Nouvel Observateur described it as " a fiction of sterile ramifications , weighed down by a script the labyrinthine constructions of which poorly conceal the poverty of inspiration " . Pierre <unk> from Ouest @-@ France wrote that " Van Dormael plays with chance and coincidence . The demonstration is long and heavy , but aesthetically , is superb . "

 = 1925 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1925 Atlantic hurricane season was an inactive Atlantic hurricane season during which four tropical cyclones formed . Only one of them was a hurricane . The first storm developed on August 18 , and the last dissipated on December 1 . The season began at a late date , more than two months after the season began . The official start of the season is generally considered to be June 1 with the end being October 31 ; however , the final storm of the season formed nearly a month after the official end . Due to increased activity over the following decades , the official end of the hurricane season was shifted to November 30 . 
 The final two storms of the season impacted several areas , with the final storm affecting areas from Cuba to Rhode Island . The third storm caused little or no damage along the Texas coastline with gale @-@ force winds being recorded only along the coast . The last storm caused severe damage along the beaches of the Florida Peninsula , with damages estimated in the millions along with four fatalities near Tampa . At least $ 600 @,@ 000 was lost in damages dealt to the citrus industry and several maritime incidents resulted in over 55 fatalities .

 = = = Hurricane One = = = 
 The first indications of a tropical cyclone developing were on August 17 . A ship in the vicinity of the developing system reported winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) over 78 ° F ( 25 @.@ 5 ° C ) waters . Around 0000 UTC the next day , the system was classified as a modern day tropical depression with sustained winds estimated at 30 mph ( 45 km / h ) . Roughly 18 hours later , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm , the first of the season while located to the north @-@ northeast of the Bahamas . Gradual intensification took place throughout most of the storm 's life as it traveled towards the northeast until becoming a hurricane around 0600 UTC on August 20 . About 30 minutes later , a ship recorded winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) and a pressure of 993 @.@ 6 mbar ( hPa ) , the lowest pressure recorded in relation to the small storm . Shortly after , the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Increasing in forward motion , the storm became extratropical early on August 21 after turning towards the north . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Two = = = 
 The second storm of the season was first identified on August 25 to the east of Florida as a tropical depression . Around this time , several ships were reporting winds up to 25 mph ( 35 km / h ) in the vicinity of the system . Traveling towards the northeast , the storm gradually intensified , <unk> tropical storm status around 0600 UTC the next day . Several hours later , a ship recorded a pressure of 1010 mbar ( hPa ) while located in the vicinity of the system . The storm turned towards the west @-@ northwest later that day and forward motion began to increase . 
 Early on August 27 , the storm weakened below tropical storm status and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while moving over cooler waters . The system dissipated shortly after over open waters . Although the storm remained over water for the duration of its existence , the outer reaches of the system brought rain and light winds to Georgia , Florida , and the Carolinas . In Jacksonville , Florida , the storm produced 0 @.@ 47 in ( 11 @.@ 9 mm ) of rain on August 25 . Between August 26 and 27 , Cape Hatteras received 2 @.@ 06 in ( 52 @.@ 3 mm ) of rain from the storm . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Three = = = 
 The third storm of the season was first identified as tropical depression off the northwestern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula early on September 6 . The system moved at a steady pace to the northwest towards the Rio Grande Valley . Shortly after forming , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm . At this time , a ship in the vicinity of the storm recorded a pressure of 1012 mbar ( hPa ) . By 1800 UTC that day , the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Around 9 pm CST ( 0300 UTC on September 7 ) that night , storm warnings were issued for areas between Brownsville and Corpus Christi , Texas . These warnings were later expanded to include the entire Texas coastline . 
 The storm made landfall in northern Mexico , just south of the Texas border , shortly after the warnings were extended . Around the time the storm made landfall , a pressure of 1002 mbar ( hPa ) was recorded in Brownsville , Texas . The storm dissipated later that day over southwestern Texas . No known damage was caused as a result of this storm and storm @-@ force winds were only recorded over a small area on the Texas coastline . The storm produced minor rainfall over south Texas with Brownsville recording 0 @.@ 56 in ( 14 @.@ 2 mm ) and Corpus Christi recording 0 @.@ 95 in ( 24 @.@ 1 in ) . Winds up to 43 mph ( 69 km / h ) were reported in Brownsville around 1 am CST ( 0800 UTC ) on September 7 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Four = = = 
 The final storm of the season formed as tropical depression to the southeast of the Yucatan Peninsula early on November 27 , nearly a month after the official end of the hurricane season . The depression drifted towards the southeast , gradually strengthening into a tropical storm over 80 ° F ( 26 @.@ 6 ° C ) waters . Around 1300 UTC , a ship in the vicinity of the storm recorded winds up to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . Once in the Gulf , forward motion picked up as it intensified to winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . During the night of November 30 , the storm made landfall just south of Tampa , Florida ; a pressure of 998 @.@ 8 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) was recorded along with winds up to 52 mph ( 87 km / h ) . 
 Not long after making landfall , the storm weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while over center Florida . The cyclone emerged over the eastern Atlantic Ocean several hours later and regained hurricane @-@ force winds . By 0000 UTC , the storm reached its peak intensity as an extratropical system with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 980 mbar ( hPa ) . Around this time , the U. S. S. Patoka , which was in the vicinity of the storm , recorded a pressure of 978 @.@ 5 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) . The northeastward movement slowed shortly after crossing Florida . At around 6 p.m. EST ( 2300 UTC ) , it made landfall between Wilmington and Cape Hatteras with winds equivalent to a minimal hurricane . Shortly after landfall , maximum sustained winds in the storm dropped below 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . A strong area of high pressure located over the Canadian Maritimes caused the system to turn towards the east @-@ southeast . On December 5 , the storm weakened further to the equivalent of a tropical depression as the system began to move towards the south . The remnants of the storm continued towards the east , passing several hundred miles north of Bermuda later that day . Several days later , the cyclone was reported near the Azores . On December 9 , it passed neat Horta where a pressure of 992 @.@ 7 mbar ( 29 @.@ 32 inHg ) was recorded along with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . After passing through the islands , it merged with another cyclone over the North Atlantic . 
 The storm caused significant property and crop damage along the Gulf Coast of Florida . Trees , power lines , and telegraph wires were uprooted or knocked down by high winds along the Suwannee River . Structures which were previously considered to be safe from storms , being over 100 ft ( 30 @.@ 4 m ) inland , sustained significant damage from what was likely storm surge . The beaches along the Atlantic coast also sustained considerable damages from the storm . Four people were killed near Tampa in two separate incidents . The first occurred when a house collapsed on three men , pinning them to the ground . The second incident occurred after a woman ran outside her home and was struck by a tree limb . In North Carolina , heavy rains and strong winds were reported along the coast . Near record high water rises were recorded around Wilmington . Cape Hatteras was temporarily isolated from the surrounding areas as the high winds from the storm knocked down power lines throughout the area . Several buildings along the coast and numerous boats sustained considerable damage . 
 Throughout Florida , there were no reports of fatalities but property loses were estimated in the millions , with $ 1 million in Jacksonville alone . Damages to the citrus industry were also significant , with total losses exceeding $ 600 @,@ 000 . In addition to the severe impacts on land , numerous shipping incidents resulted in several deaths . A schooner carrying seven people sunk with no survivors . A tug boat sank off the coast of Mobile , Alabama while towing a lumber barge , the fate of the crew is unknown . A ship named the American S. S. Catopazi sank between Charleston , South Carolina and the northern coast of Cuba ; all 30 crew members drowned . A ship carrying about 2 @,@ 000 cases of liquor with a crew of six sank near Daytona Beach . The last incident , involving a yacht , occurred off the coast of Georgia . The ship sank near Savannah , Georgia with the 12 crew members drowning . The total loss of life at sea was at least 55 . 
 = Red @-@ winged fairywren = 
 The red @-@ winged fairywren ( Malurus elegans ) is a species of passerine bird in the family Maluridae . It is sedentary and endemic to the southwestern corner of Western Australia . Exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism , the male adopts a brilliantly coloured breeding plumage , with an iridescent silvery @-@ blue crown , ear coverts and upper back , red shoulders , contrasting with a black throat , grey @-@ brown tail and wings and pale underparts . Non @-@ breeding males , females and juveniles have predominantly grey @-@ brown plumage , though males may bear isolated blue and black feathers . No separate subspecies are recognised . Similar in appearance and closely related to the variegated fairywren ( M. lamberti ) and the blue @-@ breasted fairywren ( M. pulcherrimus ) , it is regarded as a separate species as no intermediate forms have been recorded where ranges overlap . Though the red @-@ winged fairywren is locally common , there is evidence of a decline in numbers . 
 Bearing a nice narrow pointed bill adapted for probing and catching insects , the red @-@ winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous ; it forages and lives in the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by the karri ( Eucalyptus diversicolor ) , remaining close to cover to avoid predators . Like other fairywrens , it is a cooperative breeding species , with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year @-@ round . Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young . There is a higher proportion of female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairywren . A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species . Singing is used to advertise territory , and birds can distinguish other individuals on song alone . Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The red @-@ winged fairywren was officially described by ornithologist John Gould in 1837 , who derived the bird 's specific name derived from the Latin term elegans ' elegant ' . He gave its location as the East Coast , but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia . Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern karri forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 on the basis of darker female plumage . However , others have not observed this subsequently and the consensus is that no separate subspecies are recognized . In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals . 
 It is one of 12 species of the genus Malurus , commonly known as fairywrens , found in Australia and lowland New Guinea . Within the genus it belongs to a group of four very similar species known collectively as chestnut @-@ shouldered fairywrens . The other three species are the lovely fairywren ( M. amabilis ) of Cape York , the variegated fairywren ( M. lamberti ) found across most of the continent , and the blue @-@ breasted fairywren ( M. pulcherrimus ) of southern Western Australia and the Eyre Peninsula . Molecular study showed the blue @-@ breasted fairywren to be the most closely related to the red @-@ winged fairywren . 
 Like other fairywrens , the red @-@ winged fairywren is unrelated to the true wrens . Initially fairywrens were thought to be a member of the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae or warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised Maluridae in 1975 . More recently , DNA analysis has shown the family to be related to Meliphagidae ( honeyeaters ) and Pardalotidae ( peep @-@ wrens ) in a large superfamily , Meliphagoidea . 
 = = = Evolutionary history = = = 
 In his 1982 monograph , ornithologist Richard Schodde proposed a northern origin for the chestnut @-@ shouldered fairywren group due to the variety of forms in the north and their absence in the southeast of the continent . Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm and wetter period around 2 million years ago at the end of the Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene . Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation of populations . Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red @-@ winged fairywren , while those in the northwest of the continent became the variegated fairywren . Further warmer , humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards ; this group , occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula , became the blue @-@ breasted fairywren . Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species . Finally , after the end of the last glacial period 12 @,@ 000 – 13 @,@ 000 years ago , the northern variegated forms have again spread southwards . This has resulted in the ranges of all three species overlapping . Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified . 
 = = Description = = 
 The red @-@ winged fairywren is 15 cm ( 6 in ) long and weighs 8 – 11 g ( 0 @.@ 21 – 0 @.@ 38 oz ) , making it the largest of the fairywrens . The average tail length is 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 3 in ) , among the longest in the genus . Averaging 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in males and 9 @.@ 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in females , the bill is relatively long , narrow and pointed and wider at the base . Wider than it is deep , the bill is similar in shape to those of other birds that feed by probing for or picking insects off their environs . 
 Like other fairywrens , the red @-@ winged fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism , males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting with black and grey @-@ brown . The brightly coloured crown , ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays . The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown , ear coverts and upper back , a black throat and nape , bright red @-@ brown shoulders , a long grey @-@ brown tail and wings , and greyish @-@ white belly . Non @-@ breeding males , females and juveniles are predominantly grey @-@ brown in colour , though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage . All males have a black bill and lores ( eye @-@ ring and bare skin between eyes and bill ) , while females have a black bill , rufous lores and pale grey eye @-@ ring . Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching . This has a patchy or spotty appearance , with a mixture of blue and grey feathers on the head , and black and grey on the breast ; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late . Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring , though some may need another year . Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time , although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status . 
 Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding , with males assuming an eclipse non @-@ breeding plumage . They will moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring . Body feathers are replaced at both moults while wing and tail feathers are in spring only , though the latter may be replaced at any time if damaged or worn . The blue coloured plumage , particularly the ear @-@ coverts , of the breeding males is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules . The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly , and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens , whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum . 
 = = = Vocalisations = = = 
 Vocal communication among red @-@ winged fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds in a social group and for advertising and defending a territory . They are able to distinguish different individuals on the basis of song alone , which is integral to the identification of group members and strangers . The basic , or " type one " , song is a one to four second high @-@ pitched reel consisting of 10 – 20 short elements per second ; it is sung by both males and females , particularly when there is a dispute over territory boundaries . Singing occurs most frequently before and just after dawn . Foraging birds maintain contact with each other by soft , repeating see @-@ see @-@ see descending tones , while a loud , sharp tsit serves as an alarm call .

 Survival of fairywrens from one season to the next is generally high for such small birds , and the red @-@ winged fairywren has the highest rate of all — with 78 % of breeding males and 77 % of breeding females surviving from year to year . It is not unusual for red @-@ winged fairywrens to reach 10 years of age , and the oldest known individual to date attained an age of 16 years . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The red @-@ winged fairywren occurs in the wetter , southwest corner of Western Australia , from Moore River north of Perth south through to the Margaret River region and east to Albany . It is common in parts of its range , though there is some evidence of decline from draining of swampland . It lives in the understorey of karri ( Eucalyptus diversicolor ) and jarrah ( Eucalyptus marginata ) . Older forests appear to be less favourable habitats , while birds appear to be attracted to disturbed areas after logging . Fire also results in populations disappearing , returning after a period of two years . Forestry plantations of pine ( Pinus spp . ) and eucalypts are generally unsuitable as they lack undergrowth . 
 Within the forest habitat , the red @-@ winged fairywren prefers wetter gullies and riverside sword sedge ( <unk> <unk> ) . It borders the range of the variegated fairywren on the northern limit of its range , and the blue @-@ breasted fairywren in the eastern limit , with the latter two species occupying dryer scrub while the red @-@ winged fairywren is restricted to wetter forests . The lack of intermediate forms reinforces the status of all three taxa as separate species . 
 Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for red @-@ winged fairywren conservation are Araluen @-@ <unk> , <unk> , Mundaring @-@ Kalamunda , North <unk> , the Stirling Range , Two Peoples Bay and Mount <unk> . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Hopping , with both feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously , is the usual form of locomotion , though birds may run while performing the " rodent run display " detailed below . Its balance is assisted by a proportionally large tail , which is usually held upright and rarely still . The short , rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights , though not for extended jaunts . 
 The red @-@ winged fairywren is a cooperative breeding species , with a pair or small group of birds maintaining and defending a territory year @-@ round . These territories average around 0 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 4 hectares ( 1 – 6 acres ) in optimal habitat of tall karri forest , although are smaller and restricted to dense riverbank undergrowth in less favourable habitats . The area maintained is large enough to support the group in poor years or to accommodate new members after a good breeding season . Groups range from two to nine members in size with an average of four birds , the largest for any fairywren studied to date . This is thought to be due to a very high annual survival and occupancy of suitable territory . Though reproduction rates are low , young birds still have few vacancies available for them to disperse into . Pairs are socially monogamous , with relationships ending for the most part when one partner dies . The survivor in this case selects a new partner , often a helper bird in the group . Though not directly studied , paired red @-@ winged fairywrens are likely to be sexually promiscuous , with each partner mating with other individuals . Female helpers are much more common in this species than the other species intensively studied , the superb fairywren ( M. cyaneus ) . Over half of the groups have two or more helpers , often female , which feed nestlings and reduce the workload of breeding females . Helpers have been shown to improve reproductive success in this species by increasing the number of young raised successfully per year from 1 @.@ 3 to 2 birds . There is some evidence that groups with male helpers may enlarge the territory boundaries with a subsequent " budding @-@ off " of a new territory by a helper . 
 Major nest predators include Australian magpies ( Gymnorhina tibicen ) , butcherbirds ( Cracticus spp . ) , laughing <unk> ( Dacelo novaeguineae ) , currawongs ( Strepera spp . ) , crows and ravens ( Corvus spp . ) , and shrike @-@ thrushes ( Colluricincla spp . ) as well as introduced mammals such as the red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) , cat and black rat ( Rattus rattus ) . Like other species of fairywrens , red @-@ winged fairywrens may use a " rodent @-@ run display " to distract predators from nests with young birds . While doing this , the head , neck and tail of the bird are lowered , the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call . 
 Observed in this species , the wing @-@ fluttering display is seen in several situations : females responding , and presumably acquiescing , to male courtship displays , juveniles begging for food , by helpers to older birds , and immature males to senior ones . The fairywren lowers its head and tail , <unk> and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Like all fairywrens , the red @-@ winged fairywren is an active and restless feeder , foraging in bracken ( Pteridium esculentum ) and low shrubs , as well as in leaf @-@ litter on the ground near shelter . It will occasionally ascend trees up to 5 m ( 16 ft ) above the ground in the understorey , particularly in the late summer and autumn as the flaking eucalypt bark is a rich source of arthropods . However , birds are exposed to potential predators and forays are therefore brief . They consumes a wide range of small creatures , mostly insects , eating ants and beetles year @-@ round , and adding spiders , bugs and caterpillars to their diet during breeding season . During spring and summer , birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song . Insects are numerous and easy to catch , which allows the birds to rest between forays . Groups often shelter and rest together during the heat of the day . Food is harder to find during the winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously . Ants in particular are an important food source during this period , constituting a high proportion of the diet . 
 = = = Courtship and breeding = = = 
 Like other fairywrens , male red @-@ winged fairywrens have been observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females as part of a courtship ritual . In this species , the petals that have been recorded have been yellow or , rarely , white . Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren 's own , or another 's , territory . The " face fan " display is commonly seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours ; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers . The silvery blue upper back feathers are also used more prominently in display than other species . 
 The breeding season is shorter than that of other fairywrens , occurring from October ( rarely September ) through to December . Constructed solely by the female , the nest is generally situated in thick vegetation and around 20 cm ( 8 in ) above the ground . It is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs , with an entrance in one side . The interior may be lined with finer grass and material from Clematis pubescens and Banksia grandis . One or , rarely , two broods may be laid in a season , the second being laid on average 51 days after the first . A clutch consists of two or three matte cream @-@ white eggs , tapered oval in shape with reddish @-@ brown splotches and spots , measuring 12 x 16 mm ( .45 x .6 in ) . The female incubates the eggs alone for around an hour at a time , after which the male calls her and she will leave to forage urgently for 15 – 30 minutes before returning . Her long tail is often bent from the cramped nest space and is a useful field indicator of nesting . Incubation takes 14 to 15 days , a day less in later broods , and an estimated 94 % of eggs hatch successfully . The newly hatched nestlings are altricial – raw red in colour , naked and blind . Within a day , their skin darkens to blue – grey colour as their feathers develop underneath . <unk> primary feathers emerge through the skin by the third day and eyes begin to open on the fifth day and fully open on the next . Young are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 11 – 12 days , by which time they are fledged . Though fully feathered , their tails and wings are not fully grown and they are poor fliers . Their wings take another 10 days to develop fully , during which time they generally stay well hidden in cover near the nest . Parents and helper birds will feed them for around one month after fledging . Young birds often remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group . Birds reach sexual maturity at one year of age , but females tend not to breed until their third year as breeding vacancies are scarce . The nests of red @-@ winged fairywrens rarely play host to brood parasites , though parasitism by the Horsfield 's bronze cuckoo ( Chrysococcyx basalis ) and the fan @-@ tailed cuckoo ( Cacomantis flabelliformis ) has been recorded . 
 = 1984 European Cup Final = 
 The 1984 European Cup Final was an association football match between Liverpool of England and Roma of Italy on 30 May 1984 at the Stadio Olimpico , Rome , Italy . It was the final match of the 1983 – 84 season of Europe 's premier cup competition , the European Cup . Liverpool were appearing in their fourth final , having won the competition in 1977 , 1978 and 1981 . Roma were appearing in their first European Cup final . 
 Each club needed to progress through four rounds to reach the final . Matches were contested over two legs , with a match at each team 's home ground . Liverpool 's matches ties ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories . They beat Athletic Bilbao by a single goal in the second round , while they beat Benfica 5 – 1 on aggregate in the quarter @-@ finals . Roma 's matches were all close affairs , winning their ties up to the semi @-@ final by two goal margins . They beat Dundee United 3 – 2 on aggregate in the semi @-@ finals , although it was later revealed that Roma had bribed the referee in the second leg of the semi @-@ final . This meant that two British clubs were denied finals of European cup competitions that year after Nottingham Forest were knocked out by Anderlecht in the UEFA Cup semi @-@ finals after <unk> had bribed the ref . 
 As the final was held at Roma 's home ground they went into the match as favourites , despite Liverpool 's previous record in the competition .

 In the second round Liverpool were drawn against Spanish champions Athletic Bilbao . The first leg in England ended 0 – 0 , but Liverpool won the second leg at the San Mamés Stadium 1 – 0 courtesy of an Ian Rush goal to win the tie 1 – 0 on aggregate . Liverpool 's opponents in the quarter @-@ finals were Portuguese champions Benfica . Liverpool won the first leg in England 1 – 0 after another Rush goal .

 Liverpool had finished the 1983 – 84 Football League as champions . They had also won the 1983 – 84 Football League Cup beating Everton 1 – 0 in a replay after the final finished 0 – 0 . Their success meant that Liverpool entered the match with the chance to win an unprecedented treble . Roma had finished second during the 1983 – 84 Serie A and won the 1983 – 84 Coppa Italia , they had qualified for the European Cup Winners ' Cup as a result , but victory would enable them to compete in the European Cup the following season . 
 The final was held at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome , which was Roma 's home ground . UEFA decided that the match would still be played at the stadium , despite it being Roma 's home ground . Therefore , the match was effectively a home match for them . The stadium was significant for Liverpool as well , as their victory in 1977 came at the ground . With home advantage Roma went into the match as favourites , and were 13 – 8 with bookmakers to win the match .

 The opening passages of the match were tentative . Faced with a hostile atmosphere , Liverpool were content to sit back and frustrate Roma . Despite this tactic , Liverpool took the lead in the 15th minute . Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch . Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area , which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan . The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball , Roma defenders tried to clear the ball , but Michele Nappi 's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi 's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1 – 0 lead . Two minutes later , Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range , but his goal was disallowed for offside . 
 Roma had a chance to equalise in the 27th minute , but Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar saved Conti 's low shot . Neal was shown a yellow card in the 32nd minute for bringing down Conti , and a few minutes later Liverpool had an opportunity to extend their lead . Liverpool striker Rush charged down Dario Bonetti 's clearance and ran onto the ball , but his shot was saved by Tancredi . With minutes remaining until half @-@ time , Roma equalised . Sebastiano <unk> passed to Conti , who ran down the left @-@ hand side of the pitch . His first attempt at crossing the ball into the penalty area was blocked by a combination of Neal and Mark Lawrenson , but his cross rebounded back to him . His second attempt found Roberto Pruzzo in the penalty area , whose glancing header went into the Liverpool goal to level the scores at 1 – 1 . 
 Roma came out for the second half buoyed by their equaliser and they started the half the better of the two sides . Despite this , they were unable to break down the Liverpool defence , with Lawrenson in particular performing well . Roma began to control the midfield with the Brazilian duo Falcão and <unk> Cerezo combining to combat Souness in the Liverpool midfield . Roma 's best chance of this period was a 25 yards ( 23 m ) shot from Falcão which Grobbelaar saved . Roma began to lose control after their period of control , with both sides abandoning their initial game plans for fearing of conceding a goal . Liverpool substituted striker Johnston with defender Steve Nicol in the 72nd minute . The best chance of the half came in the 85th minute ; Kenny Dalglish found Nicol in the Roma penalty area , but his shot was saved by Tancredi . The scores stayed level throughout the remainder of the half , which meant that the match would go into extra @-@ time . 
 Extra time provided little action ; the only player that looked like changing the scoreline was Conti , whose runs at Neal caused the Liverpool defender problems . Despite this , the score remained the same through the 30 minutes of extra time and the match went to a penalty @-@ shoot @-@ out . Liverpool were the first to take a penalty , but Nicol put his shot over the crossbar . Graziani stepped up to take Roma 's first penalty , but Roma captain Agostino Di Bartolomei took the ball from him and took the penalty instead , scoring to give Roma the lead . Liverpool 's next penalty was taken by their regular penalty taker Neal who scored to level the shoot @-@ out . Conti took the next penalty for Roma , but like Nicol he put his shot over the crossbar . Souness and Ubaldo Righetti converted their respective penalties to make the scoreline 2 – 2 . Rush scored Liverpool 's next penalty to make the score 3 – 2 . Graziani stepped up again to take Roma 's fourth penalty . While he was placing the ball on the penalty spot , Liverpool goalkeeper Grobbelaar was wobbling his legs in the Liverpool goal , hoping to distract Graziani . The tactic appeared to have worked as Graziani placed his penalty over the crossbar . Alan Kennedy was the next player to take a penalty and if he scored Liverpool would win the match . Kennedy scored the penalty sending Tancredi the wrong way . Liverpool won the shoot @-@ out 4 – 2 , thereby winning their fourth European Cup .

 The finetooth shark ( Carcharhinus isodon ) is a species of requiem shark , in the family Carcharhinidae , found in the western Atlantic Ocean , from North Carolina to Brazil . It forms large schools in shallow , coastal waters , and migrates seasonally following warm water . A relatively small , slender @-@ bodied shark , the finetooth shark can be identified by its needle @-@ like teeth , dark blue @-@ gray dorsal coloration , and long gill slits . It attains a maximum length of 1 @.@ 9 m ( 6 @.@ 2 ft ) . The diet of this species consists primarily of small bony fishes , in particular menhaden . Like other members of its family , it is viviparous with females giving birth to two to six pups in estuarine nursery areas every other year . 
 Valued for its meat , the finetooth shark forms an important component of the commercial gillnet shark fishery operating off the southeastern United States . Population assessments suggest that this fishery does not currently pose a threat to U.S. populations of the species . The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern , though no fishery data are available for this species off South America . This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans , though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The finetooth shark was originally described as Carcharias ( <unk> ) isodon by French zoologist Achille Valenciennes , in Müller and Henle 's 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen . The type specimen is a 65 @-@ cm ( 26 @-@ in ) juvenile male , possibly caught off New York . This species was later moved to the genus Carcharhinus . The specific epithet isodon means " equal teeth " in Greek , and refers to the similar number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws . This species may also be referred to as the <unk> shark , smoothtooth shark , or night shark ( usually used for C. signatus ) . 
 As is the case for most Carcharhinus species , attempts to analyze the finetooth shark 's phylogenetic relationships have yielded variable results . In 1988 , Leonard Compagno grouped this species with the spinner shark ( C. brevipinna ) , blacktip shark ( C. limbatus ) , graceful shark ( C. amblyrhynchoides ) , and smooth tooth blacktip shark ( C. leiodon ) , on the basis of morphological characters . Gavin Naylor 's 1992 allozyme analysis found that the finetooth shark is the second @-@ most basal member of the genus next to the blacknose shark ( C. acronotus ) . Mine Dosay @-@ <unk> 's 2008 study , based on ribosomal DNA , suggested that the closest relative of the finetooth shark is the smalltail shark ( C. porosus ) , and that the two species form a clade apart from other Carcharhinus species . 
 = = Description = = 
 The body of the finetooth shark is slender and streamlined . The snout is long and pointed , with the nares preceded by short , broadly triangular flaps of skin . The eyes are large and round , with nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) . The mouth is broad with well @-@ defined furrows at the corners . Twelve to 15 tooth rows occur on either side of the upper jaw and 13 – 14 tooth rows on either side of the lower jaw . Each tooth is small and needle @-@ like , with a narrow central cusp and smooth to minutely serrated edges . The five pairs of gill slits are long , measuring about half the length of the dorsal fin base . 
 The first dorsal fin is high and triangular with a pointed apex , originating forward of the free rear tips of the pectoral fins . The second dorsal fin is relatively large and originates over the anal fin . No ridge runs between the dorsal fins . The pectoral fins are small and sickle @-@ shaped , with pointed tips . The dermal denticles are small and overlapping , each bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth . Living finetooth sharks are a distinctive dark bluish @-@ gray above and white below , with a faint pale stripe on the flanks and no prominent fin markings . Some individuals from Florida have green eyes . Males average 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) in length and females 1 @.@ 7 m ( 5 @.@ 4 ft ) ; the largest shark on record was 1 @.@ 9 m ( 6 @.@ 2 ft ) long . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 In North American waters , the finetooth shark is common and found from North Carolina to the northern Gulf of Mexico , and very occasionally straying as far north as New York . In Central and South American waters , it is rare , but may occur more widely than presently known , having been reported off Trinidad and Guyana , infrequently from the Caribbean Sea , and off southern Brazil from São Paulo to Santa Catarina . The northwestern Atlantic , Gulf of Mexico , and South America populations are distinct , with little interchange between them . Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and Guinea @-@ Bissau , but these likely represent misidentifications of spinner sharks ( C. brevipinna ) . 
 The finetooth shark is often found near beaches and in bays and estuaries . It inhabits extremely shallow waters , no deeper than 10 m ( 33 ft ) in the summer and 20 m ( 66 ft ) deep in the winter . Historically , it was known to venture into rivers in the Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas , though most of paths into this area are now blocked by dams . The northwestern Atlantic population of this species is strongly migratory : juveniles , followed by adults , arrive off South Carolina from late March to early May , when the water temperature rises above 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) . They remain until September to mid @-@ October , until the water temperature drops and they move south to Florida . The movements of other populations are unknown . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Adult and juvenile finetooth sharks form large schools . This energetic , fast @-@ moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes , often entering the surf zone during the day to hunt . The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden ( Brevoortia tyrannus ) , with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else . The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed . Other known prey species include spot croaker ( <unk> <unk> ) , Spanish mackerel ( Scomberomorus maculatus ) , mullet ( <unk> spp . ) , shrimp , and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark ( Rhizoprionodon <unk> ) , which may have been scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler . The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks . Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm <unk> <unk> , and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium , Paraorygmatobothrium , and Phoreiobothrium . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Like other requiem sharks , the finetooth shark is viviparous : the developing embryos are nourished by yolk for the first 15 weeks , after which the depleted yolk sac develops into a placental connection to the mother . Females produce litters of two to six pups every other year . In the northwestern Atlantic , mating occurs from early May to early June and the young are born at around the same time the following year after a 12 @-@ month gestation period . The males bite at the female to hold her for copulation . The semen exuded by the male <unk> into a large , spongy mass inside the female 's uterus , in which the individual spermatozoa are embedded . Called a " <unk> " , the function of this short @-@ lived structure is unknown . Newborn finetooth sharks measure 48 – 64 cm ( 19 – 25 in ) long . Shallow bays and estuaries , such as Bull 's Bay in South Carolina , serve as critical nursery areas for newborns and juveniles . 
 Female finetooth sharks grow much more slowly and to a larger ultimate size than males . Individuals in the northwestern Atlantic population have a larger body size and reach sexual maturation later than those in the Gulf of Mexico population ; males in the two populations grow at similar rates , but northwestern Atlantic females grow more slowly than Gulf of Mexico females . In the northwestern Atlantic , males mature at a fork length ( length from snout tip to caudal fin fork ) of 99 cm ( 39 in ) and females at 102 cm ( 40 in ) , corresponding to ages of 5 and 6 years , respectively . In the Gulf of Mexico , males mature at a fork length of 94 cm ( 37 in ) and females at 99 cm ( 39 in ) , corresponding to ages of 4 and 5 years , respectively . The maximum lifespan has been estimated to be at least 9 years for males and 14 years for females . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The finetooth shark has never been implicated in an attack on humans . However , when caught , this shark thrashes and snaps at anything within range , and people have been bitten attempting to handle it . <unk> sharks are used for human consumption fresh or dried and salted . Other than off the southeastern United States , this species is of little commercial importance : it is small and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and recreational fisheries , and is generally too fast @-@ swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers . Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook @-@ and @-@ line . This species is susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate , and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits . 
 Substantial numbers of finetooth sharks are caught in drift gillnets operated by the shark fishery off southeastern United States , which peaked in 1999 at about 117 tons landed . Stock assessments conducted in 2002 suggested that U.S. populations had not yet been overfished , but that the catch rate was unsustainable , whereas assessments conducted in 2007 concluded that catch rates did not exceed sustainable levels and that populations were stable . Fishing for this species in U.S. waters is regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Service 1993 Fisheries Management Plan for Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico sharks ; it is classified as a " small coastal shark " for the purposes of commercial quotas and recreational bag limits . As a result , the IUCN has assessed the finetooth shark as of Least Concern overall and off the U.S. and Mexico . Concern <unk> this species in South America , where its numbers seem naturally low and it is potentially under heavy pressure by widespread , intensive coastal fisheries . However , the IUCN does not have sufficient data to assess its status in the region beyond Data Deficient . 
 = New York State Route 488 = 
 New York State Route 488 ( NY 488 ) is a state highway in Ontario County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 9 @.@ 53 miles ( 15 @.@ 34 km ) from an intersection with NY 21 in the town of Hopewell , near the city of Canandaigua , to a junction with NY 96 midway between the villages of Phelps and Clifton Springs . NY 488 also passes through the hamlet of Orleans , located within the town of Phelps . Although NY 488 is signed as a north – south highway , most of the route follows an east – west alignment . NY 488 was originally designated as part of NY 88 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 88 was truncated to the village of Phelps in August 1972 , at which time its former routing between NY 21 and NY 96 was renumbered to NY 488 , eliminating an overlap with NY 96 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 488 begins at an intersection with NY 21 in the hamlet of Chapin , a small community within the Ontario County town of Hopewell . The highway progresses eastward , crossing the Finger Lakes Railway at a grade crossing less than 100 yards ( 91 m ) from NY 21 . Just past the railroad , the route makes a slight turn to the northeast for 0 @.@ 25 miles ( 0 @.@ 40 km ) before curving back to the east and continuing across open farmland . As NY 488 crosses the town of Hopewell , it serves a handful of isolated homes and intersects several north – south highways of local importance , including County Road 47 ( CR 47 ) . The route continues eastward into the town of Phelps , where it serves a pair of large farms on its way to the small hamlet of Orleans , located on both the western bank of Flint Creek and the right @-@ of @-@ way of the now @-@ defunct Pennsylvania Railroad ( PRR ) . 
 In the western portion of Orleans , NY 488 intersects with the north – south CR 20 , which leads to most of the hamlet 's residences . NY 488 , meanwhile , bypasses most of the community to the northwest as it makes a gradual turn to the north to follow Flint Creek and the old PRR right @-@ of @-@ way toward the village of Phelps . Outside of Orleans , the route reenters mostly rural surroundings as it approaches a junction with CR 43 . While CR 43 heads north toward Clifton Springs , NY 488 turns to the northeast , following the creek and the old rail bed past the large reservoir serving the village of Newark . At an intersection with Trimble and Griffith Roads , the highway turns back to the north , matching a similar curve in the creek 's routing . NY 488 continues on , crossing the former right @-@ of @-@ way of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and passing <unk> High School on an otherwise nondescript stretch before ending at an intersection with NY 96 west of the village of Phelps .

The reconstruction of the highway was 70 percent complete by 1920 and finished by 1926 , by which time the highway was added to the state highway system as State Highway 1278 ( SH 1278 ) . The north – south highway connecting Orleans to the village of Phelps was rebuilt to state highway standards c . 1930 as SH 1863 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , SH 1278 and SH 1863 became part of the new NY 88 , which began in the village of Sodus and extended southward through Phelps to the intersection of West Avenue and Main Street in Canandaigua . NY 88 was truncated on its southern end to Phelps c . 1973 . Its former routing from NY 21 in the hamlet of Chapin to NY 96 west of Phelps was renumbered to NY 488 as part of a project statewide to eliminate useless overlaps such as NY 88 and NY 96 .

 Wilfred Barber , known as Wilf Barber ( 18 April 1901 – 10 September 1968 ) , was a professional first @-@ class cricketer who played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1926 to 1947 . He played two Test matches for England in 1935 against South Africa . An opening batsman with an excellent batting technique , Barber often batted in the middle order . He scored 16 @,@ 402 runs in first @-@ class cricket at an average of 34 @.@ 28 with 29 centuries . Barber made his debut in 1926 and made several appearances over the next few seasons . Despite a sound defence , Barber did not secure a regular first team place until 1932 . He scored a thousand runs for the first time that season , a feat he was to achieve eight times , while he scored over 2 @,@ 000 runs in 1935 . Until the Second World War broke out , Barber continued as a regular member of the Yorkshire side . After the war , he played one more full season before retiring in 1947 . His career continued in club cricket and he went on to coach local sides before his death in 1968 . 
 = = Career = = 
 Barber was born on 18 April 1901 in Cleckheaton , Yorkshire . He did not appear for the Yorkshire Second XI until he was 25 , in 1926 , when he scored 600 runs , including a century , and averaged 40 . The same season , he made his first @-@ class debut for Yorkshire against Worcestershire without playing a single innings . He was scheduled to bat later in the innings and was not needed to bat as Yorkshire completed an easy victory . In the next season , he was chosen to play three matches , with a top score of 18 . For the next few years , he was unable to attain a regular spot in the Yorkshire side as there were many batsmen competing for places . In the 1928 season , Barber played 16 matches , mainly when other batsmen were required in representative matches , passing fifty for the first time in an innings of 98 against the West Indians , and followed this with two other fifties . Next season , he scored his maiden first @-@ class century against the South Africans in an innings of 108 , out of a team total of 335 , with no other batsman reaching fifty . In total , he played on 22 occasions and scored 857 runs at an average of 30 @.@ 60 , including a second century , against Glamorgan . However , Barber was in and out of the side over the next two seasons . He did not play 20 matches or reach 500 runs in either season and passed fifty only four times in total . 
 Matters changed for Barber in the 1932 season , when Yorkshire 's regular , long serving opening batsman Percy Holmes began to suffer with illness . This left a batting place empty and enabled Barber to play more regularly . Wisden Cricketer 's Almanack believed that he thoroughly deserved his place in the team as he scored exactly 1 @,@ 000 runs at an average of 25 @.@ 64 , the first time he reached four figures in a season . He finished fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages , the first time he had been placed so high . His runs also played a part in Yorkshire winning the County Championship in his first full season . After this breakthrough , Barber steadily improved his total of runs and batting average , helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship twice in 1933 and 1935 . In 1933 , he scored 1 @,@ 595 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 93 , and in 1934 he scored 1 @,@ 927 runs at an average of 40 @.@ 14 . In both seasons he finished fourth in the Yorkshire averages . However , Barber 's best season statistically was the following season , 1935 , when he achieved his best aggregate of runs and highest average in an English season , passing 2 @,@ 000 runs in a season for the only time in his career . He scored 2 @,@ 147 runs at an average of 42 @.@ 09 and finished third in the Yorkshire averages . These performances earned him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord 's Cricket Ground for the only time in his career , where he scored 61 and 18 not out . 
 Also in 1935 , Barber was chosen to represent England in the Test series against South Africa . He played in the third and fourth Tests after England had lost the second match to be 1 – 0 down in the series . He was one of six Yorkshire players selected that season . He scored 83 runs in four innings with a highest score of 44 in the fourth Test but England only drew these matches and he was left out of the final game . He also took a wicket with his second ( and final ) ball in Test cricket , when the match was heading towards an obvious draw . Following these matches , he was chosen to go on the non @-@ Test playing tour by the Marylebone Cricket Club of Australia and New Zealand that winter under the captaincy of Errol Holmes . He was the senior professional but was not as effective as had been expected in Australia . However , in New Zealand he scored 365 runs in the matches against a New Zealand representative team , at an average of 60 @.@ 83 . He scored 797 runs in all first @-@ class matches , average 41 @.@ 94 , including two centuries . 
 Although Barber did not play any more Tests , his scoring was consistent in the four seasons up until World War II . In all but 1936 ( he scored 993 runs that year ) , he scored around 1 @,@ 500 runs and in all but 1938 ( he averaged just under 34 ) , he averaged between 36 and 38 . He was second in the Yorkshire batting averages in 1936 , fourth in 1937 and 1939 but slipped to sixth in 1938 . Following the war , Barber played one more full season , scoring 1 @,@ 170 runs at an average of 30 @.@ 00 in 1946 to be fourth in the Yorkshire averages . It was the eighth and final time he passed 1 @,@ 000 runs in a season . During these seasons , Barber 's runs contributed to Yorkshire being County Champions in four consecutive seasons from 1937 to 1939 and then again after the war in 1946 . He played a further three matches in 1947 to bring his career to a close . From 1932 , when Barber became a regular player , until his last full season in 1946 , he was part of a Championship winning side seven times . 
 = = Style and achievements = = 
 Barber scored a total of 16 @,@ 402 runs in his career with 29 hundreds and 182 catches , and was described by Gerald Howat as " the fourth pillar " of the Yorkshire batting in the mid @-@ 1930s ( after Herbert Sutcliffe , Maurice Leyland and Arthur Mitchell ) . A generally defensive batsman , he played carefully in the tradition of Yorkshire opening batsmen . Jim Kilburn said that Barber was " small in stature but upright in style " . He was a good batsman on the off side and had a very good defensive technique , while his strength on the leg side was noted on his Test debut . Although an opening batsman , he often went in lower down the batting order . He was more comfortable in normal circumstances than in a crisis and did not enjoy batting on difficult pitches . Bill Bowes called him the most correct and orthodox batsman he had seen , even more so than Len Hutton . Barber was a kind , modest man , who never believed that his contribution was good enough , even if he had scored a century . On his death , Wisden described him as having " rendered admirable service . " 
 Barber 's highest score was 255 against Surrey in 1935 . In this innings , he opened the batting and shared three successive century partnerships . Barber also scored 248 against Kent in 1934 . He had scored 73 in the first innings but Kent had built up a lead of 148 on the second day of the match . Barber , opening the batting with Len Hutton , scored 248 and shared a stand of 267 for the first wicket . As a result , Yorkshire drew the game . Barber shared in seven other century opening partnerships Yorkshire , four of them with Arthur Mitchell , and six other 200 partnerships . This included a stand of 346 in four and a half hours with Maurice Leyland , against Middlesex in 1932 which was a record for Yorkshire 's second wicket . His fielding , generally done in the deep , was described by Wisden as " first rate " . Bowes said that he once went for nearly three years without dropping a catch on the leg side boundary from his bowling . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 After his retirement , Barber played club cricket into his fifties , playing for <unk> Green and King Cross until 1952 . He went on to play for Mirfield in the Central Yorkshire League between 1952 and 1955 . There , he was the club 's first professional once it reformed in 1952 . During his time at the club , Barber scored eleven half centuries and won an award for his batting . After he left Mirfield , he became coach to the North Riding Educational Authorities , later working as coach and groundsman at a school in Harrogate . He died , aged 67 , in a hospital in Bradford after a short illness , on 10 September 1968 . 
 = Gandingan = 
 The gandingan is a Philippine set of four large , hanging gongs used by the Maguindanao as part of their kulintang ensemble . When integrated into the ensemble , it functions as a secondary melodic instrument after the main melodic instrument , the kulintang . When played solo , the gandingan allows fellow Maguindanao to communicate with each other , allowing them to send messages or warnings via long distances . This ability to imitate tones of the Maguindanao language using this instrument has given the gandingan connotation : the “ talking gongs . ” 
 = = Description = = 
 The instrument is usually described as four , large , shallow @-@ bossed , thin @-@ rimmed gongs , vertically hung , either from a strong support such as a tree limb or housed in a strong wooden framed stand . The gongs are arranged in graduated fashion in pairs with knobs of the lower @-@ pitched gongs facing each other and the higher @-@ pitched gongs doing the same . Normally , the lower @-@ pitched gongs would be situated on the left side and the higher pitched gongs on the right side of the player if he / she were right @-@ handed . This arrangement in fact is similar to the arrangement of gongs on the horizontally laid kulintang – so much so , in fact that master musicians say it duplicates the pattern of intervals used on the four lower @-@ pitched gongs of the kulintang . 
 The gongs , themselves , although variable in pitch , are relatively similar in size . <unk> range from 1 @.@ 8 to 2 feet and 5 to 8 inches ( including the boss ) in width for the smallest to largest gongs respectively . Because of their slight differences , smaller gongs could be placed into larger gongs , making transport of these gongs more portable than an agung ’ s , whose turned @-@ in @-@ rim eliminates that possibility . 
 Traditionally , the metal used for the gandingan was bronze but due to its scarcity , gandingans are more commonly made of less valuable metals such as brass and even iron . Recently , galvanized iron sheets have been used where different parts of the gong ( the knob , body and rim ) would be made from separate sheets and welded together , then grinded out to produce a finished product . Comparatively , these newer gongs have a higher pitch and are smaller in size than those made in older times . 
 = = Technique = = 
 The gandingan is usually played while standing behind the instrument with the gandingan player holding two wooden mallets . The mallets , called balu , are wrapped tightly with strips of rubber at one end and are considered lighter and smaller than those balu used for the agung . The rubber ends of the balu are held between the opposing knobs of the gandingan and the player would use them to strike the knobs to achieve a sound . 
 Gandingan players can demonstrate different techniques dependent on the occasion . In formal kulintang performances , players would use all four gongs , but during some informal occasions , such as a playing style called apad and <unk> , players would use only three of the highest pitched gongs of the gandingan . And in instances such as gandingan contest , gandingan players may be assisted by two <unk> ( kulintang assistants ) who would hold the gongs steadily in place as players ferociously demonstrate their virtuosity on the instrument .

 = = = Ensemble = = = 
 Traditionally among the Maguindanao , the main function of the gandingan was its use as a secondary melodic instrument after the kulintang in the kulintang ensemble . In olden style of play , strictly done by women , the patterns used function to feature / highlight / reinforce the rhythmic modes already established by the singular <unk> and dabakan . Women players would use a limited number of patterns that were repeated to provide a sonorous foundation to the entire ensemble . 
 = = = Contest = = = 
 Newer styles of play have recently emerged , pushing the bounds of what the gandingan was traditionally used for . One type of play called <unk> requires players to perform highly dense , complicated rhythmic patterns upon the gandingan . This type of play unlike the olden ( kamamatuan ) style of gandingan playing requires assistants to hold the gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound . Because of the strenuous type of play , male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity , considered a sign of masculinity , on the gandingan . During a gandingan contest , two expert gandingan players ( <unk> ) would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other . This type of play is said to have evolved from the spread of <unk> style on the agung . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Another type of play , called apad , is used for conveying linguistic messages from one player to another . This ability to mimic the intonations of the Maguindanao language on the three highest @-@ tuned gongs has dubbed the gandingan as the talking gongs . 
 Traditionally , because of strict rules forbidding direct conversational interactions between the sexes , the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another . Using the gandingan , young men and women would spend hours teasing , flirting , gossiping , playing guessing games , trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another . For instance , if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn ’ t like her back , the boy wouldn ’ t resort to telling his friends literally he didn ’ t like her . Instead , he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song . 
 In fact , during the 1950s , many families would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play . Young men would gather around the gandingan and gossip about people they dislike , usually “ chatting ” with other gandingan players further away . Locals says much of this jovial talk even contained sexual innuendoes , where all kinds of dirty words could be heard penetrating the night air . 
 <unk> were also used by a young man and woman who were having strong feelings for one another and if the feelings were just right , the couple would elope with one another . For instance , if the young man wanted to ask the young women “ to come here , ” the man would play on the gandingan , “ <unk> Ka <unk> . ” Another common message couples would play is , “ <unk> ko <unk> , ” literally meaning , “ I am waiting for you . ” 
 Along with those trivial messages , gandingans were also used in more seriously matters when signaling to others of imminent danger . During martial law , gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos ’ soldiers . Every time the villagers received the signal , they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them , the gandingan was responsible for the scurry . So they arrested the gandingan player . A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone ’ s carabao . In order to keep his brother from getting arrested , the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house . But like Marcos ’ soldiers , the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The etymology of the term , “ gandingan , ” is unknown but it appears in many Maguindanao folk tales and epics . For instance , one folk tale states the <unk> Gandingan is a place known for a powerful sultan and his beautiful daughter while in another epic , Raja sa <unk> , Gandingan is the proper name of a place where hostile datus ( who attempted to abduct a princess from the prince of <unk> ) live . Perhaps the most significant mention of the gandingan in an epic tale is in the Maguindanao epic <unk> , where word “ gandingan ” actually refers to the instrument itself . In the epic , a young princess , <unk> na <unk> , uses the gandingan to inform her sister , <unk> na <unk> , about a hero prince , <unk> , who was looking for a wife . Thanks to that message , <unk> na <unk> was able to entertain the hero prince using a kulintang into her heart . This use of the gandingan in this epic exemplifies that its use as a form of communication was pre @-@ Islamic in origin . 
 The origins of the gongs themselves are still disputed by scholars . It is likely , as observed by Thomas Forrest , a British explorer , that gongs without knobs on them ( like the gandingan ) came from China . However , other sources suggest the gandingan came to the Philippines via Indonesia or Malaysian Sarawak due to similar gandingan @-@ type instruments found among the Tausug of Sulu . 
 = = Similar instruments = = 
 The set of four , large hanging gongs is confined mainly to the Maguindanao . Scholars says the Maranao used to use the gandingan but the instrument has disappeared from usage in Maranao ensembles of today . The Tausug have a gandingan @-@ type gong with a narrow @-@ rim called a <unk> or <unk> one of the three agungs used in the Tausug kulintang ensemble . The Samal have something similar called a <unk> . Other gongs similar to the gandingan are the handheld gongs of the <unk> ( <unk> sua ) and Tiruray ( karatung ) used in their agung ensembles , the latter group sometimes substituting Maguindanao gandingan gongs for their <unk> . 
 = Nemertea = 
 Nemertea is a phylum of invertebrate animals also known as " ribbon worms " or " proboscis worms " . Alternative names for the phylum have included <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Although most are less than 20 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) long , one specimen has been estimated at 54 metres ( 177 ft ) . Most are very slim , usually only a few millimeters wide , although a few have relatively short but wide bodies . Many have patterns of yellow , orange , red and green coloration . 
 The foregut , stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body , the anus is at the tip of the tail , and the mouth is under the front . A little above the gut is the rhynchocoel , a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body . All species have a proboscis which lies in the rhynchocoel when inactive but everts ( turns inside @-@ out ) to emerge just above the mouth and capture the animal 's prey with venom . A very stretchy muscle in the back of the rhynchocoel pulls the proboscis in when an attack ends . A few species with stubby bodies filter feed and have suckers at the front and back ends , with which they attach to a host . 
 The brain is a ring of four ganglia , positioned around the rhynchocoel near its front end . At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run along the length of the body . Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors , and on their heads some species have a number of pigment @-@ cup ocelli . These ocelli can detect light but can not form an image . Nemerteans respire through the skin . They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop , and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid . There is no heart , and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall . To filter out soluble waste products , flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels , and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside . 
 All nemerteans move slowly , using their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime , while larger species use muscular waves to crawl , and some swim by dorso @-@ ventral undulations . A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom . About a dozen species inhabit freshwater , mainly in the tropics and subtropics , and another dozen species live on land in cool , damp places . Most nemerteans are carnivores , feeding on annelids , clams and crustaceans . A few species are scavengers , and a few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs . Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs . Nemerteans have few predators . Two species are sold as fish bait . 
 In most species the sexes are separate , but all the freshwater species are hermaphroditic . Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads ( ovaries or testes ) , and build temporary gonoducts ( ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted ) , one per gonad , when the ova and sperm are ready . The eggs are generally fertilised externally . Some species shed them into the water , and others protect their eggs in various ways . The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development , in which the fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division . The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles ( like the adult but smaller ) or to form planuliform larvae , in which the larva 's long axis is the same as the juvenile 's . However , some form a <unk> larva , in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva 's body , and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges . The bodies of some species fragment readily , and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies . 
 It has been suggested that three fossil species may be nemerteans , but none is confirmed . Traditional taxonomy divides the phylum in two classes , Anopla ( " unarmed " – their proboscises do not have a little dagger ) with two orders , and Enopla ( " armed " with a dagger ) with two orders . However , it is now accepted that Anopla are paraphyletic ( have given rise to another group ) , as one order is more closely related to Enopla than to the other order of Anopla . The phylum Nemertea is monophyletic , whose synapomorphies include the rhynchocoel and eversible proboscis . Traditional taxonomy says that nemerteans are closely related to flatworms and that both are relatively " primitive " acoelomates . Now both phyla are regarded as members of the Lophotrochozoa , a very large " super @-@ phylum " that also includes molluscs , annelids , brachiopods , bryozoa and many other protostomes . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1555 Olaus Magnus wrote of a marine worm which was apparently 17 @.@ 76 metres ( 58 @.@ 3 ft ) long ( " 40 cubits " ) , about the width of a child 's arm , and whose touch made a hand swell . William Borlase wrote in 1758 of a " sea long worm " , and in 1770 Gunnerus wrote a formal description of this animal , which he called Ascaris <unk> . Its current name , <unk> longissimus , was first used in 1806 by Sowerby . In 1995 , a total of 1 @,@ 149 species had been described and grouped into 250 genera . 
 Nemertea are named after the Greek sea @-@ nymph <unk> , one of the daughters of Nereus and Doris . Alternative names for the phylum have included <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The Nemertodermatida are a separate phylum , whose closest relatives appear to be the Acoela . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = Body structure and major cavities = = = 
 Nemerteans are very unusual animals . 
 The typical nemertean body is very slim in proportion to its length . The smallest are a few millimeters long , most are less than 20 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) , and several exceed 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . The longest animal ever found , at 54 metres ( 177 ft ) long , may be a specimen of <unk> longissimus , although L. longissimus is usually only a few millimeters wide . The bodies of most nemerteans can stretch a lot , up to 10 times their resting length in some species , but reduce their length to 50 % and increase their width to 300 % when disturbed . A few have relatively short but wide bodies , for example <unk> grossa is up to 3 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) long and 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) wide , and some of these are much less stretchy . Smaller nemerteans are approximately cylindrical , but larger species are flattened dorso @-@ ventrally . Many have visible patterns in various combinations of yellow , orange , red and green . 
 The outermost layer of the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites , which form the mucus in which the cilia glide . Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli . The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane , the dermis . Next to the dermis are at least three layers of muscles , some circular and some longitudinal . The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes , but these are not associated with differences in movement . Nemerteans also have dorso @-@ ventral muscles , which flatten the animals , especially in the larger species . Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme , a kind of connective tissue . In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant . 
 The mouth is ventral and a little behind the front of the body . The foregut , stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body and the anus is at the tip of the tail . Above the gut and separated from the gut by mesenchyme is the rhynchocoel , a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body . The rhynchocoel of class Anopla has an orifice a little to the front of the mouth , but still under the front of the body . In the other class , Enopla , the mouth and the front of the rhynchocoel share an orifice . The rhynchocoel is a coelom , as it is lined by epithelium . 
 = = = <unk> and feeding = = = 
 The proboscis is an <unk> of the body wall , and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive . When muscles in the wall of the rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel , the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside @-@ out to attack the animal 's prey along a canal called the <unk> and through an orifice , the proboscis pore . The proboscis has a muscle which attaches to the back of the rhynchocoel , and which can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and then retract the proboscis . 
 The proboscis of the class Anopla ( " unarmed " ) exits from an orifice which is separate from the mouth , coils around the prey and immobilizes it by sticky , toxic secretions . The Anopla can attack as soon as they move into the range of the proboscis . Some Anopla have branched proboscises which can be described as " a mass of sticky spaghetti " . The animal then draws its prey into its mouth . 
 In most of the class Enopla ( " armed " ) , the proboscis exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth . A typical member of this class has a stylet , a calcareous barb , with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions . The prey is then swallowed whole or , after partial digestion , its tissues are sucked into the mouth . The stylet is attached about one @-@ third of distance from the end of the everted proboscis , which extends only enough to expose the stylet . On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back @-@ up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost . Instead of one stylet , the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets , and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth , unlike other Enopla . The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey . 
 Some nemerteans , such as L. longissimus , absorb organic food in solution through their skins , which may make the long , slim bodies an advantage . Suspension feeding is found only among the specialized symbiotic <unk> , which have a proboscis but no stylet , and use suckers to attach themselves to bivalves . 
 = = = Respiration and circulatory system = = = 
 Nemerteans lack specialized gills , and respiration occurs over the surface of the body , which is long and sometimes flattened . Like other animals with thick body walls , they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies . The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels , while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity . The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis , and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing . The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation . The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms . 
 In the simplest type of circulatory system , two lateral vessels are joined at the ends to form a loop . However , many species have additional long @-@ wise and cross @-@ wise vessels . There is no heart nor pumping vessels , and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both the vessels and the body wall 's muscles . In some species , circulation is intermittent , and fluid ebbs and flows in the long @-@ wise vessels . The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless , but in some species it contains cells that are yellow , orange , green or red . The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen , but the function of the other pigments is unknown . 
 = = = Excretion = = = 
 Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products , especially nitrogenous by @-@ products of cellular metabolism . In nemertean protonephridia , flame cells which filter out the wastes are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels . The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts , one on either side , and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit . <unk> and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines , sometimes thousands . The reason may be that osmoregulation is more difficult in non @-@ marine environments . 
 = = = Nervous system and senses = = = 
 The central nervous system consists of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run along the length of the body . The brain is a ring of four ganglia , masses of nerve cells , positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut . Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords , many species have additional paired cords , and some species also have a dorsal cord . In some species the cords lie within the skin , but in most they are deeper , inside the muscle layers . The central nervous system is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin . This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia , for example while burrowing in oxygen @-@ free sediments . 
 Some species have paired cerebral organs , sacs whose only openings are to the outside . Others species have unpaired <unk> organs on the front of their heads . Some have slits along the side of the head or grooves obliquely across the head , and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs . All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors , and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation . Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors . On their head some species have a number of pigment @-@ cup ocelli , which can detect light but not form an image . Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli , although some have hundreds . A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts , which sense balance . 
 <unk> peregrina , which feeds on polychaetes , can follow the prey 's trails of mucus , and find its burrow by backtracking along its own trail of mucus .

 All nemerteans move slowly . Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime , some of which is produced by glands in the head . Larger species use muscular waves to crawl , and some aquatic species swim by dorso @-@ ventral undulations . Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis , and have powerful muscles . Some species of the suborder Monostilifera , whose proboscis have one active stylet , move by extending the proboscis , sticking it to an object and pulling the animal towards the object . 
 = = = Reproduction and life cycle = = = 
 Larger species often break up when stimulated , and the fragments often grow into full individuals . Some species fragment routinely and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies . All reproduce sexually , and most species are <unk> ( the sexes are separate ) , but all the freshwater forms are hermaphroditic . 
 Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads ( ovaries or testes ) , forming a row down each side of the body in the mesenchyme . Temporary gonoducts ( ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted ) , one per gonad , are built when the ova and sperm are ready . The eggs are generally fertilised externally . Some species shed them into the water , some lay them in a burrow or tube , and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings . Some <unk> ( deep sea ) species have internal fertilization , and some of these are viviparous , growing their embryos in the female 's body . 
 The zygote ( fertilised egg ) divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development , in which the fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division . The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles ( like the adult but smaller ) or to form planuliform larvae , in which the larva 's long axis is the same as the juvenile 's . The planuliform larva stage may be short @-@ lived and lecithotrophic ( " yolky " ) before becoming a juvenile , or may be <unk> , swimming for some time and eating prey larger than microscopic particles . However , many members of the order Heteronemertea and the <unk> family <unk> form a <unk> larva , which can capture unicellular algae and which <unk> describes as like a <unk> cap with the ear flaps pulled down . It has a gut which lies across the body , a mouth between the " ear flaps " , but no anus . A small number of <unk> discs form , encircling the archenteron ( developing gut ) and coalesce to form the juvenile . When it is fully formed , the juvenile bursts out of the larva body and usually eats it during this catastrophic metamorphosis . 
 The species <unk> peregrina has been reported as having a life span of around 18 months . 
 = = Ecological significance = = 
 Most nemerteans are marine animals that burrow in sediments , lurk in crevices between shells , stones or the holdfasts of algae or sessile animals . Some live deep in the open oceans , and have gelatinous bodies . Others build semi @-@ permanent burrows lined with mucus or produce cellophane @-@ like tubes . Mainly in the tropics and subtropics , about 12 species appear in freshwater , and about a dozen species live on land in cool , damp places , for example under rotting logs . 
 The terrestrial <unk> <unk> is a native of Australia but has been found in the British Isles , in Sao Miguel in the Azores , in Gran Canaria , and in a lava tube cave at <unk> on the Island of Hawaii . It can build a cocoon , which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported , and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous hermaphrodite . Another terrestrial genus , <unk> , is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles , widely across the Indo @-@ Pacific , in Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic , in Frankfurt , in the Canary Islands , in Madeira and in the Azores . 
 Most are carnivores , feeding on annelids , clams and crustaceans , and may kill annelids of about their own size . They sometimes take fish , both living and dead . Insects and myriapods are the only known prey of the two terrestrial species of <unk> . A few nemerteans are scavengers , and these generally have good distance chemoreception ( " smell " ) and are not selective about their prey . A few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs and feed on micro @-@ organisms filtered out by the host . 
 Near San Francisco the nemertean <unk> <unk> has consumed about 55 % of the total egg production of its host , the Dungeness crab Metacarcinus magister . C. <unk> is considered a significant factor in the collapse of the <unk> crab fishery . Other coastal nemerteans have devastated clam beds . 
 The few predators on nemerteans include bottom @-@ feeding fish , some sea birds , a few invertebrates including horseshoe crabs , and other nemerteans . Nemerteans ' skins secrete toxins that deter many predators , but some crabs may clean nemerteans with one claw before eating them . The American <unk> <unk> and the South African <unk> <unk> , both called " tapeworms " in their respective localities , are sold as fish bait .

 Class Anopla ( " unarmed " ) . Includes animals with proboscis without stylet , and a mouth underneath and behind the <unk> <unk> . Comprises 100 marine species . Their body wall has outer circular and inner length @-@ wise muscles . In addition , <unk> <unk> has circular and inner length @-@ wise muscles in the epidermis ; the extra muscle layers seem to be needed for burrowing by peristalsis . 
 Order Heteronemertea . Comprises about 400 species . The majority are marine , but three are freshwater . Their body @-@ wall muscles are disposed in four layers , alternately circular and length @-@ wise starting from the outermost layer . The order includes the strongest swimmers . Two genera have branched proboscises . 
 Class Enopla ( " armed " ) . All have stylets except order Bdellonemertea . Their mouth is located underneath and ahead of the brain . Their main nerve cords run inside body @-@ wall <unk> Bdellonemertea . Includes seven species , of which six live as commensals in the mantle of large clams and one in that of a freshwater snail . The hosts filter feed and all the hosts steal food from them . These nemerteans have short , wide bodies and have no stylets but have a sucking pharynx and a posterior <unk> , with which they move like inchworms . 
 Order Hoplonemertea . Comprises 650 species . They live in benthic and pelagic sea water , in freshwater and on land . They feed by commensalism and parasitism , and are armed with stylet ( s ) Suborder Monostilifera . Includes 500 species with a single central stylet . Some use the stylet for locomotion as well as for capturing prey . 
 Suborder Polystilifera . Includes about 100 pelagic and 50 benthic species . Their pads bear many tiny stylets . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 Although one might expect stylets to be fossilized since they are made of the mineral calcium phosphate , none have been found . As nemertea are otherwise completely soft @-@ bodied , one would expect fossils of them to be extremely rare . 
 The Middle Cambrian fossil <unk> from the Burgess Shale has been classed as a nemertean , based on a resemblance to some unusual deep @-@ sea swimming nemerteans , but few paleontologists accept this classification as the Burgess Shale fossils show no evidence of rhynchocoel nor intestinal caeca . 
 It has been suggested that <unk> , one of the Pennsylvanian @-@ age animals from Mazon Creek in northern and central Illinois , may be a nemertean . This fossil , however , only preserves the outline of the " worm " , and there is no evidence of a proboscis , so there is no certainty that it represents a nemertean . 
 = = = = Within Nemertea = = = = 
 There is no doubt that the phylum Nemertea is monophyletic ( meaning that the phylum includes all and only descendants of one ancestor that was also a member of the phylum ) . The synapomorphies ( trait shared by an ancestor and all its descendants , but not by other groups ) include the eversible proboscis located in the rhynchocoel . 
 While Ruppert , Fox and Barnes ( 2004 ) treat the <unk> as monophyletic , <unk> and <unk> ( 2003 ) regard them as paraphyletic and basal ( contains the ancestors of the more recent clades ) . The Anopla ( " unarmed " ) represent an evolutionary grade of nemerteans without stylets ( comprising the Heteronemertea and the <unk> ) , while Enopla ( " armed " ) are monophyletic , but find that <unk> is doubly paraphyletic , haven given rise to both the Heteronemertea and the Enopla . Ruppert , Fox and Barnes ( 2004 ) treat the Bdellonemertea as a clade separate from the Hoplonemertea , while <unk> and <unk> ( 2003 ) believe the Bdellonemertea are a part of the Monostilifera ( with one active stylet ) , which are within the Hoplonemertea – which implies that " Enopla " and " Hoplonemertea " are synonyms for the same branch of the tree . The Polystilifera ( with many tiny stylets ) are monophyletic . 
 = = = = Relationships with other phyla = = = = 
 English @-@ language writings have conventionally treated nemertean as " primitive " <unk> bilaterians that are most closely related to flatworms ( Platyhelminthes ) . These pre @-@ cladistics analyses emphasised as shared features : <unk> ( with multiple cilia per cell ) , glandular epidermis ; rod @-@ shaped secretory bodies or rhabdites ; frontal glands or organs ; protonephridia ; and <unk> body organization . However , <unk> epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in Ctenophora , Echiura , Sipuncula , Annelida , Mollusca and other taxa . The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale . The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure , and similar structures appear in small marine annelids and entoproct larvae . The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure , and in position – the flame cells of nemertea are usually in the walls of the fluid vessels and are served by " drains " from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin , while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body . Rigorous comparisons show no synapomorphies of nemertean and platyhelminth nephridia . 
 According to more recent analyses , in the development of nemertean embryos , ectomesoderm ( outer part of the mesoderm , which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built ) is derived from cells labelled 3a and 3b , and <unk> ( inner part of the mesoderm ) is derived from the 4d cell . Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids , echiurans and molluscs is derived from cells 3a and 3b , while the ectomesoderm of <unk> flatworms is derived from the 2b cell and <unk> flatworms produce no ectomesoderm . In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly primarily by well @-@ developed muscles embedded in <unk> connective tissue . This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as <unk> and <unk> , but a similar structure of body @-@ wall muscles embedded in <unk> connective tissue is widespread among the <unk> ( animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern ) such as sipunculans , echiurans and many annelids . 
 Nemerteans ' affinities with Annelida ( including Echiura , Pogonophora , <unk> and perhaps Sipuncula ) and Mollusca make the ribbon @-@ worms members of Lophotrochozoa , which include about half of the extant animal phyla . Lophotrochozoa groups : those animals that feed using a lophophore ( Brachiopoda , Bryozoa , Phoronida , Entoprocta ) ; phyla in which most members ' embryos develop into trochophore larvae ( for example Annelida and Mollusca ) ; and some other phyla ( such as Platyhelminthes , Sipuncula , Gastrotricha , Gnathostomulida , <unk> , Nemertea , Phoronida , Platyhelminthes and Rotifera ) . These groupings are based on molecular phylogeny , which compares sections of organisms DNA and RNA . While analyses by molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non @-@ members , the relationships between members are mostly unclear . 
 Most protostome phyla outside the Lophotrochozoa are members of Ecdysozoa ( " animals that molt " ) , which include Arthropoda , Nematoda and <unk> . Most other bilaterian phyla are in the <unk> , which include <unk> and Chordata . The Acoelomorpha , which are neither protostomes nor deuterostomes , are regarded as basal bilaterians . 
 = Haapsalu Castle = 
 Haapsalu Castle ( also Haapsalu Episcopal Castle , Estonian : Haapsalu <unk> ) is a castle with cathedral in Haapsalu , Estonia , founded in the thirteenth century as the seat of the Bishopric of Ösel @-@ Wiek . According to legend , during full moons in August , an image of a maiden , The White Lady , appears on the inner wall of the chapel . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1228 , the Archbishop of Riga , Albert of Riga formed a new diocese consisting of <unk> , Saaremaa and Hiiumaa and designated Gottfried , an abbot of <unk> Cistercian monastery , as the bishop . The bishopric was created as a state of the Holy Roman Empire on 1 October 1228 , by Henry , King of the Romans . Papal legate Wilhelm of Modena fixed these borders permanently in 1234 . The first residence of the Bishopric of Ösel @-@ Wiek was located in Lihula Castle , where with the help of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword , a stronghold was built of stone . In an attempt to avoid conflicts with the influential Order , the Bishop transferred the diocese 's residence to <unk> , where it was burned by Lithuanians ten years later . A new center for the diocese was chosen in Haapsalu , where an Episcopal stronghold and cathedral were started . Building of the castle went on for three centuries . 
 = = Castle = = 
 Construction , widening and reconstruction of the stronghold went on throughout several centuries , with the architecture changing according to the development of weapons . The stronghold achieved its final dimensions – area of more than 30 @,@ 000 square metres , thickness of the wall between 1 @.@ 2 and 1 @.@ 8 meters ( 3 @.@ 9 and 5 @.@ 9 ft ) , and maximum height over 10 metres ( 33 ft ) – under the reign of Bishop Johannes IV <unk> ( 1515 – 1527 ) . The western side of the castle houses a 29 @-@ metre ( 95 ft ) watchtower dating from the 13th century , later used as a bell tower . The walls were later raised to 15 metres ( 49 ft ) . 
 The inner trenches and <unk> , which were built for cannons and as a shelter from bombing , date back to the Livonian War ( 1558 – 1582 ) , but it was during this war that the stronghold was severely damaged . The walls of the small castle and the outer fortification were left partly destroyed . 
 In the 17th century , the castle was no longer used as a defensive building by the Swedes who now ruled the Swedish Estonian Province . In the course of the Great Northern War in 1710 , Estonia fell under Russian rule and the walls were partially demolished at the command of the Peter I of Russia , turning the castle in effect into ruins . 
 = = St. Nicolas Cathedral = = 
 The Cathedral of Haapsalu was a cathedral ( i.e. the main church ) of the Bishopric of Ösel @-@ Wiek , where the throne , the official chair of the Bishop , was situated and where the Chapter of the Bishopric worked . It is the biggest single @-@ naved church in the Baltic countries , with its 15 @.@ 5 @-@ metre ( 51 ft ) -high domical vaults and an area of 425 m2 ( 4 @,@ 575 sq ft ) . 
 The first written record of the church is the charter of Haapsalu where Bishop Hermann I , the founder of the town wrote : " ... we , the ones having established the cathedral in Haapsalu and having provided our canons with the appropriate dwellings and income , determined a certain site to be a town , where everybody who has chosen it as their place of living together with us , could gather and find shelter there ; and if needed would be able to defend the church with all the means at their disposal . " 
 Built in 1260 , the church belongs to the transition period from Romanesque to Gothic architecture . The first is characterized by the plant ornament of the capital of the pilasters and the second by thee star ( asteroid ) vaults . The portal was also originally Romanesque – the <unk> on the round arch had a niche with the figure of the patron saint . The inner walls were covered with paintings , the floor consisting of the gravestones of clergymen and distinguished noblemen . A unique round baptismal chapel was built in the second half of the 14th century . 
 During the Livonian War , Estonia became part of the Lutheran Swedish kingdom . The Catholic Dome Church became a church with a Lutheran congregation and was then called the Castle Church . In 1625 , the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf sold the town of Haapsalu , the castle and the nearby land property to Count Jacob De la Gardie , who planned to turn the dilapidated stronghold into a modern castle . Arent Passer , a well @-@ known sculptor and master builder , was invited as a consultant . 
 On March 23 , 1688 , the sheet @-@ copper roof of the church was destroyed in a fire , but the church was restored relatively quickly . The storm in 1726 destroyed the roof again . The decreased congregation could not afford the renovation and moved to the town church . In the 19th century , the reconstruction of the ruins into a romantic castle park was started . 
 In 1886 – 1889 , the church was renovated and rebuilt . The ruined Romanesque @-@ style portal was replaced by the pseudo @-@ Gothic " stepped portal " , the extant fragments of the wall paintings were covered over , and the tombstones were taken out of the church . On October 15 , 1889 the first service dedicated to Saint Nicholas was held . 
 The Soviet occupation in 1940 led to the closing of the church . During World War II , services were continued , but in the spring of 1944 hooligans broke into the church and destroyed the altar with the altarpiece , the organ , the chairs and the windows . In 1946 , the congregation asked the Soviet government to list the Cathedral as a protected historical monument , but it failed to raise their interest . The church was empty for years ; for some time it was used for storing grain , even plans for turning it into a swimming @-@ pool were made . 
 On Mother 's Day of 1992 , a Mother ’ s Altar to commemorate Estonian mothers killed during the Soviet occupation was consecrated . The statue of the Virgin and the Child was made by the sculptor Hille Palm .

 On full moon nights in August an image of a maiden , The White Lady , is said to appear on the inner wall of the chapel . 
 During the reign of Ösel @-@ Wiek Bishop , every canon was supposed to lead a chaste and virtuous life according to the rules of the monastery . Access of women to the Episcopal Castle was forbidden by threat of death . A legend tells that a canon fell in love with an Estonian girl and brought secretly the maiden into the castle . She hid by dressing as a choirboy and remained a secret for a long time , but when the bishop visited Haapsalu again , the young singer caught his attention and he ordered an investigation of the singer 's gender . 
 Upon finding the girl , the bishop summoned his council and it decided that the girl should be immured in the wall of the chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was starved to death . The builders left a cavity into the wall and the poor girl with a piece of bread and a mug of water was walled in . For some time her cries for help were heard . Yet her soul could not find the peace and , as a result , she appears on the Baptistery ’ s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries , and also to prove the immortality of love . 
 The White Lady Days music festival is held at the time of the August full moon . 
 = The Cottage ( video game ) = 
 The Cottage ( Swedish : <unk> ) is an adventure video game that was initially made available in 1978 for the mainframe computer Oden in Stockholm , and later published by Scandinavian PC Systems for IBM PCs in 1986 in Swedish , Danish , Norwegian and English . It was the first publicly available Swedish adventure game and one of the first commercial Swedish video games . 
 The game is set in a cottage in Småland ; the player explores the cottage and its surroundings by typing simple commands to indicate what they want to do or where they want to go . They aim to find items and perform certain actions to raise their score and rank , while avoiding traps and enemy characters , with the ultimate goal of getting inducted into the " cottage council " . 
 The game was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann , Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson , three children who had played the game Adventure and wanted to create a similar game in Swedish . The Cottage began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own , with the player moving through an amusement arcade to choose what to play ; as they found it more fun to move through the arcade than to play the games , they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games . Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold ; despite this , the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre @-@ paid royalties . The game had a cult @-@ like status among Oden users at the time , and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The Cottage is set in a surreal environment in the Småland province in Sweden , and begins on the pier of a lake , outside a cottage surrounded by a deep forest and waterfalls . The cottage is larger on the inside than the outside , and has nine underground levels . The player is able to move in four cardinal directions and perform actions by typing simple commands , such as " North " , " Left " and " Take ball " . Their aim is to explore the cottage and its surroundings to find and collect items . The inside of the cottage includes obstacles such as trapdoors the player can fall through and robbers who can steal the player 's valuables , while the cottage 's surroundings include " mysterious creatures " that the player can encounter . 
 At the start of the game , the player 's score is set to the value of 50 ; their goal is to increase it as much as possible , for the maximum score of 307 . This is done by performing certain actions , finding new areas , solving puzzles , and by finding and keeping treasures and valuable items . In exchange for some of their score , the player can receive hints or get resurrected following an in @-@ game death . The player is ranked in accordance with their score : they start as a " clumsy rookie " ( " <unk> <unk> " ) , and eventually become an " expert on Småland houses " ( " expert på hus i Småland " ) . If the player finishes the game , they get inducted into the cottage council ( " <unk> " ) . 
 = = Development = = 
 The Cottage was originally developed in 1977 – 1978 by three children : brothers Viggo Kann ( then Eriksson ) and Kimmo Eriksson , and their friend Olle Johansson , who at the time of the project 's start were ten , twelve and fourteen years old , respectively . As Viggo and Kimmo 's parents worked at Stockholms <unk> ( " Stockholm 's Computer Center " , QZ ) and the Royal Institute of Technology ( KTH ) , and Johansson 's father worked at an office that was a client for QZ , they had access to QZ 's mainframe computer Oden . Using Oden and the book What to Do After You Hit Return ( 1975 ) , the Eriksson brothers and Johansson learned programming . 
 With the help from system developers at QZ , the three set up their game – at the time just titled <unk> ( " Cottage " ) – on Oden in 1978 , and created the message board <unk> <unk> ( " Thorvald 's cottage council " ) for it ; scientists working at QZ played the game , and were able to discuss it on the message board . The Eriksson brothers and Johansson used a single Texas Silent Writer computer terminal in the <unk> ' parents ' bedroom to program the game , through which they could log in to Oden . Connecting to Oden was expensive , so they sometimes visited KTH during the evening to work on the game , as Oden only cost money to use during the day . At KTH , they had access to one terminal each , which used actual monitors to display text , as opposed to their writer terminal at home which printed the text on " enormous amounts of paper " . 
 All three had previously programmed their own video games : Johansson had made a Mastermind game featuring an opponent character named Thorvald ; Kimmo had made a slot machine game and a tic @-@ tac @-@ toe game ; and Kann had made a guessing game similar to hangman . They thought about how they wanted to combine their games into one single amusement arcade @-@ themed game , where the player could pick which of the games they wanted to play , but due to difficulties in unifying the three developers ' different programming methods , the game 's code became " messy " ; Kann eventually decided to make a " final push " and managed to finish and unify the program . 
 When they had finished programming and connecting the arcade , they realized that it was more fun to walk around in the arcade than to actually play the games . They ended up creating more and more rooms in the arcade , with characters to play games with , but as the arcade area and its surroundings grew , they eventually decided to remove the arcade games . Instead , they added new elements , including " shady characters " , animals and items ; the elements that remained were the slot machine and the character Thorvald . Having played Adventure ( 1976 ) on Oden and finding its cave exploration exciting , they wondered if they would be able to create a similar game in Swedish . As they worked on the game , they grew into different roles : Kimmo mostly came up with " wacky ideas " , Johansson was a driven visionary who " made things happen " , and Kann fixed things and made sure that everything worked . According to Kimmo and Johansson , they cared about the game 's content , not just the technical aspects , and made a game that they found fun themselves . They created two reoccurring characters based on themselves , who appear throughout the game : Kimmo , based on the real Kimmo , and the " cottage council chairman " Thorvald , who represents Johansson . As Kann was interested in language , and had specific ideas of how to spell certain words , they used consistently correct grammar , while consistently using non @-@ standard spelling for words such as " sig " ( " oneself " ) and " dem " ( " them " ) , rendering them as " <unk> " and " dom " . 
 The Eriksson brothers and Johansson used the programming language BASIC to create the game , which Kimmo called noteworthy : it was considered impossible to write big programs in BASIC , and The Cottage was " gigantic " . The reason for their choice in programming language was that it was the only one all three knew beforehand ; Kimmo said that they would no longer have chosen BASIC if they had programmed The Cottage in 1986 , as they had access to many more programming languages by that time . According to Johansson , another reason was " pure defiance " towards the Eriksson brothers ' father , who had told them they would never be able to get the game running if they programmed it in BASIC . According to Johansson , the most challenging aspect of the development was getting the game to understand the Swedish language ; to keep the size of the game 's command interpreter " reasonable " , they decided to limit it to two @-@ word commands only . Acknowledging that different people use different words for things , they play @-@ tested it with friends and family , writing down all attempted commands and deciding what the game should be expected to understand . During a short period of the game 's development , the developers also logged all actions players at QZ had taken that the command interpreter had not understood ; based on this data , they improved the interpreter and changed the outcomes to certain actions . At one point , the Eriksson brothers and Johansson took a two @-@ year break from the game , but eventually returned to it and finished it in 1979 . 
 = = = Home release = = = 
 The Eriksson brothers and Johansson did not work much more on the game until 1984 , when the journalist Erik <unk> conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg 's magazine Upp & Ner , which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985 . In the article , <unk> asked Johansson why they had not made the game commercially available for home computers ; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them , and that they would have to find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version . 
 The business software publisher Scandinavian PC Systems found out about the game through Upp & Ner ; they were expanding at the time and wanted to add a video game to their catalogue , so they contacted the game 's developers . The Eriksson brothers and Johansson developed a version for home computers , but had problems with compiling it for the PC , as it was a much larger BASIC program than most compilers could handle . Due to copyright issues , a scene in the mainframe version of the game where the player guest stars in The Muppet Show had to be cut for the commercial release , but all other materials remained intact ; additionally , some visuals and audio were created and added for this release . The game was published by Scandinavian PC Systems for IBM PCs in Swedish , Danish , Norwegian and English in 1986 . The developers negotiated with Scandinavian PC Systems , and were given 5 SEK per sold copy of the Swedish version and 2 SEK per sold foreign copy as royalties ; 30 @,@ 000 SEK of the royalties were pre @-@ paid . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The Cottage was the first publicly available Swedish adventure video game , as well as one of the first commercially available Swedish video games . Through the late 1970s and early 1980s , the game had a cult @-@ like status among people with access to Oden . As people had to pay for the time they spent using Oden , the game was commercially important to QZ , leading to all three developers getting free Oden accounts . Almost all IBM PCs in Sweden following the game 's release for that platform had a copy of The Cottage , and several thousand copies of it were sold ; Kann reasoned that the success came because the IBM PC was still new , and that almost no computer programs were available in Swedish at the time . Despite this , the developers did not receive a lot of money outside of the pre @-@ paid royalties ; according to Johansson , they only got 500 SEK " every once in a while " . 
 In his book Video Games Around the World , author Mark J.P. Wolf called the game an " impressive achievement " considering the developers ' young age . Sigrid <unk> at Jönköpings @-@ Posten noted the game 's absence from the 2013 video game exhibit at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology as odd considering its popularity and cult status . An eight week long video game development camp , named <unk> after The Cottage 's Swedish title , was held in Sweden in 2015 , with a follow @-@ up planned for 2016 .

 " Perfection " began as an instrumental track by the Soul Seekerz that samples " Turn The Beat Around ( Love to Hear <unk> ) " , which was originally performed by disco singer Vicki Sue Robinson . Simon Langford decided to sample the song after watching the end credits for the film The Specialist . Langford excited by his song idea phoned his writing partner Julian Napolitano . Two days later , Napolitano had completed close to seventy percent of the song , much to the surprise of Langford , who had been preoccupied with paper work . After completing the instrumental track , the group were approached by All Around the World Records , who wanted to use the track for a song by Minogue . Minogue , Rob Davis and Therese Grankvist then wrote lyrics to accompany the music composed by the Soul Seekerz . 
 In a review for Allmusic , John Lucas called the song a " painfully generic attempt at recapturing former glories " and " beneath someone of Minogue 's calibre " . He also criticized Minogue 's vocals , calling them " uninspired " .

 = Panchakanya = 
 Panchakanya ( <unk> ् <unk> ् <unk> , <unk> ) is a group of five iconic heroines of Hindu epics , extolled in a hymn and whose names are believed to dispel sin when recited . They are Ahalya , Draupadi , Sita or Kunti , Tara and Mandodari . Ahalya , Tara , Mandodari and Sita are from the epic Ramayana ; while Draupadi and Kunti are from the Mahabharata . 
 The panchakanya are venerated as ideal women and chaste wives in one view . Their association with more than one man and breaking of traditions in some cases are prescribed as not to be followed by others . 
 = = Hymn = = 
 The well @-@ known Sanskrit hymn that defines the <unk> runs : 
 A variant replaces Sita with Kunti : 
 Differences are underlined . 
 Practicing Hindus , especially Hindu wives , remember the Panchakanya in this daily morning prayer . Their names are extolled and the prayer is <unk> <unk> , prescribed to be recited in the early hours of the morning . 
 The panchakanya literally means five kanyas . Kanya may be translated as girl , daughter , maiden or virgin . Though all being married , the choice of the word kanya , not nari ( woman ) or sati ( chaste wife ) , seems interesting to Mr Pradip Bhattacharya . 
 = = From the Ramayana = = 
 The kanyas , Ahalya , Tara and Mandodari appear in the Hindu epic Ramayana . Sita , its heroine , is sometimes included in the panchakanya list . 
 = = = Ahalya = = = 
 Ahalya , also known as Ahilya , is the wife of the sage Gautama . Ahalya is often regarded as the leader of the <unk> due to the " nobility of her character , her extraordinary beauty and the fact of her being chronologically the first kanya " . Ahalya is often described to be created by the god Brahma as the most beautiful woman in the entire universe , but also sometimes as an earthy princess of the Lunar Dynasty . Ahalya was placed in the care of Gautama , until she gained puberty and was finally married to the elderly sage . The king of the gods , Indra , was infatuated with her beauty and comes disguised as Gautama , when the sage was away , and requests or orders sexual intercourse . In the Ramayana ( the earliest full narrative of the tale ) , Ahalya falls prey to Indra 's trickery and does not recognize him or is raped . In all narratives , Ahalya and her lover ( or rapist ) Indra are cursed by Gautama . Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible to the world and how she is purified by offering Rama - an avatar of the god Vishnu and hero of the Ramayana - hospitality , in the popular retelling developed over time , Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama 's foot . Some versions also mention that she was turned into a dry stream and that she would be condoned of her guilt when eventually the stream starts flowing and joins the river Gautami ( Godavari ) . Indra was cursed to be castrated or be covered by a thousand vulvae that ultimately turn into a thousand eyes . 
 = = = Tara = = = 
 Tara is the Queen of Kishkindha and wife of the monkey ( vanara ) King Vali . After being widowed , she becomes the Queen of Sugriva , Vali 's brother . Tara is described as the daughter of the monkey physician Sushena in the Ramayana , and in later sources , as an apsara ( celestial nymph ) who rises from the churning of the milky ocean . She marries Vali and bears him a son named Angada . After Vali is presumed dead in a battle with a demon , his brother Sugriva becomes king and appropriates Tara ; however , Vali returns and regains Tara and exiles his brother , accusing him of treachery and also appropriates Sugriva 's wife Ruma . When Sugriva challenges Vali to a duel , Tara wisely advises Vali not to accept because of the former 's alliance with Rama , but Vali does not heed her , and deceptively dies from Rama 's arrow , shot at the behest of Sugriva . In his dying breath , Vali reconciles with Sugriva and instructs him to follow Tara 's wise counsel in all matters . Tara 's lamentation forms an important part in most versions of the tale . While in most vernacular versions , Tara casts a curse on Rama by the power of her chastity , in some versions , Rama enlightens Tara . Sugriva returns to the throne , but spends his time carousing often with now his current chief queen Tara and fails to act on his promise to assist Rama in recovering his kidnapped wife , Sita . Tara — now Sugriva 's queen and chief diplomat — is then instrumental in tactfully reconciling Rama with Sugriva after pacifying Lakshmana , Rama 's brother , who was about to destroy Kishkinda in retribution for Sugriva 's perceived treachery . 
 = = = Mandodari = = = 
 Mandodari is the queen consort of Ravana , the Rakshasa ( demon ) king of Lanka . The Hindu epics describe her as beautiful , pious , and righteous . Mandodari is the daughter of Mayasura , the King of the Asuras ( demons ) , and the apsara ( celestial nymph ) Hema . Some tales narrate how an apsara called Madhura was cursed to become a frog and imprisoned in a well for 12 years , after which regains her beauty or a frog , blessed to a beautiful maiden ; in both cases , she is adopted by Mayasura as his daughter Mandodari . Ravana comes to the house of Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari and then marries her . Mandodari bears him three sons : Meghanada ( Indrajit ) , Atikaya , and Akshayakumara . According to some Ramayana adaptations , Mandodari is also the mother of Rama 's wife Sita , who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana . Despite her husband 's faults , Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness . Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama , but her advice falls on deaf ears . Her love and loyalty to Ravana are praised in the Ramayana . Different versions of the Ramayana record her ill @-@ treatment at the hands of Rama 's monkey generals . Some versions say they humiliate her , while disturbing a sacrifice by Ravana , while others narrate how they destroy her chastity , which protects Ravana 's life . Hanuman tricks her into disclosing the location of a magical arrow which Rama uses to kill Ravana . After Ravana 's death , Vibhishana — Ravana 's younger brother who joins forces with Rama and is responsible for Ravana 's death — marries Mandodari on the advice of Rama . In some versions , Mandodari curses Sita that Rama would abandon her . 
 = = = Sita = = = 
 Sita is the heroine of the Ramayana and the consort of the Hindu god Rama ( avatar of Vishnu ) and is an avatar of Lakshmi , goddess of wealth and wife of Vishnu . She is esteemed as a standard @-@ setter for wifely and womanly virtues for all Hindu women . Sita is the adopted daughter of Janaka , king of Videha , found while he was furrowing the earth . The prince of Ayodhya , Rama wins Sita in her <unk> . Years later , when Rama is sentenced to a fourteen @-@ year exile , Sita joins Rama and his brother Lakshmana in exile , despite Rama 's wish for her to remain in Ayodhya . While in exile in Dandaka forest , she falls prey to Ravana 's scheme and sends Rama away in quest of a golden deer , while she is kidnapped by Ravana . Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka , until she is rescued by Rama , who slays Ravana in war . Sita proves her chastity by undergoing a trial by fire . Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya , where Rama is <unk> as king . When a washerman casts doubts about her chastity , Rama abandons a pregnant Sita in the forest . Sita gives birth to twins Lava and Kusha in the hermitage of sage Valmiki , who protects her . Her sons grow and reunite with Rama and again Sita is asked to prove her chastity before Rama can take her back . However , Sita chooses to return to the womb of her mother , Earth . 
 = = From the Mahabharata = = 
 The Hindu epic Mahabharata features the kanya Draupadi and Kunti , sometimes included in the panchakanya . 
 = = = Draupadi = = = 
 Draupadi is the heroine of the Mahabharata . She is the common wife of the five Pandava brothers and queen of Hastinapur , in their reign . Born from a fire @-@ sacrifice of king of Panchala - Drupada , Draupadi was prophesied to lead to the end of Drona and the Kauravas . Though the middle Pandava Arjuna - disguised as a brahmin - wins her in her swayamvara , Draupadi is compelled to marry all the five brothers on command of her mother @-@ in @-@ law Kunti . The <unk> agree to the plan that <unk> will always be the chief consort of all brothers and always the empress . She will be in personal union with one brother every year and may bear him a child . Anyone of the other 4 , who interrupts them during a private time within that one year , must go on a 11 @-@ month <unk> . She insults the Kaurava general Karna in the swayamvara and laughs at Duryodhana - the leader of the Kauravas - when he falls in her Pandava palace at Indraprastha . She mothers five sons from each of the Pandavas , regaining her virginity after every year . The Kauravas take their revenge when the eldest Pandava Yudhishthira loses her to Kauravas in a game of dice . The Kaurava Dushasana tries to disrobe her in the royal court , however divine intervention saves her dignity by making her wrapped cloth infinite in length . Draupadi pledges to keep her hair untied till they were drenched by Dushasana 's blood and mocks her husbands and all present in the court . The Pandavas and Draupadi finally accept 13 @-@ year exile for losing the game . While in exile in the forest , her second husband Bhima rescued her from various demons and <unk> , who abducted her . She also instructed Krishna 's queen Satyabhama on the duties of a wife . In the 13th year of exile , Draupadi and her husbands spent life incognito in Virata 's court . She served as the maid of the queen and is harassed by the queen 's brother Kichaka , who she desires to be killed by Bhima . After life in exile , a war breaks between the Kauravas and Pandavas , in which the Kauravas are slain and her insult avenged , but Draupadi also loses her father , brothers and sons . Yudhishthira became the emperor of Hastinapur with Draupadi as the chief consort . At the end of their lives , Draupadi and her husbands set off to the Himalayas to walk to heaven ; but Draupadi falls in the middle , as she loved Arjuna more than her other husbands . She is venerated as a village goddess and described at times an avatar of the fierce goddess Kali or the goddess of wealth , Lakshmi . 
 = = = Kunti = = = 
 Kunti is the queen of Pandu , the king of Hastinapur and mother of the three eldest Pandavas . Kunti was daughter of the Yadava king <unk> and was adopted by the childless <unk> , king of Kunti Kingdom . By her service , she propitiated the sage Durvasa , who granted her a mantra by which she could summon a god and have a child by him . She recklessly tests the boon and invites the Sun @-@ god Surya , who grants a son named Karna , whom she abandons . In due course of time , Kunti chooses Pandu in her swayamvara . Pandu abdicates after being cursed by a sage that union with a woman will result in his death . At Pandu 's behest , Kunti uses Durvasa 's boon to mother Yudhishthira , from the god Dharma , then Bhima from the god Vayu , and thirdly Arjuna , from the god Indra . Her co @-@ wife Madri bears the twins <unk> and <unk> , from the <unk> . After the death of Pandu , Madri being cause of Pandu 's death commits sati on same pyre while Kunti returns to Hastinapur and takes care of the five Pandavas . Kunti befriends Vidura , the stepbrother of Pandu and the advisor of the king . When Kauravas , the princes of Hastinapur and the cousins of the Pandavas , try to kill Kunti and her sons , however they escape . She prevents Bhima from killing the demoness <unk> and advices him to marry her and beget a son , Ghatotkacha . She instructs her children to take care of the common people and orders Bhima to kill the demon <unk> . When Arjuna wins Draupadi , Kunti instructs the brothers to share the prize . Kunti and the Pandavas return to Hastinapur . When Pandavas are sent to 12 @-@ year exile when defeated in a game of dice by the Kauravas , Kunti stays in Vidura 's refuge . When an epic war between the Pandavas and <unk> is to ensue , Kunti reveals to Karna - now a Kaurava general - about being his mother and gets him to promise her that he will not kill any other Pandava , except Arjuna . After the war , in which the Kauravas and Karna were killed , Kunti with the parents of the Kauravas left for the forest and spent rest of her life in prayer . She was killed in a forest fire and attained heaven . 
 = = Common features = = 
 All kanyas lack mothers in their life . Ahalya , Tara , Mandodari , Sita and Draupadi have supernatural births , while Kunti is adopted at birth and separated from a mother . Though all of the kanyas are described as mothers , except Kunti , no kanya 's motherhood is emphasized in their tales . Another common element is the theme of loss in their legends . Ahalya is cursed and abandoned by her family . Tara loses her husband , Draupadi her sons and Mandodari her husband , sons and kin in war . Each of them suffers a tragedy and used by men , but battles on with life and society . They are considered by Mr Pradip Bhattacharya as victims of patriarchal myth @-@ making , however orthodox Hindus usually oppose such theoretical speculation and consider such speculation distorting the message . A free @-@ spirited Ahalya is punished for her adultery . <unk> , who challenges and mocks even her husbands , has her dignity repeatedly violated by men . 
 The Mahari dance tradition equates the panchakanya with the five elements . Ahalya , Draupadi , Kunti , Tara and Mandodari represent water , fire , earth , wind and ether respectively . In similar analogy , writer <unk> Patil associates Ahalya , Draupadi , Sita , Tara and Mandodari with wind , fire , earth , ether and water respectively . 
 = = Assessment and remembrance = = 
 Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore wrote a collection of poems titled " Pancha Kanya " with themes of episodes from mythology of the panchakanya . The tales of the panchakanya remain popular motifs in the Mahari dance tradition of Odisha . 
 The panchakanya are regarded by one view as ideal women . George M. Williams remarks , " They are not perfect but they fulfil their dharma ( duty ) as mothers , sisters , wives and occasionally leaders in their own right . " Another view considers them exemplary chaste women or <unk> ( " great chaste women " ) as per the Mahari dance tradition , and worthy as an ideal for " displaying some outstanding quality " . 
 Another view does not regard the panchakanya as ideal women who should be emulated . Bhattacharya , author of Panch @-@ Kanya : The Five Virgins of Indian Epics contrasts the panchakanya with the five satis enlisted in another traditional prayer : Sati , Sita , Savitri , Damayanti and Arundhati . He rhetorically asks , " Are then Ahalya , Draupadi , Kunti , Tara , and Mandodari not chaste wives because each has ' known ' a man , or more than one , other than her husband ? " 
 Women who suffered most in their lives and who had followed the dictate and regulations prescribed in the scriptures for women were considered . They , as prescribed in the Manu <unk> , the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics , were considered as the Five ideal Woman , all married . 
 = <unk> hunger = 
 <unk> hunger or hedonic hyperphagia is " the drive to eat to obtain pleasure in the absence of an energy deficit . " Particular foods may have a high " hedonic rating " or individuals may have increased susceptibility to environmental food cues . Weight loss programs may aim to control or to compensate for hedonic hunger . Therapeutic interventions may influence hedonic eating behavior . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although hunger may arise from energy or nutrient deficits , as would be expected in the set @-@ point theories of hunger and eating , hunger may arise more commonly from anticipated pleasure of eating , consistent with the positive @-@ incentive perspective . <unk> distinguished the overeating responses to these stimuli as homeostatic hyperphagia and hedonic hyperphagia respectively . Accordingly , hunger and eating are subject to feedback control from homeostatic , hedonic , and cognitive processes . Although these mechanisms interplay and overlap to some extent , they can nonetheless be individually separated . Thus , the positive @-@ incentive perspective suggests that eating is similar to sexual behavior : humans engage in sexual behavior , not because of an internal deficit , but because they have evolved in a way that makes them crave it . High calorie foods have had intrinsic reward value throughout evolution . The presence of desirable ( or " hedonic " ) food , or the mere anticipation of it , makes one hungry . The psychological effects of hedonic hunger may be the appetitive equivalent of <unk> @-@ driven activities such as recreational drug use and compulsive gambling . Susceptibility to food cues can lead to overeating in a society of readily available calorie dense , inexpensive foods . Such hedonistic eating overrides the body 's ability to regulate consumption with satiety . 
 A related phenomenon , specific appetite , also known as specific hunger , is conceptually related to , but distinct from , hedonic hunger . Specific appetite is a drive to eat foods with specific flavors or other characteristics : in usage , specific appetite has put greater emphasis on an individual who <unk> learns a particular appetite behavior rather than an evolutionarily innate , hedonic appetite preference . 
 hedonic <unk> preference may lead to increased weight gain due to eating when not hungry . 
 = = Food variability = = 
 A " hedonic rating " of foods reflects those which are more likely to be eaten even though the individual is not hungry . For example , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanning suggests that fed rats show a high preference for a mixture of fat and carbohydrate in the form of potato chips compared to their standard chow or single macronutrient foods . When binge eating occurs without the presence of energy deprivation , it is thought to be due to frequent exposure to palatable food . Another study evaluated how hedonic ratings of individual foods aggregate into the food components of particular types of meals , and related preferences to overall dietary intake . 
 = = Interpersonal variability = = 
 Individuals may have increased hedonic hunger susceptibility to environmental food cues . Genetic variability may influence hedonic hyperphagia . Variation in hedonic hunger levels from person to person may be key in determining success in weight loss tactics and a person 's ability to cope with tempting foods that are readily available . To assess this , a Power of Food Scale ( PFS ) has been developed that quantifies a person 's appetitive anticipation ( not consumption ) . Binge @-@ eaters , obese individuals and those with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa scored higher than restrictive type and normal weight college students . A decrease in PFS score leads to better success in weight loss . 
 = = Food reinforcement = = 
 The reinforcing value of food refers to how hard someone is willing to work to obtain food . Food reinforcement is influenced by several factors including food palatability , food deprivation , and food variety . It is also motivated by concerns about fullness ( expected satiation ) and the hunger that might be experienced in the intervening period between meals ( expected satiety ) . The effector mechanisms of food reinforcement depend on dopaminergic activity in the brain . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Conceptually , weight loss programs might target control of hedonic hunger . Specific research to determine what diet techniques would be most beneficial for those with an increased hedonic hunger would help people modify their immediate availability of food or its palatability . For example , whole grain popcorn may be a better choice than potato chips due to a lower calorie load and an increased sense of satiety . Adding dietary fiber to foods and beverages increases satiety and reduces energy intake at the next meal . Low @-@ energy @-@ density foods with high <unk> power may be useful tools for weight management . <unk> has been found to be greater with yogurt beverages than fruit juice , and was equal with low @-@ energy @-@ density yogurt with <unk> and high @-@ energy @-@ density yogurt . People with high PFS scores may do better with meal replacement products . 
 Medications may affect hedonic eating behavior . <unk> @-@ like peptide @-@ 1 ( <unk> ) agonists , such as exenatide and <unk> which are used for diabetes , may help suppress food reward behavior . Inhibition of dopamine transport within the brain increases dopamine concentrations , which can reduce energy intake . Despite theoretical underpinnings , opiate antagonists as single agents have generally not shown substantial clinical benefit . However , preliminary data has suggested synergistic effects with concurrent targeted therapy of opiate receptors and either dopamine or cannabinoid receptors . 
 Bariatric surgery of various types may influence hedonic hunger particularly if accompanied by counseling interventions that reduce automatic hedonic impulses . These surgeries may work in part by modifying the production of gastrointestinal hormones , particularly by increasing glucagon @-@ like peptide @-@ 1 and peptide <unk> ( <unk> ) ; reduction of ghrelin has been inconsistent .

 Helen C. White ( November 26 , 1896 – June 7 , 1967 ) was a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin – Madison . White twice served as the English department chair and was the first woman to become a full professor in the university 's College of Letters and Science . She was also the first woman elected president of the American Association of University Professors , and a president of the American Association of University Women ( AAUW ) , University of Wisconsin Teachers ' Union , and University Club . White wrote six novels and numerous nonfiction books and articles . 
 White was raised in Boston in a Roman Catholic household , and kept the faith for the rest of her life . She graduated from the Girls ' High School and Radcliffe College . After completing her master 's degree , she taught at Smith College for two years before moving West to study for her doctorate in Madison . White loved the city and became an assistant professor there upon completing her Ph.D. in 1924 with a dissertation on William Blake . She taught courses including freshman English and metaphysical poetry graduate seminars . White 's students included writers such as August Derleth , Herbert <unk> , and Mark Schorer . Graduate students called her " the Purple Goddess " partly due to her predominantly purple wardrobe and exceptional height . 
 In her 48 @-@ year career , White received 23 honorary doctorates , a Laetare Medal , a Siena Medal , an AAUW achievement award , and two Guggenheim Fellowships . She became an Honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1958 for her scholarship . White was a United States delegate at two UNESCO events and was on the boards of several organizations . Upon her death , the university built Helen C. White Hall in her name . The building houses the university 's English department and undergraduate library , which contains 4 @,@ 000 books from White 's collection .

 Helen Constance White was born November 26 , 1896 , in New Haven , Connecticut . Her parents , Mary ( née King ) and John White , had three other children ( one female , two male ) and ran a Roman Catholic household , a faith White maintained passionately for the rest of her life . In 1901 , her parents chose to settle in the new Boston suburb Roslindale for the city 's cultural opportunities . White 's father left his job as a New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad clerk to become a civil servant . White described her mother as matriarchal and her father as secretive . 
 Beginning in 1909 , White attended the Boston Girls ' High School , where she was studious and performed well in school . She participated in the Debating Club and became the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of her school paper , Distaff , in her senior year . She graduated in 1913 and received a Margaret A. Badger Scholarship and an Old South Historical Society prize . During this time , she was a member of the Massachusetts suffrage movement . 
 White started at Radcliffe College later that year and graduated summa cum laude in three years with a bachelor 's degree in English . White was awarded a Phi Beta Kappa key and the George B. <unk> bachelor 's thesis prize at her 1916 graduation . She continued at Radcliffe and completed her master 's degree in 1917 , whereupon she sought teaching posts . In September , White became an Assistant in Smith College 's English department , where she taught English for two years . Her friends suggested that she pursue her doctoral study " out West " in Madison , Wisconsin — a proposition White accepted . 
 = = Madison = = 
 White arrived for the 1919 fall semester . She was not familiar with Wisconsin , but quickly came to love Madison and its university , particularly for its people 's open spirit and school pride . Her new apartment would become her longtime home . White worked as an Instructor in the English department and university library while she worked on her doctorate . As a graduate student , she held office hours on Saturday mornings for anyone interested in her tutoring , often at the expense of her own work . White graduated in 1924 and became an assistant professor the next year . By 1936 , she had become a full professor , the first woman to do so in Letters and Science at the university . 
 She taught several classes , including freshman English , 17th century English literature , metaphysical poetry , and a graduate course in John Donne , George Herbert , Andrew Marvell , Richard <unk> , and Henry Vaughan . Margaret Thoma of <unk> described White 's English 5 writing seminar as " now famous " in 1942 . White taught two classes when the Wisconsin Writers ' Institute opened in 1945 . White 's classes emphasized unambiguous writing and constructive , honest feedback . She was known to amiably reply to all of her mail . White used a four desk system in her apartment , where each desk served a specific function : personal letters , low @-@ priority book notes , high @-@ priority work , or typing . Some of her most notable students , such as August Derleth , Herbert <unk> , and Mark Schorer , continued to rely on White 's editorial opinion after their own careers were established . Mark Schorer wrote that White 's " patience " , " tact " , " humor " , and " sympathy " were the <unk> of her successful style . White considered teaching " not only stimulating but ... the most worthwhile thing a person can do . " 
 White had little time to write due to her other academic obligations , and once said , " belonging to things is an occupational disease of my profession " . White became the English department chair in 1955 and once again in 1961 . As chair , White recruited faculty members from established universities , fought for the recognition of her staff , and worked with the faculty members individually , as she would with her students . She wrote in the summers , often while she traveled . Aided by Guggenheim Fellowships , White visited most of Europe . On her first fellowship , she traveled in Italy and studied at Oxford University and the British Museum between 1928 and 1929 for a year . While abroad , White wrote English Devotional Literature , 1600 – 1640 and was inspired to start her first novel , A Watch in the Night . In mid @-@ 1930 , she received her second fellowship to verify her work in England . She received a grant from the university to finish her 1935 The Metaphysical Poets in London . White was a visiting scholar at the California Huntington Library between 1939 and 1940 , where she worked on Social Criticism in Popular Religious Literature of the Sixteenth Century . She returned to the library in mid @-@ 1941 . White was a visiting professor at Barnard College between 1943 and 1944 , and a visiting professor at Columbia University during the summer of 1948 . She also had a strong interest in poetry , though she didn 't think highly of her own . 
 White developed a reputation for frequently wearing purple clothes , a choice made for convenience . White referred to herself as " the large woman in purple " , and the English department grad students called her " the Purple Goddess " . Toni <unk> wrote that the " Goddess " appellation was partly due to her exceptional height : over six feet . 
 White retired in 1965 after 48 years of teaching and administration . In her retirement , White was appointed to the university 's Institute for Research in the Humanities . She suffered a heart attack in 1966 , whereupon her health declined , though she continued to work at the university 's Memorial Library . In the next spring , White became sick and died on June 7 , 1967 . Neither she nor her three siblings had married . A memorial service was held in Madison 's St. Paul 's University Chapel on May 19 , 1968 .

 White published her first short story when she was 13 . Her first major project was The Mysticism of William Blake , a modified version of her dissertation . It was published in 1927 by the University of Wisconsin Press . She later wrote six novels , including A Watch in the Night ( 1933 ) , Not Built with Hands , To the End of the World , and Dust on a King 's Highway . The Wisconsin State Journal wrote that her novels were highly praised for their historical settings , views towards religion , and contemplative psychology . White also authored Tudor Books of Private Devotion , English Devotional Literature , 1600 – 1640 , Victorian Prose , The Metaphysical Poets ( 1935 ) , Social Criticism in Popular Religious Literature of the Sixteenth Century , and numerous articles . Her religious works stemmed from her Roman Catholic reverence . White described her publishers as kind for publishing her unpopular scholarly works in @-@ between her profitable novels . 
 White was the first female elected president of the American Association of University Professors and thrice served as president of the American Association of University Women ( AAUW ) , including from 1941 to 1947 . White received an AAUW achievement award in 1949 for her scholarly work and international service in the humanities . She also served as the vice president of the International Federation of University Women , president of the University of Wisconsin Teachers ' Union , and the first woman president of the University Club . White was awarded two Guggenheim Fellowships , the 1942 Laetare Medal , the 1944 Siena Medal , the 1947 Radcliffe Alumni Association 's Distinguished Achievement Award for Education , and 23 honorary degrees from places such as Miami University , Mount Mary College , Mount Saint Scholastica College , Rockford College , Smith College , and Wilson College . She became an Honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1958 for her renown as a scholar of 16th and 17th century English literature . In 1959 she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . White was on the United States National commission for UNESCO and represented the United States twice at UNESCO meetings : the 1946 Preparatory Commission for UNESCO and the 1947 second UNESCO General Conference held in Mexico City . White was also on the 1946 U.S. Education Mission to Germany . Additionally , she sat on the boards of the National Conference of Christians and Jews , the American Council on Education , and the Phi Beta Kappa Senate , and was appointed by the U.S. President to the Fulbright Board of Foreign Scholarships . 
 Upon her death , the University of Wisconsin named a new building after her . It houses the undergraduate library , known as College Library . Helen C. White Hall sits on the edge of campus near Lake Mendota and is seven stories tall . The English department moved from Bascom Hall to the new building when it opened in September 1971 . The library holds White 's donation of over 4 @,@ 000 books . The building also houses the philosophy department , library school , and Cooperative Children 's Book Center . Hazel McGrath wrote that " no more fitting monument to one of its most eminent scholars could have been built by the University of Wisconsin " . 
 = Hurricane Carol ( 1953 ) = 
 Hurricane Carol in 1953 was the strongest storm of the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season and the first Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the 1938 New England hurricane . Carol developed on August 28 off the west coast of Africa , although the Weather Bureau did not initiate advisories until five days later . On September 2 , Carol attained hurricane status , based on a ship report . It moved northwestward , attaining peak winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) , based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters . After weakening , it brushed Bermuda and turned northeastward near New England , passing west of Nova Scotia before making landfall near Saint John , New Brunswick on September 7 . While crossing Atlantic Canada , Carol became an extratropical cyclone , which dissipated on September 9 southwest of Greenland . 
 When Carol initially threatened to strike Bermuda , several planes were evacuated from the island . Later , the hurricane produced high waves along the New England coastline which , in combination with foggy conditions , caused several boating accidents . At least 40 people required rescue , and four people were killed . Although winds in the region were minor , fishing damage totaled about $ 1 million ( 1953 USD , $ 8 @.@ 84 million 2016 USD ) . In Nova Scotia , hurricane @-@ force wind gusts downed trees and power lines , as well as heavy damage to the apple crop totaling $ 1 million ( 1950 CAD , $ 9 @.@ 15 million 2016 USD ) . High waves washed several boats ashore , and also killed one person . Ferry travel was halted across Atlantic Canada , although impact was less severe outside of Nova Scotia . In Prince Edward Island , gusty winds caused isolated power outages , and minor flooding occurred in New Brunswick .

 In late August , a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa , developing into a tropical depression developed near Cape Verde on August 28 . It moved west @-@ southwestward for two days before turning to the west . The depression is estimated to have intensified into a tropical storm on August 31 , and subsequently it turned to the west @-@ northwest . On September 2 , the S.S. Umatilla reported winds up to force 12 on the Beaufort scale , or hurricane strength ; the ship also reported very high seas and a rapidly decreasing pressure . Based on the report , the Miami Weather Bureau office initiated advisories on Hurricane Carol about 750 miles ( 1200 km ) east @-@ northeast of Barbados . 
 After reaching hurricane status , Carol embarked a steady intensification trend as it moved northwestward . On September 3 , the Hurricane Hunters flew into the storm and reported winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) , along with a minimum pressure of 929 mbar . This was its peak intensity , attained about 30 hours after reaching hurricane strength , and making Carol the strongest storm of the season . At its peak , the maximum winds were in an area 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) in diameter across the center . The hurricane maintained peak winds for about a day before beginning to weaken . Early on September 6 , Carol passed about 225 mi ( 362 km ) southwest of Bermuda with winds of about 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . The next day the hurricane turned to the north @-@ northeast , bypassing Cape Cod by about 140 mi ( 230 km ) . Late on September 7 , Carol brushed western Nova Scotia before making landfall near Saint John , New Brunswick with winds of around 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) . Shortly after making landfall , Carol transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , which crossed the Gulf of Saint Lawrence , eastern Quebec , and Labrador before dissipating southwest of Greenland on September 9 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 As Carol was threatening Bermuda , planes flew away from the island and ships returned to harbor for safety . Although hurricane @-@ force winds were initially predicted , Carol only brushed the island with high waves and gale force winds . The winds toppled a few trees and power lines , and also injured two motorcyclists after they lost control of their vehicles . 
 Along the East Coast of the United States , the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from New Jersey through Maine due to the approaching hurricane . The combination of high waves and foggy conditions caused several boating accidents in New England , killing four people and left at least 40 people in need of Coast Guard rescue . Winds across much of the region were not significant , reaching only 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) on Nantucket . Across southeast Maine , Carol produced at least 1 in ( 25 mm ) of rainfall , which was beneficial due to gardeners and trees due to previously dry conditions . Effects were generally minimal in the state , although the rainfall prompted the cancellation of a few Northeast Airlines flights . The hurricane caused moderate damage to the fishing industry in New England , totaling around $ 1 million ( 1953 USD , $ 8 @.@ 84 million 2016 USD ) . 
 In the Grand Banks of Canada , the threat of the hurricane prompted fishing boats to venture back to port . In the Bay of Fundy , foggy conditions drove an ocean liner aground . Across Nova Scotia , rough seas washed a boat near Dartmouth , a schooner near Halifax , four yachts in Chester , and another three boats in Shelburne ashore . In addition , eleven yachts in Chester sank during the storm . The seas flooded a coastal road and nearby field in Prospect , destroying a garage . In Cow Bay , a man drowned after falling off of a yacht . Rough seas halted ferry service between Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia , as well as between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick ; other ferry service across the region were delayed . 
 As Carol moved through eastern Canada , it dropped light to moderate rainfall along its path , peaking at 4 @.@ 33 inches ( 110 mm ) in the Côte @-@ Nord region of eastern Quebec , along the northern coast of the Gulf of St. Lawrence . Strong winds affected much of the region , primarily Nova Scotia , including an 80 mph ( 129 km / h ) gust in Halifax . Across the province , the combination of winds and rain downed the equivalent of about 500 @,@ 000 ft3 ( 14 @,@ 000 m3 ) of trees , most of which in areas where some trees were already cut . The winds blew trees onto power lines , leaving widespread areas without telephone , telegraph , or power . In Annapolis Valley , strong winds heavily damaged the apple and grain crop , with farms experiencing losses up to 50 % . Losses from the apple crop was estimated around $ 1 million ( 1950 CAD , $ 9 @.@ 15 million 2016 USD ) . Strong winds left some property damage , including broken windows and at least one instance of a blown @-@ off roof . Across the province , Carol left several people injured . 
 Outside of Nova Scotia , the winds from Carol were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Brunswick . Light rainfall , peaking at 2 @.@ 44 inches ( 62 mm ) in the province , caused street flooding in Moncton . The rainfall reached as far west as Ontario , and as far east as Prince Edward Island , where rainfall reached 1 @.@ 73 inches ( 44 mm ) . Winds in the latter province damaged roofs and downed some trees , resulting in minor power outages . Further north in Quebec , adverse conditions from the storm delayed a search party after a plane crash . 
 = Neil Harvey with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = 
 Neil Harvey was a member of Donald Bradman 's famous Australian cricket team , which toured England in 1948 and was undefeated in their 34 matches . This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles . 
 Aged 19 , Harvey was the youngest player of the touring party . An attacking left @-@ handed middle @-@ order batsman , he had become the youngest Australian to score a Test century by compiling 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer of 1947 – 48 . However , Harvey struggled early on in the tour , having difficulty adapting to English conditions . After being omitted from the first @-@ choice team in the first half of the tour , Harvey 's performances improved with his increasing familiarity with local conditions and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley after an injury to Sid Barnes . Harvey scored 112 in a first innings counter @-@ attack to keep Australia in contention after they had suffered a top @-@ order collapse . Harvey hit the winning boundary in the second innings as Australia won the match with a Test world record successful run @-@ chase of 3 / 404 . He retained his place for the Fifth Test , ending the series with 133 runs at a batting average of 66 @.@ 50 . 
 Overall , Harvey ended with 1 @,@ 129 runs at 53 @.@ 76 in the first @-@ class matches with four centuries , placing him sixth on the run @-@ scoring aggregates and seventh in the batting averages for Australia . Harvey was an acrobatic fielder , regarded as the best in the Australian team . He was twelfth man in the Tests before he broke into the playing XI , and took several acclaimed catches throughout the tour , finishing with 17 catches as well as a solitary wicket with his occasional off spin . 
 = = Background = = 
 A somewhat diminutive left @-@ handed middle @-@ order batsman who was the second @-@ youngest of six cricketing brothers , Harvey made his debut in first @-@ class cricket for his state , Victoria , during the 1946 – 47 Australian season . The following year , at the age of 19 , Harvey made his national debut in the Fourth Test against India in Australia in 1947 – 48 after a series of impressive performances at domestic level . In the Fifth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , he hit 153 to break Archie Jackson 's record for the youngest Australian to make a Test century . The innings ensured him a place on the 1948 Invincibles tour of England as the youngest member of the 17 @-@ man squad . He was more than six and a half years younger than the next youngest players of the team , Arthur Morris and Bill Johnston . Speaking about Harvey 's selection , his captain ( and one of three team selectors ) , Donald Bradman , opined : " He has the brilliance and daring of youth , and the likelihood of rapid improvement " . 
 = = Early tour = = 
 Australia traditionally fielded its first @-@ choice team in the tour opener , which was customarily against Worcestershire . Despite scoring a century in Australia 's most recent Test , Harvey was made 12th man and it appeared that he was not initially in Bradman 's Test plans . Australia promptly crushed the hosts by an innings . 
 Harvey made his debut on English soil in the second tour match against Leicestershire . Batting at No. 5 , he came in at 3 / 316 and made 12 , struggling against the local spinners , as Australia collapsed to end on 448 before winning by an innings . Harvey played a key role in Australia 's victory in the next match against Yorkshire in Bradford , on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling . Harvey took two catches in the home side 's first innings of 71 . He made seven in the first innings as Australia replied with 101 . After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings , Australia collapsed to 4 / 20 in pursuit of 60 for victory . No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat at No. 6 , stand @-@ in captain Lindsay Hassett — Bradman rested himself for the match — top @-@ edged a pull shot and was caught to leave Australia at 5 / 20 . To make matters worse , Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat , so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912 . Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg , who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it . Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary . Colin McCool was out at 6 / 31 before Harvey and wicket @-@ keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia . Harvey was reprieved on 12 ; he took several steps down the pitch to the bowling of Frank Smailes and missed , but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity . Harvey then hit the winning runs by lifting Smailes for a six over the sightscreen , ending unbeaten on 18 not out . 
 The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval . Harvey scored seven and struggled in contrast to the rest of the Australians , who prospered to total 632 , laying the foundation for an innings victory . Harvey took three catches in the match , including two leaping catches in the second innings with his hands above his head . His feats prompted the local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had never been seen at The Oval . The home team 's captain Stuart Surridge lofted a drive down the ground , and Harvey ran 25 m from wide long @-@ on and leapt in the air to catch the ball , which would have cleared the boundary . Harvey managed only 16 before being run out while batting with Bill Brown as Australia piled on 4 / 414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings in the following match . 
 Harvey was then rested as Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs , its largest winning margin for the summer . During this match , the other batsmen set a world record for the most first @-@ class runs scored in one day ’ s play , adding 721 on the opening day . Harvey returned for the innings victory against Oxford University , but scored only 23 as Australia amassed 431 in their only opportunity at the batting crease . 
 The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and were basically a full strength Test team , while Australia fielded their first @-@ choice team . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage , and given Harvey 's early struggles in English conditions and his failure to pass 25 in his first six innings , he was overlooked as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings . 
 After asking Bradman about the reason for his difficulties with the bat , Harvey was told that these were caused by rash shot selection and a tendency to hit the ball in the air . Bradman said " He was technically perfect in his shot production . He was batting well enough and simply getting out early . " Harvey adapted his style and improved his performance . In the next match , he scored 36 and 76 not out on a turning pitch against Lancashire at Old Trafford in Manchester , putting on an unbroken century partnership with Ron Hamence in the second innings as the match ended in a draw . Harvey was rested for the following match against Nottinghamshire , which was also drawn . 
 Harvey returned in the next fixture against Hampshire and made one as Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side 's 195 . It was the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead on the tour . However , Harvey did not get another chance with the bat as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets . 
 = = Test omission = = 
 Harvey had one last chance to make his case for Test selection in the match at Hove against Sussex . It was the final county fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge . He came to the crease at 3 / 360 and put on stands of 93 and 97 with Ray Lindwall and Hamence respectively to finish unbeaten on 100 in only 115 minutes . Australia declared at 5 / 549 when Harvey reached three figures and went on to complete an innings victory . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton described Harvey 's innings as " a superb century , rich in youthful daring and stroke production " . Harvey later rated it his best innings of the tour excluding the Test matches . 
 Up to this point , the reserve opener Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72 @.@ 72 , with a double century , three other centuries and 81 not out , and was on his third tour of England . In contrast , Harvey had totalled only 296 runs at 42 @.@ 29 despite his unbeaten 100 against Sussex . 
 Brown thus gained selection for the First Test , batting out of position in the middle order while Sid Barnes and Morris opened , whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia 's most recent Test against India . This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first @-@ choice team ; Harvey did not play and Brown batted out of position in the middle order . There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last @-@ minute call @-@ up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test , but the opener recovered . 
 Despite his omission , Harvey spent a large amount of the Test substituting as twelfth man for paceman Ray Lindwall , who succumbed to a hamstring injury in the first innings . Lindwall was nevertheless able to jog between the wickets when Australia batted , without needing a runner , but he did not take the field in the second innings . Fingleton said that Harvey was " by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides " and that Australia gained a substantial advantage through his presence on the ground . England captain Norman Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be unable to field , but he did not formally object to the presence of Harvey . Former Australian Test cricket Bill O 'Reilly said that Lindwall was demonstrably not " incapacitated " and that Yardley " must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far " . O 'Reilly decried the benefit that Australia derived through the substitution , agreeing with Fingleton that Harvey was the tourists ' best fielder by far . English commentator John Arlott went further , calling Harvey the best fielder in the world . Australia went on to defeat England by eight wickets although Brown made only 17 . 
 Between Tests , Harvey was called in for the match against Northamptonshire , scoring only 14 , while Brown was rested as Australia won by an innings . In the second match before the next Test , which was against Yorkshire , Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener . Harvey hit the ball to all parts of the ground and Fingleton opined that " [ Harvey ] probably gained the respect of this most discerning crowd more quickly than any other cricketer in recent years " . However , Brown retained his middle @-@ order position for the Second Test at Lord 's ahead of Harvey ; Australia fielded an unchanged team . O 'Reilly criticised the retention of Brown , who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role . He said that despite the fact that Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord 's in 1938 , Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection . Bradman ’ s men went on to a crushing win by 409 runs , although Brown made only 24 and 32 in the middle order . 
 The next match was against Surrey and started the day after the Second Test . Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings , so he was not able to bat in Australia 's first innings , in which Harvey made 43 before being run out . In the second innings , Harvey caught Surrey captain Errol Holmes from a leaping catch , <unk> the ball as it flew through a flock of pigeons . On the final day , Australia wanted to finish the run @-@ chase quickly so they could watch the Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside Sam Loxton and promised Bradman that he would reach the target quickly . Australia chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10 @-@ wicket win in just 20 @.@ 1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time for the championship @-@ deciding match . 
 For the following match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test , Brown did not play . Harvey came to the crease at 3 / 304 and put on 164 for the fourth wicket before his partner Morris was out for 294 . He put on another 63 with Loxton before falling for 95 . During his innings , Harvey repeatedly advanced out of the crease to attack the spinners . Loxton ended on 159 not out as Australia reached 7 / 774 declared , their highest score of the tour , which underpinned a dominant innings victory . Harvey and the other Australian batsmen repeatedly left their crease to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard , who ended with 0 / 186 . Goddard had been touted as a possible England selection because the bowlers used in the first two Tests had failed to challenge the supremacy of Australia ’ s batsmen , but the tourists ’ attack ended his prospects . Loxton 's innings earned him Brown 's middle @-@ order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford , which was a rain @-@ affected draw . 
 = = Fourth Test = = 
 During the drawn Third Test , Barnes was injured and Ian Johnson was used as a makeshift opener because Morris was the only specialist opener left in the team after the omission of Brown . In the meantime , Barnes 's injury had opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test . Harvey managed only ten and Brown only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests . 
 Despite his low score in the preceding match against Middlesex , Harvey was called into the team for the Fourth Test at Headingley at the expense of Barnes . The selectors had overlooked Brown as a replacement for Barnes 's opening position . Instead , vice @-@ captain Hassett would move from the middle @-@ order to accompany Morris at the top of the innings , while Harvey would slot into the middle @-@ order . 
 England batted first and amassed 496 . Australia began their reply on the second afternoon and Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 1 / 63 . The next morning , Hassett and Bradman fell in one Dick Pollard over to leave Australia at 3 / 68 with two new batsmen at the crease . Harvey came in bareheaded at No. 5 to join cavalier all @-@ rounder Keith Miller . Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead . Upon arriving in the middle Harvey told his senior partner " What 's going on out here , eh ? Let 's get stuck into ' em " . Harvey got off the mark by forcing the ball behind point for a single . 
 The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead . He hoisted off spinner Jim Laker 's first ball over square leg for six . Miller shielded Harvey from Laker , as the young batsman was struggling against the off breaks that were turning away from him , especially one ball that spun and bounced , beating his outside edge . Miller drilled an off @-@ drive from Laker for four , and then hit another flat over his head , almost for six into the sightscreen . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , and Harvey joined the fightback during the next over , hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker , the second of which almost cleared the playing area . He then took another boundary to reach 44 , with Miller on 42 . Miller then lifted Laker for a six over long off , and a four over long on from Yardley to reach 54 . Miller drove the next ball through cover for four . Yardley responded by stacking the on side with outfielders and bowling outside leg stump , challenging Miller to another hit for six . The batsman obliged , but edged the ball and was caught at short fine leg for 58 . The partnership yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , and was likened by Wisden to a " hurricane " . Fingleton said that he had never " known a more enjoyable hour " of " delectable cricket " . O 'Reilly said that Miller and Harvey had counter @-@ attacked with " such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult , if not absolutely impossible , to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation " . Arlott said that " two of the greatest innings of all Test cricket were being played " during the partnership . 
 At 4 / 189 Loxton came in to join Harvey , who continued to attack the bowling , unperturbed by Miller 's demise . Ken Cranston came on to bowl and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries . Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where the hook had gone ; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder 's former position , collecting three more runs . Australia thus went to lunch at 4 / 204 , with Harvey on 70 . 
 After lunch , Australia scored slowly as Loxton struggled . Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen with livelier bowling , but instead , Loxton began to settle in . He lofted Pollard to the leg side , almost for six , and then hit three boundaries off another over . Harvey accelerated as well , and 80 minutes into the middle session , reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250 . Harvey ’ s knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours . Loxton then dominated the scoring and brought up his 50 with a six . The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls , bowled by Laker while playing a cross @-@ batted sweep . His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment . Nevertheless , it was an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match back from England 's firm control . Harvey fell at 5 / 294 , and Australia slumped to 8 / 355 before a counterattack by Ray Lindwall saw them to 458 , restricting England 's lead to 38 . O 'Reilly said that Harvey 's innings was one of " no inhibitions " and that it was " completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot " . He added that it was " the very mirror of truth in the batting art " , " delightfully untrammeled by the <unk> of good advice or any other handicapping influence " , and that Harvey 's innings was the most pleasing he had seen since Stan McCabe 's 232 at Trent Bridge in 1938 . 
 England then progressed to 0 / 129 in their second innings before Harvey intervened . On 65 , Cyril Washbrook attempted a hook from Bill Johnston . Connecting with the middle of the bat , he imparted much power on the ball , which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground , but Harvey quickly ran across the ground and bent over to catch the ball at ankle height while still on the run . Jack Fingleton said that it " was the catch of the season — or , indeed , would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [ against Surrey ] " . O ’ Reilly doubted " whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball , let alone make a neat catch of it " . He added that the " hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic " . Later in the day , captain Yardley was caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot from Johnston . 
 After five minutes on the final morning , Yardley declared at 8 / 365 . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller , which would help to break up the wicket , thereby causing more uneven bounce and making the surface more likely to spin . The declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , and the local press wrote them off , predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spin bowlers . However , Morris partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes to set up the win , although they were helped by England ’ s fielders , who missed several catching and stumping chances . Harvey came to the crease at 3 / 396 and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary . 
 Immediately after the Headingley Test , Harvey made 32 in a fleet @-@ footed cameo attack against the local spinners as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings . In the next match against Glamorgan , he came to the crease at the fall of third wicket and made nine runs before rain ended the match in the second innings . Harvey then made a duck , bowled by a big @-@ turning leg break from Eric Hollies in the first innings as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets ; he was not required to bat in the second innings . Harvey was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour . He returned for the non @-@ first @-@ class match against Durham , scoring two out of Australia 's 282 in a rain @-@ affected draw , which ended after the first day without reaching the second innings . 
 = = Fifth Test = = 
 Although he had only scored 41 runs in four innings between Tests , Harvey was retained for the Fifth and final Test at The Oval . England elected to bat on a rain @-@ affected pitch . Precipitation in the week leading up to the match had delayed the start , and Yardley ’ s decision to bat was regarded as a surprise , as the weather suggested that bowlers would enjoy the conditions . This proved to be correct as Australia cut England down for 52 on the first day , with Lindwall ( 6 / 20 ) in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights . Australia had already passed England by the close of play , reaching 2 / 153 . The next day , Harvey came to the crease at 4 / 243 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth . He hit Jack Young for a straight @-@ driven four and then pulled him for another . Harvey then succumbed to Eric Hollies for 17 , hitting a catch to Young , leaving Australia at 5 / 265 . The Warwickshire spinner noticed this , and delivered a topspinner that dipped more than usual , and the batsman mistimed his off @-@ drive , which went in the air towards mid @-@ off . Australia finished at 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to complete victory by an innings and 149 runs and seal the series 4 – 0 . 
 = = Later tour matches = = 
 Seven matches remained on Bradman 's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat . Australia batted first against Kent and Harvey made 60 , including a 104 @-@ run stand with Brown before falling at 4 / 283 , part of a collapse in which Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361 . Despite stumbling with the bat , the tourists completed an innings victory . In the next match against the Gentlemen of England , Harvey was rested as Australia amassed 5 / 610 and won by an innings . He returned for the match against Somerset , putting on 187 for the second wicket with Hassett in 110 minutes . Harvey hit 14 fours and 2 sixes , both of which came in one over , in top @-@ scoring with a " glorious " 126 as Australia compiled 5 / 560 declared and won by an innings and 374 runs . Harvey performed a similar feat in the following match against the South of England , coming in at 3 / 237 and scoring 110 , adding 175 in 110 minutes in conjunction with Hassett , who also made a second successive century as Australia declared at 7 / 522 . Harvey reached his century in just 90 minutes . The match was washed out , but not before Harvey bowled for the first time during the tour and took his only first @-@ class wicket for the season , that of Trevor Bailey . He ended with 1 / 15 . 
 Australia 's biggest challenge in the post @-@ Test tour matches was against the Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI . During the last Australian tour in 1938 , Leveson @-@ Gower ’ s team was effectively a full @-@ strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play . Bradman then fielded a full @-@ strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of Ian Johnson at the expense of Doug Ring . Harvey made 23 before being bowled by Freddie Brown as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays . For the entire first @-@ class tour , Harvey scored four centuries and aggregated 1 @,@ 129 runs at 53 @.@ 76 . 
 The tour ended with two non @-@ first @-@ class matches against Scotland . In the first match , Harvey was rested as the Australians took an innings victory . In the second match , Harvey scored four and then took 2 / 13 in the second innings as Australia ended their campaign with another innings victory . 
 = = Role = = 
 At the age of 19 , Harvey was the youngest player of the touring party — more than six and half years younger than all the other members of the squad . An attacking left @-@ handed middle @-@ order batsman , Harvey had become the youngest Australian to score a Test century , by making 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer . However , Harvey struggled early in the tour and had difficulty adapting to English conditions . After being omitted from the first @-@ choice team in the early part of the tour , Harvey 's performances improved with increasing familiarity with local conditions , and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test , where he batted at No. 5 behind Miller and in front of Loxton due to the injury to Barnes . Upon Barnes ’ return for the Fifth Test , the trio were each pushed down one position . 
 Overall , Harvey ended with 1 @,@ 129 runs at 53 @.@ 76 in the first @-@ class matches with four centuries , placing him sixth on the aggregates and seventh in the batting averages . He played the bulk of his 27 first @-@ class innings between No. 4 and No. 6 in the batting order . Only three times did he bat elsewhere . He scored an unbeaten 73 in less than an hour in the second innings of the second match against Surrey as a makeshift opener , setting up a ten @-@ wicket victory . He made 23 batting at No. 3 against Oxford University and one against Hampshire while batting at No. 7.N- 
 Harvey was an acrobatic fielder , regarded as the best in the Australian team . Fingleton said that Harvey was " by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides , who was to save many runs in the field " . O 'Reilly agreed Fingleton that Harvey was Australia 's best fielder by far , Arlott went further , calling Harvey the best fielder in the world . He was twelfth man in the early Tests because of his fielding ability , before breaking into the playing XI and taking several acclaimed catches throughout the tour . He took 17 catches for the tour and claimed a solitary wicket with his occasional off spin , bowling only ten overs for the entire summer .

 Thurman played an active role in establishing international student organizations to help prevent foreign students feeling isolated while studying abroad . She organized one of the first international scholarship programs for African @-@ American women . She studied racism and the effects of prejudice on various people throughout the world , making two round @-@ the @-@ world trips in her lifetime . She wrote books and newspaper articles to preserve black heritage , and initiated the publishing efforts of the National Council of Negro Women ( NCNW ) by founding the <unk> Women ’ s Journal . In addition to writing the second ever history of black Californians , in 1958 Thurman published a cookbook laced with historical information about black professional women at a time when African Americans had few civil rights . Recognizing that there was little academic interest in black women 's history at the time , Thurman used the marketing ploy of food to report on the lives of black women who were not domestics . She participated in international peace and feminist conferences , and in 1945 attended the San Francisco Conference for the founding of the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation . Thurman also established museums such as the Museum of Afro @-@ American History in Boston in 1963 . 
 Thurman and her husband retired in San Francisco in 1965 . She worked with the San Francisco Public Library in 1969 to develop resources for black history of the American West . In 1979 she was honored with a Centennial Award at Spelman College , sharing the recognition with UNESCO director <unk> Sullivan Challenor . After her husband 's death in 1981 , Thurman took over the management of the Howard Thurman Educational Trust , which funded research for literary , religious and scientific purposes and assisted in scholarships for black students . On her death in 1996 , she left the couple 's vast archives to numerous universities .

 Sue Elvie Bailey was born on August 26 , 1903 , in Pine Bluff , Arkansas , to Reverend Isaac and Susie ( née Ford ) Bailey . She attended primary school at Nannie Burroughs ' School for Girls in Washington , D.C. In 1920 , she graduated from the college preparatory school , Spelman Seminary ( now Spelman College ) in Atlanta , Georgia . She continued her education at Oberlin College in Oberlin , Ohio , graduating in 1926 with bachelor 's degrees in music and liberal arts , making her the first black student to earn a music degree from Oberlin . While there , Bailey developed a friendship with Louise Thompson , who would become a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance movement , and encouraged Langston Hughes , inventor of jazz poetry , to read poetry there . She traveled with a quintet giving concerts in Cleveland , New York , and Philadelphia , as well as London and Paris . 
 = = Early career = = 
 After graduating , Thurman took a post as a music teacher at the Hampton Institute in Virginia , but did not enjoy the work . One of the issues at Hampton was that her friend , Louise Thompson , also a teacher there , had written anonymously to W. E. B. Du Bois , co @-@ founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , complaining about conditions at the college under the predominantly white administration . Although Bailey was suspected of writing the letter after Du Bois published it in the NAACP 's journal The Crisis , she did not betray Thompson but instead invited Langston Hughes to Hampton for a poetry reading and moral support . Nevertheless , she left Hampton in 1930 to become a traveling National Secretary for the Student Division of the YWCA . She lectured throughout Europe and established the first World Fellowship Committee of the YWCA . On June 12 , 1932 , in the dining hall at Lincoln Academy , Kings Mountain , North Carolina , Bailey married Howard W. Thurman ( 1900 – 1981 ) , a minister , who would become a social critic , writer and dean of several prominent US universities . At the time of their marriage , he was serving as Dean of Rankin Chapel and Professor of Systematic Theology at Howard University in Washington , D.C. 
 = = Asia = = 
 In 1935 , the couple embarked upon a six @-@ month trip through southern Asia , visiting Burma , Ceylon and India , culminating in a “ Pilgrimage of Friendship ” to the International Student Conference in India . Her husband led the American delegation , lecturing at more than forty universities , while Thurman herself was asked to meet with journalists and students , to discuss race relations and evaluate the parallels between the situation with Indians and the British and the African Americans and white Americans . Initially , Howard had turned down the opportunity and his wife was not included in the offer , but when the trip was finally agreed , both were participants . Thurman was not chosen simply as the wife of Howard Thurman but , in the words of the committee , because she was one of " four persons best able to do this particular job " . This decision was remarkable for the period given that black women were often invisible members of society and generally prohibited from authoritative roles in social welfare programs . Thurman lectured during the trip on negro women and the organizations to which they belonged , as well as internationalism and culture . During their meeting with Rabindranath Tagore in Santiniketan she presented a paper " The History of Negro Music " , though initially she had been reluctant to discuss slave music . She finally agreed only after Tagore and Gandhi explained that to Asian Christians , negro spirituals were deemed to express the profound faith of people even in bondage and seemed more authentic than western hymns . Thurman both sang and taught songs to local choirs . She also commented on art , having acquired knowledge on the subject during an earlier trip to Mexico . 
 The couple met with Mahatma Gandhi , becoming the first African Americans to have an audience with him . When Thurman asked him to take his message to the United States , he demurred as his work in India and his personal quest there were not finished . One important aspect of the meeting was a discussion of how non @-@ violent resistance could be used as a means of creating social change . The meeting had a profound effect on the couple , changing the direction of their lives . Though they would remain Christians , the meeting with Gandhi led them to consider establishing a church free of prejudice , transcending racial , social , economic and spiritual boundaries . After they returned to the United States , Howard received a letter from A. J. Muste on behalf of Alfred Fisk who was looking for someone to establish a church in San Francisco which crossed the racial and spiritual divides . Muste was hopeful that Rev. Thurman might know of a divinity student interested in the position . Instead , Howard decided to take up the challenge himself , securing a leave of absence in order to found the church . Thurman went with him bringing their two daughters , as she strongly believed in the cause .

 Thurman established the Juliette Derricotte Scholarship in the late 1930s , which allowed African @-@ American undergraduate women of high academic achievement to study and travel abroad . The first two recipients of the scholarship were Marian Banfield of Howard University and Anna V. Brown of Oberlin College . Banfield was a goddaughter of Howard Thurman . The following year the recipients of her scholarship were Elizabeth McCree from Boston , who attended Fisk University , and Margaret Bush Wilson of Talladega College . 
 In 1940 , Thurman founded the <unk> Women ’ s Journal , the first publishing vehicle of the National Council of Negro Women ( NCNW ) , which she edited from 1940 until 1944 . In 1941 , an archive committee was formed to design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of African @-@ American women . Though their plans focused primarily on written records and professional accomplishment and would thus reflect middle @-@ class life , the committee initiated work on collecting historical records of black women . In 1944 , Thurman became the committee 's chair and her mother donated $ 1 @,@ 000 toward creating the National Council of Negro Women 's National Library , Archives , and Museum . On June 30 , 1946 , they held an archive drive , printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers , organizations , librarians and others to help them acquire photographs , books and mementos . They opened the first facility of the library at what is now the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site . 
 In 1943 , Thurman and her husband moved to San Francisco . She wrote several articles about their Asian trip , analyzing information , discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities . It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non @-@ violent resistance as a means of social protest . By 1944 , the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they , along with Fisk , opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples . It was the first interracial , non @-@ denominational church in the United States . While her husband assumed the pastoral duties , Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans , Africans , Asians and their cultures , covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos . 
 In 1945 , Thurman attended the San Francisco Conference for the founding of the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation . The official African @-@ American delegation included W. E. B. Du Bois , founder of the NAACP ; Walter Francis White , Executive Secretary of the NAACP ; and Mary McLeod Bethune founder of the National Council of Negro Women , but Bethune insisted on sending three additional observers from the NCNW , which included Thurman . After the event , Thurman published a report in the Chicago Defender on April 16 , 1945 , in which she questioned the limited role that people of color played in the proceedings and pointed out that the large populations of developing countries would become a force to be reckoned with . Thurman , as a representative for the NCNW , attended the Primer Congreso <unk> de Mujeres held in Guatemala City , Guatemala , in 1947 . The congress addressed many of the issues she supported such as women 's rights , internationalism , and peace initiatives . In 1949 , she led a delegation of members from the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples to Paris for the Fourth Plenary Session of UNESCO . 
 After researching black history in California , Thurman wrote eight articles for the San Francisco Sun Reporter as part of a series entitled " Pioneers of Negro Origin in California " . Using the same title , she published the articles in book form in 1952 . It was the second history of black Californians published — the first being The Negro Trail Blazers of California by Delilah L. Beasley in 1919 — and filled a gap caused by a lack of academic interest . History in America , at the time , was written about men and almost exclusively about white men . Neither of the women who wrote about the history of blacks in California was a native Californian . 
 = = = Boston = = = 
 In 1953 , Howard Thurman became the Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and , after ten years in California , the couple moved to Boston . The move was prompted by the desire to share their ideas of outreach and inclusion in a university setting , though they were aware that the arrival of the first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties . From the beginning , Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment , organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members and their friends . Shortly after they arrived , a Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends . Not only was she not known well at the university , finding her family to notify them was difficult . In response , Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated . By 1965 , the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University . The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement , but they believed their commitment was to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible , rather than participating in marches , protests and demonstrations . Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack , who co @-@ founded the Congress of Racial Equality ; Lillian Smith , author of the novel Strange Fruit ; Glenn E. Smiley , national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation , as well as King 's own acknowledgement , which credited their spiritual guidance . 
 Thurman continued her writing work in Boston . In 1958 , she published the The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro , which not only gave recipes but included black history . It retold stories of professional women and history to counter the belief that all black women were maids and domestics at a time when African Americans were excluded from basic civil rights . She recognized that in order to tell their history , a new approach was needed as there was no market for histories of the African Americans . In the preface to her book , she explained she was creating " palatable history " , testifying to her shrewd marketing ability . 
 During the 1960s , the Thurmans traveled widely , making various trips to study racial barriers that prohibited creation of community . A two @-@ year sabbatical granted from Boston University made their travels possible . In 1962 , they journeyed to Saskatchewan , Canada , to meet with tribal leaders about discrimination and in 1963 , they embarked on a trip that included Nigeria , Israel , Hawaii , and California . In Nigeria , Howard Thurman lectured at the University of Ibadan . The couple 's second round @-@ the @-@ world tour took them to Japan , the Philippines and Egypt . 
 In 1963 , Thurman founded the Museum of Afro @-@ American History in Boston . Interested in history , she had discovered a settlement where free blacks had lived prior to the Civil War and their 1808 African Meeting House , which housed both Boston 's first black church and the first segregated public school in the United States . The museum was created to save the site and provide a means to purchase other significant properties for preservation of African @-@ American heritage in the area . Thurman also created a map of important African American historical sites in Boston with the help of her daughter , Anne Chiarenza , which she called " Negro Freedom Trails of Boston " . The map highlighted twenty @-@ two points of interest to black history within the city of Boston and was in part created to give black school children a sense that they were part of the history of the city . What is today known as the Black Heritage Trail was adapted from Thurman 's original idea . 
 While in Boston , in 1962 , Thurman arranged for the sculptor Meta Warrick Fuller to create a commissioned " freedom plaque " for Livingstone College , of Salisbury , North Carolina . Bailey was an invited speaker at Livingstone in 1963 and at that time , in honor of United Nations Day , she donated a collection of dolls representing the member nations to the college . As far back as the 1930s , Thurman had collected ethnic dolls and given them to universities to promote understanding of cultural differences . In 1967 , Livingstone awarded her with an honorary doctorate .

 Howard Thurman took retirement from Boston University in 1965 and the couple moved back to San Francisco . Thurman continued to pursue historic preservation . She worked with the San Francisco Public Library in 1969 to develop resources for black history of the American West . In the 1970s , the couple took a trip to the Pacific basin . In 1979 she was honored with a Centennial Award at Spelman College , sharing the recognition with UNESCO director <unk> Sullivan Challenor . 
 After her husband 's death , in 1981 , Thurman took over the management of the Howard Thurman Educational Trust , which funded research for literary , religious and scientific purposes , endowed scholarships for black students and assisted charitable projects . Thurman was the mother of Anne Spencer Thurman and stepmother to Olive Thurman , her husband 's daughter with his first wife . Olive was the first wife of actor Victor Wong . 
 Thurman died on Christmas Day , 1996 , at the San Francisco Zen Buddhist Hospice Center .

 " ' Gehenna " is the second episode of the first season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network on November 1 , 1996 . The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter , and directed by David Nutter . " Gehenna " featured guest appearances by Robin Gammel and Chris Ellis . 
 Offender profiler Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) , a member of the private investigative organisation Millennium Group , is sent to San Francisco to track down a doomsday cult which murders its brainwashed members when they disobey it . 
 " Gehenna " sees both Carter and Nutter continue their roles from " Pilot " , although it also necessitated changes in filming locations . The episode opens with a quote by W. H. Auden — the first of the series ' opening quotations — and makes references to the Hebrew Bible 's Gehenna .

 In San Francisco , a group of young men drive to an abandoned factory , and drug one of their members with LSD , leaving him to be torn apart by what he perceives to be a monster . Later , a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park is proven to be from human remains . A private investigative organisation , the Millennium Group , dispatches offender profiler Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) and colleague Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this . Black believes that the victims were burnt alive ; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the Group to the same factory . 
 In Black 's home in Seattle , his wife Catherine ( Megan Gallagher ) confides in policeman Bob Bletcher ( Bill Smitrovich ) her worry about Black 's overprotective nature , fearing he may quit his job if he believes his family to be in danger . Catherine does not yet know that a stalker from their past has resurfaced and has been posting <unk> of the family to Black . Black has meanwhile been persuaded by his fellow Group member Mike Atkins ( Robin Gammell ) that his family is in no immediate risk . 
 Back in San Francisco , dental records matched to teeth found in the ashes lead to a young immigrant who vanished six months prior , having joined a doomsday cult . Elsewhere , this cult is seen operating as <unk> , working in a large assembly hall as propaganda slogans are projected onto the walls around them . One of the members is apprehended by Black , and during his interrogation it becomes clear that the cult , fronting as Gehenna Industries , is brainwashing its terrified members , incinerating those who disobey . 
 Black returns to Seattle , researching Gehenna Industries from his home . He uncovers a warehouse address belonging to the cult , which Atkins investigates . The warehouse is full of cached weaponry , stockpiled for the cult 's doomsday predictions . The cult 's leader lures Atkins into the industrial microwave which has been used to immolate the victims , but the police arrive in time to save him , having been tipped off by Black that Atkins may be in danger . The weapons stockpile allows the police to bring down the cult , but Black is certain that their influence is still a threat .

 " Gehenna " is the second episode of the series directed by David Nutter , who had previously helmed " Pilot " . Nutter would also direct " 522666 " and " Loin Like a Hunting Flame " later in the first season . The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter . Beyond creating the concept for Millennium , Carter would write a total of six other episodes for the series in addition to " Gehenna " — three in the first season , and a further three in the third season . " Gehenna " marked the first appearance by Chris Ellis as Group member Jim Penseyres ; Ellis would go on to reprise the role in " Dead Letters " and " The Judge " . 
 The episode opens with a quote from the Anglo @-@ American poet W. H. Auden , taken from the 1939 poem " Blessed Event " — " I smell blood and an era of prominent madmen " , the final line of the poem 's third stanza . Poetry by William Butler Yeats , a contemporary of Auden 's , formed a plot point in " Pilot " , while the title of " Loin Like a Hunting Flame " was taken from the work of yet another contemporary , Dylan Thomas . As " Pilot " did not open with a quotation , " Gehenna " is the first episode of Millennium to do so . The episode 's title , Gehenna , is the Hellenised form of the Hebrew <unk> , the " Valley of the Son of Hinnom " . <unk> was a location referred to in the Hebrew Bible where children were sacrificed by burning to the Canaanite god Moloch ; this ritual sacrifice echoes the cremation of the victims in the episode . 
 The building used for exterior shots of the Black family 's home is different from the one seen in " Pilot " ; the earlier house was located in an expensive neighbourhood whose residents had decided not to allow filming to continue there . The new location chosen was one which had already been used in Millennium 's sister show The X @-@ Files , appearing in that series ' second episode " Deep Throat " . The house 's owner was an air stewardess who would frequently meet members of the cast and crew as they travelled in and out of Vancouver .

 " Gehenna " received mixed reviews from critics . Writing for The A.V. Club , Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a C + , finding that it was " almost completely crippled by ... self @-@ seriousness " . VanDerWerff felt that the episode reflected Millennium seeming simultaneously both " intrinsically of the 1990s " and " ahead of its time " , find that its treatment of " the dread and shadowy fear and sense that the world held several cloaked and mysterious evils for well @-@ to @-@ do Americans " was a symptom of 1990s preoccupation with " the end of the world " while foreshadowing the mood of the United States following the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001 . As a result , VanDerWerff described the episode , and the series , as being " the first post @-@ Sept . 11 show " . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 , noting that there is " more here than just your standard serial killer show " . Gibron praised the episode 's " atypical storyline " , which he felt was achieved through " some suggestive effects and wonderful crosscutting " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five , calling it " a somewhat humdrum story " .

 = Yarmouth Castle = 
 Yarmouth Castle is an artillery fort built by Henry VIII in 1547 to protect Yarmouth Harbour on the Isle of Wight from the threat of French attack . Just under 100 feet ( 30 m ) across , the square castle was initially equipped with 15 artillery guns and a garrison of 20 men . It featured an Italianate " arrow @-@ head " bastion on its landward side ; this was very different in style from the earlier circular bastions used in the Device Forts built by Henry and was the first of its kind to be constructed in England . 
 During the 16th and 17th centuries the castle continued to be maintained and modified ; the seaward half of the castle was turned into a solid gun platform and additional accommodation was built for the fort 's gunners . A bulwark was built on the east side of the castle and an additional gun battery was placed on the town 's quay , just to the west . For most of the English Civil War of the 1640s it was held by Parliament ; following the Restoration , it was refortified by Charles II in the 1670s . 
 The fortification remained in use through the 18th and 19th centuries , albeit with a smaller garrison and fewer guns , until in 1885 these were finally withdrawn . After a short period as a coast guard signalling post , the castle was brought back into military use during the First and Second World Wars . In the 21st century , the heritage organisation English Heritage operates the castle as a tourist attraction .

 Yarmouth Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry broke with Pope Paul III to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon , and remarry . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraged the two countries to attack England . Henry responded in 1539 by ordering the construction of fortifications along the most vulnerable parts of the coast , through an instruction called a " device " . The immediate threat passed , but resurfaced in 1544 , with France threatening an invasion across the Channel , backed by her allies in Scotland . Henry therefore issued another device in 1544 to further improve the country 's defences , particularly along the south coast . 
 The town of Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight may have been attacked by the French in 1543 ; if so , this raid probably encouraged the construction of a castle there as part of the second wave of Device Forts . The fort functioned alongside the existing defences in the Solent and protected the main crossing from the west side of the island to the mainland . Yarmouth Castle was a square artillery fort built around a central courtyard with an angular , " arrow @-@ head " bastion protecting the landward side . It was initially equipped with three cannons and culverins , and twelve smaller guns , firing from a line of embrasures along the seaward side of the castle . It was garrisoned by a small team of soldiers , consisting of a master gunner , a porter and 17 soldiers , commanded by Richard Udall , the castle 's first captain . Udall lived in the castle , but the soldiers resided in the local town . 
 The castle was constructed by George Mills under the direction of Richard Worsley , the Captain of the Island , on land belonging to the Crown , possibly on the site of a church destroyed during the events of 1543 . Henry had dissolved the monasteries in England a few years before , and stone from the local Quarr Abbey was probably reused in the construction of the castle . It was finished by 1547 , when Mills was paid £ 1 @,@ 000 for his work and to discharge the soldiers who had been guarding the site during the project . 
 = = = = Initial use = = = = 
 When the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I succeeded to the throne there were changes in the leadership on the Isle of Wight and the castle . Worsley was dismissed in favour of a Roman Catholic appointee in 1553 and Udall was executed in 1555 for his role in the Dudley conspiracy to overthrow the Queen . When the Protestant Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558 , however , peace was made with France and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to England . Elizabeth reappointed Worsley to his post and he carried out an extensive redevelopment of the castle . Worsley filled in half of the castle 's courtyard to produce a solid artillery platform able to hold eight heavy guns with an uninterrupted field of fire over the sea , and he probably also constructed the Master Gunner 's House on the other side of the castle . Nonetheless , an inspection in 1586 showed that the fortification was in poor condition . Work costing £ 50 was done in 1587 , including the erection of an earth bulwark alongside the castle to mount additional guns . The next year saw the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada , after which further repairs were carried out on the castle . By 1599 the Crown was informed that the castle , which was still considered an important defence for the Solent , needed expensive repairs . 
 = = = 17th century = = = 
 Yarmouth Castle continued to be an important military fortification , used both as a fortress but also as a transport hub and a stores depot . The repairs recommended in 1599 were carried out in the first years of the 17th century and a further £ 300 was invested in Yarmouth Castle and nearby Sandown Castle in 1609 , including adding two angular buttresses along the walls facing the sea . 
 A survey in 1623 by the castle 's captain , John Burley , reported that the garrison comprised only four gunners and the captain , with the buildings in a " ruinous " state and the defences in need of repair ; similar concerns were raised in 1625 and 1629 . Suggestions that a half @-@ moon battery should be added to the defences were not progressed , but in 1632 the parapets were raised in height and further lodgings and a long room for stores were constructed within the castle . Some of the stone used for this may have been reused from nearby Sandown , whose walls had been destroyed by the sea ; before it was used at Sandown , the stone appears to have been taken from the local monasteries . 
 Civil war broke out in 1642 between the followers of King Charles I and those of Parliament . Initially , Captain Barnaby Burley , a relative of John , and an ardent Royalist , held the castle on behalf of the King with a tiny garrison . Burley negotiated surrender terms , including that he initially be allowed to remain in the castle with armed protection , and the castle remained in the control of Parliament for the rest of the war . Early during the Interregnum it was decided to increase the size of the garrison at the castle from 30 to 70 soldiers , due to concerns about a potential Royalist attack from the island of Jersey . Most of the soldiers lived outside the castle itself . The annual cost of this force was around £ 78 and in 1655 the garrison was made smaller again to reduce costs . 
 When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 , he demobilised most of the existing army and the following year the garrison at Yarmouth was given four days notice to leave the castle . The King announced that the castle 's artillery would be sent to Cowes , unless the town of Yarmouth agreed to take over the financial responsibility of running the site themselves . The town declined to do so , but Charles repeated the offer in 1666 ; this time Yarmouth seems to have taken action , appointing four soldiers for a garrison , although the town did not assign an officer to command them , or apparently make any repairs to the now dilapidated castle . 
 The Crown took over the castle again in 1670 , and Robert Holmes , the new Captain of the Isle of Wight , had some of the guns brought back from Cowes to the castle . The site was refortified and a new battery placed on the adjacent quay , but the older earthworks were demolished and the moat was filled in . Holmes built a mansion for himself alongside the castle , where on three occasions he hosted the King . 
 In 1688 , Charles ' brother , James II , faced widespread revolt and a potential invasion of England by William of Orange . Holmes was a supporter of James , but although he intended to control Yarmouth Castle on the monarch 's behalf , the local inhabitants and the garrison at Yarmouth sided with William , preventing him from openly siding with the King .

 Yarmouth Castle continued to be used , and records from 1718 and 1760 show it was equipped with eight 6 @-@ pound ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) and five 9 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 1 kg ) guns along the castle and the quay platforms , respectively . Throughout this period it was probably staffed by a captain and six gunners , supported by the local militia . In the early 18th century , Holmes ' mansion was rebuilt , forming its current appearance . By the 18th century , however , Yarmouth Harbour had gradually silted up and been destroyed by industrial developments , reducing the value of the anchorage , and the design of the castle had become outdated . 
 In 1813 , during the Napoleonic Wars , work was carried out to alter the design of the parapet . The Crimean War sparked a fresh invasion scare and in 1855 the south coast of England was refortified . Yarmouth Castle underwent considerable repairs that year ; four naval guns and traversing rails were installed on the castle platform , and a regular county army unit was put in place to garrison the fort . In 1881 a proposal was put forward to modernise the entire fortification , but this was rejected and in 1885 the garrison and the guns were withdrawn . 
 The coastguard began using the castle as a signalling station in 1898 . In 1901 , the War Department passed the castle to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and in 1912 parts of the castle were leased to the Pier Hotel , which incorporated Robert Holmes 's former mansion ; the Pier Hotel eventually became the George Hotel and still occupies part of the old castle moat . The Office of Works took control of the castle in 1913 , carrying out a programme of repairs , and it was used by the military in both the First and Second World Wars . It was finally retired from military use in the 1950s . 
 In the 21st century , Yarmouth Castle is run by the heritage organisation English Heritage as a tourist attraction , receiving 9 @,@ 007 visitors in 2010 . It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument .

The castle 's 16th @-@ century bulwark , which originally covered the area to the west of Pier Street and the north of Quay Street , and its quay battery have also been destroyed . 
 The walls of the castle are mainly built from ashlar stone , with some red brick used on the south side . The walls are pierced by a small number of gunloops , including in the " ears " of the bastion , which would have overlooked the moat . When first built the interior of the castle formed a sequence of buildings around a courtyard , but the southern half of the castle was filled in shortly afterwards to produce a solid gun platform able to support heavy guns . It was later raised again in the 17th century to its current height . The parapet is now covered with turf , with 19th @-@ century rounded corners , and the platform still has the rails on which the four naval guns would have traversed , dating from 1855 . A small lodging room , built on the platform at the top of the stairs , has since been destroyed . 
 The arrow @-@ head design of the castle 's bastion reflected new ideas about defensive fortifications spreading out from Italy in the 16th century . Earlier Henrician castles had used the older European style of semi @-@ circular bastions to avoid presenting any weak spots in the stonework , but an arrow @-@ headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force . Yarmouth was among the first fortifications in Europe , and the first in England , to adopt this design . 
 The accommodation and other facilities are on the south side of the castle . On the ground floor , the entrance to the castle leads through to a courtyard , linked to four barrel @-@ vaulted rooms in the south @-@ west corner , originally 17th @-@ century lodgings for the garrison . Two of these chambers were converted for use as magazines and the fittings of one of these still remains in place . In the south @-@ east corner is the Master Gunner 's House , comprising a parlour , hall and kitchen on the ground floor , and a chamber and attic on the floors above . The parlour and hall would have originally been separated by a screen ; the chamber would also have been subdivided . On the first floor is a small chamber , supported on arches above the courtyard , which was used as a lodging . On the second floor , the Long Room runs on top of the barrel @-@ vaulted chambers , its massive , original roof still intact . 
 = Church architecture in Scotland = 
 Church architecture in Scotland incorporates all church building within the modern borders of Scotland , from the earliest Christian structures in the sixth century until the present day . The early Christian churches for which there is evidence are basic masonry @-@ built constructions on the west coast and islands . As Christianity spread , local churches tended to remain much simpler than their English counterparts . By the eighth century more sophisticated ashlar block @-@ built buildings began to be constructed . From the eleventh century , there were larger and more ornate Romanesque buildings , as with Dunfermline Abbey and St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney . From the twelfth century the introduction of new monastic orders led to a boom in ecclesiastical building , often using English and Continental forms . From the thirteenth century elements of the European Gothic style began to appear in Scotland , cumulating in buildings such as Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilt Melrose Abbey . Renaissance influences can be seen in a move to a low @-@ massive style that was probably influenced by contacts with Italy and the Netherlands . 
 From the mid @-@ sixteenth century the Reformation revolutionised church architecture in Scotland . It resulted in a rejection of the elaborate ornamentation of existing churches . New churches were produced in a plain style , often with a T @-@ plan that emphasised the pulpit and preaching . This style was adopted by both Presbyterian and Episcopalian wings of the Scottish Kirk , but there were some attempts to introduce Baroque elements into church building after the Restoration . In the eighteenth century the influence of James Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements , with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple . This classicism continued into the early nineteenth century , but became increasingly controversial and began to be rejected for a version of the Gothic revival , which flourished into the early twentieth century . Between the world wars , a form of neo @-@ Romanesque became the norm for new churches . In the second half of the twentieth century new churches were highly influenced by modernism , resulting in rectangular and irregularly shaped buildings , built in new materials , although many of these were later demolished . As the level of new building reduced from the 1970s there was a move to functional and unambitious new churches , but in the 1980s there was a move back to more striking and original designs .

 = = = Early churches = = = 
 The introduction of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland from the sixth century led to the construction of the first churches . These may originally have been wooden , like that excavated at Whithorn , but most of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry @-@ built churches , beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east . Early chapels tended to have square @-@ ended converging walls , similar to Irish chapels of this period . Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England , with many churches remaining simple oblongs , without transepts and aisles , and often without towers . In the Highlands they were often even simpler , many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings . 
 Monasteries also differed significantly from those on the continent , and were often an isolated collection of wooden huts surrounded by a wall . At <unk> an Naoimh in the Inner Hebrides there are huts , a chapel , refectory , guest house , barns and other buildings . Most of these were made of timber and wattle construction and probably thatched with heather and turves . They were later rebuilt in stone , with underground cells and circular " beehive " huts like those used in Ireland . Similar sites have been excavated on Bute , Orkney and Shetland . From the eighth century more sophisticated buildings emerged . The development of early ashlar masonry produced block @-@ built stone buildings , like the eleventh century round tower at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule . 
 = = = Romanesque = = = 
 After the eleventh century , as masonry techniques advanced , ashlar blocks became more rectangular , resulting in more stable walls that could incorporate refined architectural moulding and detailing that can be seen in corbelling , buttressing , lintels and arching . At the same time there was increasing influence from English and continental European designs , known as Romanesque . The Romanesque style had its origins in Roman building techniques and early churches in the Byzantine Empire and Italy and was characterised by massive reinforced walls and round arches that could bear the weight of rounded barrel vault roofs . The introduction of this style to Scotland is associated with the ecclesiastical reforms that began in the reign of Máel Coluim III ( r . 1058 – 93 ) , bringing continental ideas of monasticism and church organisation to the country . The oldest Romanesque church in Scotland is probably the small chapel built for Máel Coluim 's wife Margaret on Castle Rock , Edinburgh , with a vaulted semi @-@ circular apse . In the twelfth century a number of new parish churches were built by lords on their land . They were often small aisless buildings with two or three connected cells , each of diminishing size , ending in a rounded apse . One of the best preserved is at Dalmeny in Lothian . 
 St. Regulus Chapel at St. Andrews dates from around 1150 and was probably built as a reliquary church . Only the aisless choir and tall square tower survive . Its detailing derives from work on a church at <unk> @-@ le @-@ Street in England and it may have been carried out by the same Yorkshire masons . The first monastic establishment built in the Romanesque style was Dunfermline Abbey , begun at the behest of Queen Margaret about 1074 . An existing small chapel was expanded with a square choir and rounded apse . About fifty years later it was replaced by a grander cruciform church of which only the nave now survives . The chevron pattern in the detailing on the piers was modelled on that at Durham Cathedral . Similarly , St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney , begun in 1137 , may have employed masons that had worked at Durham , with which it shares a similar pattern of great round arches based on thick cylindrical pillars . The arrival of the new monastic orders in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms , including abbeys at Kelso , Holyrood , St Andrews and Jedburgh , one of the most complete Romanesque buildings to survive . 
 = = = Gothic = = = 
 The style that developed from the Romanesque , originating in twelfth @-@ century France , is now known as Gothic . It was characterised by pointed arches , ribbed vaults and flying buttresses . It was brought to Britain by the Cistercians , whose abbeys retained thick walls , but pierced them with lancet arches with slender pointed arches . This style became characteristic of the early Gothic in Britain and can be seen at Dundrennan Abbey , begun around 1142 , which resembles religious foundations in northern England . The style can also be seen in the East end of Elgin Cathedral , which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery . 
 A more elaborate style known as decorated Gothic , applying ornamentation to vaults and pillars , particularly using curved motifs , began to be adopted in the thirteenth century and was characteristic of Scottish church building in the fourteenth century . It was used at Dunblane Cathedral , built in the thirteenth century , particularly to decorate the nave and East end . At Fortrose in the Highlands the elaborate decoration of this style is still visible in the south aisle . One of the finest examples is Sweetheart Abbey near Dumfries , a Cistercian monastery , named after the burial of John de Balliol 's heart alongside the body of his wife . The period of the Wars of Independence ( 1296 – 1357 ) saw a large number of ecclesiastical buildings ruined , including Melrose and Jedburgh Abbeys . Church building was largely confined to the parish churches in the relatively secure areas like Fife , as at St. <unk> , originally a church of the Dominican friars . 
 In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland . French master @-@ mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey , both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture . Compared with after the Reformation , the interiors of churches were often elaborate , with highly decorated sacrament houses , like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell . The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel , depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins , were created in the mid @-@ fifteenth century . They are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style . Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments , like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas . 
 = = = Renaissance = = = 
 The impact of the Renaissance on ecclesiastical architecture can be seen in the re @-@ adoption of low @-@ massive church building with round arches and pillars , in contrast to the perpendicular Gothic style that was particularly dominant in England in the late Medieval era . The adoption of the low @-@ massive style may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands , and was perhaps a conscious reaction against English forms in favour of continental ones . It can be seen in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral , begun in 1406 , the facade of St Mary 's , Haddington from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone 's Kings College , Aberdeen ( 1500 – 09 ) . About forty collegiate churches were established in Scotland in late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries . Many , like Trinity College , Edinburgh , showed a combination of Gothic and Renaissance styles . The early sixteenth century saw crown steeples built on churches with royal connections , symbolising imperial monarchy , as at St. Giles Cathedral , Edinburgh . 
 = = Early modern era = = 
 = = = Reformation = = = 
 From about 1560 , the Reformation revolutionised church architecture in Scotland . Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship . With no need for elaborate buildings divided up by ritual there was widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings , ornaments and decoration . There was a need to adapt old buildings and build new churches suitable for reformed services , particularly by putting the pulpit and preaching at the centre of worship . 
 Many of the earliest buildings were simple gabled rectangles , a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century . Examples include Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s , Greenock ( 1591 ) and Durness ( 1619 ) , These new buildings often had windows on the south wall and none on the north , which became a unique feature of Reformation kirks . There were continuities with pre @-@ Reformation materials , with some churches using rubble , as at Kemback in Fife ( 1582 ) . Others employed stone and a few added wooden steeples , as at Burntisland ( 1592 ) . The church of Greyfriars , Edinburgh , built between 1602 and 1620 , used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form , but that at Dirleton ( 1612 ) , had a more sophisticated classical style . 
 A variation of the rectangular church that developed in post @-@ Reformation Scotland was the " T " -shaped plan , often used when adapting existing churches , which allowed the maximum number of parishioners to be near the pulpit . They can be seen at Kemback and Prestonpans after 1595 . It continued to be used into the seventeenth century as at Weem ( 1600 ) , Anstruther Easter , Fife ( 1634 – 44 ) and New Cumnock ( 1657 ) . In the seventeenth century a Greek cross plan was used for churches such as Cawdor ( 1619 ) and Fenwick ( 1643 ) . In most of these cases one arm of the cross would have been closed off as a laird 's aisle , meaning that they were in effect " T " -plan churches . Larger churches often had a steeple , as at Tron Kirk , Edinburgh ( 1636 – 47 ) . 
 = = = Restoration = = = 
 By the later seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and episcopalian wings of the church had adopted the modestly sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation . Most had a centralised plan with two or three arms , in a rectangular or T @-@ planned arrangement . Steeples continued to be a major feature , either centrally on the long axis , or on an end gable , in as had been the case in pre @-@ Reformation churches . As a result , there was little of the baroque extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England . Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era . Lauder Church was built by Sir William Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale , who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity , but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches . The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns , including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance . The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of James Smith , who had become a Jesuit in his youth . These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687 , which was outfitted in an elaborate style . In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh , in Greyfriars Kirkyard , a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro , designed by Donato Bramante ( 1444 – 1514 ) . The Latin Cross form , increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism , was also used , as in Smith 's Canongate Kirk ( 1688 – 90 ) , but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689 – 90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was blocked up , making it , in effect , a T @-@ plan . 
 = = = Eighteenth @-@ century Neo @-@ Classicism = = = 
 In the eighteenth century established patterns continued , with T @-@ shaped churches with steeples on the long side , as at New Church , Dumfries ( 1724 – 27 ) , and Newbattle Parish Church ( 1727 – 29 ) . William Adam 's Hamilton Parish Church ( 1729 – 32 ) , was a Greek cross plan inscribed in a circle , while John Douglas 's Killin Church ( 1744 ) was octagonal . Scots @-@ born architect James Gibbs was highly influential on British ecclesiastical architecture . He introduced a consciously antique style in his rebuilding of St Martin @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Fields , London , with a massive , steepled portico and rectangular , side @-@ aisled plan . Similar patterns in Scotland can be seen at St Andrew 's in the Square ( 1737 – 59 ) , designed by Allan Dreghorn and built by the master mason Mungo Nasmyth , and at the smaller <unk> Chapel ( completed 1731 ) , designed by Alexander McGill . Gibbs ' own design for St. Nicholas West , Aberdeen ( 1752 – 55 ) , had the same rectangular plan , with a nave @-@ and @-@ aisles , barrel @-@ vaulted layout with superimposed pedimented front . After the Toleration Act of 1712 , episcopalians began building a limited number of new chapels including Alexander Jaffray 's St Paul 's chapel in Aberdeen ( 1721 ) , the meeting house designed by McGill in Montrose , an Edinburgh chapel opened in 1722 and St Andrew 's @-@ by @-@ the @-@ Green in Glasgow ( 1750 – 52 ) , which adopted a simpler version of Gibbs ' pedimented rectangular plan . 
 In the second half of the eighteenth century , Scotland 's rapidly expanding economy and population resulted in the laying out of numerous new towns and remodelled settlements , resulting in a need for new churches to support the local residents . These included St Andrew 's and St George 's West Church , George Street , in the New Town of Edinburgh , designed by Andrew Frazer ( 1782 – 87 ) , followed in the tradition of Gibbs , with an oval plan , tetrastyle Corinthian portico and a tall steeple . The builder , Alexander Stevens , probably also designed the steeple of St Cuthbert 's Church ( 1789 – 90 ) . At <unk> , from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a grid plan , with a central square focused on <unk> Church ( 1795 – 97 ) , still following in the tradition of Gibbs , with a tetrastyle portico and steeple . 
 = = Nineteenth century = = 
 = = = Neo @-@ <unk> decline = = = 
 In the early nineteenth century the Gibbs @-@ influenced steepled tradition continued , as can be seen in Robert Nisbet 's Inveresk Church ( 1803 – 10 ) . A Grecian form was developed at William Burn 's North Leith Church ( 1813 ) and St John 's Episcopal Church , Edinburgh ( 1816 ) . The controversy over the style of the Scottish National Monument in 1816 led to the labelling of Greek temple motifs as " pagan " and relatively few columnar Greek churches were built after that in the capital . An exception was Archibald Elliot 's Broughton Church ( 1820 – 21 ) , which had a Doric temple front . More common in Edinburgh were churches that combined classical elements with other features , like the domed St George 's , Charlotte Square ( 1811 – 14 ) , executed by Robert Reid , or the <unk> @-@ Baroque of William Playfair 's St Stephen 's ( 1827 – 28 ) . In Glasgow there was a tradition of grafting porticoes on to existing meeting @-@ houses , which continued in Gillespie Graham 's West George Street Independent Church ( 1818 ) , which was criticised as " popish " , and John Baird I 's Greyfriars United Secession Church ( 1821 ) , which was fronted by a Roman Doric portico . Classical designs for the established Church included the redevelopment by William Stark of St George 's @-@ Tron Church ( 1807 – 08 ) , David Hamilton 's St Enoch 's Parish Church ( 1827 ) and St Paul 's Parish Church ( 1835 ) . 
 = = = Gothic revival = = = 
 As elsewhere in Western Europe , in the nineteenth century there was a return to Medieval styles , grouped together into a Gothic revival . Early examples included Adams ' St George 's Episcopal Chapel in Edinburgh ( 1792 ) , which included octagonal lantern on ogival arches . Other examples included James Playfair 's chapel @-@ like Farnell Church ( c . 1789 ) and Richard Crichton 's towered Craig Parish Church ( 1799 ) . In the early nineteenth century examples influenced by the English Perpendicular included Glenorchy Church ( 1810 – 11 ) , built by the Earl of Breadalbane , John Paterson 's octagonal reconstruction of St Paul 's Church , Perth ( c . 1800 – 07 ) and <unk> Church , Stonehaven ( 1810 – 12 ) . Examples of a more explicitly perpendicular form can be seen in Gillespie Graham 's <unk> ( 1813 ) , or David Hamilton 's Old Erskine ( 1813 – 14 ) . 
 As urban populations grew , major neo @-@ Gothic churches were built to accommodate them . After the passing of the Catholic Relief Act , James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew 's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow ( 1814 – 17 ) . There was also growth in the Episcopal Church , which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers . In Edinburgh these were modelled on the English Perpendicular , as at St Paul 's York Place ( 1816 – 18 ) , the towered St John 's Chapel ( 1816 – 18 ) and St David 's ( Ramshorn ) ( 1824 – 26 ) . In Glasgow , the Ramshorn Kirk 's has a T @-@ plan and symmetrical front with tall tower . 
 The Kirk began to concern itself with providing churches in the new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands , establishing a church extension committee in 1828 . Led by Thomas Chalmers , by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches , largely through public subscription . When the Great Disruption occurred in 1843 , and roughly a third of ministers and their congregations left the established church and its buildings to form the Free Church of Scotland , Chalmers ' organisational skills helped the Free Church build over 700 new places of worship by 1847 . The established church took time to recover , but embarked on a rival programme of church building , increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1 @,@ 437 by 1909 . The intense competition between different denominations led to the creation of grand churches with tall steeples and ultimately resulted in an oversupply of churches , which would be a financial burden to future generations . 
 The intense competition for congregations also led to changes to make worship more attractive that were reflected in architecture . The Church of Scotland was among the first European Protestant churches to engage in liturgical innovation reflected in seating arrangements , abandoning box pews for open benches . From the middle of the nineteenth century some of its churches , like Greyfriars in Edinburgh , began installing organs and stained glass windows , reflecting an attempt to return to forms of worship largely excluded since the late seventeenth century . At Duns the church was rebuilt ( opened 1888 ) in a plan used in the Middle Ages , with a separate chancel , communion table at the far end , and the pulpit under the chancel arch . The influence of the ecclesiological movement can be seen in churches built at <unk> ( opened 1893 ) , which had an apsidal chancel raised above the level of the nave , a stone pulpit and a brass lectern , and St. Cuthbert 's , Edinburgh ( rebuilt 1894 ) , with a marble communion table in a chancel decorated with marble and mosaic . 
 A sub @-@ set of the Medieval revival were Neo @-@ romanesque churches , often called " Norman " at the time , built in a style that incorporated Romanesque , Byzantine and Anglo @-@ Saxon features within a low @-@ massive framework . These were utilised by all the major denominations . Examples include the Church of Scotland buildings at Errol ( 1831 – 33 ) ; the Catholic St. Anthony 's Chapel , <unk> ( 1845 ) ; <unk> Free Church , <unk> ( 1845 ) ; and the Episcopalian St. Thomas , Rutland Place , Edinburgh ( 1842 – 43 ) . Later nineteenth @-@ century examples included the church at <unk> ( 1873 ) , and St. Ninian 's , Cathcart Road ( 1888 ) , Glasgow , both designed by W. G. Rowan . 
 The Gothic style developed fully in the later nineteenth century . Important figures included Frederick Thomas Pilkington ( 1832 – 98 ) , who adapted the Gothic style for the needs of the Free Church of Scotland , as at Barclay Viewforth Church , Edinburgh ( 1862 – 64 ) . Robert Rowand Anderson ( 1834 – 1921 ) , trained in the office of leading Gothic Architect George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh , where he worked on many small churches , including St James the Less in Leith , Christ Church , Falkirk ( 1862 ) and the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh ( 1876 ) . He also supervised the renovation of Dunblane ( 1890 – 93 ) and Paisley Abbey ( 1898 – 1907 ) . Alexander ' Greek ' Thomson ( 1817 – 75 ) , working mainly in Glasgow , began in the Gothic style , but soon turned toward the ancient Greeks and Egyptians for inspiration , as can be seen in the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church ( 1856 ) . Scotland 's most influential architect of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century , Charles Rennie MacKintosh , designed a number of churches , but only one , Queen 's Cross Free Church , Glasgow ( 1898 – 99 ) was built . It avoided the characteristic steeple of Glasgow churches in favour of a wide tower , and has a simple , elegant , rectangular structure with a single aisle . 
 = = Twentieth century = = 
 = = = Neo @-@ Romanesque = = = 
 In the first half of the twentieth century , there continued to be isolated examples of Gothic church building , including L. G. Thomson 's Reid Memorial Church , Edinburgh ( 1929 – 33 ) and J. Taylor Thomson 's St John <unk> Church , Glasgow ( 1927 – 31 ) . The most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo @-@ Romanesque buildings . Protestant examples included H. O. Tarbolton 's Bangour Village Church ( 1924 – 30 ) and L. G. Thomson 's <unk> Church ( 1937 ) . Roman Catholic examples included Reginald Fairlie 's Immaculate Conception Church , Fort William ( 1933 – 34 ) , and Archibald Macpherson 's St Matthew , Rosewell ( completed 1926 ) . 
 The reunification of the Church of Scotland in 1929 removed much of the need for new Presbyterian church @-@ building , which was replaced by a tendency towards renovating nineteenth @-@ century churches , toning @-@ down ritualistic furnishings ; replacing dark varnish by white or neutral colour schemes . The main tendency in church design in the 1930s was a move towards classicism . There were isolated large classical Protestant commissions , such as Bristo Baptist Church , Edinburgh ( 1933 – 35 ) , but the major buildings in this form were in the Catholic Church where there was a movement towards worshipper @-@ centred basilican plans , after the pontificate of Pius X ( 1903 – 14 ) . This movement reached its peak in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council . The leading figure in pursuing this style was Giacomo Antonio ( Jack ) Coia , who after the deaths of his partners , was the sole heir to the Glasgow @-@ based practice of Gillespie , Kidd & Coia . From the later 1920s he pursued a brick style of Catholic architecture , pioneered by Macpherson in Edinburgh and combined with the classical tendencies of Fairlie 's refacing of St Patrick 's , Cowgate ( 1928 – 29 ) . Coia 's first church , St Anne 's , Dennistoun ( 1931 ) , utilised the engineering techniques of Beaux @-@ Arts architecture , resulting in a broad , centralised space , with narrow arcades rather than aisles , with a monumental facade of red @-@ brick . He used a more linear plan in subsequent designs , including St Patrick , Greenock ( 1934 – 35 ) , St Columba , Maryhill ( 1937 ) , and St <unk> , Rutherglen ( 1934 – 40 ) . The early Christian and Byzantine character of the most striking of these , St Patrick 's , was enhanced by carvings by Archibald Dawson . Coia 's use of selective details was probably indebted to Mackintosh . Later in the decade Coia took into partnership T. <unk> Kennedy . Kennedy 's temporary , open @-@ roofed Catholic chapel at the Empire Exhibition ( 1938 ) was fronted by a Mackintosh @-@ like grid of metalwork , and with his St Peter in Chains Church , Ardrossan ( 1938 ) , with austere walls and towers , showed the influence of the " abstract compositions " of contemporary Swedish architecture and pointed to the future influence of modernism . 
 = = = Modernism and Post @-@ Modernism = = = 
 After the Second World War , there was another period of rapid church building , as the creation of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches . The austerity , shortage of materials and need for rapid building , discouraged the development of innovative design . This was accompanied by the rejection by most architects of traditional forms in favour of " international modernism " , characterised by simple outlines , uncluttered internal spaces , absence of colour , and flat roofs . 
 The Catholic Church , whose traditional membership was most affected by the changes in housing , was the first to react to this situation , creating 76 new parishes between 1845 and 1960 in the west of the country alone . The Baptist and Episcopalian churches followed close behind , particularly in the new towns . Within the Church of Scotland , the closeness of congregation and clergy was expressed in the domestic plainness of 1950s duel @-@ use hall churches , as at <unk> 's <unk> Parish Church , Cumbernauld ( completed 1962 ) , a steel framed building , clad in timber and brick with a flat roof . Of 129 buildings erected by the Church of Scotland between 1948 and 1959 , 108 were on this basic pattern . 
 The influence of more radical Expressionism and Modernism can be seen in buildings such as Basil Spence 's <unk> Crematorium , Edinburgh ( 1964 – 67 ) , with a series of irregular chapels , with smooth @-@ faced <unk> and Wheeler & Sproson 's <unk> Church , Bathgate ( 1965 ) , influenced by Beaux @-@ Arts architecture . The pioneering contribution from the Church of Scotland was St. Columbia 's , Glenrothes ( 1960 ) , which had seating for the congregation on three sides of a central platform , with the choir and elders on the fourth side behind the pulpit . 
 In the Roman Catholic Church , the most important steps towards an expressionist design were under taken by Gillespie , Kidd & Coia . This began with St Paul 's Church in the new town of Glenrothes ( 1956 – 57 ) . This was a wedge @-@ shaped construction of white @-@ painted common brick focused on a dramatic , jagged metal cross by the sculptor Benno <unk> . From about 1960 , all Gillespie , Kidd & Coia 's churches were designed in this Late Modernist style , as at St Bride 's , East Kilbride ( 1963 – 64 ) , which had a rectangular plan . From the mid @-@ 1960s , they adopted a centralised , non @-@ rectangular plan , with seating ranged round the altar , reflecting liturgical change . Sacred Heart Church , Cumbernauld ( 1964 ) , was rectangular , of load @-@ bearing brick , dramatically lit through dark coloured windows . Our Lady of Good Counsel , Dennistoun ( 1965 ) had a splayed plan and slanted ceiling . St Benedict Drumchapel ( 1965 – 67 ) had a prow @-@ like roof on curved , laminated timbers . These innovative designs inspired others to experiment , including J. McCarron 's Our Lady of Sorrows , South Uist ( 1964 – 65 ) . However , many of these designs proved too radical and were later demolished by the Catholic Church , citing structural or maintenance problems . 
 The end of this phase of church @-@ building , as the production of new housing subsided in the 1970s , saw a return to conservatism in church design , which may have reflected a loss of confidence in the churches as attendances rapidly declined . M. Glendinning , R. MacInnes and A. <unk> have identified a " post @-@ Coia " style emerging in this period . The limited building , some replacing existing churches , tended to be by building companies using laminated timber beams , exposed brickwork and pyramidal roofs to produce utilitarian , if aesthetically unadventurous , constructions . From the late 1980s there were some original designs , including St Mary the Virgin , in Port Glasgow ( 1984 ) by Frank Burnet , Bell and Partners ; St Anthony 's Catholic church in <unk> ( 1987 ) , by James F. Stephen Architects ; and the replacement church at St Joseph 's Catholic Church , <unk> ( 1997 ) by Jacobsen and French . There was also the postmodern design of St John <unk> Catholic Church , Irvine ( 1982 ) , and the nearby Girdle Toll parish church , converted from a farmhouse ( 1992 ) . 
 = Arbroath = 
 Arbroath or Aberbrothock / <unk> / ( Scottish Gaelic : <unk> <unk> , [ <unk> ] ) is a former royal burgh and the largest town in the council area of Angus in Scotland , and has a population of 23 @,@ 902 . It lies on the North Sea coast , around 16 miles ( 25 @.@ 7 km ) ENE of Dundee and 45 miles ( 72 @.@ 4 km ) SSW of Aberdeen . 
 While there is evidence for settlement of the area now occupied by the town that dates back to the Iron Age , Arbroath 's history as a town begins in the High Middle Ages with the founding of Arbroath Abbey in 1178 . Arbroath grew considerably during the Industrial Revolution owing to the expansion of firstly the flax and secondly the jute industries and the engineering sector . A new harbour was built in 1839 and by the 20th century , Arbroath had become one of the larger fishing ports in Scotland . 
 The town is notable as the home of the Declaration of Arbroath , as well as the Arbroath <unk> . The town 's football team , Arbroath F.C. , hold the world record for the highest number of goals scored in a professional football match . They won 36 @-@ 0 against Aberdeen Bon Accord in the Scottish Cup in 1885 .

 The earliest recorded name for the town was ' Aberbrothock ' , a reference to the <unk> Burn which runs through the town , the prefix ' Aber ' coming either from the Gaelic ' <unk> ' , or the earlier term ' Aber ' which could be either Goidelic or Brythonic for ' river mouth ' . The name ' Aberbrothock ' can be found in numerous spelling variations . In the earliest manuscripts available , it is seen as ' <unk> ' ( in the letter to Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury , which agreed that the Queen regnant , Margaret , Maid of Norway would marry Edward I ) and ' <unk> ' ( in the subsequent letter giving consent for the marriage ) . In the Declaration of Arbroath , it is seen as ' <unk> ' . Early maps show a number of variants including Aberbrothock , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 The modern name ' Arbroath ' became more common in the mid @-@ 19th century , with the older name being largely dispensed with by the time of the first edition of the Ordnance Survey Maps . However , variants of ' Arbroath ' had been used since the 17th century , including ' <unk> ' and <unk> .

 The area around Arbroath has been occupied since at least the Neolithic period . Material taken from postholes from an enclosure at <unk> , near Friockheim , about five miles north of Arbroath have been radiocarbon dated to around 3500 BC The function of the enclosure is unknown , but may have been for agriculture or for ceremonial purposes . 
 Bronze age archaeology is to be found in abundance in the surrounding area . Examples include the short @-@ cist burials found near West Newbigging , about a mile to the North of the town . These burials included pottery urns , a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet . Iron Age archaeology is also well represented , for example in the souterrain nearby <unk> cemetery and at West Grange of Conan , as well as the better @-@ known examples at <unk> and Ardestie . 
 The area appears to have been of some importance in the early Christian period , as evidenced by the Pictish stone carvings found during the restoration of St Vigeans church , and now housed in the small museum there . The stones had been used in the building of the old church and , unfortunately , many been badly damaged . One of the stones , the 9th century <unk> Stone , has the distinction of being one of the few Pictish artefacts to have an inscription in Latin text : ' <unk> : <unk> [ E ] <unk> <unk> ' , which has been interpreted in various ways , but it is thought that the second line refers to the Pictish King <unk> , who reigned between 839 and 842 AD . 
 = = = Medieval history = = = 
 The first modern development in Arbroath was the Abbey , founded by King William the Lion in 1178 for monks of the Tironensian order from Kelso Abbey . It received consecration in 1197 with a dedication to Saint Thomas Becket . It was the King 's only personal foundation , and he was buried within its precincts in 1214 . The Abbey was not finally completed until 1233 . 
 Arbroath was the location of the Battle of Arbroath in 1446 . A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath , Alexander Lindsay , third Earl of Crawford , and Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop 's lands and burning his properties . Lindsay was excommunicated for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary . The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of <unk> as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town , leaving 500 dead , including Lindsay and Ogilvy . Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family . 
 The Abbey relatively quickly fell into disuse and eventual disrepair after its dissolution at the Reformation , the lead from the roof rumoured to have been used in the 16th century civil wars and the stonework plundered for housebuilding throughout the town . The ruins were a popular site for travellers during the 17th and 18th centuries , and finally in 1815 the remains were taken into the care of the State for preservation . The remains are now administered by Historic Scotland . 
 On 6 April 1320 the Scottish Parliament met at Arbroath Abbey and addressed to the Pope the Declaration of Arbroath , drafted by the Abbot of the time , Bernard . This document detailed the services which their " lord and sovereign " Robert the Bruce had rendered to Scotland , and affirmed in eloquent terms the independence of the Scots . 
 Arbroath was created a royal burgh in 1599 by James VI . 
 In the 17th century , at the church of St Vigeans , near Arbroath , communion was not held for several years because the villagers believed there was a curse on the church . The curse said that if communion were held then the church would fall in to a large subterranean lake . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 During the Jacobite rising known as the Forty @-@ Five , Arbroath was a Jacobite town . A large portion of its able bodied men joined the Jacobite army . It was one of the principal ports where men and supplies could be landed from France . It and other Jacobite ports along the north @-@ east coast collectively formed ‘ an asset of almost incalculable value ’ to the Jacobite cause . 
 During the industrial revolution , Arbroath 's economy expanded and the population of the town expanded , with new housing having to be constructed to house the influx of workers . Arbroath became moderately well known for jute and sailcloth production , with 34 mills employing 1400 looms and producing over one million yards of <unk> cloth and 450 @,@ 000 yards of sailcloth in 1875 . Arbroath is believed to be the source of the sails used on the Cutty Sark . In 1867 , the mills in Arbroath employed 4620 people . Arbroath was also prominent in the manufacture of shoes and lawnmowers ; local firm Alexander Shanks supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club . 
 Arbroath today is mostly known for its connection with the Scottish fishing industry . After the original harbours , dating from the 14th and 18th centuries , were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour , the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered . The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield , including Shetland . The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980 , around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath , with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen , hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish . Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present . Today , Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port , and although no fish auction takes place , the <unk> remains open and is used for landing shellfish . There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath , and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north . The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however , but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen , Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland , Norway and Ireland .

 Arbroath was made a royal burgh in 1178 by King William the Lion at the same time as the Abbey was established . The burgh of regality permitted the monks to hold a weekly market , dispense basic justice and to establish a harbour . In 1559 , the town 's burgh of regality was reconfirmed in 1559 by King James VI of Scotland . A provost and a town council were appointed and it was at this point Aberbrothock became a fully fledged royal burgh . 
 In 1922 , Lord Inchcape became burgess of the town . To commemorate the occasion he was presented with his ticket to the office in a silver casket engraved with the burgh coat @-@ of @-@ arms and views of the locality . 
 Arbroath was controlled by Arbroath Town Council from the time of King James VI through to 1975 , when Arbroath ( and the county of Angus ) were amalgamated with the counties of Perthshire and Dundee City into Tayside , under the control of Tayside Regional Council .

 Arbroath 's prospects originally revolved around the harbour . The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy , the abbot in 1394 AD . This gave way to a more commodious port in 1725 , which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839 , when the sea wall , quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour , at a cost of £ 58 @,@ 000 . Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846 , there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels , totalling 9100 gross tons . In the same year , 599 vessels docked at Arbroath , 56 from foreign ports ( mainly Baltic ports ) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade . Bark , flax , hemp , hides , oak , and fir timber , and guano for manure , groceries from London , and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath , with manufactured goods ( mainly sailcloth ) exported via Arbroath . 
 Driven by the needs of the fishing and commercial sailing industry , in 1795 Arbroath @-@ based sail maker Francis Webster Ltd had perfected the art of adding Linseed oil to flax sails , creating an oiled flax . This developed in the late @-@ 19th century into waxed cotton , which drove Arbroath as a manufacturing centre , until the early 1970s manufacturing began to decline . A major employer , Keith & Blackman , closed in 1985 and Giddings and Lewis @-@ Fraser wound down its operations at about the same time , with the entire plant eventually demolished to make way for a Safeway ( now Morrisons ) supermarket .
