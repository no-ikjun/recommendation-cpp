 Major League Soccer began to demonstrate positive signs of long @-@ term profitability as early as 2004 with the single @-@ entity ownership structure , salary cap , and the media and marketing umbrella Soccer United Marketing ( SUM ) all contributing towards MLS 's financial security . As soccer @-@ specific stadiums are built , ownership expands , and television coverage increases , MLS has seen its revenues increase while controlling costs . 
 Television coverage and revenue have increased since the league 's early years . In 2006 , MLS reached an 8 @-@ year TV deal with ESPN spanning the 2007 – 2014 seasons , and marked the first time that MLS earned rights fees , reported to be worth $ 7 – 8 million annually . In September 2012 the league extended its distribution agreement with London @-@ based Media rights agency MP & Silva until 2014 in a deal worth $ 10 million annually . Total league TV revenues are over $ 40 million annually . In 2011 , MLS earned $ 150 million when it sold a 25 % stake in SUM . 
 In early 2005 , MLS signed a 10 @-@ year , $ 150 million sponsorship deal with Adidas . In 2007 , MLS teams started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league @-@ wide sponsorship partners who had already been advertising on the back of club jerseys , following the practice of international sport , specifically soccer . MLS established a floor of $ 500 @,@ 000 per shirt sponsorship , with the league receiving a flat fee of $ 200 @,@ 000 per deal . As of July 2014 , sixteen teams had signed sponsorship deals to have company logos placed on the front of their jerseys ( and another team is directly owned by its shirt sponsor ) , and the league average from jersey sponsors was about $ 2 @.@ 4 million . As of February 2016 , all teams in MLS have jersey sponsors . 
 The Los Angeles Galaxy made a profit in 2003 in their first season at The Home Depot Center , and FC Dallas turned a profit after moving into Pizza Hut Park in 2005 . For each season between 2006 – 2009 , two to three MLS clubs ( generally clubs with a soccer @-@ specific stadium ) were reported as profitable by the league . 
 By 2012 , the league had shown a marked improvement in its financial health . In November 2013 , Forbes published its first valuation of MLS teams since 2008 , and revealed that ten of the league 's nineteen teams earned an operating profit in 2012 , while two broke even and seven had a loss . Forbes estimated that the league 's collective annual revenues were $ 494 million , and that the league 's collective annual profit was $ 34 million . Forbes valued the league 's franchises to be worth $ 103 million on average , almost three times as much as the $ 37 million average valuation in 2008 . The Seattle Sounders FC franchise was named the most valuable at $ 175 million , a 483 % gain over the $ 30 million league entrance fee it paid in 2009 . 
 The trend in increased team values has continued with MLS teams seeing a strong 52 % increase in franchise values from 2012 to 2014 . In August 2015 , Forbes released the updated list of MLS franchise values with the most profitable team weighing in at $ 245 million and the least at $ 105 million . The average value jumped from $ 103 to $ 157 million .

 D.C. United and Miami Fusion F.C. were the only two MLS teams to adopt European naming conventions during the 1990s .

 = Tropical Storm Lucille = 
 Tropical Storm Lucille was the first tropical cyclone to have its name retired in the Western Pacific basin . Lucille was identified as a weak tropical depression on May 25 , 1960 , to the east of the Philippines . Tracking northwestward , the system failed to develop and warnings on it were discontinued on May 27 . At the same time , a second system began organizing along the west coast of Luzon . The two systems ultimately merged into one over the Philippines between May 28 and 29 . Now tracking northeastward , the system re @-@ intensified and became a tropical storm on May 30 . Lucille attained its peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . As it accelerated over open waters , the system brushed the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi @-@ jima before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on June 1 . The remnants of Lucille were last noted on June 4 near the International Date Line . 
 Between May 27 and 29 , heavy rains fell across much of Luzon as Lucille developed . These rains , amounting to 406 mm ( 16 in ) in the suburbs of Manila , triggered destructive floods that left some areas under 4 @.@ 6 m ( 15 ft ) of water . The worst of the floods took place during the overnight hours of May 28 to 29 . During that time , hundreds of homes were swept away and an estimated 300 – 500 people , including at least 80 children , were killed . Monetary losses from the floods exceeded $ 2 million . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On May 24 , 1960 , a possible area of low pressure was identified to the west of Koror in the Republic of Palau . Tracking generally to the northwest , the system gradually developed . Despite only having winds around 30 km / h ( 15 mph ) , it was classified as a tropical depression early the next day and assigned the name Lucille by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) . Around the same time , a second , less organized low pressure system developed off the west coast of Luzon , Philippines . That system remained almost stationary over the South China Sea as Lucille accelerated northwestward . Early on May 27 , the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression as it approached the Philippines . After degenerating , the remnants of Lucille moved over the Visayas . 
 Shortly after the JTWC issued their final advisory on Lucille , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began monitoring the system near Luzon as a tropical depression . By May 28 , radiosonde data from Clark Air Base in Luzon indicated that the second system acquired a closed circulation at the 500 mb level and began moving northeastward . While crossing the northern Philippines , the two systems merged and became a single cyclone , retaining the name Lucille . During its passage of the country , winds up to 63 km / h ( 39 mph ) were reported in Manila . Once back over open waters , the system intensified as it accelerated northeastward , attaining tropical storm intensity early on May 30 . 
 Tropical Storm Lucille attained its peak intensity late on May 30 with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) and an estimated barometric pressure of 985 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 09 inHg ) . At this time , the China Meteorological Administration assessed Lucille to have been a stronger system , attaining typhoon status with two @-@ minute sustained winds estimated at 125 km / h ( 78 mph ) . Around 1700 UTC on May 31 , the storm tracked approximately 65 km ( 40 mi ) west of Iwo Jima . Roughly five hours later , it moved within 15 km ( 10 mi ) of Chichi @-@ jima where a pressure of 992 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 30 inHg ) was measured . Sustained winds on Chichi @-@ jima reached 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) ; however , these were determined to be unrepresentative of Lucille 's actual intensity due to natural funneling on the island . On June 1 , the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it turned west @-@ northwestward and continued over open waters . The remnants of Lucille were last noted by the JMA on June 4 as it crossed the International Date Line . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Prior to transitioning into an extratropical cyclone , Lucille brushed the Japanese islands of Iwo Jima and Chichi @-@ jima . On the former , winds reached 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) while on the latter , gusts peaked at 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . The gusts on Chichi @-@ jima caused the USS Cayuga County to broach in the harbor . 
 Due to the significant loss of life caused by the storm , the name Lucille was retired . This marked the first time that a tropical cyclone in the Western Pacific had its name removed following its usage . For unknown reasons it was not replaced with any particular name , making it one of two storms in the basin to not have a replacement , although Lucy took the name 's place in 1962 . 
 = = = Philippines = = = 
 Across the northern Philippines , torrential rains associated with Lucille , the secondary low , and a subsequent southwesterly monsoon caused extensive flooding . The heaviest rains took place between May 27 and 28 , with conditions similar to a tropical storm occurring during the overnight hours . During a 24 @-@ hour span on May 27 , 218 mm ( 8 @.@ 6 in ) of rain fell in Manila . In surrounding areas , more than 406 mm ( 16 in ) of rain fell . Gale @-@ force winds toppled trees and billboards and brought down telephone lines . The city of Manila was brought to a virtual standstill as three quarters of the city became submerged in at least 0 @.@ 3 m ( 1 ft ) of water . Transportation was shut down and businesses were deserted the day after the floods . Taking place mainly in the suburban communities surrounding Manila , rivers over @-@ topped their banks and inundated " squatter " areas . The hardest @-@ hit areas were submerged in up to 4 @.@ 6 m ( 15 ft ) of water . Residents reported that homes were swept off their foundations by the water and were brought downstream . Others reported seeing bodies floating amid debris . In Tondo , floodwaters reaching 1 @.@ 8 m ( 6 ft ) deep killed at least seven people . Hundreds of homes were swept away in Manila , resulting in many deaths . Numerous homes were washed away in Quezon City . The heart of Manila was spared flooding as the river running through the city began to recede after nearly over @-@ topping the concrete dike surrounding it . 
 Throughout the Philippines , officials confirmed that 108 people , including 80 children , had been killed and a further 150 were missing by May 30 . Later reports on the storm stated that approximately 300 people lost their lives . Some news reports indicated that as many as 500 people may have been killed . Additionally , more than 20 @,@ 000 people were left homeless . Losses amounted to roughly $ 2 million . The floods were regarded as the nation 's worst since 1947 . The flooding caused by Lucille was also considered the worst ever in the country by some until September 2009 when Typhoon <unk> devastated Manila . 
 In the immediate aftermath of the floods , the entire Manila police force was mobilized to assist residents and begin relief operations . On May 29 , Quezon City mayor Norberto S. <unk> sent an emergency request to the Philippine Air Force to rescue people trapped on rooftops . 
 = Our Song ( Taylor Swift song ) = 
 " Our Song " is a country song performed by American singer @-@ songwriter Taylor Swift . The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman . It was released on September 9 , 2007 by Big Machine Records as the third single from Swift 's eponymous debut album , Taylor Swift ( 2006 ) . Swift solely composed " Our Song " for the talent show of her freshman year in high school , about a boyfriend who she did not have a song with . It was included on Taylor Swift as she recalled its popularity with her classmates . The uptempo track is musically driven mainly by banjo and lyrically describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song . 
 " Our Song " was met with acclaim from contemporary critics , some who deemed it one of Swift 's best singles , and commercial success . The song charted within the top 30 and top 20 on the Canadian Hot 100 and Billboard Hot 100 , respectively . In the United States , it became Swift 's first number one single on the Hot Country Songs Chart , maintaining the position for six consecutive weeks , and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .

The video won both nominations for " Video of the Year " and " Female Video of the Year " at the 2008 CMT Music Awards . Swift has performed the song at an abundance of venues , some while supporting as opening act for various country artists ' concert tours . She also performed it as part of the Fearless Tour ( 2009 – 10 ) , her first headlining tour .

 Swift self @-@ penned " Our Song " for the talent show of her freshman year in high school with no intentions of including it on her debut album . She thought to herself that to be appropriate for the talent show , the song she would write needed to be upbeat and relatable to her classmates . " I wrote it about this guy I was dating , and how we didn 't have a song . So I went ahead and wrote us one " , she said . The writing process , as with her lead single " Tim McGraw " , took place in approximately 20 minutes . Several months after performing it at the talent show , some of her peers approached her to inform her that they enjoyed the song she played at the talent show , singing a few lines . " They 'd only heard it once , so I thought , ' There must be something here ! ' " , Swift recalled . When choosing tracks to record for Taylor Swift , Swift " stood by " " Our Song " , repeatedly insisting album producers to record it with her . She claimed she " knew there was something about it . " She concluded , " I think there 's just some sort of magic in the way the track sounds like it 's bouncing . " Swift said she desired for the song to be placed as the closing track on Taylor Swift due to its last lyrics repeating the phrase " Play it again " , which she thought would subliminally request audiences to replay the album . Big Machine Records executives chose " Our Song " to be the third single from Taylor Swift , which Swift was surprised yet glad about .

 = Polled Dorset = 
 The Polled Dorset is a breed of sheep developed for meat at the North Carolina State University Small <unk> Unit in 1956 . The name refers to the fact that it is a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed . The Polled Dorset is the result of a genetic mutation by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns . After some years of breeding work , a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic horns and which bred true . 
 Polled Dorsets are an all @-@ white , medium @-@ sized sheep , prolific and able to breed out of season . The carcases are muscular with good conformation and the adults produce a thick fleece , which is free from dark fibers . Since its development , the number of Polled Dorsets registered in the United States has grown to exceed the number of Horned Dorsets . Without horns the sheep are easier to handle and there is much less risk of the rams hurting themselves or others by butting . The Polled Dorset is sometimes confused with the Australian Poll Dorset , but that breed did not start as a genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset breeding program . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1949 , four hornless lambs were sired from a Horned Dorset on a farm at North Carolina State University in Raleigh , North Carolina . Over the next five years , as part of their normal breeding program , those four ewes and the other ewes on the farm were bred to the Horned Dorset . Eventually , a ewe gave birth to twin rams . NCSU 401 was a regular horned Dorset , but his brother , " NCSU 402 " , was born polled , without horns , due to a genetic mutation . Thus , the Polled Dorset was born . NCSU 402 was the official name given to the first true Polled Dorset sheep . It was named in accordance with the naming system that has been used at the NCSU Small <unk> Unit since it started its breeding program . 
 After research and testing were done to confirm that the Polled Dorset carried the same characteristics as the Horned Dorset and was able to pass on these traits , the Continental Dorset Club , formed in 1898 , registered the very first Polled Dorset sheep in 1956 . Livestock scientists , the late Dr. Lemuel Goode and the late Sam Buchanan , are credited with identifying and developing the hornless sheep . The offspring of NCSU 402 were bought by other breeders and within twenty years , seventy percent of all registered Dorsets were polled . The success of the Polled Dorset has made it considered to be the second most popular sheep breed in the United States . A polled strain of Dorsets were also developed in Australia in the 1900s , however , these were not as a result of a genetic mutation but resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset Horn . 
 = = Conformation = = 
 Polled Dorsets are a medium @-@ sized sheep that are long lived and prolific , heavy milkers . They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses . Their fleece is very white , strong , close , free from dark fiber and extends down the legs . When shorn , fleece averages between five and nine pounds ( 2 @.@ 23 to 4 kg ) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used . The staple length ranges from 2 @.@ 5 to 4 inches ( 6 to 10 cm ) with a numeric count of 46 's @-@ 58 's . The fiber diameter ranges from 27 @.@ 0 to 33 @.@ 0 microns . At maturity , ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds ( 67 to 91 kg ) , some weighing more in show condition . Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds ( 102 to 125 kg ) . Dorsets are noted for their ability to be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out @-@ of @-@ season breeding . They are one of the few breeds that have this characteristic . Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations , including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter . These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes . 
 Since the breed first became commercial , it has spread to Canada and become a major contributor in the commercial lamb industry . The breed adapts well to confinement and is readily used in accelerated crossbreeding programs . Polled Dorsets thrive under grass @-@ based and <unk> conditions and are more suitable on small farms that are intensely managed . 
 = = Polled versus Horned Dorsets = = 
 The Dorset is an ancient breed that was most likely developed from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England . Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860 , and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891 . Today , the Dorset is found in two varieties globally , Horned and Polled . In the Horn variety , both ewes and rams have horns , while the polled variety have no horns at all . Polled Dorsets are ideal for commercial settings because they do not have horns that can get caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt . 
 Polled Dorsets are the most popular white @-@ faced breed in North America , while the much less @-@ common Dorset Horn is listed as " threatened " by The Livestock Conservancy in the United States . In essence , the difference between the two breeds is that one has horns and the other does not . 
 = Russian battleship Sissoi Veliky = 
 Sissoi Veliky ( Russian : <unk> <unk> ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1890s . The ship 's construction was marred by organizational , logistical and engineering problems and dragged on for more than five years . She was commissioned in October 1896 with an appalling number of design and construction faults , and only a few of them were fixed during her lifetime . Immediately after sea trials , Sissoi Veliky sailed to the Mediterranean to enforce the naval blockade of Crete during the Greco @-@ Turkish War . On March 15 [ O.S. March 3 ] , 1897 she suffered a devastating explosion of the aft gun turret that killed 21 men . After nine months in the docks of Toulon for repairs , the ship sailed to the Far East to reinforce the Russian presence there . In the summer of 1900 , Sissoi Veliky supported the international campaign against the Boxer Rebellion in China . Sailors from Sissoi Veliky and the battleship Navarin participated in the defence of the International <unk> in Beijing for more than two months . 
 In 1902 the ship returned to Kronstadt for repairs , but very little was achieved until the early losses of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 caused the formation of the Second Pacific Squadron to relieve the Russian forces blockaded in Port Arthur . Sissoi Veliky sailed for the Far East with the rest of the Baltic battleships and participated in the Battle of Tsushima on May 27 [ O.S. May 14 ] 1905 . She survived the daytime artillery duel with Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō 's ships , but was badly damaged and taking on water . During the night Japanese destroyers scored a torpedo hit on the ship that damaged her steering . The next morning the ship was unable to maintain speed because of flooding , and her crew surrendered to Japanese armed merchant cruisers . The ship capsized later that morning with the loss of 47 crewmen .

The man in charge of shipbuilding , Admiral Ivan Shestakov , saw little value in building uniform ship classes and regularly changed design and construction targets to match foreign novelties of the day . In 1885 the program was reduced to nine battleships ; the freed funds were reallocated to torpedo boats in response to German advances with these weapons . The first ten years of the 1881 program were marked by indecision , bureaucracy and a shortage of funds , and only two battleships were actually built ( Imperator Aleksandr II , Imperator Nikolai I , and one coastal defense ship Gangut ) . These were relatively small and slow ships , each with a single frontal barbette housing 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns ( in case of Gangut , a single gun ) . 
 The fourth ship ( the future Navarin ) was planned as an even cheaper and smaller ( 6 @,@ 400 long tons ( 6 @,@ 500 t ) ) ship . However , the superiority of the German Brandenburg @-@ class battleship compelled the Imperial Navy to lift cost and size constraints and build a large battleship with two main gun turrets . The Franco @-@ Russian Works hastily proposed a draft based on the British Trafalgar class . The Navy hesitated , and awarded the contract to the private company only after a push from Tsar Alexander III . Navarin , laid down in July 1889 and launched in 1891 , set the standard configuration for all Russian pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , but in 1890 , when the Navy discussed plans for the fifth battleship , the future was uncertain . The admirals were still discussing whether the Navy should concentrate on large battleships , smaller coastal defence ships or on the ocean @-@ going cruisers . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 In September 1890 the Naval Technical Committee ( MTK ) rolled out a proposal for a medium @-@ size ( 8 @,@ 500 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 8 @,@ 600 t ) , 331 @-@ foot ( 100 @.@ 9 m ) long ) battleship armed with three single 12 @-@ inch guns mounted in barbettes . Codenamed Gangut No. 2 , it attempted to blend the hull of Alexander II and the armament of Navarin in a tightly budgeted , compromised design . None of the admirals who reviewed the proposal was satisfied with it , and the MTK was overwhelmed with a flurry of contradicting suggestions . The four main guns were to be mounted in two barbettes covered with 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch @-@ thick ( 64 mm ) armoured cupolas . The choice of secondary armament caused another round of debate . The MTK initially proposed a combination of Russian Model 1877 6 @-@ inch guns and Armstrong 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns . Admirals Stepan Makarov and Vladimir Verkhovsky advised against the use of weapons of two different sizes ( as this caused problems with fire control and direction ) , and against using the obsolete 1877 guns . The MTK did just the opposite , dropping the modern Armstrong guns in favor of the 1877 model , probably as a result of not wanting to use foreign @-@ built weaponry . In March 1891 the MTK presented a revised proposal that increased displacement to 8 @,@ 880 long tons ( 9 @,@ 020 t ) and the main armament to four 12 @-@ inch guns that was accepted by Admiral <unk> . 
 The ship was 332 feet 6 inches ( 101 @.@ 3 m ) long at the waterline and 345 feet ( 105 @.@ 2 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 68 feet ( 20 @.@ 7 m ) and a draught of 25 feet 6 inches ( 7 @.@ 8 m ) . She displaced 10 @,@ 400 long tons ( 10 @,@ 600 t ) , over 1 @,@ 500 long tons ( 1 @,@ 500 t ) more than her designed displacement of 8 @,@ 880 long tons ( 9 @,@ 020 t ) . The ship had a partial double bottom and a centreline bulkhead separated the engine and boiler rooms . Sissoi Veliky 's crew initially consisted of 27 officers and 555 enlisted men , but grew to a total of 686 by 1905 . 
 Sissoi Veliky had two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one four @-@ bladed propeller . They had a total designed output of 8 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 300 kW ) using steam provided by 12 cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers . The ship 's designed speed was 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , but she reached a top speed of 15 @.@ 65 knots ( 28 @.@ 98 km / h ; 18 @.@ 01 mph ) during her sea trials on October 17 [ O.S. 5 October ] , despite 8 @,@ 635 ihp ( 6 @,@ 439 kW ) from her engines . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) of coal at full load that gave her a range of 4 @,@ 440 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 220 km ; 5 @,@ 110 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Like many Russian ships before and after it , <unk> Veliky was plagued by regular " improvements " of the original design that delayed construction for years . In the beginning of 1893 , over a year after construction began , the MTK again redesigned <unk> Veliky 's artillery . The two pairs of 12 @-@ inch 40 @-@ calibre guns were changed from barbette mountings to French @-@ style center @-@ pivot twin turrets . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 15 ° and the ship carried 80 rounds per gun for them . Their rate of fire was intended to be one round per 1 @.@ 5 minutes , but it was one shot per 2 @.@ 5 – 3 minutes in reality . They fired a 731 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 331 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 598 ft / s ( 792 m / s ) to a range of 12 @,@ 010 yards ( 10 @,@ 980 m ) at an elevation of 10 ° . 
 The secondary armament was replaced by six quick @-@ firing six @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) , 45 @-@ calibre , Canet guns that were mounted in casemates on the main deck . Each gun was provided with 200 rounds of ammunition . Alterations of the shell hoists to accommodate the larger rounds for the Canet guns began only in December 1895 . They fired shells that weighed 91 @.@ 27 lb ( 41 @.@ 40 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 790 m / s ) . The guns had a maximum range of 12 @,@ 600 yards ( 11 @,@ 500 m ) when fired at maximum elevation . 
 The ship 's anti @-@ torpedo boat armament was changed more than once and , in the end , consisted of twelve 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) and ten 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns . The 47 mm guns were mounted on the top of the superstructure and on the upper deck above the six @-@ inch casemates . They fired a 3 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 476 ft / s ( 450 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of 2 @,@ 020 yards ( 1 @,@ 850 m ) . The ten 37 mm guns were mounted in the fighting top . They fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 450 ft / s ( 440 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of 3 @,@ 038 yards ( 2 @,@ 778 m ) . Sissoi Veliky carried six above @-@ water 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , one each in the bow and stern and two on each broadside . The ship also could carry 50 mines . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The ship 's armour scheme was based on that of Navarin although it used nickel steel rather than the compound armour of the older ship . The maximum thickness of the waterline armour belt was 16 inches ( 406 mm ) over the machinery spaces which reduced to 12 inches abreast the magazines . It covered 227 feet ( 69 @.@ 2 m ) of the ship 's length and was 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 2 m ) high . It tapered to a thickness of 6 – 8 inches ( 152 – 203 mm ) at the bottom edge . The upper 3 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 0 m ) of the belt was intended to be above the waterline , but the ship was significantly overweight and the entire belt was submerged at normal load . The belt terminated in a 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) and 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) transverse bulkheads , fore and aft , respectively . 
 The casemate was above the belt , 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick on all sides , 152 feet ( 46 @.@ 3 m ) long and 7 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) high , and protected the six @-@ inch guns . The sides of the turrets were 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick and their roofs were 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick . Above the casemate , the bases of the turrets were protected by 10 inches of armour ; inside the casemate , only five inches of armour protected them . The conning tower 's sides were nine inches thick . The armour deck connected to the top of the waterline belt and was 2 @.@ 5 inches thick above the belt , but fore and aft of the belt it was 3 inches ( 76 mm ) thick . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The MTK rushed Gangut No. 2 into production and , contrary to established practice , ordered structural steel and armour before the project was properly authorized . Construction began on August 7 [ O.S. July 25 ] , 1891 in the wooden shed of the Franco @-@ Russian Works in Saint Petersburg . On January 3 1892 [ O.S. December 21 , 1891 ] she was officially named Sissoi Veliky to commemorate the victory in the Battle of <unk> which coincided with the day of St. <unk> the Great of Egypt in the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar . The ship was formally laid down on May 7 [ O.S. May 19 ] , 1892 . 
 The management of the construction was flawed from the start : the stem and <unk> , rudder frame , and propeller shaft brackets were not ordered in time , and the late discovery of this omission substantially delayed progress . Verkhovsky , having no time to place orders with reliable foreign suppliers , contracted the job to local plants already known for poor discipline and quality that were already loaded down with other Navy jobs . The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval rearmament that the government was willing to finance . In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full @-@ scale conflict between Verkhovsky and the board of the Alexandrovsky Steel Works , a ridiculous charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop . The savvy admiral always blamed the suppliers but did not even attempt to fix the disarray in his own office . 
 Nevertheless , in April 1894 the completed hull passed static pressure tests . It was launched June 2 [ O.S. May 20 ] , 1894 during a fleet review attended by Tsar Nicholas II . The commissioning of Sissoi Veliky was scheduled for September 1896 , but an examination in August revealed that the steering gear , water pumps , ventilation system and one of the turrets were still missing or defective . The builders hastily equipped the ship with rudder controls built for Poltava and delivered the ship for her sea trials on October 6 [ O.S. September 23 ] , 1896 . The Navy desperately needed Sissoi Veliky in the Mediterranean and she was commissioned regardless of her known faults . 
 = = Service = = 
 = = = Mediterranean = = = 
 Immediately after the trials Sissoi Veliky was ordered to join the Mediterranean Squadron which was engaged in the naval blockade of Crete in the wake of the 1896 Cretan riots and the Hamidian massacres . Her maiden voyage revealed more problems ; the lack of ventilation in the steering compartment was so appalling that during the first port call the captain purchased electric fans with his own money and the electrical systems failed one by one before reaching Gibraltar . The copper rings for sealing the portholes were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897 . 
 On December 27 [ O.S. December 14 ] , 1896 the leaking Sissoi Veliky reached Algiers . The captain planned to stay there for at least 20 days to complete the most urgent repairs , but five days later a telegram from Saint Petersburg forced him to leave for Piraeus . There the crew managed to seal the seams between the armour plates and repair the electrical systems . In February 1897 Sissoi Veliky steamed for Crete and she had her first gunnery exercise ten miles off the shore of Souda Bay , Crete at the end of the month . The second exercise , held on March 15 [ O.S. March 3 ] , ended in disaster when the rear turret exploded after an hour of target practice . The explosion blew the roof of the turret over the mainmast so that it struck the base of the foremast , crushing one 37 mm gun and a steam cutter . The explosion killed 16 men and wounded another 15 ; 6 of these later died of their wounds . The badly damaged Sissoi Veliky headed to Toulon for repairs . 
 Investigation revealed both mechanical and organizational causes of the accident . The chain of events , as it was reconstructed in Toulon , started with a failure of the hydraulic breech @-@ locking mechanism of the left @-@ hand gun . The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation . The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right @-@ hand gun firing unlocked it . The turret commander , ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing , was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter . He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man , but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties . The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail @-@ safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked . 
 Sissoi Veliky was repaired by Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée . The French engineers openly ridiculed the quality of Russian workmanship manifested in a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch @-@ wide ( 38 mm ) open seam between the belt armour and the ship 's hull . This could have completely negated the battleship 's protection if a shell had struck it . The Russian investigators reported a horrifying number of less obvious faults and deemed the ship unfit for sailing . The internal decks of the secondary armament casemates were particularly dangerous since the 152 mm shells easily fell through the cracks and holes in the deck . The Saint Petersburg admirals dismissed these concerns , arguing that the gap between armour plates was an inevitable feature of the design , and that the decks and other faults could be fixed by the crew " in their spare time " . 
 = = = Far East = = = 
 After nine months in the dock at Toulon , the repaired Sissoi Veliky was assigned to Admiral Fyodor Dubasov 's Far Eastern Squadron ( Navarin , Sissoi Veliky , and the armoured cruisers Rossia and Vladimir Monomakh ) and sailed for the Far East . The British , alerted by the sudden movement of Russian battleships , dispatched the battleship HMS Victorious to shadow the Russian ship . Sissoi Veliky , assisted by a flotilla of tugs , barely passed the shallow entrance to the Suez Canal , but Victorious ran aground near Port Said and abandoned pursuit . Aside from this incident , the east @-@ bound voyage was uneventful , and the ship safely reached Port Arthur on March 16 [ O.S. March 4 ] , 1898 . 
 In the summer of 1898 Sissoi Veliky sailed to Nagasaki for repairs and returned to her new base in Vladivostok where she stayed for the rest of 1898 and 1899 . In April 1900 the fleet sailed to Port Arthur for a massive landing exercise intended to intimidate the Boxers . The warning was not heeded , and the Boxer Rebellion intensified , compelling the Russian government to intervene . On May 28 [ O.S. May 15 ] , 1900 the Viceroy of the Russian Far East , Admiral Yevgeni Alekseyev , dispatched the Far Eastern Squadron from Port Arthur to the Taku Forts . Sissoi Veliky , the battleship Petropavlovsk , the armoured cruiser Dmitrii Donskoi and a host of other European ships blockaded the mouth of the Hai River and the smaller gunboats moved up the river to protect amphibious landings which began on May 29 [ O.S. May 16 ] . The incursion provoked the Boxer siege of Beijing ; the Russians responded by sending a company of sailors from Sissoi Veliky and Navarin to defend the embassy in Beijing . 
 The company reached the city without meeting any opposition and at first it seemed that the European troops in Beijing could easily defend the Embassy Row from the disorganized mob . On June 3 [ O.S. May 21 ] the rebels received reinforcements from the regular Chinese Army and , on the afternoon of June 19 [ O.S. June 6 ] , they began a massive assault on the diplomatic missions . One month later the Chinese managed to burn down the Austrian , Dutch and Italian legations . The sailors stood their ground with American and French Marines until the arrival of reinforcements on August 5 [ O.S. July 23 ] . During the seven weeks of the siege , three men from Sissoi Veliky were killed in action , one died of disease , and twelve were wounded . 
 Sissoi Veliky remained in the Far East for another year ; in December 1901 an accumulation of mechanical troubles that could not be fixed in Far Eastern docks compelled the fleet commander to send her back to the Baltic . She returned to Libau via Nagasaki , Hong Kong and Suez in April 1902 . 
 = = = The last voyage = = = 
 In May 1902 Sissoi Veliky attended a fleet review honouring the state visit of President of France , Émile Loubet . In June she was moved into a drydock in Kronstadt . All available financing was diverted to the completion of the Borodino @-@ class battleship and the new cruisers , so the repairs of Sissoi Veliky proceeded at a slow pace . She had her artillery , boilers and ventilation system completely replaced , but once again it turned out that the repairs were not up to scratch and needed a thorough rework . 
 The Russo @-@ Japanese War broke out in the Pacific on February 10 [ O.S. January 27 ] 1904 . In March the navy assigned Sissoi Veliky to the Second Pacific Squadron bound for the Pacific with Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky in command . Despite the urgency , calls to speed up repairs of Sissoi Veliky and completion of the new ships were stonewalled by the Ministry of the Navy until the shocking loss of Petropavlovsk on April 13 [ O.S. March 31 ] . Admiral Aleksei <unk> , the new Governor of Kronstadt , hastened the repairs by striking out " unnecessary " jobs . Sissoi Veliky went into action with new rangefinders , searchlights and small @-@ calibre guns , but her damaged internal decks were never mended . <unk> Ozerov , the captain of Sissoi Veliky , expressed concern about her stability , but on at least three occasions <unk> suppressed his reports , arguing that past experience is sufficient proof of the ship 's seaworthiness . 
 On August 25 [ O.S. August 13 ] the Second Pacific Squadron sailed from Saint <unk> to Reval where it wasted nearly a whole month in preparation for a fleet review . Tsar Nicholas II personally visited each battleship and harangued the crews in anticipation of a victory over Japan . On October 14 [ O.S. October 2 ] the squadron departed Libau , and sailed to Tangier . Here , Rozhestvensky split his forces . The newer battleships continued their way past the Cape of Good Hope and Rear Admiral Dmitry von Fölkersam 's squadron of cruisers and transports were ordered to rendezvous with Black Sea Fleet ships in Souda Bay and then take the short route via the Suez Canal . Rozhestvensky initially planned to keep Sissoi Veliky and Navarin with his main force , but assigned them to von Fölkersam instead . The ship rejoined <unk> 's fleet at Nosy Be , Madagascar on January 9 , 1905 [ O.S. December 27 , 1904 ] where they stayed for two months , training while Rozhestvensky finalized coaling arrangements for the next leg of the journey . Despite regular exercise , the gunners of the new Borodino @-@ class ships could not match the level of Sissoi Veliky and other old ships . The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay , French Indochina , on March 16 [ O.S. March 3 ] and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron , commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov . The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on May 9 [ O.S. April 26 ] and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok five days later . The voyage from Madagascar to Camranh Bay took 28 days at an average speed of 7 knots ( 13 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 mph ) , and again Sissoi Veliky 's mechanical problems evidenced themselves , slowing down the squadron . In less than a month she suffered twelve failures of her boiler tubes and heat exchangers . The steering gear alone failed no less than four times . 
 = = = Tsushima = = = 
 May 14 [ O.S. May 1 ] , 1905 the squadron began the last leg of its journey to Tsushima . Sissoi Veliky was sailing in the left column of the Russian order of battle , second in line after Oslyabya . At 13 : 15 May 27 [ O.S. May 14 ] the Russians sighted the Japanese fleet . Twenty @-@ four minutes later Sissoi Veliky opened fire simultaneously with the flagship Knyaz Suvorov . Sissoi Veliky started firing at the armoured cruisers Kasuga and Nisshin and later engaged the armoured cruiser Iwate , hitting her with a single 12 @-@ inch shell . 
 At 14 : 40 a heavy shell exploded next to Sissoi Veliky 's bow , damaging the bow torpedo tube . Shortly afterward a 12 @-@ inch and a 6 @-@ inch shell hit the belt armour near the water line , causing flooding in the forward compartments . In the following hour the ship was hit by one 12 @-@ inch , three 8 @-@ inch and three 6 @-@ inch shells , which disabled her forward turret hydraulics , set the casemates afire and simultaneously severed the firefighting water supply . At 15 : 40 Ozerov steered the burning Sissoi Veliky away from the line of fire and joined the unengaged Russian cruiser formation . By 17 : 00 the crew had extinguished the fires and the ship returned to action with a heavy list to port . She took her place in line behind Navarin at the moment when the Japanese battleships ceased fire and the Russians hoped to leave the battlefield without further casualties . One hour later Admiral Kamimura re @-@ established contact and engaged the fleeing Russians . Sissoi Veliky survived this phase of the battle unharmed . After sunset she joined the group of survivors assembled by Nebogatov , but was unable to keep pace with Nebogatov 's flagship Imperator Nikolai I. Sissoi Veliky and Navarin fell back , supporting Admiral Ushakov with gunfire . At 19 : 30 the ship sighted Japanese destroyers fanning out for an attack . 
 The destroyers attacked at close range ( under 600 yards ( 550 m ) ) in uncoordinated groups . Sissoi Veliky beat off the first ( 19 : 45 ) and the second ( 22 : 30 ) attacks , but the third one , by the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla under command of Kantarō Suzuki , which had already sunk Navarin and Knyaz Suvorov . , scored a torpedo hit 45 minutes later that damaged her rudder and propellers . The ship could still be steered by using her engines at varying speeds , but the flooding intensified and by 03 : 15 the next morning the bow was submerged to the point where forward movement was no longer possible . Ozerov realized that Sissoi Veliky could not make it to Vladivostok ; he ordered " all astern " , reversed the engines and headed <unk> to Tsushima Island , hoping to beach his crippled ship with the intent of using her as a fixed gun emplacement . 
 By 06 : 00 flooding forced Ozerov to telegraph " all stop " , shutting down the vessel 's engines . The crippled Vladimir Monomakh passed by Sissoi Veliky , unable to offer any assistance . At 07 : 20 the Japanese armed merchant cruisers Shinano Maru and <unk> Maru converged on the stationary ship . When they came within 6 @,@ 600 yards ( 6 @,@ 000 m ) from Sissoi Veliky , Ozerov signalled : " I am sinking , request assistance . " The Japanese responded with a straightforward question , " Do you surrender ? " Ozerov hoisted the white flag in response . At 08 : 15 the Japanese boarding party of one officer and 31 enlisted men boarded the battleship and raised the Japanese flag , but failed to pull down the Russian flag . The Japanese attempted to tow their prize to safety , but soon realized the effort was futile . They moved the Russian prisoners onto their ships and retrieved their flag . At 10 : 05 Sissoi Veliky capsized and sank , still flying the Russian flag . Sissoi Veliky lost 47 men killed during the battle ; 613 of her crew were rescued . 
 = Moonrise ( novel ) = 
 Moonrise is a children 's fantasy novel , the second book in the Warriors : The New Prophecy series . The book , which follows the adventures of four groups of anthropomorphic wild cats ( called Clans ) , was written by Erin Hunter ( a pseudonym used by Victoria Holmes , Cherith Baldry , Kate Cary , and Tui T. Sutherland ) , with cover art by Wayne McLoughlin . Moonrise follows six cats , Brambleclaw , Squirrelpaw , Crowpaw , Feathertail , Stormfur , and Tawnypelt , as they return to their forest home from a journey to the ocean . They travel through the mountains , where they meet the Tribe of Rushing Water , a new group of cats first introduced in this novel . The Tribe cats are being attacked by a savage mountain lion called Sharptooth . Although reluctant at first , the Clan cats agree to help the Tribe get rid of Sharptooth . Series editor Victoria Holmes drew inspiration from locations such as the New Forest and the Scottish Highlands . 
 Moonrise has been released in hardcover , paperback , and e @-@ book formats , and has been translated into French , Russian , Chinese , Japanese , and German . The book received mostly positive comments from reviews published in Booklist and Horn Book Review , which praised the plot and cliffhanger ending . However , a reviewer for Kirkus Reviews criticized the characters ' confusing names and the writing style . Moonrise held the number two spot on The New York Times Best Seller list for children 's chapter books for two weeks .

 The authors of the series drew inspiration from several natural locations in the United Kingdom . The four Clans ( WindClan , RiverClan , ThunderClan , and ShadowClan ) share a fictional forest based on England 's New Forest . Loch Lomond is another location that influenced the setting of Moonrise . Some other sources of inspiration for the series include the works of authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis . 
 Cherith Baldry , one of the people who write using the pen name Erin Hunter , said that it was hard to write the death of Feathertail at the end of Moonrise because they had to present it in a way suitable for the book 's younger target audience . 
 Moonrise is written in an alternating third @-@ person limited narrative , with the exception of the prologue , which is written in a third @-@ person objective perspective . The point @-@ of @-@ view alternates between the characters Stormfur , who is with the questing cats , and <unk> , describing her experiences as the destruction of the forest begins .

 Moonrise was written by Erin Hunter , a pseudonym used by authors Cherith Baldry , Kate Cary , Tui Sutherland , and series editor Victoria Holmes . The pseudonym is used so that the individual novels in the series would not be shelved in different places in libraries . Victoria Holmes chose the name Erin because she liked the name , and Hunter because it matched the theme of feral cats . It also ensured that the books were shelved near those of Brian Jacques , an author that the writers , collectively known as " the <unk> " , liked . 
 Moonrise was published as a hardcover by HarperCollins on July 25 , 2005 , in Canada , and August 2 , 2005 , in the US and UK . The book was released as a paperback on July 25 , 2006 , and as an e @-@ book on November 6 , 2007 . Moonrise has been translated into various foreign languages : it was released in Russian on October 18 , 2005 , by <unk> Media Group , in Japanese on March 18 , 2009 , by <unk> Shoten , and in French on March 5 , 2009 , by Pocket Jeunesse . The Chinese version of Moonrise was published on April 30 , 2009 , by Morning Star Group .

 = = = Setting and characters = = = 
 Moonrise takes place in several locations inspired by similar locales in the United Kingdom . With the exception of a disused mine , the forest in which the cats live is based largely on the New Forest . In addition , parts of the story take place by the ocean and in a fictitious mountain range . 
 The main characters each come from one of four Clans : ThunderClan , RiverClan , ShadowClan , and WindClan . All Clan cats share a belief in StarClan , a group of spirits usually represented by the stars , who are their ancestors and provide them with guidance . The Clans also follow identical hierarchy structures : Clans each have one leader , a deputy who is second @-@ in @-@ command , and a medicine cat who heals Clanmates in addition to communicating with StarClan . The bulk of each Clan consists of warriors , who carry out hunting for food , patrol borders , and fight battles when they occur . Apprentices are younger cats who are in training to become warriors , or more rarely , medicine cats . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 In the previous book in the series , Midnight , StarClan , the warrior cats ' ancestors , sent four cats ( one from each Clan — Brambleclaw , Crowpaw , Feathertail , and Tawnypelt ) on a quest . Squirrelpaw and Stormfur went with them . At the end of their journey , they arrived at the ocean and found an unusually intelligent badger named Midnight . Midnight told the cats that the Clans would have to leave their forest home and find a new place to live , as humans were going to cut down the forest and build a new " <unk> " ( the cats ' word for a road ) . 
 On the return journey , the Clan cats decide , after consultation with Midnight , to go through a mountain range which they had avoided in their initial travels . There , they meet a Clan @-@ like group of cats called the Tribe of Rushing Water , who have their own set of ancestors : the Tribe of Endless Hunting . The Tribe takes the traveling cats in and gives them food and shelter . The Clan cats discover that the Tribe cats have a prophecy : a silver cat will save them from Sharptooth , a savage lion @-@ like creature that has been killing many members of the Tribe . The Tribe thinks that Stormfur is the silver cat from the prophecy , and he is therefore expected to protect the Tribe from Sharptooth . Although reluctant at first , Stormfur eventually agrees to help the Tribe . 
 Together , the Clan cats succeed in leading Sharptooth into a trap in a cave . However , their plan to poison Sharptooth goes awry , and Feathertail jumps up to the roof of the cave onto a stalactite , causing it to fall . Both Feathertail and Sharptooth are killed by the impact . The Tribe then realizes that Feathertail was the silver cat in their prophecy , not her brother Stormfur , as they had previously thought . The five remaining cats then continue their journey . The book ends with Squirrelpaw noticing <unk> , which is at the edge of WindClan territory ; they are almost home . 
 Meanwhile , back in the forest , the Clans begin to experience the effects of the humans ' intrusion into their territories , including lost and poisoned prey , destruction of the forest and cats being abducted . 
 Moonrise is followed by Dawn , which details the events following the questing cats ' return to the forest , and their subsequent journey to find a new home .

It was also ranked 121st on USA Today 's bestseller list during the week of August 11 , 2005 . The work was also a success in Canada , reaching number seven on the Leader @-@ Post children 's bestseller list , and remaining in the top 15 for seven weeks . In a Fairfield , Greater Victoria store , Moonrise was reportedly more popular than Harry Potter . 
 = Weather forecasting = 
 Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location . Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia , and formally since the nineteenth century . Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will change . 
 Once an all @-@ human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure , current weather conditions , and sky condition , weather forecasting now relies on computer @-@ based models that take many atmospheric factors into account . Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon , which involves pattern recognition skills , teleconnections , knowledge of model performance , and knowledge of model biases . The chaotic nature of the atmosphere , the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere , error involved in measuring the initial conditions , and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made ( the range of the forecast ) increases . The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome . 
 There are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts . Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property . Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture , and therefore to traders within commodity markets . Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days . On an everyday basis , people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day . Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain , snow and the wind chill , forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events , and to plan ahead and survive them . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Ancient forecasting = = = 
 For millennia people have tried to forecast the weather . In 650 BC , the Babylonians predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as astrology . In about 340 BC , Aristotle described weather patterns in Meteorologica . Later , Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting , called the Book of Signs . Chinese weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 300 BC , which was also around the same time ancient Indian astronomers developed weather @-@ prediction methods . In 904 AD , Ibn Wahshiyya 's Nabatean Agriculture discussed the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations ; signs of rain based on observation of the lunar phases ; and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds . 
 Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events , also termed pattern recognition . For example , it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red , the following day often brought fair weather . This experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore . However , not all of these predictions prove reliable , and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing . 
 = = = Modern methods = = = 
 It was not until the invention of the electric telegraph in 1835 that the modern age of weather forecasting began . Before that , the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day ( 160 km / d ) , but was more typically 40 – 75 miles per day ( 60 – 120 km / day ) ( whether by land or by sea ) . By the late 1840s , the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously , allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind . 
 The two men credited with the birth of forecasting as a science were officer of the Royal Navy Francis Beaufort and his protégé Robert FitzRoy . Both were influential men in British naval and governmental circles , and though ridiculed in the press at the time , their work gained scientific credence , was accepted by the Royal Navy , and formed the basis for all of today 's weather forecasting knowledge . 
 Beaufort developed the Wind Force Scale and Weather Notation coding , which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life . He also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around British shores , and with his friend William Whewell , expanded weather record @-@ keeping at 200 British Coast guard stations . 
 Robert FitzRoy was appointed in 1854 as chief of a new department within the Board of Trade to deal with the collection of weather data at sea as a service to mariners . This was the forerunner of the modern Meteorological Office . All ship captains were tasked with collating data on the weather and computing it , with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose . 
 A storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the Royal Charter inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made , which he called " forecasting the weather " , thus coining the term " weather forecast " . Fifteen land stations were established to use the new telegraph to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale warning service . His warning service for shipping was initiated in February 1861 , with the use of telegraph communications . The first daily weather forecasts were published in The Times in 1861 . In the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected . The " Weather Book " which FitzRoy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time . 
 As the electric telegraph network expanded , allowing for the more rapid dissemination of warnings , a national observational network was developed which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses . Instruments to continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his <unk> had earlier been used by FitzRoy . 
 To convey accurate information , it soon became necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds ; this was achieved by means of a series of classifications first achieved by Luke Howard in 1802 , and standardized in the International Cloud Atlas of 1896 . 
 = = = Numerical prediction = = = 
 It was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction . In 1922 , English scientist Lewis Fry Richardson published " Weather Prediction By Numerical Process " , after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected , and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised , to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found . 
 Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others . However , the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers , and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems . It was later found , through numerical analysis , that this was due to numerical instability . The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team led by the mathematician John von Neumann ; von Neumann publishing the paper Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation in 1950 . Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955 , spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers . 
 = = = Broadcasts = = = 
 The first ever daily weather forecasts were published in The Times on 1 August 1861 , and the first weather maps were produced later in the same year . In 1911 , the Met Office began issuing the first marine weather forecasts via radio transmission . These included gale and storm warnings for areas around Great Britain . In the United States , the first public radio forecasts were made in 1925 by Edward B. " E.B. " Rideout , on WEEI , the Edison Electric Illuminating station in Boston . Rideout came from the U.S. Weather Bureau , as did WBZ weather forecaster G. Harold Noyes in 1931 . 
 The world 's first televised weather forecasts , including the use of weather maps , were experimentally broadcast by the BBC in 1936 . This was brought into practice in 1949 after World War II . George Cowling gave the first weather forecast while being televised in front of the map in 1954 . In America , experimental television forecasts were made by James C Fidler in Cincinnati in either 1940 or 1947 on the DuMont Television Network . In the late 1970s and early 80s , John Coleman , the first weatherman on ABC @-@ TV 's Good Morning America , pioneered the use of on @-@ screen weather satellite information and computer graphics for television forecasts . Coleman was a co @-@ founder of The Weather Channel ( TWC ) in 1982 . TWC is now a 24 @-@ hour cable network . 
 = = How models create forecasts = = 
 The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future . The main inputs from country @-@ based weather services are surface observations from automated weather stations at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea . The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation , observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide . Stations either report hourly in METAR reports , or every six hours in SYNOP reports . Sites launch radiosondes , which rise through the depth of the troposphere and well into the stratosphere . Data from weather satellites are used in areas where traditional data sources are not available . Compared with similar data from radiosondes , the satellite data has the advantage of global coverage , however at a lower accuracy and resolution . Meteorological radar provide information on precipitation location and intensity , which can be used to estimate precipitation accumulations over time . Additionally , if a pulse Doppler weather radar is used then wind speed and direction can be determined . 
 Commerce provides pilot reports along aircraft routes , and ship reports along shipping routes . Research flights using reconnaissance aircraft fly in and around weather systems of interest such as tropical cyclones . Reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems which cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance , or are expected to be of high impact 3 – 7 days into the future over the downstream continent . 
 Models are initialized using this observed data . The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods , which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model 's mathematical algorithms ( usually an evenly spaced grid ) . The data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast . Commonly , the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations . These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined . The rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future . The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change , and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future . This time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time . The length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid . 
 The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid , and is chosen to maintain numerical stability . Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes , while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes . The global models are run at varying times into the future . The UKMET Unified Model is run six days into the future , the European Centre for Medium @-@ Range Weather Forecasts model is run out to 10 days into the future , while the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run 16 days into the future . The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart , or prog . The raw output is often modified before being presented as the forecast . This can be in the form of statistical techniques to remove known biases in the model , or of adjustment to take into account consensus among other numerical weather forecasts . MOS or model output statistics is a technique used to interpret numerical model output and produce site @-@ specific guidance . This guidance is presented in coded numerical form , and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States . As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963 , long range forecasts , those made at a range of two weeks or more , are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere , owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved . In numerical models , extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity . 
 Essentially , a model is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes . Within any modern model is a set of equations , known as the primitive equations , used to predict the future state of the atmosphere . These equations — along with the ideal gas law — are used to evolve the density , pressure , and potential temperature scalar fields and the velocity vector field of the atmosphere through time . Additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive @-@ equation mesoscale models as well . The equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods , with the exception of a few idealized cases . Therefore , numerical methods obtain approximate solutions . Different models use different solution methods : some global models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite difference methods for the vertical dimension , while regional models and other global models usually use finite @-@ difference methods in all three dimensions . 
 = = Techniques = = 
 = = = Persistence = = = 
 The simplest method of forecasting the weather , persistence , relies upon today 's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow . This can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state , such as during the summer season in the tropics . This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern . It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts . 
 = = = Use of a barometer = = = 
 Measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency ( the change of pressure over time ) have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century . The larger the change in pressure , especially if more than 3 @.@ 5 hPa ( 2 @.@ 6 mmHg ) , the larger the change in weather can be expected . If the pressure drop is rapid , a low pressure system is approaching , and there is a greater chance of rain . Rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions , such as clearing skies . 
 = = = Looking at the sky = = = 
 Along with pressure tendency , the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas . Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future . At night , high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the moon , which indicates an approach of a warm front and its associated rain . Morning fog portends fair conditions , as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds which prevent fog formation . The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front . Cloud @-@ free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future . A bar can indicate a coming tropical cyclone . The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The forecasting of the weather within the next six hours is often referred to as nowcasting . In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy , as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model . A human given the latest radar , satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours . However , there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation , including evolution of those features in time . 
 = = = Use of forecast models = = = 
 In the past , the human forecaster was responsible for generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations . Today , human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters , such as model biases and performance . Using a consensus of forecast models , as well as ensemble members of the various models , can help reduce forecast error . However , regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system , large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run . Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user . Humans can use knowledge of local effects which may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast . While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans may no longer be needed in the forecast process at some point in the future , there is currently still a need for human intervention . 
 = = = Analog technique = = = 
 The analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast , requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event . What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future . Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition . It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans , as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future . A similar technique is used in medium range forecasting , which is known as teleconnections , when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime . An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño @-@ Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) related phenomena . 
 = = Communicating forecasts to the public = = 
 Most end users of forecasts are members of the general public . Thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths , power outages , and widespread hail damage . Heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand @-@ still , as well as cause flooding in low @-@ lying areas . Excessive heat or cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities , and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation . 
 Several countries employ government agencies to provide forecasts and watches / warnings / advisories to the public in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests . Knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must be taken into account to present the information in a useful and understandable way . Examples include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's National Weather Service ( NWS ) and Environment Canada 's Meteorological Service ( MSC ) . Traditionally , newspaper , television , and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public . Increasingly , the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found . In all cases , these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis . 
 = = = Severe weather alerts and advisories = = = 
 A major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories which the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected . This is done to protect life and property . Some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning , as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch . Other forms of these advisories include winter weather , high wind , flood , tropical cyclone , and fog . Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media , including radio , using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System which break into regular programming . 
 = = = Low temperature forecast = = = 
 The low temperature forecast for the current day is calculated using the lowest temperature found between 7pm that evening through 7am the following morning . So , in short , today 's forecasted low is most likely tomorrow 's low temperature .

 There are a number of sectors with their own specific needs for weather forecasts and specialist services are provided to these users . 
 = = = Air traffic = = = 
 Because the aviation industry is especially sensitive to the weather , accurate weather forecasting is essential . Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off . Turbulence and icing are also significant in @-@ flight hazards . Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries , icing due to the heavy precipitation , as well as large hail , strong winds , and lightning , all of which can cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight . Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation , as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds . On a day @-@ to @-@ day basis airliners are routed to take advantage of the jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency . <unk> are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination . Additionally , airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind . This reduces the distance required for takeoff , and eliminates potential crosswinds . 
 = = = Marine = = = 
 Commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction and speed , wave periodicity and heights , tides , and precipitation . These factors can each influence the safety of marine transit . Consequently , a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio , for example the <unk> ( marine forecast ) . Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = Agriculture = = = 
 Farmers rely on weather forecasts to decide what work to do on any particular day . For example , drying hay is only feasible in dry weather . Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton , wheat , and corn crops . While corn crops can be ruined by drought , their dried remains can be used as a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage . Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall . For example , peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze . Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes , regardless of their timing . 
 = = = Forestry = = = 
 Weather forecasting of wind , precipitations and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling wildfires . Different indices , like the Forest fire weather index and the Haines Index , have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes . Conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather , too . 
 = = = Utility companies = = = 
 Electricity and gas companies rely on weather forecasts to anticipate demand which can be strongly affected by the weather . They use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating ( heating degree day ) or cooling ( cooling degree day ) . These quantities are based on a daily average temperature of 65 ° F ( 18 ° C ) . Cooler temperatures force heating degree days ( one per degree Fahrenheit ) , while warmer temperatures force cooling degree days . In winter , severe cold weather can cause a surge in demand as people turn up their heating . Similarly , in summer a surge in demand can be linked with the increased use of air conditioning systems in hot weather . By anticipating a surge in demand , utility companies can purchase additional supplies of power or natural gas before the price increases , or in some circumstances , supplies are restricted through the use of brownouts and blackouts . 
 = = = Other commercial companies = = = 
 Increasingly , private companies pay for weather forecasts tailored to their needs so that they can increase their profits or avoid large losses . For example , supermarket chains may change the stocks on their shelves in anticipation of different consumer spending habits in different weather conditions . Weather forecasts can be used to invest in the commodity market , such as futures in oranges , corn , soybeans , and oil .

 " The Lastest Gun in the West " is the twelfth episode of The Simpsons ’ thirteenth season . It first aired on the Fox network on February 24 , 2002 . In the episode , Bart , after being chased by a vicious dog , runs into a retired Western star named Buck McCoy , who soon becomes Bart 's idol . After McCoy shows the Simpsons some of the films he starred in , the family decides to help him get back into acting . 
 The episode was directed by Bob Anderson and written by John Swartzwelder , who based the script on a story idea pitched by fellow Simpsons writer Ron Hauge . The episode features Dennis Weaver as the retired Western actor Buck McCoy , as well as Frank Welker as the vicious dog , and Karl Wiedergott as an alcoholic resembling Walter Brennan . When it was first broadcast , " The Lastest Gun in the West " was seen by 5 @.@ 9 % of the American population between ages 18 and 49 . It has since been negatively received by fans and has garnered mixed reviews from critics .

 When a vicious dog chases Bart , he takes refuge in the garden of a house belonging to former Western actor Buck McCoy . Buck shows Bart a trick to calm the dog down , making it friendly towards him , and Bart begins to hero @-@ worship Buck . Naturally , Homer learns about Bart 's new idol and demands he worship him instead . 
 To help him out , Bart gets Buck a job on Krusty the Clown 's show , but Buck gets drunk and makes a fool of himself on air , crushing Bart. Seeing this , Marge and Homer decide to help Buck overcome his alcoholism , so they clean out Buck 's house and enroll him in an Alcoholics Anonymous program . Despite making progress , Buck is not restored to hero @-@ status for Bart , but Homer has an idea . 
 Homer plans a bank robbery , but when he , Buck and Bart arrive at the bank , a robbery led by Snake is already underway . Buck leaps into action , subdues the bank robbers and becomes a hero in Bart 's eyes once again . Bart acknowledges everything Homer has done and declares him to be a hero as well . At the end Bart gets chased by the vicious dog again .

 The idea for the episode was pitched by Simpsons writer Ron Hauge , who thought it would be interesting to see an episode in which Bart would run into a retired Western film star in the neighborhood and " think he was the coolest guy in the world " , although the actor had seen better days . Hauge suggested that Swartzwelder , who is an avid Western fan , would be the appropriate writer for the episode . Swartzwelder also pitched the plot idea about the angry dog who chases Bart in the episode .

 The design for Buck McCoy was primarily based on Dennis Weaver , who portrayed him in the episode , as well as aspects of other western actors such as Roy Rogers and John Wayne . McCoy 's costume in the fictional television show <unk> was based on the attire worn by the main character in real @-@ life television series McCloud . The design for the dog went through several different model changes until the Simpsons staff settled on the " very angry bull @-@ terrier design " seen in the episode . A scene in the episode shows McCoy showcasing an array of films he starred in to the Simpson family through a movie projector . In order to achieve the strobe light effect done by the projector , the animators painted every other frame white and then blank .

 The episode features American actor Dennis Weaver , famous for his role in the television show Gunsmoke , in a guest role as the Western actor Buck McCoy . Al Jean , the show runner for the episode , stated in the DVD commentary that Weaver was very funny , a ” terrific guy ” , and that it was an honor to meet him . Karl Wiedergott , an actor who usually fills in for unavailable male cast members during table reads for The Simpsons episodes , portrayed an alcoholic resembling Walter Brennan . The dog was played by voice artist Frank Welker .

 The episode title , which is often wrongfully referred to as " The Latest Gun In the West " , is a pun based on the term " the fastest gun in the west " . A scene in the episode shows McCoy auditioning for a spot in the Krusty the Clown show . To showcase his skills , McCoy shoots a Krusty cardboard cutout in the crotch . The scene is a reference to an incident on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson , in which Ed Ames hit a mannequin in the crotch while demonstrating a tomahawk throw . Carson 's quips during the incident are referenced in Krusty 's line " Ooh , right in the panhandle . " Carson can also be seen in one of the clips before Krusty 's show in the episode , along with poet Robert Frost . The inside of McCoy 's house is loosely based on the inside of Will Rogers ' house in Will Rogers State Historic Park . " <unk> " , the last TV series McCoy starred in , is a parody of the American television police drama McCloud , in which Weaver played the lead ; McCoy claims the series was eventually retooled into Room 222 . In one scene , Homer shows Bart a poster of himself dressed as Farrah Fawcett .

 Daniel Lucius " Doc " Adams ( November 1 , 1814 – January 3 , 1899 ) was an American baseball player and executive who is regarded by historians as an important figure in the sport 's early years . For most of his career he was a member of the New York Knickerbockers . He first played for the New York Base Ball Club in 1840 and started his Knickerbockers career five years later , continuing to play for the club into his forties and to take part in inter @-@ squad practice games and matches against opposing teams . Researchers have called Adams the creator of the shortstop position , which he used to field short throws from outfielders . In addition to his playing career , Adams manufactured baseballs and oversaw bat production ; he also occasionally acted as an umpire . 
 From 1847 to 1861 , the Knickerbockers selected Adams as their president six times , and as a vice president , treasurer , or director in six other years . As president of the club , Adams was an advocate of rule changes in baseball that resulted in nine @-@ man teams and nine @-@ inning games . When the National Association of Base Ball Players ( NABBP ) was formed in 1858 , he led the rules and regulations committee of the new organization . In his role , Adams ruled that the fields ' bases should be 90 feet ( 27 m ) apart , the modern distance , and supported the elimination of the " bound rule " , which allowed for balls caught after one bounce to be recorded as outs . He resigned from his positions with the Knickerbockers and NABBP in 1862 . Adams ' contributions in creating baseball 's rules went largely unrecognized for decades after his 1899 death , but in 1980 a letter about him appeared in The New York Times ; by 1993 , researcher John Thorn had written about Adams ' role . Other historians have given him credit for helping to develop the sport , and Thorn has called Adams " first among the Fathers of Baseball " . 
 A graduate of Yale University and Harvard Medical School , Adams began working in the medical field in the late 1830s , and practiced in New York City during his time as a member of the Knickerbockers . In 1865 , he left medicine and later became a bank president and member of the Connecticut legislature . He and his wife had five children . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in Mont Vernon , New Hampshire , on November 1 , 1814 , Adams was the fourth of Daniel and Nancy Adams ' five children . The elder Daniel Adams was a physician and author ; he wrote a math textbook that was widely used in the United States in the early- to mid @-@ 1800s . After being schooled at Kimball Union Academy in New Hampshire from 1826 to 1828 and Amherst , Massachusetts ' Mount Pleasant Classical Institution , Adams attended three colleges from 1831 to 1838 . He studied at Amherst College for two years , then transferred to Yale University , where he acquired a bachelor 's degree upon his graduation in 1835 . Nancy Adams , Daniel 's sister , indicated in a letter penned in the early 1830s that he began playing with " bats and balls " by this time . 
 Adams continued his studies at Harvard Medical School through 1838 , obtaining an MD . Following his time in college , he joined his father 's medical practice . The pair worked in Mont Vernon , before the younger Adams relocated twice , first to Boston and then to New York City . Adams also worked for the New York <unk> , which provided medical care to poor residents . He offered his assistance when outbreaks of cholera affected New York City . For providing vaccinations , Adams received yearly pay of $ 400 for a time . His field of employment gave rise to his nickname of " Doc " , which was given as " Dock " at the time . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 According to baseball historian John Thorn , 1839 is the year Adams became a baseball player . In an 1896 interview in The Sporting News , Adams said that " soon after going to New York I began to play base ball just for exercise , with a number of other young medical men . " Starting in 1840 , he was a player with the New York Base Ball Club . This team began play five years earlier than the New York Knickerbockers , who are credited in several baseball histories as pioneering the modern version of baseball . Adams played an early form of the game , but Thorn writes that he " understood [ it ] to be baseball , no matter what it was called " . 
 Adams received an invitation to become a member of the Knickerbockers a month or so after the team 's September 23 , 1845 , creation . He accepted and joined the club along with other men in the medical field ; he later said that players from the New York Base Ball Club were behind the formation of the Knickerbockers . Records of the club 's practice games indicate that he was a member of the Knickerbockers by November 18 , 1845 . In an inter @-@ squad game held that day , which was the Knickerbockers ' last of the year , Adams scored nine runs for his team as they defeated a side picked by William R. Wheaton , 51 – 42 . The club organized its first game against outside opposition in 1846 ; at a June 5 meeting Adams was selected to a three @-@ man committee whose aim was to set up a game against the New York Base Ball Club . The committee 's efforts were successful , and a game was scheduled on June 19 . Adams participated in the contest , which the Knickerbockers lost 23 – 1 . Batting second in the Knickerbockers ' lineup , he made one out and did not score a run . 
 The Knickerbockers did not play any known games against other clubs from 1847 to 1850 . During these years , the team split its players into two squads , which played against each other twice per week . According to Adams , he often attempted to compel members of the Knickerbockers to attend the sessions . He was only occasionally successful , and when few Knickerbockers came , they played variants of baseball that required fewer players than regular games . Twice in June 1851 , the club played against the Washington Base Ball Club , winning by scores of 21 – 11 and 22 – 20 . No individual statistics are available for the first game ; Adams scored twice for the Knickerbockers in the second . In 1853 , Adams played in two games against the Gotham Ball Club , tallying seven runs in a pair of victories . The two clubs met three times from June to October 1854 , and Adams had one run in each game . After splitting the first two contests , their October 26 , 1854 , game lasted 12 innings before being suspended due to darkness with the score tied 12 – 12 ; both teams fell short of the 21 runs that were required to win a game under the rules of the time . 
 Following two November games against the Eagle Base Ball Club that Adams is not known to have participated in , he returned to the Knickerbockers ' lineup for a June 1 , 1855 , game against Gotham and scored three times , although Gotham prevailed , 21 – 12 . He took part in two other 1855 games against Eagle and Gotham , respectively , scoring five runs total as the Knickerbockers won both contests . Adams competed four times for the club against outside opponents in 1856 as it won once , lost twice , and had one tie ; he scored ten times , and records for two games showed that his defensive position was shortstop . The Knickerbockers had a 2 – 2 win – loss record in competitive games during 1857 that Adams participated in . Playing three times at shortstop and once at first base defensively , he contributed 12 runs offensively , including a six @-@ run effort in the Knickerbockers ' 37 – 23 victory over the Empire club on June 24 . In 1858 , Adams made four appearances for the Knickerbockers against outside opposition and scored nine runs , but the team went 1 – 3 in the games . He varied his defensive positioning between second base , third base , and shortstop . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 As a player , Adams created the concept of the shortstop position , according to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy <unk> . In the first five years the Knickerbockers played , the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players . The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases ; if there were more than eight players , extra outfielders were sometimes used . The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield , because of the balls ' light weight . Adams ' shortstop position , at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850 , was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders . With the advent of higher @-@ quality baseballs , Adams moved toward the infield , since the distance the balls could travel increased . Prior to the invention of the shortstop , large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields ; defensive players tended to stand by bases , leaving empty space in between them for batters . The shortstop filled one of the two gaps . 
 Adams hit left @-@ handed ; he said that his batted balls occasionally went into a river by the Elysian Fields , the ground in Hoboken , New Jersey , where the Knickerbockers practiced and played . Adams had a long on @-@ field career with the Knickerbockers ; he remained a player with the team until 1859 . He did not limit his play to shortstop ; he fielded at every position except pitcher . Little is known about the relative performance of early baseball players , and the game was largely recreational , as opposed to competitive . Thorn speculates that Adams may have been " the best player of the 1840s " , citing his lengthy playing career as evidence . 
 = = Equipment maker and umpire = = 
 In addition to playing the game , Adams was involved in the production of early baseball equipment . He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time , supplying many New York City @-@ based clubs . Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched , it became " livelier " : it traveled further when batted or thrown . According to author Peter Morris , Adams ' ball @-@ manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years , as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls . In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs . A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls . As late as 1863 , Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York , continuing to produce them by hand . Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats , choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process . 
 Adams also worked occasionally as an umpire in significant games . One notable example was the final contest of a three @-@ game series between all @-@ star teams from Brooklyn and New York City , held on September 10 , 1858 , in Long Island . During the game , which the New York City all @-@ stars won 29 – 18 , Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at a pitch in the strike zone . Previously , strikes were only called when a batter swung at a pitch and missed . Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game . Otherwise , the called strike rule was not applied often in its first few years of existence . 
 = = Knickerbockers and NABBP executive = = 
 The Knickerbockers held elections annually to determine who would serve as officials . At the club 's second election , held on May 5 , 1846 , Adams was named the Knickerbockers ' vice president . At an April 1847 meeting , he became the president of the team , and was re @-@ elected in 1848 and 1849 . He was the leader of a " Committee to Revive the Constitution and By @-@ Laws " of baseball in 1848 . Adams was not chosen as an officer in 1851 , but the next year was named one of the club 's three treasurers ; he was elected to the same position the following two years . The number of baseball teams in the New York City area started to grow during the early 1850s , as the Washington Base Ball Club ( also known as the Gotham Ball Club ) and Eagle Base Ball Club were founded or reorganized . The Eagle Base Ball Club , desiring a unified set of rules , sent a message to the Knickerbockers requesting that a committee be formed . Adams was one of the three Knickerbockers members selected to be on the committee , and the clubs agreed on a set of rules , which were presented at the Knickerbockers ' meeting on April 1 , 1854 . At the same meeting , Adams was voted into the position of club director . 
 After again being named a director in 1855 , Adams became president of the Knickerbockers for the fourth time , winning an election held at the club 's April 5 , 1856 , meeting . He remained the team 's president in 1857 , and after not being named as an officer the next three years , was elected president in 1861 . During his time as the club 's president , the Knickerbockers ' organization was emulated by newly formed teams , and Adams himself was considered a " respected " figure by members of other clubs . According to author Andrew J. Schiff , Adams was among the most powerful baseball figures of the era . Concurrently , Adams maintained his New York City medical practice . 
 = = = Number of players and game length = = = 
 A supporter of nine @-@ man baseball teams , Adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players from outside the Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared . No rules existed at the time regarding team size , but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club . The proposal was defeated by a 13 – 11 vote , in favor of a rule forbidding non @-@ club members to play if there were 14 players ( seven per team ) . 
 A two @-@ man committee was created with the aim of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games . Duncan F. Curry and William F. Ladd were chosen as the committee members , but Ladd withdrew and Adams was named as a substitute . His partner on the committee , Curry , had led the opposition to nine @-@ man teams . Adams and Curry also differed on another issue : the length of games . At the time , a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs ; that team was awarded the victory . A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854 . Adams favored nine @-@ inning games , while Curry wanted contests to last seven innings . A convention was scheduled for early 1857 , and Adams joined a three @-@ man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates . At the convention , which consisted of one session each in January and February , Adams was voted president . The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven @-@ inning games , but the other teams backed a motion for nine @-@ inning contests , which passed . 
 These changes were incorporated in the " Laws of Base Ball " , written by Adams . He authored the initial draft of the regulations with what The New York Times ' Richard <unk> called " an upright script and strong hand . " The " Laws " included regulations governing bat and ball sizes , and a ban on betting by players and umpires . Fellow Knickerbocker William H. Grenelle copied Adams ' work onto blue pages and made modifications and notations as the convention progressed . Among other changes , Grenelle crossed out part of the rule Adams had written on game length ; he replaced the number nine with seven , before the motion that settled the issue was introduced . In March , the Knickerbockers changed their rules to match those passed at the convention . In May 1857 , Adams presided over a player convention where nine @-@ inning games were officially made part of the rules of baseball for participating teams . 
 = = = Distance between bases and campaign against bound rule = = = 
 In March 1858 , the National Association of Base Ball Players ( NABBP ) was formed at another convention . Adams was one of the Knickerbockers ' two delegates , having been selected at a February meeting attended by representatives from 25 clubs . He held the chairmanship of the association 's rules and regulations committee , and drafted the new organization 's initial set of rules . These included a clarification of the prescribed distance between bases , which under Knickerbocker Rules had been set at " forty @-@ two paces " between home plate and second base , and " forty @-@ two paces , equidistant " between first and third base . Historians differ on whether the bases were roughly 90 feet ( 27 m ) apart , or a shorter distance . Thorn has written that the pace itself may have been " an imprecise and variable measure , to gauge distances by ' stepping off ' , " and Adams described the rule as " rather vague . " At the 1857 convention , it was decided that bases would be " securely fastened upon the four corners of a square whose sides are roughly thirty yards . " As rules committee chairman for the new NABBP , Adams made the baselines 90 feet ( 27 m ) from one base to another , the distance seen in modern baseball . He ruled on the distance between home plate and the pitcher 's mound as well , making them 45 feet ( 14 m ) apart . In addition , the committee mandated that clubs have nine players per side , which became the norm . It also created the called strike rule , in an effort to reduce pitch totals and the time required to play games . 
 Adams campaigned for a further change in the rules of baseball , involving when outs were recorded . At the time , an out was allowed when the ball was caught by a fielder after one bounce ; this was known as the " bound rule " . Adams supported a ban on such outs , calling his preferred rule " the fly @-@ game " . Under the style of play he backed , when a fly ball was hit a fielder would have to catch the ball before it touched the ground for an out to be made . This was similar to rules on catches in cricket , and would serve to increase the level of skill required from fielders . The Knickerbockers had enacted a rule mandating the " fly @-@ catch " by 1857 . 
 The Knickerbockers attempted to introduce the fly rule more widely at the 1857 convention , with a proposal that permitted the continued use of the bound rule for foul balls . Despite widespread support from sportswriters , the proposed rule change was voted down . Writer William Hershberger said that the decision showed " the limits of the Knickerbockers ' influence and divisions within the baseball fraternity . " The rule change was proposed to the NABBP annually by Adams but did not pass . At the 1858 NABBP convention , a vote on eliminating the bound rule was unsuccessful . Opponents raised concerns that the proposal would dramatically lengthen game times . Despite his support for the fly rule , in 1858 Adams successfully motioned for NABBP regulations , including outs on bounces , to apply to the Knickerbockers . He did so because he was reluctant to oppose the rules of the NABBP . Shortly after his motion , he organized a Knickerbockers meeting to discuss the fly rule and " obtain a reconsideration " of the newly passed resolution . At the meeting , the Knickerbockers decided to exclude outs on bounces from their practice games and contests against teams that supported the fly rule . In future years , the club remained an advocate of eliminating the bound rule , but Adams ' continued efforts were rejected . A split in the rules and regulations committee caused it to avoid supporting the fly game at the NABBP 's 1859 convention , and votes at the 1860 and 1861 conventions maintained the bound rule . Adams ' final comments about the regulation at an NABBP convention indicated that he believed it would soon be modified . The bound rule started losing support by 1863 , after Adams left the Knickerbockers , and outs on bounced balls were outlawed in 1864 . 
 = = = Retirement = = = 
 In addition to his other roles , Adams regularly served as a delegate on behalf of the Knickerbockers at the NABBP 's annual meetings . He remained with the Knickerbockers in an executive role until March 26 , 1862 , when he retired having served 12 years overall in various non @-@ playing capacities . Upon leaving his position , the club named him an honorary member . He received a scroll from the Knickerbockers , which referred to him as " The Nestor of Ball Players " , alluding to a mythical king known for offering advice . Adams also resigned from his role as rules committee chairman of the NABBP .

 Adams and Cornelia Cook married in 1861 , and remained together until Adams ' death . The couple had five children ; the first , a son named Charles , died less than a month after his birth in 1864 . The others , two sons ( Frank and Roger ) and two daughters ( Catharine and Mary ) , were born between 1866 and 1874 . Adams continued to maintain his medical practice during his baseball career , but was forced to abandon it in 1865 after he began suffering health issues . After relocating to Ridgefield , Connecticut , he went on to become " one of the leading citizens of the Connecticut village , " according to author William J. Ryczek . Adams served as a Republican legislator in the Connecticut House of Representatives for the town in 1870 . He contributed to the creation of the Ridgefield Land Improvement Association , and to a committee overseeing construction of a town house . In 1871 , he accepted a job with the Ridgefield Savings Bank ( later renamed the Fairfield County Bank ) as the company 's first president . After working there until 1879 , Adams took a break from his duties ; during this time , he helped found Ridgefield 's library and served as its treasurer . In 1884 , he returned to the Ridgefield National Bank and remained president there until mid @-@ 1886 . Adams and his family relocated to a house in New Haven , Connecticut , in 1888 . 
 Along with baseball , playing music was among Adams ' favorite activities . Occasionally , he and Henry Ward Beecher performed flute duets . Although no longer actively involved in baseball , Adams was still a follower of the sport . He played in an exhibition as late as 1875 , and stories exist that he played recreationally into the following decade . Late in his life , he said of the growth of baseball , " We pioneers never expected to see the game so universal as it has now become . " Adams contracted pneumonia following a bout of influenza , and died on January 3 , 1899 , at the age of 84 . He was buried at New Haven 's Evergreen Cemetery . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 For decades after Adams ' death , his role in codifying baseball 's early rules was largely unremembered . Thorn included Adams among a group of " powerfully influential figures " from the period — also including Louis F. Wadsworth and Wheaton — who he writes " went unrecognized in their lifetimes and became mysteries to future generations . " Alexander Cartwright was more widely recognized as a pioneering figure for the sport . The Baseball Hall of Fame has claimed that Cartwright was the inventor of 90 @-@ foot ( 27 m ) baselines and the nine @-@ inning game . However , by the time conventions led by Adams had enacted those rules in the late 1850s , Cartwright had traveled to California and was no longer a member of the Knickerbockers . Adams is said to have avoided " campaigning for credit " for rules changes after he left the Knickerbockers ; researcher Gary O <unk> said of him that he " didn 't like to brag . " Several of the rules approved at the conventions survived to modern baseball , including the 90 @-@ foot ( 27 m ) baseline distance . The 45 @-@ foot ( 14 m ) distance from home plate to the pitching mound , however , did not last through the 19th century ; it was pushed back 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in 1880 . The shortstop position , which for Adams was located between the infielders and outfielders , was later played in the infield , between second and third base . Dickey Pearce was the first player to field in that area , and his ability to prevent base hits in the formerly unoccupied territory convinced other teams to employ similar tactics . 
 The Hartford Courant points to 1980 as a year when Adams started to gain greater attention for his achievements . A share of the New York Mets was purchased by a publishing company led by Nelson Doubleday , Jr. that year , and claims that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in 1839 , which are considered flawed by modern researchers , were reported by the media . After the Doubleday reports in 1980 , The New York Times received a letter from the great @-@ grandson of Adams that the Courant said attempted " to try to set the record straight . " The newspaper ran the letter in its April 13 issue , and added a 1939 piece by Roger Adams . In 1993 , Thorn published research on Adams ' contributions in the encyclopedia Total Baseball . The New York Times published an article on Adams on September 23 , 2015 . 
 Various historians have given Adams recognition as an important figure from the early years of baseball . Thorn has written that he " may be counted as first among the Fathers of Baseball . " O <unk> said of Adams : " Without [ him ] , we wouldn 't have the game we know and love as baseball today . " The " father " label was rejected by Ryczek ; he wrote that Adams did not conceive the sport , but called him a " collaborator " in its development . On July 31 , 2014 , the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 " Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend " . Eric <unk> has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer . He says of Adams , " Should he be in the Hall of Fame ? Absolutely . You ask anyone who knows about 19th century baseball . They 'll laugh at Cartwright ; Abner Doubleday , they won 't even talk about ; but they all know Doc Adams . He was the glue that held things together in the early part of baseball . " Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016 , when he was up for consideration on the Hall 's Pre @-@ Integration Era Committee ballot . Ten of the 16 committee members supported him , two fewer than the number needed for induction . 
 While Adams ' contributions had received notice from historians , Associated Press writer Andrew Dalton called such reports " somewhat speculative " in nature before 2016 . That year , the 1857 " Laws of Base Ball " authored by Adams were sold at an auction . The documents were included in a batch of historical papers that brought $ 12 @,@ 000 in a 1999 sale . Adams ' authorship of the papers was unknown at the time , but was confirmed after the owner brought the documents to the attention of an auction house in 2015 . An anonymous buyer purchased the " Laws of Base Ball " in April 2016 for $ 3 @.@ 26 million , the most a series of baseball documents had ever sold for .

 The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , often referred to as just Brisco or Brisco County , is an American Western / science fiction television series created by Jeffrey Boam and Carlton Cuse . It ran for 27 episodes on the Fox network starting in the 1993 – 94 season . Set in the American West of 1893 , the series follows its title character , a Harvard @-@ educated lawyer @-@ turned @-@ bounty hunter hired by a group of wealthy industrialists to track and capture outlaw John Bly and his gang . Bruce Campbell plays Brisco , who is joined by a colorful group of supporting characters , including Julius Carry as fellow bounty hunter Lord Bowler and Christian Clemenson as stick @-@ in @-@ the @-@ mud lawyer Socrates Poole . 
 While ostensibly a Western , the series routinely includes elements of the science fiction and steampunk genres . Humor is a large part of the show ; the writers attempted to keep the jokes and situations " just under over @-@ the @-@ top " . A large number of episodes involve the Orb , a powerful device from the future . John Astin plays Professor Wickwire , an inventor who assists Brisco with anachronistic technology including diving suits , motorcycles , rockets , and airships . The search for new technology and progressive ideas , what the writers of the show called " The Coming Thing " , is a central theme throughout the series . 
 Brisco was developed by Boam and Cuse at the request of Fox executive Bob Greenblatt . Impressed by the duo 's work on the script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore the tone and style of vintage movie serials . The initial ideas and proposals from the show 's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down . Brisco was one of the last television shows to be filmed on the Warner Bros. Western backlot . Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music , which has been reused by the National Broadcasting Company during its coverage of the Olympic Games . 
 During its broadcast run , The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , garnered a small but dedicated following and was well received by critics . The series earned high ratings at the beginning of its season , but later episodes failed to attract a substantial number of viewers . Fox canceled the show at the end of its first and only season . In 2006 , Warner Home Video released a DVD set containing all 27 episodes . The series has been remembered fondly by critics , who praise its humor and unique blend of genres .

 The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , is set in a fictional American Old West of 1893 . Robber barons control the financial and industrial interests of the West from the boardrooms of San Francisco 's Westerfield Club . The famous U.S. Marshal Brisco County , Sr. ( R. Lee Ermey ) has apprehended a gang of outlaws and its leader , the notorious John Bly . While transporting them to stand trial , County is murdered and the gang escapes . Meanwhile , in a nearby mine , a group of shackled Chinese workers unearths " The Orb , " a large golden globe studded with rods . A worker draws one of the rods from out of the Orb , then touches several of his co @-@ workers with it . As each worker is touched with the rod he is imbued with superhuman strength which they use to break the iron chains binding them , thus freeing themselves . The murder of Brisco County , Sr. , and the discovery of the Orb set into motion the major plots of the series . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 Members of the Westerfield Club hire Brisco County , Jr . ( Bruce Campbell ) , the son of the slain U.S. Marshal , to track and re @-@ capture Bly ( Billy Drago ) and his gang . The Westerfield Club 's timid lawyer , Socrates Poole ( Christian Clemenson ) relays instructions and financial support to Brisco . Another bounty hunter , Lord Bowler ( Julius Carry ) , who is known for his expert tracking skills , also hopes to capture Bly . Bitter over the elder County 's fame , Bowler treats Brisco as a rival . The two men often find themselves reluctantly joining forces to achieve a common goal . Later in the series , Brisco and Bowler work together as partners and friends . 
 In the pilot episode , Brisco tracks John Bly 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Big Smith ( M.C. Gainey ) . In a battle on a train car , Brisco knocks Smith off the train and into a river ; he is assumed dead until he reappears later in the series . Brisco , Bowler and Socrates hunt the rest of Bly 's gang in subsequent episodes . All ten of the gang members are captured or killed , and Brisco 's pursuit of Bly , who is seeking the Orb for its supernatural power , frequently puts him into contact with the object . Each encounter with the Orb reveals a fantastic effect on people who use it . In the episode " The Orb Scholar " , Bly shoots Brisco and leaves him to die . Professor Ogden Coles , a scientist who studies the Orb , heals Brisco with the device . In the episode " Bye Bly " , it is revealed that Bly is a fugitive from the distant future who has traveled to 1893 to steal the Orb . Bly plans to use the Orb to travel back to his time and rule the world . Instead , Brisco uses the Orb to travel through time to save Bowler 's life . Brisco eventually kills Bly by stabbing him with a rod from the Orb . Series creator and executive producer Carlton Cuse said that the Orb represents faith and that depending on the intentions of those who use it , the object rewards or punishes them accordingly . 
 The pilot episode introduces several characters who make recurring appearances throughout the series . Big Smith 's moll Dixie Cousins ( Kelly Rutherford ) is a saloon singer and con artist who has a brief romantic encounter with Brisco . In later episodes , Dixie becomes Brisco 's primary love interest . In his first mission , Brisco also meets Professor Albert Wickwire ( John Astin ) , an eccentric scientist who returns to help many times during the series . Wickwire 's ideas and inventions play into Brisco 's interest in technology and the future , something Brisco calls " The Coming Thing " . Pete Hutter ( John Pyper @-@ Ferguson ) is a hapless mercenary working for Bly . He has a compulsive attachment to his " piece " ( pistol ) , and given any opportunity will pontificate about topics such as art and philosophy . Pete appears throughout the series as a comic foil to trade barbs with the heroes . He appears to be killed three times during the series , but returns each time with a comic excuse for why he didn 't die . The second half of the series includes many episodes with Whip Morgan ( Jeff Phillips ) , a young <unk> whose attempts to assist Brisco and Bowler often end up causing trouble .

 The show features classic Western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter showdowns , in combination with atypical elements . Much of the series is devoted to the science fiction plot surrounding the Orb , and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy that has helped Brisco maintain its cult status . In almost every episode , the characters discover or are confronted by fantastic technology . In the pilot episode , Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks . In the episode " Brisco For the Defense " , Brisco uses a slide projector to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence . Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology , including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a helium @-@ filled zeppelin . Campbell told Starlog magazine , " It 's kind of Jules Verne meets The Wild Wild West . " The presence of futuristic technology in a Victorian era Western places the series in the steampunk genre ; it is one of the few such shows to have aired on prime @-@ time television . At least one @-@ third of the show 's episodes contain steampunk or Weird West elements . Though " technology @-@ out @-@ of @-@ time " frequently intrudes into the plots of Brisco , the fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again . Some of these out @-@ of @-@ time technologies were archaic imaginations of those prevalent in the 20th century , and two film researchers , Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper , suggest that followers of the show may be puzzled that such inventions , so useful in their own lives , are not exploited further . 
 According to Cuse , the show was purposefully set in 1893 , exactly 100 years before the series premiered in 1993 . Brisco is meant to be aware of the imminent changes in society and technology and actively looks for them . The writers of the show , and also the character of Brisco , refer to this concept as " The Coming Thing " . Elaborating on this theme , Campbell said , " Basically this show is about the turn of the century , when the Old West met the Industrial Era . Cowboys still chew tobacco and ride the range and states are still territories but , over the horizon , is the onset of electricity , the first autos and telephones . Brisco is in the middle of a transition from the past to the future . " The collision of cowboy characters with puzzling technology and other anachronisms generates humor throughout the series . The writers made it a point to insert scenes mirroring the pop culture of the 20th century , from the apparent invention of the term " UFO " in the pilot episode to the appearance of a sheriff who looks and acts like Elvis Presley . Speaking about the humor of the show , Campbell said , " I would say 30 percent of each episode is being played for laughs . But it 's not a winking at the camera , Airplane @-@ type of humor . We 're funny like Indiana Jones is funny ; the laughs come primarily from the wide variety of ridiculous , colorful characters that come in and out of this series . " 
 = = Cast = = 
 Bruce Campbell went through five auditions for the role of Brisco before he was hired . In his first audition with the casting director , Campbell spontaneously did a standing flip . The stunt impressed the casting director so much that during each subsequent audition , Campbell was asked to do the flip again . In his final audition , Campbell assured the network executives that if hired for the role , he would work hard to make the show a success . In an interview , Campbell said , " It 's every actor 's dream to play a cowboy , so when this opportunity came up , I mean , yeah , where do I sign ? " He added that working on Brisco provided him with acting opportunities he would not have otherwise had . Cuse said getting Campbell " was just one of those collisions between an actor and a script that was just perfect ... I can 't imagine Brisco having ever existed without him . " Writing in Auxiliary Magazine , Luke Copping claimed that Brisco was Campbell 's " last great " role before the actor fell into " a period of self @-@ parody and overt camp that he did not redeem himself from until joining the cast of Burn Notice " . 
 Christian Clemenson went to Harvard with Cuse but still went through the normal audition channels to get the part of Poole . Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved . He later said , " The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West , and my character to that show 's Artemus Gordon , was an important hook for me . It was one of my favorite shows growing up , and as soon as I saw that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show , I called my agent and said , ' I 'll do anything I have to do to get this . ' " Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole . Praising Clemenson 's work on Brisco , Cuse said , " You can 't give him anything he 's not capable of doing . He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast " . 
 Julius Carry saw great potential in the character of Bowler . He had researched black cowboys for a project in college and used that knowledge in his portrayal of Bowler . Carry said that Bowler was similar to the real @-@ life black deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves , in that " Reeves always got his man and would often pull off incredible tricks to bring people in . " Carry knew Clemenson from the time they worked together on the Western television pilot Independence . He had no knowledge of Campbell , but approved of the choice for the leading man after watching Army of Darkness . He later told Starlog , " I saw that he would be very good with the physical stuff and that he could deliver a one @-@ liner . I knew the situation would be good . " The original direction for Bowler was to have him constantly oppose Brisco , but as the series progressed the writers saw the good @-@ natured chemistry between the actors and decided to make Brisco and Bowler a team . Bowler 's race was never an issue in the show . According to Cary Darling , a television critic , this attitude is different from serious Westerns and " may hew more to the truth than one might think " . He said historians have noted that black cowboys were common and that conflicts with white cowboys were rare . 
 Kelly Rutherford 's portrayal of Dixie Cousins , with her emphasis on innuendo and subtext , has been described as " less Miss Kitty ( Gunsmoke ) than Mae West " . Rutherford said that playing Dixie allowed her to fulfill her " fantasy of being Madeline Kahn in Blazing Saddles . " When John Astin was cast he was best known for his portrayal of Gomez Addams in The Addams Family . Cuse said that he and the writers enjoyed paying homage to the television star of their childhoods : " For us , it was like , ' Oh wow , we get to meet John Astin in the guise of employing him on this show ! ' "

 In 1989 , Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was released in the cinemas . It was a commercial success , earning its producers US $ 115 million from domestic screenings . The action @-@ packed story , unfolding in a manner reminiscent of Saturday matinee movie serials , about the adventures of an archaeologist was written by Jeffrey Boam , with development and story help from Carlton Cuse ; this film was their third collaboration , after Lethal Weapon 2 and 3 . According to Cuse , Bob Greenblatt , an executive at Fox Broadcasting Company , engaged him and Boam to develop a television series " because of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade " . Greenblatt wanted a show that had a style similar to the Indiana Jones movies . Cuse started watching old serials and noticed that many fell into two genres : Westerns and science fiction . This gave Boam and Cuse the idea to combine the genres . They decided to emulate the serials ' style ; for example , each act within an episode begins with a title , usually a pun , and ends with a cliffhanger . 
 Boam and Cuse did not intend for the series to be historically accurate . Their aim was to create an action @-@ adventure with a modern feel . Cuse told USA Today , " We 're not approaching this show as if we were doing a period piece . We see it as a contemporary program . Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities . The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too , but you never thought of them that way . " <unk> and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series . The show was intended to be family friendly , so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations . Boam said , " In the two @-@ hour pilot Brisco doesn 't even once have to shoot his gun . Our violence is cartoonish . There is no pain and suffering . " Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements , billboards , and even a trailer shown in movie theaters . When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993 , Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell " isn 't the next big television star , I 'll eat my desk . " 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Cuse served as show runner and head writer . Boam , who served as executive producer , also contributed scripts for the show . The writing staff included John Wirth , Brad Kern , Tom <unk> , David Simkins , and John McNamara . They followed Cuse 's informal instruction that the tone of the show remain " just under over @-@ the @-@ top " : the series would be humorous but not too campy . Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing the stories they conceived . Worth commented , " there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked when you put them on film . That doesn 't always happen . " Cuse described long hours writing the show , including several overnight sessions . Each episode of Brisco was filmed in seven days , so the turn @-@ around time for scripts was one week . McNamara said that he became a " student of TV history " while writing for Brisco , reviewing old episodes of Maverick for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre . He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a " trans @-@ genre form " , because much of the audience grew up with Lethal Weapon , Star Trek , and The Wild Wild West . Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer 's familiarity with Mark Twain 's novel <unk> <unk> Wilson . Porter and Porter describe the novel as an " ancestor text " , because the characters of Brisco and Bly both refer to it , and say that this type of literary device is used again by Cuse in Lost . 
 One of the challenges the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production . Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series . An example given by the writers was Boam 's idea for a full @-@ sized " pirate ship on wheels " . The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create . They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons . Kern said it was better to " shoot past the mark , and come back to it , rather than start below it . " He elaborated on this , saying , " if you envision the 40 @-@ foot galleon and go back from that , you 'll always end up with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse . " 
 As the series progressed during its broadcast season , the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science @-@ fiction , comedy and traditional Western elements . Cuse said , " I think we did a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network . " However , midway through the first season , the writers made a thematic shift from science @-@ fiction to more comedy and adventure . Cuse said , " We were biting off more than we could chew ... we were trying to do a comedic action adventure Western , with tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek humor , genuine drama , plus science fiction . All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously . " By the final third of the series , the writers had wrapped up the science @-@ fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs .

 The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , was filmed primarily on the Warner Bros. soundstages . Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot , known as Laramie Street . It was one of the last Western shows to use the backlot . Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s . Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia , California ; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles ; and the <unk> Ranch in Santa Clarita , California . Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at <unk> 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown , California . A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park . 
 Comet was portrayed by five horses , each with a different talent . The main horse was Copper , chosen by veteran wrangler Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle . Campbell nicknamed the horse " Leadbelly " due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes . Another horse , Boss , was used for long @-@ range shots , chase scenes , and elaborate stunts , such as leaps through windows . Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared . Near the end of the season , a horse named Comet was trained , its name chosen so that the horse would get used to hearing it on set . The " true show horse " was Strip , which was adept at doing tricks , such as lip movements , head nods , and hoof stamping . According to Spencer , all those stunts " as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that " were done by Strip . For these scenes , Spencer would stand off @-@ camera and use a stick to signal Strip . Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and filled it with grain to reward Strip after every take . No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper . With white colorings on his nose and legs , Strip 's appearance was chosen for Brisco 's steed ; Copper and the other horses were touched up with " clown white " greasepaint to match Strip 's markings . 
 Foley artist Casey Crabtree provided sounds for horse hoof movements , work that was praised by sounds effects industry expert David <unk> . He said of Crabtree 's work on Brisco , " Her horses sounded so natural and real – their hooves , the sound of their hooves on the texture of the ground , the sound of saddle movement , bridle jingles – it was as good as anything I would want for a feature film , and this was episodic television . " The make @-@ up on many of Brisco 's episodes was done by veteran artist Mel Berns , Jr . 
 Two props of the Orb were made . One of the prop Orbs was used for stunts and had retractable rods . A second version was manufactured from cast bronze , making it heavy : " You really didn 't want to have to handle it , " Campbell said . The rocket car seen in the pilot episode was built by special effects coordinator Kam Cooney and was a working vehicle with an internal combustion engine and throttle controls . Some items used in the show had been repurposed from older productions , and some would later be used in other shows . For example , the steam locomotive seen in the pilot episode was the same as the one used in Back to the Future Part III . Two of Carry 's prop guns – rifles whose barrels were sawed @-@ off in fashion of the Mare 's Leg – were later reused in the science fiction television series Firefly . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Stephen Graziano and <unk> Ray Bunch composed original music for the series . Composed by Randy Edelman , the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show 's following ; in the mid @-@ 1990s , the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) hired Edelman to provide music for its sports coverage , including National Football League games and the Olympics . The music samples Edelman sent NBC included the Brisco theme , and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics . NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1997 World Series . Edelman said , " It was original , and it seemed to have the right spirit . It 's got a very flowing melody , it 's triumphant , and it has a certain warmth . And it has at the end of it , what all television things like this have , a ' button , ' an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop it down into a 15 @-@ second thing . " Cary Darling said that the " booming " theme song was " part Magnificent Seven , part Aaron Copland and as grand and wide as ' Big Sky Country ' " .

 In July 1993 , Brisco 's two @-@ hour pilot was screened for television critics in Los Angeles . Initial critical reaction to the pilot was positive and focused on the humor and the science fiction plot points . USA Today 's Matt Roush enjoyed the campy humor and the cast of the show , saying it worked on many levels and would " please all but the family curmudgeon . " Calling Brisco " one of the best shows of the fall season " , Jennifer Stevenson of the St. Petersburg Times praised the show 's " intelligent , satirical asides " . Kay Gardella wrote in the New York Daily News that the pilot set itself " apart from others of genre " with its humorous script and sight gags . The Los Angeles Times called Brisco " gratifying nonsense " , and praised Campbell and the supporting cast for supplying humor without " going over the top " . Some critics , such as Walter Goodman of The New York Times and David Hiltbrand of People , found the supporting characters " weakly cast " and not as strong as Campbell in the lead . Other reviewers praised the overall look of the show , such as Todd Everett of Variety , who approved of the " strong comic @-@ book visual style " and the pilot 's high production values . Writing in the Washington Post , Tom Shales said that the pilot 's production was " more <unk> than <unk> " . 
 The pilot 's science @-@ fiction plot elements were appreciated by New York magazine , which wrote favorably about the " millenarianism " of the show , including Brisco 's use of a rocket to travel on railroad tracks . While Rod Dreher of the Washington Times liked the " nifty " Orb subplot , some critics responded negatively to the Orb . The Washington Post 's Shales called the Orb " hokey supernatural bunk " . Other reviewers complained generally about the broad mix of genres and number of subplots in the pilot . While TV Guide 's Jeff Jarvis roundly praised the quality of the pilot and called Brisco his favorite Fox show of 1993 , he criticized the pilot for being " padded with outlaws and mysterious orbs " . Diane Werts of Newsday similarly said that Brisco " just about hits the bulls eye " with its " sharp wit " and " thrill a minute " action , although she noted that the pilot was over @-@ packed with characters and subplots . Writing in The New York Times , Goodman said , " The writers try everything , including some business involving raiders of a lost orb , without much of a payoff . " 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker enjoyed the " nervy attempt to do something different with the TV Western " in the pilot and said that " Brisco County is less a satire of the Western 's cliches than a revitalization of them . " Writing in the Toronto Star , Greg Quill said that the pilot introduced Brisco as " a western in the loosest use of the term " . Quill noted that the pilot includes " every cliche in the western movie arsenal " , but that " everything , from characters to plot turns , is skewed away from the norm " , and that the pilot episode rose above the level of western spoof to become an " outrageously confident tribute to ... the best of the genre " .

 During the broadcast run of The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , TV Guide featured a positive review of the show in its Couch Critic column and wrote , " It 's as funny as it is exciting , which is not an easy combo to pull off ... it 's fresh and funny and different , and that 's why we like it . " The magazine twice listed Brisco as a family @-@ friendly TV program : " Back when some of us grew up , Westerns were synonymous with great family entertainment , but – let 's be honest – some of them were dull as dust . Not this one . Brisco is a Western with a sense of humor , filled with impish action for kids and adults . " 
 The Wall Street Journal reviewed a host of Westerns from 1992 and 1993 and said that Brisco was " the most sheer fun of the bunch " , calling it " a period piece with slick production values and a mix of drama and humor , fast pace and high camp . " In an article on the 1993 television season , the Toronto Star 's Greg Quill wrote that Brisco was a program that represented " American TV craft at the top of its form " . In contrast , Elvis Mitchell of Spin magazine gave Brisco a scathing review , calling the show 's premise a " tedious ... rickety gimmick " . Mitchell acknowledged the show 's " quick reflexes " , but said the humor was " uncomfortable " with a " cynical quickness " . He added , " Brisco County relieves us of the burden of laughing . It spends too much time looking at itself in the mirror , admiring its own adorable dimpled half @-@ smile . " 
 Viewership figures for Brisco fell as its season progressed and in 1994 , it was listed in TV Guide 's annual " Save Our Shows " article . Readers were requested to write in and vote to save one of the four listed shows – one from each television network – that were in danger of being cancelled . The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , won with 34 @.@ 7 percent of the 72 @,@ 000 votes cast . Cuse said the vote " reaffirms for me a feeling I 've had – namely that the Nielsens aren 't accurately reflecting people 's interest in this show , " adding that , given Fox 's then relatively small share of the market , it was notable that the show got more votes than any of the programs from NBC , CBS , and ABC . 
 Writing in USA Today , Matt Roush encouraged readers to watch the low @-@ rated show , saying that families should watch it rather than " that interchangeable T.G.I.F. tripe " . He said , " Brisco is mighty lavish but even more mightily loony , happily saddled with broad sight gags and tortured puns . " Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly speculated that mainstream success eluded the show because of its mixing of genres . He said , " Brisco refuses to behave like a normal Western , mixing in sci @-@ fi , slapstick , and ... kung fu . " The Chicago Tribune 's Scott Williams praised Brisco for its " strong supporting cast " and " superb physical comedy and crisp dialogue " . He said the show should have been a hit , but that the Friday night time slot hampered its ratings . 
 = = = Level of violence = = = 
 Brisco was criticized early on for the violence it portrayed ; meant to be comical , a scene in the pilot in which four villains accidentally kill each other in a crossfire troubled critics instead . Cuse insisted that the show was still appropriate for children , saying , " I think we 're very conscious of violence and I think we 've made an effort to avoid violence in the pilot and in the future episodes " . Halfway through the season , U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan singled out Brisco as the most violent show on television based on a study at Minnesota 's Concordia University , in which students watched 132 hours of network and cable programming , during the week of September 28 to October 4 , 1993 . The students tallied each act of violence , and found that Brisco had 117 violent acts per hour . The study deemed Brisco more violent than the film Beverly Hills Cop , which was also viewed for the study . Cuse called the criticism " patently ridiculous , " noting that only one episode of the show was viewed , in which a boxing match takes place . Each punch and jab was counted as an act of violence . Cuse spoke out against legislation to curb television violence , saying that politicians were " chasing a false objective . " He said it was the job of a show 's producer to control the moral content of a television program and the parents ' duty to monitor what their children watch . 
 The Los Angeles Times printed a story about Senator Dorgan 's efforts to elicit a response from the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) with the title " Fox Tops Tally of Violence on Major TV Networks Media : Study of a week of prime @-@ time shows also lists ' Brisco County ' as bloodiest series . Senator wants FCC to issue report card , name sponsors . " Cuse responded by writing a letter to the editor . In the letter , entitled " ' Brisco County ' Is a Family @-@ Oriented Series " , Cuse objected to the newspaper story title labeling Brisco as the " bloodiest series " . He said that Senator Dorgan 's press release did not mention blood and that the show 's violence should be viewed in context . Cuse added the show had been listed as family friendly in other publications , and that he read every viewer letter sent regarding the show . " The overwhelming majority praise " Brisco County " for being a show that the entire family can watch together . After 15 original airings , I have not received one single letter criticizing the show on the grounds of violence or violent content . " When the US Senate discussed forcing broadcast and cable networks to regulate violent programming , Cuse said that self @-@ regulation within the industry was a positive move . As he operated on his " own internal moral principles " , the measures would not affect his week @-@ to @-@ week work .

 Writing in People magazine in 1995 , Craig Tomashoff said the cancellation of Brisco was " one of the tragedies going into [ the 1994 – 1995 ] TV season " . Tomashoff suggested that the show influenced UPN 's Legend , another Western series with comedy and science fiction elements . Reflecting on the show in the Orange County Register in 1996 , critic Cary Darling lamented Brisco 's cancellation , saying that the show " stood way out from the rest of the broadcast pack . " Darling reviewed the show , describing it as " a witty , multiracial Western that tempered its fisticuffs with fantasy , its innocence with irony , and its romantic vision of the Old West with an abiding New World faith in the future 's infinite possibilities . " Writing in Entertainment Weekly , Ken Tucker called the show a " one season wonder " that was " ahead of its time " . 
 When the series was released on DVD , critics remembered it fondly . Video Librarian called Brisco " criminally short @-@ lived " and " wildly entertaining . " Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the series an " A- " , calling the show " smart @-@ alecky and witty , suspenseful and absurd . " IGN DVD called the DVD set " impressive " and said that the series was " a satisfying show that hits its mark " . Auxiliary Magazine called Brisco " one of the greatest sci @-@ fi / Western epics in television history " and compared it favorably to the more well @-@ known sci @-@ fi / Western shows , Firefly and The Wild Wild West . In its 2006 gift guide , the Christian Science Monitor gave Brisco a positive review , saying , " Folks , there are so few comic sci @-@ fi / Westerns , they should be celebrated , not canceled prematurely .

 The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , premiered on the Fox network at 8 : 00 pm on Friday , August 27 , 1993 , with a two @-@ hour pilot movie . To bolster viewer interest in the show , Fox rebroadcast the pilot two days later at 7 : 00 pm . Both airings of the pilot returned strong ratings . Brisco 's ratings for the pilot and first episode were high , particularly with the demographic of adults aged 18 – 49 . The series was aired in Canada , including on Global Toronto ( channel 29 ) . 
 The pilot movie was followed by 26 episodes , each 45 minutes long and airing at 8 : 00 pm on Fridays . Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushaw openly touted Brisco and its star Bruce Campbell . The network fully expected the show to be its breakout hit of the year , a distinction which eventually went to Brisco 's follow @-@ up , The X @-@ Files . Hoping that more viewers would follow Brisco as it progressed , Fox approved producing an entire season of the show , despite post @-@ pilot low ratings . Subsequent episodes failed to attract more viewers and the show was cancelled at end of its first and only season . After the series ended , Fox retransmitted the show on Sunday nights at 8 : 00 pm during July and August 1994 . The show was later broadcast for a short time in syndication , airing on the U.S. cable channel TNT .

 As the season progressed , the ratings declined , greatly hurting the show 's chances of being renewed . Writer John McNamara partially blamed Brisco 's low ratings on its Friday 8 : 00 p.m. time slot . He said not many people watch television at that time , so " fighting for numbers " then was " like being stuck on Normandy beach " . Grushaw acknowledged the high quality of the show and the vocal support from its small fan base . " Obviously the viewers are very passionate about the show ... and when you read some of the things they have to say , it gives you real pause , " Grushaw told USA Today in 1994 . By May of that year , Grushaw said renewing Brisco was a 50 – 50 call . At the end of its season , Brisco was one of the lowest rated shows of the year , and Fox confirmed its cancellation in June . 
 Brisco 's writers were planning for another season before the show 's cancellation . They had not penned the ending of the first season as a finale for the series and had broad ideas for the second season , which would have featured Brisco settling in as the sheriff of a small town . In his autobiography , Campbell mused , " To explain why a TV show is canceled is almost impossible . Ironically Brisco , with its off @-@ kilter humor , wouldn 't have been developed on any other network , yet the appeal of ' Westerns ' was still rural – not the side Fox 's urban bread was buttered on . " 
 Writer and supervising producer Brad Kern reflected on the show 's cancellation , saying , " Ten years later , everybody you talk to ... they all love the show . I think that was the biggest disappointment about the show not coming back . We knew we were doing something special . " Told of the show 's success in the TV Guide " Save Our Shows " poll , Sandy Grushow said , " Obviously I 'm happy and not entirely surprised , " but added , " You can 't dismiss a season 's worth of ratings . " Kim Manners , director on nearly a third of the Brisco episodes , said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively . He told writer Joe Nazzaro , " It really woke me up as a director , almost spiritually , " and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X @-@ Files . Manners said , " When they didn 't give it a second year , I was devastated , " adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco . Considering the show 's short life , Cuse later commented , " If the show could have survived into a second season , I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time . Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience . I think if circumstances had been different , Brisco could have had a much longer life . " Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Brisco 's chances of building an audience , saying , " We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night , which is sort of a death slot – I mean people do still go bowling – few shows have succeeded in that slot .

 In 2005 , Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly posted that The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . , deserved to be released on DVD . Gord Lacey , the creator of the website <unk> , told the New York Daily News that Brisco was among the five most requested shows on the site . Lacey spent several years lobbying industry contacts to get Brisco released on DVD . This led to correspondence with Cuse , who also wanted to get a DVD set produced . On July 18 , 2006 , Warner Home Video released The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr . : The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1 , an 8 @-@ disc DVD set that contains all 27 episodes of the series . The release includes commentary tracks from Campbell and Cuse ; an interactive menu of Brisco 's signature references narrated by Campbell ; The History of Brisco County , Jr . , documentary ; a feature called A Reading from the Book of Bruce ; and another gallery hosted by Campbell focusing on the gadgets from the show .

 Third and Fourth streets , as part of the Coronado street system , have existed since the 19th century , and were paved in the early 20th century . SR 282 was designated in 1968 , around the time the San Diego – Coronado Bridge was opened . Attempts to build first a highway , and later a tunnel , to allow base traffic to bypass the Coronado city streets , were rejected by voters in 1974 and 2010 , respectively . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 282 begins at Alameda Boulevard as a one @-@ way couplet consisting of Third and Fourth streets . The portion of Alameda Boulevard between Third and Fourth streets is also part of SR 282 westbound . McCain Boulevard and Tow Way continue west from the Fourth and Third street intersections with Alameda Boulevard into Naval Air Station North Island , respectively . Third and Fourth streets continue through the intersections of I – J avenues , Palm Avenue , and D – H avenues , passing through a residential area . Third Street goes by Palm Park , and Fourth Street by Triangle Park ; both are at the intersections with Palm Avenue . SR 282 travels slightly southeast towards its terminus at SR 75 ( Orange Avenue ) . 
 SR 282 is part of the National Highway System ( NHS ) , a network of highways that are essential to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . In 2013 , SR 282 had an annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) of 13 @,@ 300 on Fourth Avenue between J Avenue and Alameda Boulevard , and 24 @,@ 200 on Alameda Boulevard between Third and Fourth Streets , the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway . 
 = = History = = 
 The intersection of Third Street and Orange Avenue dates back to at least 1890 . Coronado began to commission the paving of much of its street system in the early 1910s . In November 1911 , the board of trustees in Coronado approved the paving of Third Street from Orange Avenue to what was K Avenue . It soon became the goal of the city to have all streets paved before the 1915 San Diego World Exposition . The streets west of Orange Avenue were to be handled in one contract , using " decomposed granite and oil . " Third Street had already been paved with this material by 1913 . 
 SR 282 was initially designated in 1967 solely along Fourth Street from SR 75 to the Naval Air Station ; however , it was not to be in effect until the San Diego – Coronado Bridge was completed . Nevertheless , before the bridge opened , the designation was added in the 1968 legislative session , along with the portion of Orange Avenue from the Coronado Ferry landing to Fourth Street , which was to be removed once the Coronado Bay Bridge opened . The designation came into effect on February 21 , 1969 . In April , plans were under way to repave Fourth and Third Streets and add signals at the Orange Avenue intersections . The bridge opened on August 3 , 1969 . In September , the City of Coronado added Third Street as a truck route going westbound to the base , in addition to the already @-@ existing Fourth Street truck route leaving the base . 
 In 1974 , Proposition N was proposed to attempt to resolve concerns regarding traffic in Coronado . The plan was to build another highway along the northern and eastern shore of Coronado Island , to bypass the busy residential and commercial districts and provide easy access to the North Island Naval Air Station from the western end of the bridge . The proposition asked voters whether the City Council should " actively pursue " the matter . Previous proposals had included widening Fourth Street to be able to handle traffic in both directions . Critics contended that the highway would block the view of the San Diego Bay . Coronado Mayor Rolland <unk> opposed the proposal in early November 1974 as it would require approval from over 30 government agencies and would force the city to continue with it , although some declared the road " impossible to build . " The voters rejected this plan , and the City Council then voted to keep traffic along Third and Fourth streets , closing the gate at First and Second streets . The bridge and the resulting traffic continued to be a hotly debated issue in the early 1980s . A plan in 1981 to convert Fourth Street into an expressway leading to the naval station was strongly opposed by the public due to the required demolition of structures and a lack of evidence that the plan would succeed in reducing traffic ; by this time , Third and Fourth streets had been converted into one @-@ way streets between the bridge and the naval station . 
 In April 2006 , the Navy commenced construction on an entrance to the Naval Air Station from the intersection of Third Street and Alameda Boulevard . The new entrance was completed in July 2007 , and the existing entrance and exit on Fourth Street was made an exit @-@ only station . Before then , traffic entering the base had to continue southwest on Alameda Boulevard , making a left on Fourth Street . This change was expected to reduce congestion in downtown Coronado . 
 The City of Coronado has attempted to have a tunnel built from the Coronado bridge to the San Diego Naval Base numerous times , and hired Ledford Enterprises to help with the lobbying process in 2002 and 2006 . The city endorsed a proposed study in 2004 to determine possible alternatives to resolve the traffic issues , which included keeping the status quo . On June 8 , 2010 , Coronado voters decided against Proposition H , which would have advised the city to undergo further investigation into building a tunnel between the Coronado bridge and the San Diego Naval Base . This concluded ten years of studies and proposals by the city of Coronado to find a way to reduce traffic to the naval station during rush hour . Critics of the proposal did not believe that the tunnel would resolve the traffic issues . Following this , the Coronado City Council voted to abolish the Tunnel Commission .

 Marc Ravalomanana , <unk> ( Malagasy : [ <unk> ̥ ] ) ( born 12 December 1949 ) is a Malagasy politician who was the President of Madagascar from 2002 to 2009 . Born into a farming Merina family in Imerinkasinina , near the capital city of Antananarivo , Ravalomanana first rose to prominence as the founder and CEO of the vast dairy conglomerate <unk> , later launching successful wholesaler <unk> and several additional companies . 
 He entered politics upon founding the Tiako <unk> political party in 1999 and successfully ran for the position of mayor of Antananarivo , holding the position from 1999 to 2001 . As mayor he improved sanitary and security conditions in the city . In August 2001 he announced his candidacy as an independent in the December 2001 presidential election . He then took office as President in 2002 amidst a dispute over election results in which he successfully pressed his claim to have won a majority in the first round . Under the leadership of Jacques Sylla , Ravalomanana 's Prime Minister from 2002 to 2007 , the political party Tiako i Madagasikara ( TIM ) was founded in 2002 to support Ravalomanana 's presidency and came to dominate legislative and local elections . He was re @-@ elected in December 2006 , again with a majority in the first round . 
 During Ravalomanana 's presidency , Madagascar made significant advances toward development targets and experienced an average of seven per cent growth per year . His administration oversaw the construction of thousands of new schools and health clinics . Road rehabilitation aided in improving rural farmers ' access to markets . The establishment of the independent anti @-@ corruption agency BIANCO , and the adoption of diverse supporting policies resulted in a decline in government corruption . The acreage of natural areas under protection expanded in fulfillment of Ravalomanana 's " Madagascar Naturally " development program . The 2007 release of Ravalomanana 's comprehensive development strategy , the Madagascar Action Plan , set targets and goals for national development over his second term in the areas of governance , infrastructure , agriculture , health , economy , environment and national solidarity . 
 Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in the later period of his presidency , accusing him of increasing authoritarianism and the mixing of public and private interests . In addition , the benefits of the country 's growth were not evenly spread , leading to increased wealth inequality , inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes . In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo , the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo , Andry Rajoelina , strengthened popular disapproval of his policies . Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition , leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana 's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d 'état . 
 From 2009 to 2012 Ravalomanana lived in exile in South Africa , where he was engaged in active negotiations with Rajoelina and former heads of state Albert Zafy and Didier Ratsiraka to organize national elections . In December 2012 he declared he would not present himself as a candidate , then a precondition to the elections being viewed as legitimate by the international community . TGV candidate Hery Rajaonarimampianina was elected president in January 2014 , defeating Jean @-@ Louis Robinson , the candidate of Marc Ravalomanana 's camp . Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 he was arrested , having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration . After his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest in May 2015 , Ravalomanana announced the re @-@ opening of the Tiko business group and was re @-@ elected the president of TIM . 
 = = Early years = = 
 The youngest of eight siblings , Marc Ravalomanana was born on 12 December 1949 to a farming family of humble means in the village of Imerinkasinina , 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) east of Antananarivo in <unk> District . Ravalomanana 's parents worked as peddlers before opening a small shop in a rural village in Tamatave Province . Anticipating the regional violence that erupted during the 1947 Malagasy Uprising against French colonial rule , the family relocated to a village near their ancestral lands outside Antananarivo . Once resettled in the highlands , Ravalomanana 's mother worked as a seamstress in addition to assisting her husband with farming their land . 
 Ravalomanana 's family origins are Merina , the island 's largest and most politically prominent ethnic group . The Ravalomanana family tomb is outside the historic walls of the village , a placement that would typically indicate the family 's origins lie with the hova ( commoners ' caste ) , rather than the andriana — the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar . His later entry into the political sphere has made the question of his caste background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press . Biographer Vivier ( 2007 ) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin . 
 From a young age he regularly attended the Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar ( FJKM ) , a Reformed Protestant church and , with 2 @.@ 5 million adherents , the most important religious association in Madagascar . As a youth he sang in the choir and later taught catechism . 
 From age five he began attending <unk> public primary school , located 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) from Imerinkasinina . He walked this distance daily , often departing early with baskets of watercress to sell to train passengers at the nearby station . He completed his upper primary schooling at the Protestant missionary @-@ run <unk> private school in <unk> , where his mother arranged for him to live with a host family . After completing his primary studies he attended the Swedish missionary @-@ run technical secondary school in <unk> . He lived with one of his brothers and began producing and selling yogurt in individual serving pots to local villagers and students as a means to subsidize his studies . During this time he met his future wife , Lalao <unk> , a classmate at the secondary school . In 1972 , in a climate of increasing political instability and widespread school @-@ based protests against the Tsiranana administration , Ravalomanana dropped out of the school 's eleventh grade program at the age of 23 ; he then pursued further technical training in Fianarantsoa . He participated in NGO @-@ sponsored entrepreneurship training in Sweden and Germany , and business studies in Denmark underwritten by the Danish ambassador . After returning to Madagascar , he wed Lalao on 12 November 1974 ; their marriage produced one daughter and three sons . 
 = = Entrepreneur = = 
 Upon completing his studies , Ravalomanana returned to <unk> District , where he and his family began making and selling homemade yogurts , a common artisanal product in the highlands region . On his bicycle , he collected milk from farmers in neighboring towns , gradually increasing his production and clientele . He opened his first yogurt and cheese production center in 1977 in <unk> on land he named Rova @-@ Tiko ( " Tiko Palace " ) , where he would build the first Tiko factory several years later . His wife handled the administrative and accounting side of the business from <unk> , where the storage facility for finished products was located . By the end of the 1970s , Ravalomanana 's dairy business employed five salaried staff members and was distributing its products in stores across Antananarivo . 
 Ravalomanana solicited a loan from the Agence Française de <unk> to further expand his business , but this request was denied , souring his view of France . His subsequent request to the World Bank for 1 @.@ 5 million US dollars was approved , and in 1982 he founded the Tiko company . The representative of the World Bank to Madagascar at the time , José <unk> , secured the loan with exceptionally favorable reimbursement conditions that enabled Ravalomanana to sell his products at a lower cost than other small dairy producers , which gradually put his most significant competitors out of business . <unk> later left his post at the World Bank to become a principal investor in the company , joined by private investors from South Africa , Germany and the United States . As Tiko continued to grow , the entrepreneur began incorporating imported ingredients such as powdered milk from South Africa ( constituting 80 per cent of the composition of Tiko dairy products ) and surplus butter from Europe , further improving the profitability of his business and enabling additional diversification . Tiko Group first concentrated exclusively on the production of dairy products before expanding into fruit juices , ice cream , cooking oil and carbonated beverages . The Tiko slogan printed on many of the group 's products , Vita Malagasy ( " Made in Madagascar " ) , reflected Ravalomanana 's national pride and his vision that Madagascar should develop a larger capacity to produce quality goods for distribution for national and international markets . 
 Ravalomanana cultivated political relationships to facilitate the continued growth of Tiko in spite of an economic climate non @-@ conducive to free enterprise under the Socialist administration of Ratsiraka . Early support in the 1980s came from the Supreme Counselor of the Revolution <unk> <unk> , then @-@ Minister of Finance <unk> <unk> , and another minister , Justin <unk> . By the mid @-@ 1980s , the profitability of his Tiko enterprise enabled Ravalomanana to purchase a costly villa formerly owned by French colonial governor Leon <unk> in the central <unk> neighborhood of Antananarivo . 
 In 1997 , under the pretext of concern about mad cow disease , Ratsiraka obstructed Ravalomanana 's plans to build a farm stocked with imported high @-@ yield milk cows . Ravalomanana overcame the objection by breeding high @-@ yield cows locally , thereby further boosting Tiko production . Later that same year , Ratsiraka 's daughters began competing with Tiko by importing and reselling vegetable oil under the brand name " Eden " . When Norbert Ratsirahonana declared himself a candidate in the 1997 presidential elections against Ratsiraka and Albert Zafy , Ravalomanana provided significant financial contributions to the Ratsirahonana campaign in return for tax exemptions on his edible oil products for a period of five years . The profits he consequently earned were reinvested to create the <unk> wholesale company in 1998 . By 2001 , over a dozen principal warehouses throughout the country enabled widespread distribution of Tiko products to urban and rural areas , with a flagship warehouse in the <unk> neighborhood of Antananarivo . 
 The Ratsiraka administration launched an inquiry into Tiko business practices in September 2000 and issued an executive decision in June 2001 that the company should be shut down for failure to adhere to a 1996 agreement requiring Tiko to create jobs and produce low @-@ cost vegetable oil ; this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court on 16 October 2002 . A number of lawsuits have been filed over Ravalomanana 's business practices , including a court judgment on the eve of the 2001 presidential election requiring the payment of between 200 and 363 billion Malagasy francs in Tiko back taxes , but all were either dismissed or ended in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement ; none resulted in a criminal conviction . 
 At its height during the period of Ravalomanana 's presidency , Tiko provided direct salaried employment to between 1 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 000 staff and indirect employment to over 10 @,@ 000 . The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector . The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man . In the mandatory self @-@ disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates , Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion Malagasy francs . He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc . , 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products , a portfolio worth 13 @.@ 1 billion Malagasy francs , and declared 77 million Malagasy francs in annual revenues . Vivier ( 2007 ) demonstrates that the valuation of Ravalomanana 's holdings and his annual revenue in particular were significantly underestimated . 
 = = Mayor of Antananarivo = = 
 In 1999 , Ravalomanana decided to register as an independent candidate in the Antananarivo mayoral election rather than finance a representative from another party . The president of the Judged By Your Work Party ( AVI ) , Norbert Lala Ratsirahonana , had met the entrepreneur several years prior in relation to Tiko business matters . The two discussed the possibility that Ravalomanana could run as an AVI candidate , but this idea was abandoned . His principal opponent , former Prime Minister Guy Willy <unk> of the Association for the Rebirth of Madagascar ( <unk> party ) , suffered from low popularity , leading Ratsiraka to tacitly support Ravalomanana 's candidature against the representative of his own party . By contrast , Ravalomanana was an unknown , attracting attention primarily for his considerable success in employment and wealth creation through Tiko , and his esteemed role as Vice President of the Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar , which was vocal in its support for the candidate . 
 Supporters among Ravalomanana 's high @-@ level Tiko staff established a group to promote his campaign , which he named Tiako <unk> ( " I Love Antananarivo " ) . The candidate spent over 700 million Malagasy francs on the campaign , drawn from the proceeds of his business and private donations . His campaign staff widely distributed promotional posters featuring the candidate 's face , name and slogan , and handed out free Tiko yogurts and boxes of milk to the public . Ravalomanana 's campaign posters often featured the Tiko logo and images of the candidate riding a bicycle laden with milk canisters to play on his image as a simple and poor farmer who , through intelligence , determination and responsible management , succeeded in developing a thriving business and would apply these same skills to develop the capital city . The Ravalomanana campaign received support on the basis of his evident success as a manager , his leadership in the Christian community and his non @-@ alignment with Ratsiraka 's <unk> party , as well as his relative youthfulness and physical attractiveness to female voters . The campaign opened on 2 November 1999 , and by 8 November Ravalomanana held a led in the polls . In the 14 November municipal elections , Ravalomanana was elected mayor of Antananarivo with 45 per cent of the votes . 
 Upon being elected mayor , Ravalomanana prioritized sanitation , security and public administration in the capital city . Provided a budget of approximately 11 million US dollars to manage Antananarivo , Ravalomanana took initiative to secure additional funds . He established a bank account for public and business contributions to city improvement projects , raising over $ 700 @,@ 000 in six months . He obtained funds from international donors to establish garbage collection and disposal systems , restore dilapidated infrastructure such as roads and marketplaces and replant public gardens . He received regular guidance and council from Kurt Schmoke , recently Mayor of Baltimore , Maryland , with whom he had developed a friendship through his biannual business trips to the United States as CEO of Tiko . To improve sanitation conditions in the city , he constructed public latrines in densely populated or highly frequented areas . During his tenure , construction in the capital increased sharply , with twelve new supermarkets constructed in two years . Ravalomanana launched an initiative to install or repair street lights throughout the city to improve nighttime safety . He increased the number of police officers on the streets , leading to a drop in crime . His relationship with President Ratsiraka remained good through his early tenure as mayor , although his decision on 28 June 2001 to eliminate " red zones " – areas of the city where public assembly and protests were prohibited – provoked Ratsiraka 's strong disapproval . 
 In an August 2000 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle , Ravalomanana expressed the belief that development in Madagascar would require greater personal responsibility among the Malagasy populace , a better business environment , environmental protection and reduced corruption . In response to increasing media speculation that he could be a strong candidate for the presidency , he stated that he was ambivalent toward the prospect , declaring " I miss the freedom of business , the ease of getting things done . "

 = = = Presidential election of 2001 = = = 
 On 5 August 2001 , in front of the FJKM church in his village of birth , Ravalomanana announced his intent to run for President in the election to be held on 16 December . His campaign promoted his image as a self @-@ made man who would draw upon his business acumen to develop the country and played upon his relative youth ( he was then aged 52 ) and his non @-@ alliance with the elderly " political dinosaurs " who had dominated politics over the previous three decades . His humble origins as a village farmer inspired support among rural voters , who made up over four @-@ fifths of the population . He was seen as the embodiment of the meritocracy many voters wished to see established in Madagascar in place of corrupt power networks dominated by nepotism . The Counsel of Christian Churches of Madagascar ( <unk> ) rallied behind Ravalomanana , whose electoral slogan was " Don 't be afraid , but have faith . " Ravalomanana received counsel and support for his campaign from the former mayor of Baltimore and a director of former US President Bill Clinton 's campaign . 
 Ravalomanana 's announcement sparked retaliatory actions by the Ratsiraka administration , resulting in frequent defamatory attacks in the press and a court judgment fining him 300 billion Malagasy francs ( 55 @.@ 6 million Euros ) in unpaid back taxes , and two other lawsuits in relation to his management of Tiko , which were later settled out of court . These attacks were denounced by spokesmen for Ravalomanana 's campaign support network , Tiako <unk> ( TIM ) , and in speeches the candidate delivered in urban and rural areas across the island , with travel made possible by his considerable personal wealth and the airplane and seven distribution helicopters registered to Tiko . Tiko distribution channels were used to distribute posters , baseball caps , tee @-@ shirts and other promotional materials . 
 October 2001 polls showed Ravalomanana ahead of Ratsiraka . Following the December election , official results put Ravalomanana in first place , with 46 per cent , against Ratsiraka 's 40 per cent ; without a majority , a run @-@ off would be required between the two candidates . Ravalomanana , claiming to have won a majority in the first round , refused to participate in a run @-@ off , instead demanding that the High Constitutional Court review the votes . Ratsiraka 's supporters then blockaded the capital , which Ravalomanana 's supporters controlled . Ravalomanana declared himself president on 22 February 2002 . After a recount , on 29 April 2002 the High Constitutional Court pronounced Ravalomanana the winner of an absolute majority in the first round of the election , and he was sworn in on 6 May . Ravalomanana dispatched soldiers to bring pockets of resistance under control , with incidents of unrest continuing until Ratsiraka fled into exile on 5 July 2002 after losing control of most of the country 's provinces . 
 = = = First term = = = 
 Upon election to the presidency , Ravalomanana sought to mitigate the negative economic impact of the eight @-@ month political standoff with Ratsiraka , which had cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure , including bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson . He enacted a series of new laws , policies and reforms that sought to efface remaining traces of Ratsiraka 's socialist ideology and replace it with a firmly capitalist , market @-@ driven economic environment . In a break with tradition , the new head of state moved away from reliance on its principal trading partner , France , and cultivated relationships with partners such as Germany , the United States and South Korea as part of his strategy for Madagascar 's economic development . He partnered with advisers at Harvard University to launch a rapid results initiative designed to spur rapid economic growth . In 2004 the World Bank approved his administration 's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper , entitled Madagascar <unk> ( Madagascar Naturally ) , in which he enshrined the principle of environmental conservation as inseparable from sustainable economic growth . The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana 's progressive economic and political policies , which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism , facilitated foreign direct investment and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally . 
 At the 2003 Durban World Parks Congress he pledged to more than triple protected natural areas on the island from 1 @.@ 6 million hectares ( 6 @,@ 200 sq mi ) to 6 million hectares ( 23 @,@ 000 sq mi ) – ten per cent of the country 's land surface – over five years . In 2004 he established BIANCO ( Bureau <unk> Anti @-@ Corruption ) , an anti @-@ corruption bureau , which resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo 's lower @-@ level bureaucrats in particular , although high @-@ level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau . That same year , the International Monetary Fund agreed to write off half Madagascar 's debt . Having met a set of stringent economic , governance and human rights criteria , in 2005 Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the Millennium Challenge Account , a new development fund managed by the United States . Legal reforms strengthened state institutions , particularly the judiciary , and produced improvements in human rights , civil liberties and the business climate . Consequently , the economy grew at an average annual rate of seven per cent throughout his presidency . Under his administration , hundreds of kilometers of roads were paved in formerly isolated rural areas . Dramatic improvements in education and health were also achieved under his administration . During Ravalomanana 's first term , thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed , older buildings were renovated and tens of thousands of new primary teachers were recruited and trained . Primary school fees were eliminated and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students . Logging in protected areas was outlawed until January 2009 . 
 After being elected president in 2002 , Ravalomanana remained a prominent player in the private sector . The 2003 privatisation of <unk> ( Societe d <unk> National Malgache des <unk> <unk> ) , the state agricultural corporation , and <unk> ( Société Malgache de <unk> et de Distribution ) , the national trading corporation , provided Ravalomanana the opportunity to purchase both entities , which he incorporated under Tiko . He also created a public roads construction company , Asa <unk> Malagasy . 
 The benefits of economic growth during the Ravalomanana administration were not evenly distributed , leading to higher costs of living for all Malagasy and a deepening poverty among much of the population with fewer able to increase their wealth . Detractors indicate a decline in purchasing power and dramatic inflation early in Ravalomanana 's presidency as evidence of a failure to reduce poverty . Ravalomanana 's critics remarked that the greatest beneficiary of his reforms and policies was the president himself , giving the example of road construction projects that enabled Tiko to distribute more efficiently as well as the farmers and other small businesspeople targeted by the initiative . Furthermore , his own companies tended to be awarded most of the government contracts for which they bid , although this occurred transparently and legally , due to a weak legal framework around conflict of interest . Critics condemned his tendency to make unilateral decisions and disregard the views of his entourage , a number of whom resigned or were dismissed . Many joined an opposition movement that had gained considerable strength by late 2007 . 
 On 18 November 2006 , Ravalomanana 's jet was forced to divert from Madagascar 's capital during a return trip from Europe following reports of a coup underway in Antananarivo and shooting near the airport . The attempted coup was ultimately unsuccessful .

 Ravalomanana ran for a second term in the presidential election held on 3 December 2006 . According to official results , he won the election with 54 @.@ 79 per cent of the vote in the first round ; his best results were in Antananarivo Province , where he received the support of 75 @.@ 39 per cent of voters . He was sworn in for his second term on 19 January 2007 . 
 = = = Second term = = = 
 During his second term , Ravalomanana oversaw revisions to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper . Renamed the Madagascar Action Plan ( MAP ) , this new strategy was intended to build on the successes of his first term to accelerate and expand national development . The plan focused on " the eight commitments " : accountable governance , more extensive and interconnected infrastructure , agriculture based rural development , family planning and health ( particularly fighting HIV / AIDS ) , strong economic growth , environmental protection , and the traditional principle of <unk> ( solidarity ) . The plan 's targets were aligned with the United Nations ' Millennium Development Goals . 
 As construction of schools and hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana 's second term , additional measures were adopted to improve education quality , including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five , expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and an overhaul of the national curriculum , which had been modified piecemeal since independence from France in 1960 . In the Constitution of 2007 , English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language , in reflection of Ravalomanana 's goal to increase Madagascar 's participation in the global market . 
 In the later half of his second term , Ravalomanana was criticized by domestic and international observers , who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption . 
 = = = Confrontation with Rajoelina = = = 
 On 13 December 2008 , the government closed Viva TV , owned by mayor of Antananarivo Andry Rajoelina , stating that a Viva interview with exiled former head of state Didier Ratsiraka was " likely to disturb peace and security " . This move catalyzed the political opposition and a public already dissatisfied with other recent actions undertaken by Ravalomanana , including a July 2008 deal with Daewoo Logistics to lease half the island 's arable land for South Korean cultivation of corn and palm oil , and the November 2008 purchase of a second presidential jet at a cost of 60 million U.S. dollars . Within a week , Rajoelina met with twenty of Madagascar 's most prominent opposition leaders ( referred to in the press as the " Club of 20 " ) , to develop a joint statement demanding that the Ravalomanana administration improve its adherence to democratic principles . The demand was broadcast at a press conference , where Rajoelina promised to dedicate a politically open public space in the capital , which he would call Place de la democratie ( " Democracy Square " ) . 
 Beginning in January 2009 , Rajoelina led a series of political rallies in downtown Antananarivo where he gave voice to the frustration that Ravalomanana 's policies had triggered , particularly among the economically marginalized and members of the political opposition . On 3 February , Ravalomanana dismissed Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and appointed a special delegation headed by Guy <unk> to manage the affairs of the capital . Rajoelina incited demonstrators on 7 February to occupy the president 's office in Ambohitsorohitra Palace in central Antananarivo . The presidential guard opened fire on the advancing crowd , killing 31 and wounding more than 200 . Ravalomanana became the third president since independence ( after Ratsiraka and Philibert Tsiranana ) to allow the defense forces to shoot at civilians ; several months later , at a demonstration led by Ravalomanana supporters , Rajoelina would become the fourth president to authorize such an action . Popular disapproval of Ravalomanana intensified and polarized some in favor of his resignation , although perceptions of Rajoelina as an alternative remained mixed . Conflicts between pro @-@ Rajoelina demonstrators and security forces continued over the following weeks , resulting in several additional deaths . 
 On 11 March , following a declaration of neutrality by army leadership , pro @-@ opposition soldiers from the Army Corps of Personnel and Administrative and Technical Services ( <unk> ) stormed the army headquarters and forced the army chief of staff to resign . Over the next several days the army deployed forces to enable the opposition to occupy key ministries , the chief of military police transferred his loyalty to Rajoelina and the army sent tanks against the president 's <unk> Palace . Rajoelina rejected Ravalomanana 's offer on 15 March to hold a national referendum to determine whether the president should resign , and called on security forces to arrest the president . The following day , the army stormed the Ambohitsorohitra Palace and captured the Central Bank . Hours later , Ravalomanana transferred his power to a group of senior army personnel , an act described by the opposition as a voluntary resignation . Ravalomanana later declared he had been forced at gunpoint to relinquish power . The military council would have been charged with organizing elections within 24 months and re @-@ writing the constitution for the " Fourth Republic " . However , Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> announced on 18 March that the council would transfer power directly to Rajoelina , making him president of the opposition @-@ dominated High Transitional Authority ( HAT ) that he had appointed weeks earlier . With the military 's backing , the HAT was charged with taking up the tasks previously accorded to Ravalomanana 's proposed military directorate . Madagascar 's constitutional court deemed the transfer of power , from Ravalomanana to the military board and then to Rajoelina , to be legal ; the court 's statement did not include a justification for its decision . Rajoelina was sworn in as President on 21 March at Mahamasina Municipal Stadium before a crowd of 40 @,@ 000 supporters , a transfer of power that was considered illegitimate and unconstitutional by the international community and widely described in the press as a coup d 'état .

 After coming to power , Rajoelina 's HAT pursued legal action against Ravalomanana . On 2 June 2009 , Ravalomanana was fined 70 million US dollars ( 42 million British pounds ) and sentenced to four years in prison for alleged abuse of office which , according to HAT Justice Minister Christine Razanamahasoa , included the December 2008 purchase of a presidential jet worth $ 60 million . Razanamahasoa claimed Ravalomanana " mixed public interests with his personal interests " . The former head of state was in exile in South Africa at the time , having been prevented from returning to Madagascar the previous month . Additionally , on 28 August , Ravalomanana was sentenced in absentia to hard labour for life for his role in the protests and ensuing deaths . Arrest warrants were also issued for General <unk> <unk> and Colonel Anatole <unk> . Ravalomanana 's Tiko Group faced heavy pressure from the transitional government , which in April 2009 demanded that the company pay 35 million US dollars in back taxes or risk being shut down . 
 Both Ravalomanana and Rajoelina were requested by the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) to renounce participation in the 2013 Malagasy presidential elections in order to hasten an end to the ongoing political crisis . On 10 December 2012 , Ravalomanana announced that he would not participate in the elections , and encouraged Rajoelina to follow suit , in line with SADC recommendations . Rajoelina complied ; however , when Ravalomanana 's wife Lalao submitted her candidacy several months later , Rajoelina resubmitted his candidacy , declaring that Marc Ravalomanana sought to govern by proxy through his wife . In August 2013 , a special electoral court invalidated the candidacy of Lalao Ravalomanana , as well as her chief competitors Rajoelina and Ratsiraka . TGV candidate Hery Rajaonarimampianina was elected president in January 2014 , defeating Jean @-@ Louis Robinson , the candidate of Marc Ravalomanana 's camp . Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 Ravalomanana was arrested , having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration . After his sentence was lifted and he was freed from house arrest in May 2015 , Ravalomanana recommenced broadcasts at his MBS radio station , announced the re @-@ opening of the <unk> business group , and was re @-@ elected the president of TIM .

 Ravalomanana is known for his fervent Christian faith . As a young adult he gradually took on increasingly responsible leadership roles within his church community . In early 2000 he replaced a member of the eastern Antananarivo synod in its Christian Men 's Committee and was quickly elected its president . In August the same year he was elected as head layman and Vice @-@ President of the FJKM . In 2005 , he was quoted as saying that he " dream [ s ] of a Christian nation " , a vision that critics considered a violation of the constitution , which described the state as secular . A 2007 constitutional referendum removed this descriptor , among other changes . While Ravalomanana enjoyed strong support from the FJKM and other church organizations early in his political career , these organizations placed increasing pressure on him over time , viewing his policies as inadequately effective in reducing poverty across the island . 
 Ravalomanana owns media group Malagasy Broadcasting System ( MBS ) , which operates radio and television stations .

 = Citroën C3 Picasso = 
 The Citroën C3 Picasso is a mini MPV produced by the French motor company Citroën since 2008 . It was first unveiled at the 2008 Paris Motor Show as a concept car named " <unk> " , and was designed by Donato Coco and Jean @-@ Pierre <unk> . The Picasso is the mini MPV version of the Citroën C3 and the successor of the Citroën Xsara Picasso , and was designed to compete with the Opel <unk> , Nissan Note , Renault Modus and Ford Fusion . 
 The vehicle is a mini Sport Utility Vehicle version of the C3 Picasso for the Latin America market , where it has been sold as the Citroën C3 Aircross since 2010 . 
 The first C3 Picasso was assembled in December 2007 at the PSA Trnava Plant in west Slovakia , which Citroën announced from France in July 2008 would be the sole manufacturer of the model . Citroën presented the finished product to the Slovak press and public on 25 September before it was unveiled to the world in October at the 2008 Paris Motor Show . The Trnava Plant by then was expected to be building 28 cars per hour as the C3 Picasso went on sale in France in February 2009 for € 14 @,@ 950 . The company began to sell the car in other European markets in March 2009 . 
 When launched in Spain in 2009 , only three trims were available : LX , SX , or Exclusive . The LX was the most basic and least expensive model , with a 95 bhp ( 71 kW ; 96 PS ) VTi engine , priced at € 12 @,@ 590 , while the Exclusive model was most expensive with a 110 bhp ( 82 kW ; 112 PS ) HDi Airdream engine at € 18 @,@ 650 . The C3 Picasso was launched in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2009 , where it went on sale for £ 11 @,@ 495 for the 1 @.@ 4 @-@ litre VTi , the most basic model with 44 mpg @-@ imp ( 6 @.@ 4 L / 100 km ; 37 mpg @-@ US ) , while the most expensive was the ' Exclusive ' with a 1 @.@ 6 @-@ litre HDi engine and 62 mpg @-@ imp ( 4 @.@ 6 L / 100 km ; 52 mpg @-@ US ) at £ 15 @,@ 595 . A redesigned version of the car was shown at the 2012 Paris Motor Show on 27 September 2012 and was on sale in Europe by November . 
 = = Models = = 
 Exclusive is consistently the most expensive trim for each market , with the biggest choice of engines and features . It is the only model to feature a folding front passenger seat , making the storage space into the whole interior of the car except the driver 's seat . Extras for the trim include : tinted windows , rear parking sensors , automatic windscreen wipers , a leather and chrome interior , pollen filter , and dual @-@ zone automatic climate control , which allows for two varying temperature settings simultaneously in the vehicle . 
 = = = Limited and Special Edition = = = 
 Blackcherry is a limited edition trim , available in the UK since November 2010 and based on the <unk> + . It was sold with the 1 @.@ 6 @-@ litre High @-@ pressure Direct Injection ( HDi ) diesel engine . It was discontinued and replaced with the Code Red and Code White in January 2012 , which have the same engine . 
 90th Anniversary ; the release of the Limited Edition 90th Anniversary C3 Picasso in August 2009 was the UK 's third limited edition model . It was created to commemorate 90 years of Citroën and has similar features to the Exclusive trim , sold at the same price and features the <unk> SatNav system , leather upholstery , and a commemorative badge on the dashboard emblazoned with the wording " 90 Years " . As bonus , it came equipped with £ 1 @,@ 000 of extras and was released in an advertising campaign of Anniversary trims for other Citroën models at the same time as the launch of the Limited Edition Millennium trim in France . The model was limited to 150 cars in the UK , of which only one has been sold and registered for use . 
 Millennium ; several trims were released in France under the Millennium moniker , including the : C1 , C4 , C4 Picasso , C5 and C5 Tourer . The model has 16 @-@ inch ( 41 cm ) alloy wheels , the <unk> SatNav system and radio with built @-@ in Bluetooth and dual @-@ zone automatic climate control . The car was available in a metallic or pearlescent finish . 
 Code Red / Code White was released in January 2012 . The limited edition C3 Picasso Code Red and Code White replaced the Blackcherry in the UK . The Code has the same engine as the Blackcherry and has been finely tuned for a marginally increased fuel economy and lower carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions . It features obsidian black bumpers and 17 @-@ inch ( 43 cm ) Polar White or Cherry Red " clover " alloy wheels , and can be equipped with extra features , which include roof bars , curtain airbags , cruise control and a speed limiter . Body colours exclusive to the trim are Belle Ile Blue , Shark Grey and Cherry Red . 
 Passion Bleus was released in France to celebrate the 2012 European Football Championship . The name is a tribute to the French national football team , which Citroën supports as a partner of the French Football Federation . The advertising campaign for the Passion Bleus involved French footballers , rallying champion Sébastien Loeb , and an online Facebook game " Le Pilote et le Bleu " ( The Pilot and Blue ) . Other Citroën vehicles to receive a Passion Bleus trim were the : C1 , C3 , C4 , C4 Picasso , and the Berlingo <unk> . 
 Music Touch was launched in January 2013 in France . Created through a partnership with Samsung and Universal Music Group , the C3 Picasso Music Touch comes with a free white Samsung Galaxy Tab 16 GB . The obvious styling differences are the additional chrome trims and mirror covers , and white pearlescent paint . The Music Touch special series was also added to the C4 Picasso , C4 Aircross and Berlingo <unk> vehicles . 
 = = Design and features = = 
 All C3 Picasso models have an anti @-@ lock braking system ( ABS ) , Electronic brakeforce distribution ( EBD ) , child locks , remote central locking and two front airbags . Electronic Stability Control ( ESC ) , once an option , is now included across the range . The vehicle is only available as a 5 @-@ seater , but with all models the three rear seats can be folded flat to increase the boot capacity from 385 litres ( 13 @.@ 6 cu ft ) or 500 litres ( 18 cu ft ) including the hidden compartment to store the parcel shelf , up to a maximum of 1 @,@ 506 litres ( 53 @.@ 2 cu ft ) . The Exclusive model features a folding front passenger seat to increase the storage space further . All models in the range have a " Mistral Maxi Taylor " woven cloth interior ; according to Citroën , top European engineers and designers including Donato Coco and Jean @-@ Pierre <unk> were involved in designing the vehicle . 
 Optional accessories are available for the range , including an aluminium roof rack capable of carrying 60 kg ( 132 lb ) and kerbside lights in the door mirrors . Also available are : 16 @-@ inch ( 41 cm ) and 17 @-@ inch ( 43 cm ) alloy wheels with a choice of two patterns , chrome mouldings for the bumpers and doors , front fog lamps and cruise control , rear parking sensors , automatic lights ( standard on some variants ) , and a speed limitation device – which are commonly used for safety reasons or to reduce fuel bills . A seatbelt reminder , which can be added to the passenger and rear seats , is fitted to the driver 's seat as standard . 
 The chassis platform used for the C3 Picasso is a modified version of that in the Citroën C3 and the Peugeot 207 , giving it a comparable wheelbase . The reuse of automobile platforms is commonplace , especially for Citroën because the Trnava plant builds the Peugeot 207 and the C3 Picasso . The parent company PSA Peugeot Citroën pools resources and manufacturing for some vehicles , and sometimes <unk> vehicles , combining design teams between two or more brands to create a shared product . The advantage is the designing and testing vehicles at a reduced cost for the participating brands , but creates multiple , identical @-@ looking vehicles for the market , sometimes with minor styling differences . Examples include : the Fiat <unk> , Peugeot Expert and Citroën Dispatch , the Toyota <unk> , Peugeot 107 and Citroën C1 , and the Peugeot Partner and Citroën Berlingo . Citroën placed a contractual obligation on the manufacturers to use green materials for the C3 Picasso range . These comprise ≥ 11 % of the 170 kg ( 374 @.@ 8 lb ) of polymers on the vehicle , including the <unk> , parcel shelf and boot carpet . Citroën recommends the vehicle is serviced at least every two years , or at every 20 @,@ 000 miles ( 32 @,@ 000 km ) for petrol models and 12 @,@ 500 miles ( 20 @,@ 100 km ) for the HDi diesel models . 
 = = = Engines = = = 
 When equipped with the 1 @.@ 6 @-@ litre VTi engine , the C3 Picasso Exclusive and <unk> + models are capable of a top speed of 117 mph ( 188 km / h ) in 10 @.@ 6 seconds and 120 bhp ( 89 kW ; 122 PS ) . This 1 @.@ 6 litre and a smaller 1 @.@ 4 litre VTi petrol engine , were developed by PSA Peugeot Citroën and BMW , along with a 1 @.@ 6 L diesel engine and the two 1 @.@ 6 L HDi Airdream engines . Every model came with a 5 @-@ speed manual gearbox until 2011 , when 6 @-@ speed manual and automatic ( EGS6 ) manual versions were introduced , along with an eco @-@ friendly start @-@ stop system and regenerative braking technology in certain models , notably the Exclusive and <unk> models for the German market . According to Citroën , these two new features reduce CO2 emissions significantly and their introduction coincided with the release of a higher specification Airdream engine , the European emission standards ( Euro 5 ) carbon dioxide emissions limits were lowered and the addition of low @-@ rolling resistance tyres were added to the entire range . The tyres are specially designed to minimize wasted energy when the tyre rolls and have been estimated by the California Energy Commission to save 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 % of fuel in a typical car . 
 At first Citroën decided not to offer their new automatic EGS6 gearbox version in the UK due to the unfavourable exchange rate and costs , although this changed after a small number were privately imported for insurance classification purposes . The EGS6 gearbox became an option for the 1 @.@ 6 L VTi engine models shortly after . 
 Starting with June 2015 production , Citroen replaced the older petrol engines with a 1 @.@ 2 litre Pure Tech 110 motor . This new 3 cylinder 110 hp engine is paired with 5 speed manual transmission . CO2 emissions are <unk> / km . A <unk> <unk> 100 diesel coupled to a 5 speed manual transmission replaced the earlier offerings . The EGS6 automatic transmission is no longer available . 
 The complete vehicle lineup includes multiple models and engine configurations , all with different specifications and tuning :

 The European New Car Assessment Programme ( Euro NCAP ) tested a C3 Picasso <unk> 90 bhp ( 67 kW ; 91 PS ) model with standard equipment , including : a single forward airbag for each front seat , a speed limitation device , but no ESC . The vehicle was scored on the basis of : child and adult injury , including whiplash risk from the seating , a pedestrian front impact rating , safety equipment and clear labels detailing how to disable some features . The results of the front end tests were mixed , with the bumper scoring all available points , but the vehicle was penalised for the lack of protection and the potential damage caused if a pedestrian is struck by the bonnet . Protection inside the car was scored highly for almost every seat , and for adult and child protection ; it lost points for its use of forward @-@ facing restraints , which can be fatal in an accident if an infant is hit by an airbag . The C3 Picasso was also penalised for offering very poor whiplash protection in the driver 's seat – scoring nothing in two of the three tests and then losing points for the position of the unadjusted restraint . Overall , the vehicle scored four of five stars , less than most vehicles the Euro NCAP compares it with , which were released around the same time .

 On 20 June 2010 , 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were recalled due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes , which were believed to have been in contact with the heat shield . This fault may have caused chafing and may lead to a fuel leak . The models were built between January and March 2010 and were sold in the UK . On 24 August 2010 , all 13 @,@ 234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate , and could eventually detach , leading to a loose @-@ fitting windscreen . 
 In May 2011 , all 24 @,@ 091 C3 Picassos in the UK were recalled for a safety modification , following complaints and an investigation by BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog into brakes that could be activated on the passenger side of the right @-@ hand drive vehicles . The problem occurred because of the way the vehicles were modified for right @-@ hand @-@ drive . The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right , it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side . This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes . A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot , some of which were registered in 2002 . All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency ( <unk> ) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls . 
 8 @,@ 815 Picassos built between January and May 2011 for the UK market were recalled on 2 September 2011 when it was discovered that the battery cable was too short and could cause gearbox failures and in turn stall the engine . The faulty earth return cable was replaced . Despite the recalls , the vehicle continued to sell well in the UK and has won numerous awards . 
 = = Reviews = = 
 Critics praised the Citroen C3 Picasso in reviews for its ergonomics , Bauhaus @-@ inspired styling , ease of use and the amount of space offered , many reviewers criticised the interior , which they said felt " cheap " . The quality and reliability of the petrol engines was criticised by most reviewers as " sluggish " and struggling to carry the weight of the vehicle , although the diesel engines feedback was more positive as they are able to cope much better and run smoother . Reviewers ' comments about the tight turning radius of the vehicle were favourable . The combination of the panoramic three @-@ part windscreen , thin door pillars and high seats , which together increase the visibility of the road – led one reviewer to compare it with a greenhouse . 
 The car has three monitors on the dashboard , the first monitors the status of important components , while the second controls the sound system , and the last is a rev counter , digital speedometer and the fuel gauge . CNET described the speed gauge monitor as clear and " close to the driver 's natural line of sight " , but criticized the other two monitors for being unreadable and possibly dangerous if used by the driver while the car is moving . Some reviewers complained about the vehicle 's soundproofing , which could not adequately conceal the screech of the wind . The engine at high speed received mixed reviews , while a number of reviewers reported a fault with the <unk> bottle , which can freeze in cold weather and blow a fuse when used . The reviewer for European Car of the Year 2010 called the nominated C3 Picasso fuel efficient , but said it had " dull steering " .

 UK publication Top Gear Magazine awarded the C3 Picasso " Family Car of the Year " in 2008 , stating " This is what a 21st century family car should look like " . Michael Harvey , the Editorial Director of the magazine admitted they had taken a chance as the model was not available in the United Kingdom until the following year . In 2009 when the car was finally launched the awards increased , first with " Best MPV " at What Diesel 's Car of the Year Awards , " Scottish MPV of the Year " at the Scottish Car of the Year Awards , " Best <unk> MPV of the year " at " Auto Express New Car Awards " and finally " Design of the Year " at the Fleet World Honours . The vehicle was nominated for European Car of the Year in 2010 , but received the lowest overall score of any candidate , finishing last , in seventh place . The JD Power survey in 2011 announced the C3 Picasso as the best MPV on the market , with a satisfaction rating of 83 @.@ 1 % and five stars overall , but with the lowest rating given to the exterior quality at three stars . Many reviewers had complained of poor fitting and the finish used on the exterior .

Club member Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) has the team cast in a local mattress commercial in an attempt to raise their social status . Glee club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) discovers that his wife Terri ( Jessalyn Gilsig ) has been faking her pregnancy . 
 The episode features cover versions of four songs , studio recordings of three of which were released as singles , available for digital download , and are also included on the album Glee : The Music , Volume 2 . " Mattress " was watched by 8 @.@ 15 million US viewers , Glee 's series high at that point . It received mixed reviews from critics . The conclusion of the fake pregnancy storyline attracted praise , as did Gilsig and Morrison 's acting , however Liz Pardue of Zap2it expressed dismay that so few songs were performed , while Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal deemed " Jump " " the only memorable song of the episode " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) convinces Principal Figgins ( Iqbal Theba ) not to include a photograph of the glee club in the school yearbook , as in previous years , glee club photographs have been heavily defaced in the library copy of the yearbook by fellow students . Club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) personally buys a meager section of advertising space in the book so that a photograph featuring at least two members can be included . Fearing unpopularity , the club nominates Rachel ( Lea Michele ) to represent them in the photograph . Rachel convinces Finn ( Cory Monteith ) to appear alongside her , but after being teased by his peers , he drops out . When it transpires that the school photographer ( John Ross Bowie ) is soon to direct a commercial for his brother @-@ in @-@ law , a local mattress store owner , Rachel convinces him to cast the glee club in it , believing that local celebrity status will prevent the other students from mocking them . 
 Will is dismayed to learn that his close friend , guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) , has arranged to marry her fiancé , football coach Ken Tanaka ( Patrick Gallagher ) , on the same day the glee club will compete at sectionals . Will goes on to discover that his wife Terri ( Jessalyn Gilsig ) has been lying to him for months about her supposed pregnancy . She actually experienced a hysterical pregnancy and hid the truth from him by wearing a pregnancy pad under her clothes , while planning to secretly adopt Quinn 's ( Dianna Agron ) baby . Will walks out on her and spends the night at the school , sleeping on one of the mattresses given to the glee club in payment for their commercial . 
 Sue informs Will that the club receiving payment for the commercial revokes their amateur status , and thus their eligibility to compete at sectionals . Quinn , who has been trying to convince Sue to let her appear in the cheerleaders ' photographs despite being removed from the team due to her pregnancy , reminds Sue that as their coach she has often given the cheerleaders perks which would also render them ineligible for competition . She demands that Sue sacrifice one of the cheerleaders ' six pages in the yearbook to the glee club . Sue agrees , and accepts Quinn back onto the cheerleading team , but Quinn tells her she no longer wishes to be a cheerleader . Will announces that he will not be accompanying the club to sectionals , as he was the one who accepted payment , and as such they will only be allowed to compete without his involvement . The glee club then has their group photograph taken for the yearbook , but the copy in the library is subsequently defaced by hockey player Dave Karofsky ( Max Adler ) and football player Azimio ( James Earl ) .

 Jessalyn Gilsig referred to the confrontation between Terri and Will in " Mattress " as " The Reckoning " . She described it as sad to shoot , as she and Morrison were so invested in the storyline , and explained : " What I hope is conveyed is that you see the child inside Terri . You see the fear . " Gilsig commented that viewers had been wondering why Will was taking so long to discover Terri was not actually pregnant , explaining : " I think people have been asking ' How slow is this guy ? ! ' . But [ in " Mattress " ] Will finally reflects that he is a fully evolved human being and puts two and two together . " She noted that while Will and Emma " are adorable together " , she still believes in Terri and Will as a couple as : " I think that she really loves him . People do crazy things out of deep , deep insecurity . She 's obviously flawed , but I think she has love in her heart . " While fan reaction to her character had previously resulted in a backlash Gilsig found " tough " , she hoped that " Mattress " would be the episode in which " anti @-@ Terri fans joined Team Terri " .

 = 1962 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1962 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active since 1939 , with only five named storms . Although the season officially began on June 15 , the first storm did not form until August 26 . Hurricane Alma brushed the Outer Banks before becoming extratropical southeast of New England , destroying hundreds of boats and producing beneficial rainfall . In late August , Tropical Storm Becky developed unusually far east in the Atlantic Ocean , becoming the easternmost storm on record to recurve to the northeast . Celia followed in the September , forming east of the Lesser Antilles and executing a loop near Bermuda before dissipating . Hurricane Daisy was the costliest of the season , leaving about $ 1 @.@ 1 million in damage in New England ( 1962 USD ) . The storm dropped the highest rainfall total on record in Maine , and its precipitation caused 22 traffic fatalities . The final hurricane – Ella – was also the strongest , remaining offshore of the eastern United States but causing two deaths . 
 In addition to the five named storms , there were three non @-@ developing tropical depressions . The first struck Texas in August , causing street flooding and killing three . The second of three formed off the west coast of Florida and flooded widespread areas after 1 in 100 year rainfall . The floods affected 5 @,@ 000 houses and caused millions in damage . The third of three non @-@ developing storms moved across the Caribbean before striking Nicaragua in October . The season officially ended on November 15 . 
 = = Season activity = = 
 The hurricane season officially began on June 15 , 1962 . The National Hurricane Center began operations with no new equipment , and the warning agency instead opted to improve with the existing equipment . The agency had access to a system of radars that extended from Brownsville , Texas to Eastport , Maine , which was set up in 1961 . Although satellite imagery technology was available , the system was not fully active to provide daily images of Atlantic hurricanes . The season officially ended on November 15 . 
 During the season , three hurricanes developed from five named storms . This was below the average of 10 storms per season , and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939 . Four of the five storms developed from the intertropical convergence zone . The decreased activity is partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual , as well as a persistent ridge . In addition , temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual . Activity through September 10 was the quietest in 30 years . 
 The only region of the United States threatened by hurricanes was New England , although no stations recorded hurricane @-@ force winds in the country . This was the first such occurrence during the 20th century that no tropical storms or hurricanes hit the country . Overall damage was the lowest in several years .

 = = = Hurricane Alma = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression along the southeast Florida coast on August 26 . It moved northward along the coast , located beneath an anticyclone that aided in its intensification . The depression began a motion to the northeast on August 27 , and that day it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alma about 150 mi ( 240 km ) east of the Florida / Georgia border . This marked the latest development of the first storm since 1941 . Alma steadily intensified as it paralleled the coastline of the Carolinas , becoming a hurricane on August 28 a few miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras . Despite its proximity , the storm produced peak wind gusts of only 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) in Nags Head . Wind gusts downed a power pole in Hatteras , which caused an hour long power outage for one @-@ third of the town . There , the storm tide was 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) above normal , which resulted in some erosion . The highest rainfall total from Alma in the United States was a report of 10 @.@ 38 inches ( 264 mm ) in Cape Hatteras . Damage in the state amounted to $ 35 @,@ 000 . 
 After passing the Outer Banks , Alma continued to intensify further , reaching peak winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) about 85 mi ( 135 km ) south of Nantucket . Despite its intensity , the hurricane never developed a well @-@ defined eye . Alma quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it made its closest approach to New England , due to cooler water temperatures . In Rhode Island and Massachusetts along the coast , the storm produced northerly winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) , and one house was damaged by a fallen tree . Tides reached 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) above normal , which resulted in minor coastal flooding . However , Alma produced strong waves that destroyed over 100 boats . Damage from the storm was estimated at less than $ 1 million , though its rains were beneficial to drought @-@ stricken areas of New England . Precipitation extended northward through Maine , and storm damage was reported as far north as Portsmouth , New Hampshire . Slick roads resulted in several traffic accidents , although there were no deaths . After moving by the region , Alma turned to the southeast due to a high pressure system to its north . It became extratropical on August 30 .

 On August 26 , a tropical depression formed in the western Gulf of Mexico about 280 mi ( 450 km ) northeast of Tampico , Tamaulipas . It moved slowly to the north @-@ northwest around a ridge without intensifying beyond winds of 30 mph ( 45 km / h ) . The system encountered wind shear throughout its duration , which displaced the convection from the center to its northeast . The depression struck just west of the Texas / Louisiana border on August 29 before dissipating on August 30 . Rainfall in Texas was minimal , estimated around 1 in ( 25 mm ) . However , heavy amounts of precipitation fell across Louisiana , peaking at 23 @.@ 13 in ( 588 mm ) near Hackberry . Rainfall extended northeastward through Arkansas and Missouri . On August 29 as the depression moved ashore , heavy rainfall caused street flooding in Cameron , Louisiana . Two tornadoes were reported in the town , one of which produced winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . The storms damaged 115 houses or trailers , of which one was destroyed . There were 30 people injured , of whom 18 required hospital attention , and there were three deaths .

 A tropical disturbance emerged from Africa in late August and developed into a weak tropical depression on August 27 . For about 30 hours , the system affected the Cape Verde islands with rainfall , during which it moved slowly to the west and west @-@ northwest . Late on August 28 , it was estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm . The next day , satellite imagery observed a well @-@ developed tropical cyclone in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean . In addition , a ship reported winds of force 9 on the Beaufort scale , suggesting winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . On that basis , the Weather Bureau initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Becky , despite the agency only issuing advisories for storms west of 35 ° W. Around that time , the storm moved over an area of anomalously warm water temperatures , which allowed for its intensification . On August 30 , Becky turned to the north and northeast due to an approaching trough , becoming the easternmost cyclone since 1886 that a storm began a motion to the north . A Hurricane Hunters flight on August 31 indicated that Becky became extratropical about 70 mi ( 110 km ) south of Santa Maria Island in the Azores . The storm 's remnants continued to the northeast , dissipating on September 1 about 320 mi ( 520 km ) west of Spain .

 A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on September 12 , about 1000 mi ( 1600 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . However , satellite imagery indicated that it could have become a tropical cyclone a day earlier . Late on September 12 , a ship reported winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) , which provided the basis for the San Juan Weather Bureau to initiate advisories on Tropical Storm Celia . The storm quickly attained peak winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , and on September 13 a hurricane watch was issued for the northern Leeward Islands . However , Celia passed beneath a mid- to upper @-@ level trough and quickly weakened . By late on September 14 , a hurricane hunters flight indicated that the storm 's structure no longer resembled that of a tropical cyclone . The next day , Celia weakened to a tropical depression , and the Weather Bureau discontinued tropical cyclone advisories . It turned to the north and later to the east , passing well southeast of Bermuda . On September 18 , Celia began executing a loop to the north , during which it re @-@ intensified into a tropical storm , as reported by ships . It attained winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) on September 19 , but again weakened to a tropical depression the next day . Celia became extratropical on September 21 , without having affected land .

 An upper @-@ level low spawned a tropical depression off the west coast of Florida on September 20 . The depression moved very slowly to the north @-@ northwest , which produced heavy rainfall from Naples to Tampa , Florida . The highest total was 16 @.@ 60 in ( 422 mm ) in Sarasota , although precipitation of over 1 in ( 25 mm ) extended into Georgia and extreme southern South Carolina . A developing cyclone off the Carolinas caused the dissipation of the depression on September 23 . 
 The rains in Sarasota were the highest since 1945 , and some locations experienced 1 in 100 year rainfall totals . The rains resulted in 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) of floodwaters across western Florida , and both the Manatee River and the <unk> Creek experienced record crests . The flooding entered over 5 @,@ 000 houses , which forced the evacuation of more than 100 families . The floods also caused schools to close in three counties . In addition , floodwaters affected thousands of acres of farmlands in six counties , and some did not dry out for several weeks . Wind gusts reached 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) in eastern Florida , and more than 20 @,@ 000 people were left without power . There was one death in the state related to the storm , and damage was estimated at $ 2 @.@ 78 million .

 On September 27 , a tropical depression developed east of the Lesser Antilles . It moved through the islands without intensifying beyond winds of 30 mph ( 40 km / h ) . The depression later crossed the entirety of the Caribbean Sea . On October 3 , it struck northeastern Nicaragua , before becoming a remnant low pressure area the following day over Guatemala . 
 = = = Hurricane Daisy = = = 
 On September 29 , reconnaissance aircraft indicated the formation of a tropical depression to the east of the Lesser Antilles . For several days it moved to the west @-@ northwest , passing just north of the islands without intensifying further . This was due to its presence beneath an upper @-@ level trough , although the system began intensifying as the trough dissipated . On October 2 , after turning to the northwest between two high pressure areas , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy . Developing an anticyclone aloft , the storm continued to gradually intensify , reaching hurricane strength on October 3 . Two days later , Daisy turned to the north @-@ northeast and attained peak winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . While passing west of Bermuda , the hurricane weakened slightly , although it re @-@ intensified to its peak strength late on October 6 . Cool air imparted weakening as Daisy turned northwestward , and on October 8 , the hurricane slowed as it turned eastward , striking Yarmouth , Nova Scotia with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . It became extratropical later that day , and Daisy dissipated on October 9 south of Newfoundland . 
 In New England , Hurricane Daisy 's outer rainbands combined with an approaching nor 'easter to drop torrential rainfall over the region for 65 hours , producing upwards of 12 in ( 300 mm ) in portions of Massachusetts . The highest total from Daisy alone was 9 @.@ 47 in ( 241 mm ) at Portland International Jetport in Maine ; this was the state 's highest tropical cyclone rainfall total between 1950 and 2011 . Across the region , the rains caused widespread flood damage . In Maine , wind gusts reaching 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) destroyed hundreds of small boats , along with high waves from the storm . In New England , Daisy left five injuries , one direct death , and about $ 1 @.@ 1 million in damage . Slick roads , however , resulted in 22 traffic fatalities . In Nova Scotia , winds gusted to 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) , which destroyed three boats and left two towns without power service . Rough seas killed six people in the province . 
 = = = Hurricane Ella = = = 
 In the middle of October , an area of disturbed weather persisted across the Turks and Caicos Islands , associated with an upper @-@ level low . On October 14 , a tropical depression developed and moved northward . A day after forming , it intensified into Tropical Storm Ella as it began a track to the northwest , located east of a weakening upper @-@ level trough . On October 17 , Ella strengthened further into a hurricane as an anticyclone was gradually developing . An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the east @-@ northeast on October 19 , and later that day Ella attained its peak intensity of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) ; that made it the strongest hurricane of the season . It gradually weakened over cooler waters while accelerating to the northeast , and its eye grew to an unusually large diameter of 100 mi ( 160 km / h ) . Ella became extratropical on October 22 over the northern Atlantic as it interacted with an approaching cold front . Shortly thereafter its remnants moved over Newfoundland before dissipating on October 23 . 
 Ella is historically notable for its role in the Cuban Missile Crisis . The storm greatly complicated naval operations relating to the ' quarantine ' blockade of Cuba and badly damaged several Soviet nuclear @-@ armed submarines en route to the island , contributing to the escalation of the B @-@ 59 Incident . Early in its duration , Hurricane Ella briefly threatened to strike the North Carolina coastline . Although it remained offshore , the hurricane produced significant beach erosion along the coast . There were two associated deaths from a missing motor boat that left Charleston , South Carolina . The crew of two was declared deceased after a Coast Guard , Navy , and Air Force search failed to locate their bodies . There was no damage in Canada from its remnants .

 Louis Augustus " Lou " Phillips ( 24 February 1878 – 14 March 1916 ) was a Welsh rugby player , who played half @-@ back for Newport RFC , and won four caps for Wales . He was also a talented amateur golfer . 
 Born in Newport , Monmouthshire , Phillips was educated at Monmouth Grammar School , leaving to become an architect . He played rugby at school and then at Newport , earning a place in the 1st XV after several players retired or defected to rugby league . He made 90 appearances for Newport , during which he developed a famous half @-@ back partnership with Llewellyn Lloyd . His debut for Wales , playing alongside Lloyd , was against England in 1900 , when Wales won the Triple Crown . He earned selection again in 1901 but was forced to retire from rugby after incurring an injury playing Scotland . 
 Phillips enlisted in the 20th ( Service ) Battalion Royal Fusiliers at the start of the First World War . He was deployed to the Western Front in November 1915 . He was shot dead while out on a wiring party on the night of 14 March 1916 , near Cambrin , France .

 Phillips began playing rugby while at Monmouth Grammar School . He went on to play for Newport RFC , earning selection for the first team in 1897 . His first season at Newport was disappointing for the club , which lost seven games , after the previous six consecutive years of success . Several players had moved to Yorkshire to play rugby league , while others had married and retired . Nevertheless , Phillips was one of four new players in the team to ' make an impact ' , alongside George Boots , <unk> Hodges and Reg Skrimshire . 
 = = = Half @-@ back partnership with Llewellyn Lloyd = = = 
 The 1897 – 8 season at Newport saw the beginning of a ' historic ' partnership at half @-@ back between Phillips and Llewellyn Lloyd that lasted till 1901 . Phillips and Lloyd were thought of as a pair , both playing along similar lines and sharing the work of scrum @-@ half and outside @-@ half . While Lloyd was a smarter runner , Phillips was a better kick , but both of them could drop goals , and were remarkable in their kicks to touch . 
 In the 1898 – 9 season , Newport suffered from further retirements : Boots and Phillips were the only 2 players to appear in all 24 matches of the season . During the following season , 1899 – 1900 , with Lloyd as captain , the club was reinvigorated and scored 416 points compared with 192 in the previous season . Phillips and Lloyd were adjudged to be the half @-@ back pair of the season at both club and international level , even if there were some more brilliant individuals . In total , Phillips appeared 90 times for Newport , scoring 9 tries , 2 drop goals and 1 penalty . Townsend Collins remarked : ' He had no tricks or subtleties , but he played the orthodox game of the day with supreme <unk> 
 = = = Wales = = = 
 Phillips , who was a strong runner and tackled well , made his international debut for Wales against England on 6 January 1900 at Gloucester . His initial selection was principally due to his partnership at Newport with Lloyd , who also made selection for Wales . Lloyd had already played in 1896 against Ireland , and against Scotland and Ireland in 1899 . During the game , which Wales won 3 – 13 , Phillips displayed ' special smartness ' and used ' the acme of judgment ' in his first international appearance , proving also to be a ' splendid defender ' . He was reckoned to be amongst the best of the backs , and the combination with Lloyd was excellent . In the following match , against Scotland at Swansea on 27 January , the half @-@ back partnership of Phillips and Lloyd continued to perform : their defensive play was ' sound ' , and in attack , Phillips ' ' splendid ' fielding and kicking to touch , matched Lloyd 's ' cleverness ' and ' dodging ability ' . Wales was again victorious , 12 – 3 . For the next game , away to Ireland at Belfast on 17 March , Lloyd was replaced by Selwyn Biggs of Cardiff . The half @-@ back combination was not as good as with Lloyd but worked better than pundits had expected . The 0 – 3 victory over the Irish earned the Welsh the Triple Crown . 
 Phillips missed the opening match of the 1901 international season against England due to an injury to his knee : he was replaced at the last moment by Bala Jones of Aberavon RFC . Thinking that he had recovered , Phillips was back for the following match , against Scotland on 9 February at Inverleith , but within ten minutes he was almost helpless . He played on , and ' his last match was a tragic end to a great if short career . ' The Scottish half @-@ backs , Jimmy Gillespie and Frank <unk> , outplayed Lloyd and Phillips , and prevented the Welsh backline from receiving much ball . Scotland beat Wales 18 – 8 , and the Welsh defeat was blamed on the half @-@ backs .

 Surf Ninjas is a 1993 American comedic family film involving martial arts , directed by Neal Israel and written by Dan Gordon . The film stars Ernie Reyes , Jr . , Rob Schneider , Nicolas Cowan and Leslie Nielsen . Surf Ninjas follows two teenage surfers from Los Angeles who discover that they are crown princes of the Asian kingdom Patusan and reluctantly follow their destinies to dethrone an evil colonel that rules over the kingdom . 
 Surf Ninjas was filmed in Los Angeles , Hawaii and Thailand . A video game was also developed and released in conjunction with the film . Surf Ninjas was released in the United States on August 20 , 1993 , becoming popular but being received generally unfavorably by critics . The film was released on VHS in December 1993 and re @-@ released on DVD in September 2002 .

 Johnny and Adam are teenage surfers who live in Los Angeles with their father , Mac . Two weeks before Johnny 's 16th birthday , ninjas attack the teenagers , but they are defeated by Zatch , a mysterious warrior with an eye patch . A follow @-@ up attack results in Mac 's kidnapping , though Zatch is able to protect the teenagers and their friend Iggy from the ninjas . Adam discovers that the video game on his Sega Game Gear matches the events happening around him and finds he can control some events through his Sega . Zatch reveals to Johnny and Adam that they are actually the sons of the king of Patusan , whose land and monarchy was overthrown by the evil Colonel Chi when the boys were young . It is their destiny to return to Patusan , overthrow Colonel Chi , and free the people . Zatch takes them to the Patusani district in Los Angeles , where Johnny is introduced to a Patusani princess , Ro @-@ May , who has been betrothed to Johnny since they were infants . 
 Ninjas again attack , but Johnny 's abilities as a warrior prince emerge and he defeats several of his foes . Johnny , Adam , Iggy , Zatch , and Ro @-@ May decide to return to Patusan . They are followed by a Los Angeles detective , Lieutenant Spence , who had been investigating the ninja attacks . They reach Patusan and discover what Colonel Chi 's rule has wrought , including a burned village and a chain gang of political prisoners . The guards spot them and they are forced to fight . Johnny and Adam defeat them and free the villagers from their captivity . 
 Zatch leads the crew to a hidden cave in which the ancient weapons of the Patusani monarchy are preserved . Zatch arms Johnny and attacks him to prepare him for future challenges . Johnny is beaten repeatedly , but he is finally able to disarm Zatch . They rally the villagers and they travel to the coast opposite from an island that houses the royal city and Colonel Chi 's dungeon . Unable to go by boat due to an impassable reef , Johnny and Adam tell the <unk> to make surfboards . They then paddle to the unguarded side of the island . 
 Landing on the island , Johnny and Zatch lead the attack on the royal city , taking down Chi 's henchmen and freeing Mac . Johnny confronts Colonel Chi , successfully defeating him by knocking him into a body of water with the help of Adam and his Game Gear . With Chi 's rule undone , peace is restored to Patusan . Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro @-@ May as his princess and Adam as a prince . Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy .

 Surf Ninjas was filmed during the summer of 1992 . Filming locations included Thailand and Hawaii . The second half of the film was shot first , and the crew moved to Los Angeles to film the first half . New Line Cinema and Sega of America established a financial relationship in which a Sega Game Gear video game would be developed for the film . Game designers began developing the video game Surf Ninjas when the film was only in its scripting phase , receiving creative input from director Neal Israel . In turn , Sega partially financed the film . Screenwriter Dan Gordon said that he wrote action sequences that would both suit the film and serve as a springboard for the video game . In the film , one of the lead characters is shown playing the Surf Ninjas video game on a Sega Game Gear . The video game was released before the film 's release , and it was considered the first movie @-@ based video game to be developed concurrent with the movie and it was also the first to precede the film itself . 
 Surf Ninjas video games were also released for the Amiga 1200 computer and related CD32 console in 1994 by Flair Software / <unk> . These versions received mostly negative reviews . 
 = = Release = = 
 The studio New Line Cinema released Surf Ninjas two weeks earlier than its commercial release date in Evansville , Indiana and Lubbock , Texas as part of a test of regional markets . The early release marked the first time that a major film was released in Evansville before its national opening without any local ties . The president of theatrical marketing at New Line , Chris Pula , selected Evansville for its family @-@ oriented audiences . Pula explained : " Evansville is traditionally a strong family market . Also , we have a strong relationship with the exhibitors in that area " . The president said that the studio was testing the film in a larger market than usual due to its uncertainty about the film 's reception , and that the studio would measure its marketing success with ticket receipts . 
 Surf Ninjas was widely released in 1 @,@ 321 theaters in the United States on August 20 , 1993 . Over its opening weekend , the film grossed $ 2 million , placing 13th in box office rankings ahead of Manhattan Murder Mystery . Surf Ninjas ultimately grossed $ 4 @.@ 9 million in the United States . The film was released on VHS on December 29 , 1993 . It was subsequently released on DVD on September 3 , 2002 . 
 = = Critical reaction = = 
 Janet Maslin of The New York Times called most of Surf Ninjas " only mindlessly watchable " and called the film " another of Hollywood 's efforts to prove that the American mall mentality is at home in any corner of the globe " . Maslin also found the film to lack in actual surfing content . Lynn <unk> of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times described Surf Ninjas as " a marriage of pop icons that simply was fated to be " , citing children 's love for ninjas , especially the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , and for the surf culture . <unk> considered Rob Schneider 's presence as comic relief unfunny , believing that Leslie Nielsen should have received more screen time as the dictator . Calvin Wilson of The Kansas City Star called the film " a disgrace ... even by Hollywood standards " , seeing it as a mess of child lead roles , unfunny cameo roles by Schneider and Nielsen , martial arts action , and lame jokes . Wilson considered the story " stale and uninspired " that involved " people we don 't care about doing things we can 't believe " . 
 Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun thought the film 's lead , Ernie Reyes , Jr . , was too old and too muscular to be received believably as a 15 @-@ year @-@ old . Hunter otherwise found the Reyes to impress with their fighting skills , though the film 's martial arts sequences were " bloodless and absurd " . Hunter also criticized the director for depriving the film of personality , with its lack of danger , seriousness , or spontaneity . Richard Harrington of The Washington Post found the film to be " a harmless summer 's entertainment " for young people who enjoyed the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles films and 3 Ninjas . Harrington enjoyed Reyes , Jr. as the protagonist but found Nielsen to be disappointing . Paul Sherman of the Boston Herald thought that Surf Ninjas was " little more than a succession of <unk> , surfing , skateboarding , video games , generic rock soundtrack and strained knucklehead humor " . Sherman admired the story arc in which the protagonists learn to accept their destinies , but he thought that " the manufactured thrills along the way get obnoxious " . Sherman thought that the film would only appeal to children under 12 years old , though the film 's locations in Thailand in the second half added an exotic atmosphere . 
 Desmond Ryan of The Philadelphia Inquirer thought that Leslie Nielsen was deceptively portrayed in a major role similar to that of Lieutenant Frank Drebin from the The Naked Gun films , instead having merely " a running and unfunny gag about his malfunctioning answering machine and generally wasted otherwise " . Ryan also found the film 's dialogue to be " painful " and considered Surf Ninjas to be " beyond <unk> " . Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the story of Surf Ninjas to be " harmless and painfully dull " . LaSalle thought that the pacing of the film was too long with only " two smirks over the course of 90 minutes " . Sean Piccoli of The Washington Times thought that the film 's " dull stretch " was buoyed by the presence of Rob Schneider . Piccoli compared the martial arts choreography in the film to the " cartoon fantasies that little boys re @-@ enact on neighbors ' lawns : the good guys , alone and outnumbered by the charging horde , air @-@ punch their way to glory " . 
 Ron Weiskind of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette perceived Reyes , Jr. as " a likable presence on screen " and Schneider to be occasionally humorous in his series of gaffes . Weiskind thought that even with the abundance of martial arts in the film , the scenes were generally too lifeless . Joe Holleman of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch thought that Surf Ninjas pushed " the right buttons to guarantee adolescent enjoyment " . Holleman acknowledged that the film was " not exactly a milestone in cinematic achievement " , but he applauded the acrobatic choreography and the delivery of Schneider 's throwaway lines in " the movie 's funniest moments " . Sean P. Means of The Salt Lake Tribune described the film as a Toys " R " Us version of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , with " the cartoonish martial @-@ arts sequences [ owing ] their entire existence to the villains ' stupidity " . Means thought that the film was ultimately " as silly as it is forgettable " . 
 = Lead = 
 Lead ( / <unk> / ) is a chemical element in the carbon group with symbol Pb ( from Latin : plumbum ) and atomic number 82 . It is a soft , malleable and heavy post @-@ transition metal . Freshly cut , solid lead has a bluish @-@ white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air ; the liquid metal has shiny chrome @-@ silver luster . Lead has the highest atomic number of any non @-@ radioactive element ( two radioactive elements , namely technetium and promethium , are lighter ) , although the next higher element , bismuth , has one isotope with a half @-@ life that is long enough ( over one billion times the estimated age of the universe ) to be considered stable . Lead 's four stable isotopes each have 82 protons , a magic number in the nuclear shell model of atomic nuclei . The isotope lead @-@ 208 also has 126 neutrons , another magic number , and is hence double magic , a property that grants it enhanced stability : lead @-@ 208 is the heaviest known stable nuclide . 
 Lead is used in building construction , lead @-@ acid batteries , bullets and shot , weights , as part of solders , <unk> , fusible alloys , and as a radiation shield . 
 If ingested or inhaled , lead and its compounds are poisonous to animals and humans . Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates both in soft tissues and the bones , damaging the nervous system and causing brain disorders . Excessive lead also causes blood disorders in mammals . Lead poisoning has been documented since ancient Rome , ancient Greece , and ancient China .

 Lead is a bright silvery metal with a very slight shade of blue in a dry atmosphere . It tarnishes on contact with air , forming a complex mixture of compounds whose color and composition depend on conditions , sometimes with significant amounts of carbonates and <unk> . Lead 's characteristic properties include high density , softness , ductility , malleability , poor electrical conductivity compared to other metals , high resistance to corrosion , and ability to react with organic chemicals . 
 Various traces of other metals significantly change its properties : adding small amounts of antimony or copper increases the lead alloy 's hardness and improves resistance to sulfuric acid corrosion . Some other metals , such as cadmium , tin , and tellurium , improve hardness and fight metal fatigue . Sodium and calcium also have this ability , but they reduce the alloy 's chemical stability . Finally , zinc and bismuth simply impair the corrosion resistance . Adding small amounts of lead improves the ductility of steel , but lead impurities mostly worsen the quality of industrial materials . 
 Lead has only one common allotrope , which is face @-@ centered cubic , with the length of an edge of a unit cell being 349 pm . Unlike the other elements in its group , it does not have a diamond cubic allotrope . At 327 @.@ 5 ° C ( 621 @.@ 5 ° F ) , lead melts ; the melting point exceeds that of tin ( 232 ° C , 449 @.@ 5 ° F ) , but is significantly below that of germanium ( 938 ° C , 1721 ° F ) . The boiling point of lead is 1749 ° C ( <unk> ° F ) , below those of both tin ( 2602 ° C , <unk> ° F ) and germanium ( <unk> ° C , 5131 ° F ) . Densities increase down the group : the values of germanium and tin ( 5 @.@ 23 and 7 @.@ 29 g · cm − 3 , respectively ) are significantly below that of lead : 11 @.@ 32 g · cm − 3 .

 Lead has four observationally stable isotopes , lead @-@ 204 , lead @-@ 206 , lead @-@ 207 , and lead @-@ 208 . The relative multitude of its stable isotopes relies on the fact that lead 's atomic number of 82 is even . With its high atomic number , lead is the second @-@ heaviest element that occurs naturally in the form of isotopes that could be treated as stable for any practical applications : bismuth has a higher atomic number of 83 , but its only primordial isotope was found in 2003 to be actually very slightly radioactive . The four stable isotopes of lead could theoretically undergo alpha decay to isotopes of mercury with release of energy as well , but this has not been observed for any of them : accordingly , their predicted half @-@ lives are extremely long , ranging up to over 10100 years . As such , lead is often quoted as the heaviest stable element . 
 Three of these isotopes also found in three of the four major decay chains : lead @-@ 206 , lead @-@ 207 , and lead @-@ 208 are the final decay products of uranium @-@ 238 , uranium @-@ 235 , and thorium @-@ 232 , respectively ; the decay chains are called the uranium series , actinium series , and thorium series , respectively . Since the amounts of them in nature depend also on the presence of other elements , the isotopic composition of natural lead varies between samples : in particular , the relative amount of lead @-@ 206 may vary between 20 @.@ 84 % and 27 @.@ 78 % , and the relative amount of lead @-@ 208 may vary between 52 @.@ 4 % in normal samples to 90 % in thorium ores . ( For this reason , the atomic weight of lead is given with such imprecision , to only one decimal place . ) As time passes , relative amounts of lead @-@ 206 and lead @-@ 207 to that of lead @-@ 204 increase , since the former two are supplemented by radioactive decay of heavier elements and the latter is not ; this allows for lead – lead dating . Analogously , as uranium decays ( eventually ) into lead , their relative amounts change ; this allows for uranium – lead dating . 
 Apart from the stable isotopes , which make up almost all of lead that exists naturally , there are trace quantities of a few radioactive isotopes . One of them is lead @-@ 210 ; although it has a half @-@ life of 22 @.@ 3 years , a period too short to allow any primordial lead @-@ 210 to still exist , some small non @-@ primordial quantities of it occur in nature , because lead @-@ 210 is found in the uranium series : thus , even though it constantly decays away , its amount is also constantly regenerated by decay of its parent , polonium @-@ 214 , which , while also constantly decaying , is also supplied by decay of its parent , and so on , all the way up to original uranium @-@ 238 , which has been present for billions of years on Earth . Lead @-@ 210 is particularly well known for helping to identify ages of samples containing it , which is performed by measuring lead @-@ 210 to lead @-@ 206 ratios ( both isotopes are present in a single decay chain ) . Lead @-@ 214 is also present in the decay chain of natural uranium @-@ 238 , lead @-@ 212 is present in that of natural thorium @-@ 232 , and lead @-@ 211 is present in that of natural uranium @-@ 235 ; therefore , traces of all three of these isotopes exist naturally as well . Lastly , very minute traces of lead @-@ 209 are also present from the cluster decay of radium @-@ 223 , one of the daughter products of natural uranium @-@ 235 . Hence , natural lead consists of not only the four stable isotopes , but also minute traces of another five short @-@ lived radioisotopes . 
 In total , thirty @-@ eight isotopes of lead have been synthesized , those with mass numbers of 178 – 215 . Lead @-@ 205 is the most stable radioisotope of lead , with a half @-@ life of around 1 @.@ 5 × 107 years . The second @-@ most stable radioisotope is the synthetic lead @-@ 202 , which has a half @-@ life of about <unk> years , longer than any of the natural trace radioisotopes . Additionally , 47 nuclear isomers ( long @-@ lived excited nuclear states ) , corresponding to 24 lead isotopes , have been characterized . The longest @-@ lived isomer is lead @-@ <unk> ( half @-@ life of about 1 @.@ 1 hours ) .

 A lead atom has 82 electrons , arranged in an electronic configuration of [ Xe ] <unk> . The first and second ionization energies — energies required to remove an electron from a neutral atom and an electron from a resulting singly charged ion — of lead combined are close to those of tin , its upper group 14 neighbor ; this proximity is caused by the 4f shell — no f shell is present in previous group 14 elements atoms — and the thereby following lanthanide contraction . However , the first four ionization energies of lead combined exceed those of tin , opposite to what the periodic trends would predict . For that reason , unlike tin , lead is reluctant to form the + 4 oxidation state in inorganic compounds . 
 Such unusual behavior is rationalized by relativistic effects , which are increasingly stronger closer to the bottom of the periodic table ; one of such effects is the spin – orbit interaction , particularly the inert pair effect , which stabilizes the 6s orbital . The inert pair effect in lead comes from the great difference in electronegativity between lead and the anions ( oxide , halides , nitrides ) , which results in positive charge on lead and then leads to a stronger contraction of the 6s orbital than the 6p orbital , making the 6s orbital rather inert . ( However , this is not applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds ; as such , lead , similarly to carbon , is dominantly tetravalent in organolead compounds . ) The spin – orbit interaction not only stabilizes the 6s electron levels , but also two of the six 6p levels ; and lead has just two 6p electrons . This effect takes part in making lead slightly less reactive chemically . 
 The figures for electrode potential show that lead is only slightly easier to oxidize than hydrogen . Lead thus can dissolve in acids , but this is often impossible due to specific problems ( such as the formation of insoluble salts ) . Electronegativity , although often thought to be constant for each element , is a variable property ; lead shows a high electronegativity difference between values for lead ( II ) and lead ( IV ) — 1 @.@ 87 and 2 @.@ 33 , accordingly . This marks the reversal of the trend of stability of the + 4 oxidation state in group 14 down the group from increasing to decreasing ; tin , for comparison , has electronegativities of 1 @.@ 80 and 1 @.@ 96 .

 Powdered lead burns with a bluish @-@ white flame . As with many metals , finely divided powdered lead exhibits pyrophoricity . Bulk lead released to the air forms a protective layer of insoluble lead oxide , which covers the metal from undergoing further reactions . Other insoluble compounds , such as sulfate or chloride , may form the protective layer if lead is exposed to a different chemical environment . 
 Fluorine reacts with lead at room temperature , forming lead ( II ) fluoride . The reaction with chlorine is similar , although it requires heating : the chloride layer diminishes the reactivity of the elements . Molten lead reacts with all the chalcogens . 
 Presence of carbonates or sulfates results in the formation of insoluble lead salts , which protect the metal from corrosion . So does carbon dioxide , as the insoluble lead carbonate is formed ; however , an excess of the gas leads to the formation of the soluble bicarbonate , which makes the use of lead pipes dangerous . Water in the presence of oxygen attacks lead to start an accelerating reaction . Lead also dissolves in quite concentrated alkalis ( ≥ 10 % ) because of the amphoteric character and solubility of <unk> . 
 The metal is normally not attacked by sulfuric acid ; however , concentrated acid does dissolve lead thanks to complexation . Lead does react with hydrochloric acid , albeit slowly , and nitric acid , quite actively , to form nitrogen oxides and lead ( II ) nitrate . Organic acids , such as acetic acid , also dissolves lead , but this reaction requires oxygen as well .

 In a vast majority of its compounds , lead occurs in oxidation states + 2 or + 4 . Lead ( II ) compounds are normally ionic but lead ( IV ) compounds are often covalent . Even the strongest oxidizing elements ( oxygen , fluorine ) oxidize lead to only lead ( II ) initially .

 Most inorganic compounds that lead forms are lead ( II ) compounds . This includes binary compounds ; lead forms such compounds with many nonmetals , but not with all of them , as for example there is no known lead carbide . 
 Even though most lead ( II ) compounds are ionic , they are not as ionic as those of many other metals . In particular , many lead ( II ) compounds are water @-@ insoluble . In solution , lead ( II ) ions are colorless , but under specific conditions , lead is capable of changing its color . Unlike tin ( II ) ions , these do not react as reducing agents in solution . 
 Lead monoxide exists in two allotropes , red α @-@ PbO and yellow β @-@ PbO , the latter being stable only from around 488 ° C. It is the most commonly applicable compound of lead . However , its hydroxide counterpart , lead ( II ) hydroxide , is not capable of existence outside solutions ; in solution , it is known to form anions , <unk> . Lead commonly reacts with the heavier chalcogens . Lead sulfide can only be dissolved in strong acids . It is a semiconductor , a photoconductor , and an extremely sensitive infrared radiation detector . A mixture of the monoxide and the monosulfide when heated forms the metal . The other two chalcogenides are <unk> as well . 
 Lead dihalides are known and well @-@ characterized ; this refers to not only the binary halides ( even including the <unk> ) , but also mixed ones , such as <unk> , etc . The difluoride is the first ionically conducting compound to have been discovered . The other dihalides decompose on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light , especially notably for the diiodide . There are anion counterparts for the heavier three dihalides , such as <unk> − 
 6 . Many pseudohalides are also known .

 Few lead ( IV ) compounds are known . Inorganic lead ( IV ) compounds are typically strong oxidants or exist only in highly acidic solutions . Lead ( II ) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation , Pb 
 3O 
 4 . It is described as lead ( II , IV ) oxide , or structurally <unk> • PbO 
 2 , and is the best @-@ known mixed valence lead compound . Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent , capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid . Like lead monoxide , lead dioxide is capable of forming anions , <unk> . Lead tetrafluoride , a yellow crystalline powder , is stable , but less stable than the difluoride . Lead tetrachloride decomposes at room temperature , lead tetrabromide is less stable still and the existence of lead tetraiodide is questionable . Lead disulfide , like the monosulfide , is a semiconductor . Lead ( IV ) selenide is also known .
