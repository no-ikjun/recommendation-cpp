 = SMS Hessen = 
 SMS Hessen was the third of five pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Braunschweig class . She was laid down in 1902 , launched the following year , and commissioned into the German Imperial Navy in 1905 . She was named after the state of Hesse . Her sister ships were SMS Braunschweig , SMS Elsass , SMS Preussen , and SMS Lothringen . Like all other pre @-@ dreadnoughts built at the turn of the century , Hessen was quickly made obsolete by the launching of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 ; as a result , she saw only limited service with the German fleet . 
 During World War I , Hessen saw action in the Battle of Jutland as the second ship of the III Division of the II Battle Squadron . In the last daytime action between capital ships at Jutland , Hessen and the other pre @-@ dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron covered the retreat of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper 's battered battlecruisers from Vice Admiral David Beatty 's battlecruiser squadron . After the battle , the vessel was disarmed and used as a depot ship . 
 Hessen was one of the few obsolete battleships Germany was permitted to retain under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles . She served as a coastal defense ship in the 1920s and early 1930s , though she was withdrawn from front @-@ line service in 1934 . The following year , the ship was converted into a radio @-@ controlled target . During World War II Hessen served in this capacity , while also working as an icebreaker in the Baltic and North Seas . The ship was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946 after the end of the war and , renamed Tsel , served until scrapped in 1960 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Hessen 's keel was laid in 1899 , at the Germaniawerft in Kiel under construction number 100 . The third unit of her class , she was ordered under the contract name " L " as a new unit for the fleet . The ship cost 23 @,@ 867 @,@ 000 marks . Hessen was launched on 18 September 1903 and commissioned on 19 July 1905 . 
 The ship was 127 @.@ 7 m ( 419 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 22 @.@ 2 m ( 72 ft 10 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 1 m ( 26 ft 7 in ) forward . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws . Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical boilers , all of which burned coal . Hessen 's powerplant was rated at 16 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 15 @,@ 781 ihp ; 11 @,@ 768 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 Hessen 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 28 cm ( 11 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and eighteen 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 35 quick @-@ firing guns . The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all mounted submerged in the hull . 
 = = Service history = = 
 In July 1908 , Hessen participated in the annual summer cruise , which went into the Atlantic that year . During the cruise , the ship stopped in Tenerife , along with the battleships Deutschland and Pommern . During fleet exercises on 23 August 1911 , Hessen accidentally rammed and sank the Danish steamer <unk> . The crew of the steamer was rescued and there were no reported injuries . In October , the ship was badly damaged when she was rammed by the Danish steamer Argo . In July 1913 , Hessen collided with the torpedo boat <unk> . The torpedo boat suffered significant damage , though it did not sink , and three of its crew were killed . 
 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the ship was assigned to the IV Battle Squadron along with her four sisters , and served primarily in the Baltic Sea . Hessen performed fleet duties up through the first two years of World War I. Hessen was present as part of the distant support for the battlecruisers that bombarded Scarborough , Hartlepool , and Whitby on 15 – 16 December 1914 . During the operation , the German battle fleet of 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre @-@ dreadnoughts came to within 10 nmi ( 19 km ; 12 mi ) of an isolated squadron of six British battleships . However , skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens convinced the German commander , Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , that he was confronted with the entire Grand Fleet , and so he broke off the engagement and turned for home . 
 Another raid on the English coast followed on 24 – 25 April ; this time , the battlecruisers bombarded Yarmouth and Lowestoft . During this operation , the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely . Visibility was poor , so the operation was quickly called off before the British fleet could intervene and inflict further losses . 
 = = = Battle of Jutland = = = 
 Hessen took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . Hessen and the five ships of the Deutschland class formed the II Battle Squadron , under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Mauve . During the battle , Hessen and the Deutschland @-@ class ships performed a vital blocking action that covered the withdrawal of the German battlecruisers . Vice Admiral David Beatty 's battlecruisers had attacked the German ships in the darkness , and when the German ships had turned westward to evade their attackers , Mauve continued in a southerly course , which placed his ships between the British and German battlecruisers . The British battlecruisers turned their attention to the pre @-@ dreadnoughts , who in turn altered their course to the southwest in order to bring all of their guns to bear on the British ships . In the darkness , only muzzle flashes from the British ships could be seen ; as a result Hessen and the other II Squadron ships held their fire . 
 At approximately 03 : 00 on 1 June , a group of British destroyers launched a torpedo attack against the German battle line . At 03 : 07 , Hessen narrowly avoided a torpedo , but Pommern , the ship directly ahead of Hessen , was not so lucky . At 03 : 10 , Pommern was struck by at least one torpedo , which is believed to have detonated one of the ship 's 6 @.@ 7 in ( 17 cm ) shell magazines , destroying the ship . Hessen was undamaged . Aboard Hessen , it was assumed that a submarine had destroyed Pommern ; at 03 : 12 Hessen fired her main battery at an imagined submarine . Hessen and several other battleships engaged imaginary submarines again at 05 : 06 , and again at 05 : 13 . Gunfire from Hessen and Hannover during the latter incident nearly hit the light cruisers Stettin and München ; Admiral Scheer ordered them to cease fire . At 06 : 55 , Hessen and Schlesien mistook a mine buoy dropped by Kaiser as a periscope and attacked it . In the course of the battle , Hessen had fired five 28 cm rounds , thirty @-@ four 17 cm shells , and twenty @-@ four 8 @.@ 8 cm rounds . 
 In 1917 , Hessen was withdrawn from active service , disarmed , and used as a depot ship in Brunsbüttel . While in reserve at Brunsbüttel , Hessen was jokingly referred to as SMS " <unk> <unk> " ( SMS " Dead Slow " ) because of a warning that had been painted on the ship 's hull . The ship 's four 28 cm guns were re @-@ mounted as railroad guns and employed on the Western Front . The Australian Army captured one of the guns on 8 August 1918 ; it 's preserved as the Amiens Gun at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra , Australia . 
 = = = Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine = = = 
 Hessen was one of eight old pre @-@ dreadnoughts , along with the other ships of her class and the Deutschland @-@ class battleships Schleswig @-@ Holstein and Schlesien , that Germany was permitted to retain under the terms of Treaty of Versailles . After being refitted and rearmed , Hessen returned to service with the Reichsmarine in 1925 . Of the eight ships , Hessen was one of only three still in service as a warship when the Nazi Party under Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 . The Nazis began a program of naval rearmament ; this included the battleship Gneisenau , which was ordered as a replacement for Hessen in 1934 . 
 On 12 November 1934 , Hessen was withdrawn from fleet service and placed in reserve . On 31 March 1935 , Hessen was stricken from the reserve list and converted into a target ship . Her armament was removed , the hull was lengthened , and new machinery was installed . The longer hull allowed room for two additional watertight compartments , which brought the number up to 15 from the original 13 . The ship 's superstructure was cut down nearly entirely ; Hessen retained only a single funnel , a tower foremast , and the two armored barbettes for the main battery turrets . The ship had a crew of 80 , but could be operated by remote control when being used as a target . 
 Hessen was recommissioned on 1 April 1937 and served in the Kriegsmarine through World War II . On 31 March 1940 , Hessen acted as an icebreaker for the auxiliary cruisers Atlantis , Widder , and Orion , on their trip from Kiel to the North Sea . She and her control ship , Blitz , were ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946 . She recommissioned on 3 June 1946 as Tsel , and continued to operate as a target ship until scrapped in 1960 .

 Frigatebirds ( also listed as " frigate bird " , " frigate @-@ bird " , " frigate " , frigate @-@ petrel " ) are a family of seabirds called Fregatidae which are found across all tropical and subtropical oceans . The five extant species are classified in a single genus , Fregata . All have predominantly black plumage , long , deeply forked tails and long hooked bills . Females have white underbellies and males have a distinctive red gular pouch , which they inflate during the breeding season to attract females . Their wings are long and pointed and can span up to 2 @.@ 3 metres ( 7 @.@ 5 ft ) , the largest wing area to body weight ratio of any bird . 
 Able to soar for weeks on wind currents , frigatebirds spend most of the day in flight hunting for food , and roost on trees or cliffs at night . Their main prey are fish and squid , caught when chased to the water surface by large predators such as tuna . Frigatebirds are referred to as kleptoparasites as they occasionally rob other seabirds for food , and are known to snatch seabird chicks from the nest . Seasonally monogamous , frigatebirds nest colonially . A rough nest is constructed in low trees or on the ground on remote islands . A single egg is laid each breeding season . The duration of parental care is among the longest of any bird species ; frigatebirds are only able to breed every other year . 
 The Fregatidae are a sister group to Suloidea which consists of cormorants , darters , gannets , and boobies . Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread , ( the magnificent , great and lesser frigatebirds ) while two are endangered ( the Christmas Island and Ascension Island frigatebirds ) and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each . The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene , around 50 million years ago . Classified in the genus Limnofregata , the three species had shorter , less @-@ hooked bills and longer legs , and lived in a freshwater environment . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The term Frigate Bird itself was used in 1738 by the English naturalist and illustrator Eleazar Albin in his A Natural History of the Birds . The book included an illustration of the male bird showing the red gular pouch . Like the genus name , the English term is derived from the French mariners ' name for the bird la frégate — a frigate or fast warship . The etymology was mentioned by French naturalist Jean @-@ Baptiste Du Tertre when describing the bird in 1667 . 
 Christopher Columbus encountered frigatebirds when passing the Cape Verde Islands on his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492 . In his journal entry for 29 September he used the word <unk> , modern Spanish <unk> or <unk> . In the Caribbean frigatebirds were called Man @-@ of @-@ War birds by English mariners . This name was used by the English explorer William Dampier in his book An Account of a New Voyage Around the World published in 1697 : 
 The Man @-@ of @-@ War ( as it is called by the English ) is about the bigness of a Kite , and in shape like it , but black ; and the neck is red . It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water , but soars aloft like a Kite , and when it sees its prey , it <unk> down head foremost to the Waters edge , very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill , and immediately mounts again as swiftly ; never touching the Water with his Bill . His Wings are very long ; his feet are like other Land @-@ fowl , and he builds on Trees , where he finds any ; but where they are wanting on the ground . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 Frigatebirds were grouped with cormorants , and sulids ( gannets and boobies ) as well as pelicans in the genus Pelecanus by Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae . He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip , linear nostrils , a bare face , and fully webbed feet . The genus Fregata was defined by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799 . Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot described the genus name <unk> in 1816 for the great frigatebird . The genus name <unk> had been coined by German naturalist Paul <unk> in 1752 , though this has no validity as it predates the official beginning of Linnaean taxonomy . 
 In 1874 , English zoologist Alfred Henry Garrod published a study where he had examined various groups of birds and recorded which muscles of a selected group of five they possessed or lacked . Noting that the muscle patterns were different among the <unk> ( classical Pelecaniformes ) , he resolved that there were divergent lineages in the group that should be in separate families , including frigatebirds in their own family Fregatidae . <unk> N. Lanham observed in 1947 that frigatebirds bore some skeletal characteristics more in common with Procellariiformes than Pelecaniformes , though concluded they still belonged in the latter group ( as suborder <unk> ) , albeit as an early offshoot . Martyn Kennedy and colleagues derived a cladogram based on behavioural characteristics of the traditional Pelecaniformes , calculating the frigatebirds to be more divergent than pelicans from a core group of gannets , darters and cormorants , and tropicbirds the most distant lineage . The classification of this group as the traditional Pelecaniformes , united by feet that are <unk> ( with all four toes linked by webbing ) and the presence of a gular pouch , persisted until the early 1990s . The DNA – DNA hybridization studies of Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist placed the frigatebirds in a lineage with penguins , loons , petrels and albatrosses . Subsequent genetic studies place the frigatebirds as a sister group to the group Suloidea , which comprises the gannets and boobies , cormorants and darters . Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of frigatebirds resembled those of other Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick <unk> material over the crystalline shells . 
 Molecular studies have consistently shown that pelicans , the namesake family of the Pelecaniformes , are actually more closely related to herons , ibises and spoonbills , the hamerkop and the shoebill than to the remaining species . In recognition of this , the order comprising the frigatebirds and Suloidea was renamed Suliformes in 2010 . 
 In 1994 the family name Fregatidae , cited as described in 1867 by French naturalists Côme @-@ Damien <unk> and <unk> <unk> , was conserved under Article 40 ( b ) of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in preference to the 1840 description <unk> by Johann Friedrich von Brandt . This was because the genus names <unk> and <unk> had been synonymised with Fregata before 1961 , resulting in the aligning of family and genus names . 
 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 The Eocene frigatebird genus Limnofregata comprises birds whose fossil remains were recovered from prehistoric freshwater environments , unlike the marine preferences of their modern @-@ day relatives . They had shorter less @-@ hooked bills and longer legs , and longer slit @-@ like nasal openings . Three species have been described from fossil deposits in the western United States , two — L. <unk> and L. <unk> — from the Green River Formation ( 48 – 52 million years old ) and one — L. <unk> — from the Wasatch Formation ( between 53 and 55 million years of age ) . Fossil material indistinguishable from living species dating to the Pleistocene and Holocene has been recovered from Ascension Island ( for F. aquila ) , Saint Helena Island , both in the southern Atlantic Ocean , and also from various islands in the Pacific Ocean ( for F. minor and F. <unk> ) . 
 A cladistic study of the skeletal and bone morphology of the classical Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a clade with Limnofregata . Birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae , unlike almost all other Ciconiiformes , Suliformes and Pelecaniformes , which have 17 . The age of Limnofregata indicates that these lineages had separated by the Eocene . 
 = = = Living species and infrageneric classification = = = 
 The type species of the genus is the Ascension frigatebird ( Fregata aquila ) . For many years , the consensus was to recognise only two species of frigatebird , with larger birds as F. aquila and smaller as F. <unk> . In 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews delineated five species , which remain valid . Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the five species had diverged from a common ancestor only recently — as little as 1 @.@ 5 million years ago . There are two species pairs , the great and Christmas Island frigatebirds , and the magnificent and Ascension frigatebirds , while the fifth species , the lesser frigatebird , is an early offshoot of the common ancestor of the other four species . Three subspecies of the lesser and five subspecies of the great frigatebird are recognised . 
 = = Description = = 
 Frigatebirds are large slender mostly black @-@ plumaged seabirds , with the five species similar in appearance to each other . The largest species is the magnificent frigatebird , which reaches 114 cm ( 45 in ) in length , with three of the remaining four almost as large . The lesser frigatebird is substantially smaller , at around 71 cm ( 28 in ) long . Frigatebirds exhibit marked sexual dimorphism ; females are larger and up to 25 percent heavier than males , and generally have white markings on their underparts . Frigatebirds have short necks and long , slender hooked bills . Their long narrow wings ( male wingspan can reach 2 @.@ 3 metres ( 7 @.@ 5 ft ) ) taper to points . Their wings have eleven primary flight feathers , with the tenth the longest and eleventh a vestigial feather only , and 23 secondaries . Their tails are deeply forked , though this is not apparent unless the tail is fanned . The tail and wings give them a distinctive ' W ' silhouette in flight . The legs and face are fully feathered . The <unk> feet are short and weak , the webbing is reduced and part of each toe is free . 
 The bones of frigatebirds are markedly pneumatic ( filled with air ) , making them very light and contribute only 5 % to total body weight . The pectoral girdle ( shoulder joint ) is strong as its bones are fused . The pectoral muscles are well @-@ developed , and weigh as much as the frigatebird 's feathers — around half the body weight is made up equally of these muscles and feathers . The males have inflatable red @-@ coloured throat pouches called gular pouches , which they inflate to attract females during the mating season . The gular sac is , perhaps , the most striking frigatebird feature . These can only deflate slowly , so males that are disturbed will fly off with pouches distended for some time . 
 Frigatebirds remain in the air and do not settle on the ocean . They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their feathers would become sodden if they settled on the surface . In addition , with their long wings relative to body size , they would have great difficulty taking off again . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Frigatebirds are found over tropical oceans , and ride warm updrafts under cumulus clouds . Their range coincides with availability of food such as flying fish , and with the trade winds , which provide the windy conditions that facilitate their flying . They are rare vagrants to temperate regions and not found in polar latitudes . Adults are generally sedentary , remaining near the islands where they breed . However , male frigatebirds have been recorded dispersing great distances after departing a breeding colony — one male great frigatebird relocated from Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel to the Maldives 4 @,@ 400 km ( 2 @,@ 700 mi ) away , and a male magnificent frigatebird flew 1 @,@ 400 km ( 870 mi ) from French Guiana to Trinidad . Great frigatebirds marked with wing tags on Tern Island in the French Frigate Shoals were found to regularly travel the 873 km ( 542 mi ) to Johnston Atoll , although one was reported in Quezon City in the Philippines . Genetic testing seems to indicate that the species has fidelity to their site of hatching despite their high mobility . Young birds may disperse far and wide , with distances of up to 6 @,@ 000 km ( 3 @,@ 700 mi ) recorded . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 Having the largest wing @-@ area @-@ to @-@ body @-@ weight ratio of any bird , frigatebirds are essentially aerial . This allows them to soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings . One great frigatebird , being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean , stayed aloft for two months . They can fly higher than 4 @,@ 000 meters in freezing conditions . Like swifts they are able to spend the night on the wing , but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs . Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging . Highly adept , they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing @-@ beats , though not suited to flying by sustained flapping . Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards . Conversely , frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily . 
 The average life span is unknown but in common with seabirds such as the wandering albatross and Leach 's storm petrel , frigatebirds are long @-@ lived . In 2002 , 35 ringed great frigatebirds were recovered on Tern Island in the Hawaiian Islands . Of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age . 
 Despite having dark plumage in a tropical climate , frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat — particularly as they are exposed to full sunlight when on the nest . They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation , and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection . Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings , and males frequently flutter their gular pouches . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Frigatebirds ' feeding habits are pelagic , and they may forage up to 500 km ( 310 mi ) from land . They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long , hooked bills . They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish , particularly the genera <unk> and <unk> , that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish , but they will also eat cephalopods , particularly squid . <unk> of the genus Brevoortia can be an important prey item where common , and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten . Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas . Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators . Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds , including boobies , petrels , shearwaters and terns , in particular the sooty tern . 
 Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies , particularly the red @-@ footed booby , tropicbirds , shearwaters , petrels , terns , gulls and even ospreys of their catch , using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents . They may either assail their targets after they have caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food . Although frigatebirds are renowned for their <unk> feeding behaviour , kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species , and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting . A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40 % of the food they needed , and on average obtained only 5 % . 
 Unlike most other seabirds , frigatebirds drink freshwater when they come across it , by swooping down and gulping with their bills . 
 = = = Breeding behaviour = = = 
 Frigatebirds typically breed on remote oceanic islands , generally in colonies of up to 5000 birds . Within these colonies , they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 ( or rarely 100 ) individuals . Breeding can occur at any time of year , often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food . 
 Frigatebirds have the most elaborate mating displays of all seabirds . The male birds take up residence in the colony in groups of up to thirty individuals . They display to females flying overhead by pointing their bills upwards , inflating their red throat pouches and vibrating their outstretched wings , showing the lighter wing undersurfaces in the process . They produce a drumming sound by vibrating their bills together and sometimes give a whistling call . The female descends to join a male she has chosen and allows him to take her bill in his . The pair also engages in mutual " head @-@ snaking " . 
 After copulation it is generally the male who gathers sticks and the female that constructs the loosely woven nest . The nest is subsequently covered with ( and cemented by ) guano . Frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes , though when these are not available they will nest on the ground . A single white egg that weighs up to 6 – 7 % of mother 's body mass is laid , and is incubated in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days . The altricial chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down . They are continuously guarded by the parents for the first 4 – 6 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5 – 6 months . Both parents take turns feeding for the first three months , after which the male 's attendance tails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another six to nine months on average . The chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents ' throat and eating the part @-@ regurgitated food . It takes so long to rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year . 
 The duration of parental care in frigatebirds is among the longest for birds , rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids . Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity . A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage . This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine years of age and by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age . 
 = = = Parasites = = = 
 Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in that they often carry blood parasites . Blood @-@ borne protozoa of the genus Haemoproteus have been recovered from four of the five species . Bird lice of the <unk> genus <unk> and <unk> genus Colpocephalum and species <unk> <unk> have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands . Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study . 
 A heavy chick mortality at a large and important colony of the magnificent frigatebird , located on Île du Grand <unk> off French Guiana , was recorded in summer 2005 . Chicks showed nodular skin lesions , feather loss and corneal changes , with around half the year 's progeny perishing across the colony . An <unk> was isolated and provisionally named Fregata <unk> herpesvirus , though it was unclear whether it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition . 
 = = Status and conservation = = 
 = = = Populations and threats = = = 
 Two of the five species are considered at risk . In 2003 , a survey of the four colonies of the critically endangered Christmas Island frigatebirds counted 1200 breeding pairs . As frigatebirds normally breed every other year , the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs . Larger numbers formerly bred on the island , but the clearance of breeding habitat during World War II and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease . The population of the vulnerable Ascension frigatebird has been estimated at around 12 @,@ 500 individuals . The birds formerly bred on Ascension Island itself , but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815 . The birds continued to breed on a rocky outcrop just off the shore of the island . A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats and a few birds have returned to nest on the island . 
 The other three species are classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern . The populations of all three are large , with that of the magnificent frigatebird thought to be increasing , while the great and lesser frigatebird decreasing . Monitoring populations of all species is difficult due to their movements across the open ocean and low <unk> . The status of the Atlantic populations of the great and lesser frigatebirds are unknown and possibly extinct . 
 As frigatebirds rely on large marine predators such as tuna for their prey , overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations . As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas , they are vulnerable to local disasters that could wipe out the rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones . 
 = = = Hunting = = = 
 In Nauru , catching frigatebirds was an important tradition still practised to a some degree . Donald W. Buden writes : " Birds typically are captured by slinging the weighted end of a coil of line in front of an approaching bird attracted to previously captured birds used as decoys . In a successful toss , the line becomes entangled about the bird 's wing and bringing [ sic ] it to ground . " Marine birds including frigatebirds were once harvested for food on Christmas Island but this practice ceased in the late 1970s . Eggs and young of magnificent frigatebirds were taken and eaten in the Caribbean . Great frigatebirds were eaten in the Hawaiian Islands and their feathers used for decoration . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 The great frigatebird was venerated by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island ; carvings of the birdman <unk> manu depict him with the characteristic hooked beak and throat pouch . Its incorporation into local ceremonies suggests that the now @-@ vanished species was extant there between the 1800s and 1860s . 
 Maritime folklore around the time America was discovered held that frigatebirds were birds of good omen as their presence meant land was near . 
 There are anecdotal reports of tame frigatebirds being kept across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific . A bird that had come from one island and had been taken elsewhere could be reliably trusted to return to its original home , hence would be used as a speedy way to relay a message there . There is firmer evidence of this practice taking place in the Gilbert Islands and Tuvalu . 
 = Bioluminescence = 
 Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism . It is a form of chemiluminescence . Bioluminescence occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates , as well as in some fungi , microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria and terrestrial invertebrates such as fireflies . In some animals , the light is produced by symbiotic organisms such as Vibrio bacteria . 
 The principal chemical reaction in bioluminescence involves the light @-@ emitting pigment luciferin and the enzyme luciferase , assisted by other proteins such as aequorin in some species . The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin . In some species , the type of luciferin requires cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions , and sometimes also the energy @-@ carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . In evolution , luciferins vary little : one in particular , coelenterazine , is found in nine different animal ( phyla ) , though in some of these , the animals obtain it through their diet . Conversely , luciferases vary widely in different species . Bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history . 
 Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder mentioned that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen was involved in the process , both in wood and in glow @-@ worms . It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated . The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups , especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water . On land it occurs in fungi , bacteria and some groups of invertebrates , including insects . 
 The uses of bioluminescence by animals include counter @-@ illumination camouflage , mimicry of other animals , for example to lure prey , and signalling to other individuals of the same species , such as to attract mates . In the laboratory , luciferase @-@ based systems are used in genetic engineering and for biomedical research . Other researchers are investigating the possibility of using bioluminescent systems for street and decorative lighting , and a bioluminescent plant has been created .

 Before the development of the safety lamp for use in coal mines , dried fish skins were used in Britain and Europe as a weak source of light . This experimental form of illumination avoided the necessity of using candles which risked sparking explosions of firedamp . Another safe source of illumination in mines was bottles containing fireflies . In 1920 , the American zoologist E. Newton Harvey published a monograph , The Nature of Animal Light , summarizing early work on bioluminescence . Harvey notes that Aristotle mentions light produced by dead fish and flesh , and that both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder ( in his Natural History ) mention light from damp wood . He also records that Robert Boyle experimented on these light sources , and showed that both they and the glow @-@ worm require air for light to be produced . Harvey notes that in 1753 , J. Baker identified the flagellate Noctiluca " as a luminous animal " " just visible to the naked eye " , and in 1854 Johann Florian Heller ( 1813 @-@ 1871 ) identified strands ( hyphae ) of fungi as the source of light in dead wood . 
 Tuckey , in his posthumous 1818 Narrative of the Expedition to the Zaire , described catching the animals responsible for luminescence . He mentions <unk> , crustaceans ( to which he ascribes the milky whiteness of the water ) , and cancers ( shrimps and crabs ) . Under the microscope he described the " luminous property " to be in the brain , resembling " a most brilliant amethyst about the size of a large pin 's head " . 
 Charles Darwin noticed bioluminescence in the sea , describing it in his Journal : 
 While sailing in these latitudes on one very dark night , the sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle . There was a fresh breeze , and every part of the surface , which during the day is seen as foam , now glowed with a pale light . The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus , and in her wake she was followed by a milky train . As far as the eye reached , the crest of every wave was bright , and the sky above the horizon , from the reflected glare of these livid flames , was not so utterly obscure , as over the rest of the heavens . 
 Darwin also observed a luminous " jelly @-@ fish of the genus <unk> " and noted that " When the waves scintillate with bright green sparks , I believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea . But there can be no doubt that very many other pelagic animals , when alive , are phosphorescent . " He guessed that " a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere " was probably responsible . Daniel Pauly comments that Darwin " was lucky with most of his guesses , but not here " , noting that biochemistry was too little known , and that the complex evolution of the marine animals involved " would have been too much for comfort " . 
 Bioluminescence attracted the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War , since submarines in some waters can create a bright enough wake to be detected ; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War , having been detected in this way . The navy was interested in predicting when such detection would be possible , and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection . 
 Among the anecdotes of navigation by bioluminescence , the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot he had found his way back to his aircraft carrier USS Shangri @-@ La when his navigation systems failed . Turning off his cabin lights , he saw the glowing wake of the ship , and was able to fly to it and land safely . 
 The French pharmacologist Raphaël Dubois carried out work on bioluminescence in the late nineteenth century . He studied click beetles ( <unk> ) and the marine bivalve mollusc <unk> dactylus . He refuted the old idea that bioluminescence came from phosphorus , and demonstrated that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound , which he named luciferin , by an enzyme . He sent Harvey siphons from the mollusc preserved in sugar . Harvey had become interested in bioluminescence as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there . He studied the phenomenon for many years . His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin , and the enzymes that act on it is to produce light , were interchangeable between species , showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor . However , he found this hypothesis to be false , with different organisms having major differences in the composition of their light @-@ producing proteins . He spent the next thirty years purifying and studying the components , but it fell to the young Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura to be the first to obtain crystalline luciferin . He used the sea firefly <unk> <unk> , but it was another ten years before he discovered the chemical 's structure and was able to publish his 1957 paper Crystalline <unk> Luciferin . More recently , Martin Chalfie , Osamu Shimomura and Roger Y. Tsien won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their 1961 discovery and development of green fluorescent protein as a tool for biological research . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 Bioluminescence in fish began at least by the Cretaceous period . About 1 @,@ 500 fish species are known to be bioluminescent , and this feature evolved independently at a minimum of 27 times . Of these 27 occasions , 17 involved the taking up of bioluminous bacteria from the surrounding water while in the others , the intrinsic light evolved through chemical synthesis . These fish have become surprisingly diverse in the deep ocean and control their light with the help of their nervous system , using it not just to lure prey or hide from predators , but also for communication . 
 = = Chemical mechanism = = 
 Bioluminescence is a form of chemiluminescence where light energy is released by a chemical reaction . Fireflies , anglerfish , and other organisms produce the light @-@ emitting pigment luciferin and the enzyme luciferase . Luciferin reacts with oxygen to create light : 
 <formula> 
 Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) and phosphate groups ( PP ) are released as waste products . <unk> catalyzes the reaction , which may be mediated by cofactors such as calcium ( Ca2 + ) or magnesium ( Mg2 + ) ions , and for some types of luciferin ( L ) also the energy @-@ carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell . In bacteria such as <unk> , the expression of genes related to bioluminescence is controlled by the lux operon . 
 In evolution , luciferins generally vary little : one in particular , coelenterazine , is the light emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla ( groups of very different organisms ) , including <unk> <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) , protozoa , comb jellies , cnidaria including jellyfish and corals , crustaceans , molluscs , arrow worms and vertebrates ( ray @-@ finned fish ) . Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine : some of them obtain it through their diet . Conversely , luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species . Overall , bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history . 
 Luciferin @-@ luciferase reactions are not the only way that organisms produce light . The parchment worm <unk> ( a marine Polychaete ) makes use of another <unk> , aequorin , instead of luciferase . When calcium ions are added , the aequorin 's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase . In a second , much slower , step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised ( <unk> ) form , allowing it to recombine with aequorin , in readiness for a subsequent flash . <unk> are thus enzymes , but with unusual reaction kinetics . 
 In the hydrozoan jellyfish <unk> victoria , some of the blue light released by aequorin in contact with calcium ions is absorbed by green fluorescent protein ; it in turn releases green light . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals , especially in the open sea , including fish , jellyfish , comb jellies , crustaceans , and cephalopod molluscs ; in some fungi and bacteria ; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects . Many , perhaps most deep @-@ sea animals produce light . Most marine light @-@ emission is in the blue and green light spectrum . However , some loose @-@ jawed fish emit red and infrared light , and the genus <unk> emits yellow light . 
 The most frequently encountered bioluminescent organisms may be the dinoflagellates present in the surface layers of the sea , which are responsible for the sparkling phosphorescence sometimes seen at night in disturbed water . At least eighteen genera exhibit luminosity . A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria , known as <unk> or the milky seas effect . 
 Non @-@ marine bioluminescence is less widely distributed , the two best @-@ known cases being in fireflies and glow worms . Other invertebrates including insect larvae , annelids and arachnids possess bioluminescent abilities . Some forms of bioluminescence are brighter ( or exist only ) at night , following a circadian rhythm . 
 = = Uses in nature = = 
 Bioluminescence has several functions in different taxa . Haddock et al . ( 2010 ) list as more or less definite functions in marine organisms the following : defensive functions of startle , counterillumination ( camouflage ) , misdirection ( smoke screen ) , distractive body parts , burglar alarm ( making predators easier for higher predators to see ) , and warning to deter settlers ; offensive functions of lure , stun or confuse prey , illuminate prey , and mate attraction / recognition . It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves . In some cases the function is unknown , as with species in three families of earthworm ( <unk> ) , such as <unk> longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves . The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms . 
 = = = Counterillumination camouflage = = = 
 In many animals of the deep sea , including several squid species , bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination , in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below . In these animals , photoreceptors control the illumination to match the brightness of the background . These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria . However , in one species , Euprymna scolopes , the bacteria are an integral component of the animal 's light organ . 
 = = = Attraction = = = 
 A fungus gnat from New Zealand , <unk> <unk> , lives in the predator @-@ free environment of caves and its larvae emit bluish @-@ green light . They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects , and wind in their fishing @-@ lines when prey becomes entangled . The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function . <unk> <unk> builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour . It has an inbuilt biological clock and , even when kept in total darkness , turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm . 
 Fireflies use light to attract mates . Two systems are involved according to species ; in one , females emit light from their abdomens to attract males ; in the other , flying males emit signals to which the sometimes sedentary females respond . Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground . The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive . Larvae of the click beetle <unk> <unk> live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil . They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed . 
 In the marine environment , use of luminescence for mate attraction is chiefly known among ostracods , small shrimplike crustaceans , especially in the <unk> family . Pheromones may be used for long @-@ distance communication , with bioluminescence used at close range to enable mates to " home in " . A polychaete worm , the Bermuda <unk> creates a brief display , a few nights after the full moon , when the female lights up to attract males . 
 = = = Defense = = = 
 Many cephalopods , including at least 70 genera of squid , are bioluminescent . Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial <unk> in the same way as many squid use ink . A cloud of luminescent material is expelled , distracting or repelling a potential predator , while the animal escapes to safety . The deep sea squid <unk> <unk> may <unk> portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash , thus distracting a predator while the animal flees . 
 <unk> may use bioluminescence for defence against predators . They shine when they detect a predator , possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting the attention of predators from higher trophic levels . Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash , unharmed ; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow , attracting predators , so the phytoplankton 's bioluminescence is defensive . The problem of shining stomach contents is solved ( and the explanation corroborated ) in predatory deep @-@ sea fishes : their stomachs have a black lining able to keep the light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators . 
 The sea @-@ firefly is a small crustacean living in sediment . At rest it emits a dull glow but when disturbed it darts away leaving a cloud of shimmering blue light to confuse the predator . During World War II it was gathered and dried for use by the Japanese military as a source of light during clandestine operations . 
 The larvae of railroad worms ( <unk> ) have paired photic organs on each body segment , able to glow with green light ; these are thought to have a defensive purpose . They also have organs on the head which produce red light ; they are the only terrestrial organisms to emit light of this colour . 
 = = = Warning = = = 
 Aposematism is a widely used function of bioluminescence , providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable . It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators ; millipedes glow for the same purpose . Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason . These include scale worms , jellyfish and brittle stars but further research is needed to fully establish the function of the luminescence . Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft @-@ bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way . The limpet <unk> <unk> is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light . It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti @-@ predator function . The marine snail <unk> <unk> uses flashes of light , probably to deter predators . The blue @-@ green light is emitted through the translucent shell , which functions as an efficient diffuser of light . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Communication in the form of quorum sensing plays a role in the regulation of luminescence in many species of bacteria . Small <unk> secreted molecules stimulate the bacteria to turn on genes for light production when cell density , measured by concentration of the secreted molecules , is high . 
 <unk> are colonial tunicates and each zooid has a pair of luminescent organs on either side of the inlet siphon . When stimulated by light , these turn on and off , causing rhythmic flashing . No neural pathway runs between the zooids , but each responds to the light produced by other individuals , and even to light from other nearby colonies . Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort , for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force . 
 Some bioluminous bacteria infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae . When these caterpillars die , their luminosity may attract predators to the dead insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria and nematodes . A similar reason may account for the many species of fungi that emit light . Species in the genera Armillaria , Mycena , Omphalotus , Panellus , Pleurotus and others do this , emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium , cap and gills . This may attract night @-@ flying insects and aid in spore dispersal , but other functions may also be involved . 
 <unk> striata is the only known bioluminescent terrestrial mollusc . Pulses of light are emitted from a gland near the front of the foot and may have a communicative function , although the adaptive significance is not fully understood . 
 = = = Mimicry = = = 
 Bioluminescence is used by a variety of animals to mimic other species . Many species of deep sea fish such as the anglerfish and <unk> make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey . They have an appendage on their heads called an <unk> that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long @-@ lasting glow which the fish can control . The glowing <unk> is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish . 
 The cookiecutter shark uses bioluminescence to camouflage its underside by counterillumination , but a small patch near its pectoral fins remains dark , appearing as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it . When such fish approach the lure , they are bitten by the shark . 
 Female Photuris fireflies sometimes mimic the light pattern of another firefly , Photinus , to attract its males as prey . In this way they obtain both food and the defensive chemicals named <unk> , which Photuris cannot synthesize . 
 South American giant cockroaches of the genus <unk> were believed to be the first known example of defensive mimicry , emitting light in imitation of bioluminescent , poisonous click beetles . However , doubt has been cast on this assertion , and there is no conclusive evidence that the cockroaches are bioluminescent . 
 = = = Illumination = = = 
 While most marine bioluminescence is green to blue , some deep sea <unk> dragonfishes in the genera <unk> , <unk> and <unk> emit a red glow . This adaptation allows the fish to see red @-@ pigmented prey , which are normally invisible in the deep ocean environment where red light has been filtered out by the water column . 
 The black <unk> ( also called the northern stoplight <unk> ) <unk> niger is believed to be one of the only fish to produce a red glow . Its eyes , however , are insensitive to this wavelength ; it has an additional retinal pigment which fluoresces blue @-@ green when illuminated . This alerts the fish to the presence of its prey . The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from chlorophyll derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet . 
 = = Biotechnology = = 
 = = = Biology and medicine = = = 
 Bioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research . <unk> systems are widely used in genetic engineering as reporter genes , each producing a different colour by fluorescence , and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging . For example , the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants . Vibrio bacteria <unk> with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid ( Euprymna scolopes ) , are key experimental models for bioluminescence . Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment . See also <unk> which involves the use of light to control cells in living tissue , typically neurons , that have been genetically modified to express light @-@ sensitive ion channels , and also see <unk> , a photon of non @-@ thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum emitted from a biological system . 
 = = = Light production = = = 
 The structures of photophores , the light producing organs in bioluminescent organisms , are being investigated by industrial designers . Engineered bioluminescence could perhaps one day be used to reduce the need for street lighting , or for decorative purposes if it becomes possible to produce light that is both bright enough and can be sustained for long periods at a workable price . The gene that makes the tails of fireflies glow has been added to mustard plants . The plants glow faintly for an hour when touched , but a sensitive camera is needed to see the glow . University of Wisconsin – Madison is researching the use of genetically engineered bioluminescent E. coli bacteria , for use as bioluminescent bacteria in a light bulb . In June 2013 the Glowing Plant project raised nearly $ 500 @,@ 000 on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter to create a bioluminescent plant . An <unk> team from Cambridge ( England ) has started to address the problem that luciferin is consumed in the light @-@ producing reaction by developing a genetic biotechnology part that codes for a luciferin regenerating enzyme from the North American firefly ; this enzyme " helps to strengthen and sustain light output " . In 2016 , <unk> , a French company started selling bioluminescent lights , <unk> shop fronts and municipal street signs as their main markets . France has a law that forbids retailers and offices from <unk> their windows between 1 and 7 in the morning in order to minimise energy consumption and pollution . <unk> hoped their product would get round this ban . They used bacteria called <unk> <unk> which glow in the dark but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days . 
 = Hurricane Gabrielle ( 2001 ) = 
 Hurricane Gabrielle was a North Atlantic hurricane that caused flooding in both Florida and Newfoundland in September 2001 . It developed in the Gulf of Mexico on the same day as the September 11 attacks ; after the attacks , flights were canceled nationwide for two days , and when Gabrielle struck Florida on September 14 , it caused a day of additional cancellations . The storm moved ashore with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) near Venice , a city located south of the Tampa Bay area . The combination of the winds and heavy rainfall , which peaked at 15 @.@ 1 in ( 380 mm ) in Parrish , left 570 @,@ 000 customers without power along the west coast and 126 @,@ 000 customers without power on the east coast . The storm caused about $ 230 million ( 2001 USD ) in damage in Florida . In the Gulf of Mexico , high waves contributed to two deaths , one of which was indirect ; there was also a death due to flooding in Winter Haven . 
 After crossing the state , Gabrielle had the appearance of an occluded frontal low or subtropical cyclone ; this was after the convection decreased near the center . However , Gabrielle gradually re @-@ intensified and became a hurricane on September 17 as it passed northwest of Bermuda . The hurricane reached peak winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , but weakened subsequently due to wind shear . Gabrielle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 19 , and later that day it passed just southeast of Newfoundland . The storm produced record rainfall that caused what was described the " worst flooding in 100 years " in St. John 's . Several roads and houses were flooded in the region . The extratropical remnants of Gabrielle continued to the northeast and dissipated on September 21 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 5 , a weak low- to mid @-@ level trough was nearly stationary a short distance off the southeastern coastline of the United States . It remained stationary for several days , before developing a low @-@ level circulation over Florida by September 9 . The system moved into the Gulf of Mexico , and by September 11 , the low and its associated convection were well @-@ organized enough for the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) to classify it as Tropical Depression Eight . By that time , the system was located about 170 mi ( 270 km ) west @-@ northwest of Key West , Florida . Located in an environment of weak steering currents , the depression drifted to the west @-@ southwest after forming . Northerly wind shear and the presence of a nearby upper @-@ level low initially prevented further organization , leaving the center of the depression poorly – defined with minimal convection . The depression gradually became better organized while it slowly executed a small counter @-@ clockwise loop . Early on September 12 , the system developed increased banding features over the eastern half of its circulation . By early on September 13 , the upper level outflow over the depression became much more conducive for intensification , although the circulation remained broad and weak . Shortly thereafter , deep convection developed and persisted near the center , and at 1200 UTC on September 13 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gabrielle while located about 200 miles ( 320 km ) southwest of Venice , Florida . 
 Under the influence of a mid @-@ level trough , Gabrielle accelerated northeastward and quickly intensified , despite increasing amounts of westerly wind shear . Its center reformed several times under the deep convection , and on September 14 Gabrielle made landfall near Venice with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . At the time , Hurricane Hunters reported gusts to hurricane force , and the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility that Gabrielle made landfall as a hurricane . Land interaction and vertical wind shear quickly weakened Gabrielle over land ; its convection decreased markedly with the strongest remaining convection remaining well to the northeast of the center . The storm reached the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) about 18 hours after it made landfall ; by that time , one forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked that the storm resembled an occluded frontal low , with a large circulation devoid of convection in a non @-@ symmetric wind field . Another forecaster likened the storm to a subtropical cyclone , due to dry air continuing to limit organization . 
 On September 15 , convection gradually developed closer to the center , though operationally forecasters were unsure whether the convection was in association with Gabrielle or to a cold front to its west . A Hurricane Hunters flight into the system reported the center of Gabrielle became elongated , resembling a trough , and one forecaster considered the storm on the verge of becoming an extratropical cyclone . Shortly thereafter , convection increased near the center as the storm became stronger and better organized . Despite strong amounts of wind shear , Gabrielle intensified to attain hurricane status early on September 17 while located about 350 mi ( 560 km ) to the west of Bermuda . Continuing northeastward , the hurricane strengthened slightly further to reach peak winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) about 230 miles ( 370 km ) northwest of Bermuda . Shortly thereafter , a banding eye briefly developed in the center of the convection . Increased wind shear eventually diminished the convection , and Gabrielle weakened to tropical storm status September 18 . By early on September 19 , wind shear dissipated nearly all of the associated deep convection , and Gabrielle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 350 miles ( 560 km ) south of Newfoundland . The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast , passing a short distance southeast of Newfoundland before restrengthening to reach winds of 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) . The storm weakened , and on September 21 the extratropical remnant of Gabrielle merged with another extratropical storm over the far northern Atlantic Ocean . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Shortly after Gabrielle became a tropical storm , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from Craig Key through the Dry Tortugas in the Florida Keys and along the Florida west coast from Flamingo to the mouth of the Suwanee River . Additionally , a hurricane watch was issued from Chokoloskee to Tarpon Springs . On September 14 , a tropical storm warning was issued for Lake Okeechobee and the Florida east coast from Jupiter to Saint Augustine . Due to the storm , schools in six counties along the west coast were closed . All aircraft from MacDill Air Force Base were evacuated to Kansas as a precaution . Gabrielle struck Florida three days after the September 11 attacks , after which all flights nationwide were canceled for two days . Flights resumed the day Gabrielle moved ashore , with the exception of Sarasota @-@ Bradenton International Airport which closed due to the inclement weather . In the Tampa area , two major bridges closed due to the storm . Disney World closed three water parks and several rides . 
 The government of Bermuda issued a gale warning for the island before changing it to a tropical storm warning on September 16 . 
 The Newfoundland Weather Center issued severe weather warnings for portions of Atlantic Canada prior to the arrival of the extratropical remnant of Gabrielle . Rough sea warnings were issued for waters off of the Avalon Peninsula of eastern Newfoundland , and fishermen were recommended to remain away from the sea .

 While the storm was moving east across the Gulf of Mexico , Gabrielle produced rip currents along the coast of Alabama , killing one man in Orange Beach . High surf along the Florida Panhandle destroyed a retaining wall in Pensacola Beach . In the Florida Keys , there was an indirect drowning death of a man who fell off his boat ; this was due to a combination of high seas , engine failure , and intoxication . Upon making landfall , Gabrielle produced moderate winds along coastal areas of western Florida , with sustained winds of 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) at Venice . The same station reported a wind gust of 73 mph ( 117 km / h ) . High tides from rough waves and the storm surge reached 6 @.@ 2 feet ( 1 @.@ 9 m ) , the highest tide since 1926 . The tide flooded the northern shoreline of Charlotte Harbor and at the entrance to the Peace River , while further to the south a surge of greater than 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) inundated the barrier island at Fort Myers Beach and flooded some cars . Beach erosion was common in the areas where the storm surge was greatest . 
 In Lee County , tropical storm @-@ force winds damaged many roofs , although damage was primarily due to flooding . Along the coast , high storm tides severely damaged about 100 homes and lightly damaged 500 other homes . In nearby Charlotte County , several homes were flooded along Gasparilla Island . Strong winds in Sarasota and Manatee counties downed trees and power lines , and across western Florida , 570 @,@ 000 electric customers lost power . In <unk> , high winds damaged the roof of a motel , forcing 100 people to evacuate . High rainfall in Pasco County flooded a portion of U.S. Route 301 . Along the west coast of Florida , Gabrielle spawned four weak tornadoes . In Everglades City , sustained winds reached 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) , with gusts to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . 
 While crossing the state , Gabrielle interacted with a decaying cold front , which produced intense rainfall . The highest total was 15 @.@ 1 in ( 380 mm ) in Parrish along the west coast . Jacksonville reported 6 @.@ 32 in ( 161 mm ) in a 24 ‑ hour period . In Winter Springs , a boy drowned after being swept away by a flooded stream . In Volusia , the rains flooded about 30 homes or apartments , and roads in several counties were closed . After moving across the state , the storm produced locally strong winds along the Atlantic Florida coastline , peaking at 59 mph ( 95 km / h ) at Saint Augustine . High wind gusts left about 126 @,@ 000 homes and businesses without power in eastern Florida . Rainbands spawned five tornadoes , one of which damaged six mobile homes in Cocoa . Along the coast in Brevard and Volusia , high storm tides and waves produced significant beach erosion . 
 Overall , Gabrielle caused an estimated $ 230 million in damage in Florida . There were 18 tornadoes in the state , and three deaths related to the storm . Heavy rainfall extended into Georgia ; a station in Brunswick reported a total of 3 @.@ 84 in ( 98 mm ) . In South Carolina , high winds and tides produced coastal flooding in Garden City . 
 = = = Bermuda and Canada = = = 
 In Bermuda , the combination of Gabrielle and the cold front to its west dropped about 1 @.@ 8 in ( 46 mm ) of precipitation in a four @-@ day period . Wind gusts peaked at 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) in an outer rainband . 
 While extratropical , the remnants of Gabrielle passed a short distance south of Newfoundland , the second cyclone in less than a week to affect the area . The storm produced moderately strong wind gusts of over 60 mph ( 100 km ) across the southern portion of the island , including a peak gust of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) at Cape Race . Seas reached 36 ft ( 11 m ) in height . The remnant of Gabrielle dropped heavy rainfall in a short amount of time across Newfoundland , with one station at Cape Race recording 1 @.@ 9 in ( 48 mm ) in just one hour . This set the all time 6 – hour precipitation record at St. John 's , with a total of 3 @.@ 54 in ( 90 mm ) . In a 24 ‑ hour period , the St. John 's airport recorded 4 @.@ 67 in ( 118 @.@ 6 mm ) , which was only 0 @.@ 1 in ( 2 @.@ 6 mm ) less than the existing record . Rainfall peaked at 6 @.@ 9 in ( 175 mm ) at the Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John 's . 
 In St. John 's , the rainfall caused severe flooding , and the mayor of the city considered Gabrielle " the worst storm in 100 years " . The flooding washed out two roads and flooded 20 others , forcing several closures . The rains flooded the basements of houses with several feet of water , affecting at least four homes . Flooding damage closed 15 schools and affected 45 businesses . There were multiple reports of sewers unable to accompany the excess of water . Hurricane @-@ force wind gusts forced the cancellation of flights and left thousands without power , telephone , or heat . Dangerous conditions caused Canada Post to cancel delivery on the day of the storm . Hundreds of homes and buildings were damaged by the passage of Gabrielle , resulting in several million dollars in damage . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Despite the flooding in Florida , the heavy rainfall proved beneficial in alleviating drought conditions . By late September , water levels in 18 counties in southwestern Florida were within the normal range for the first time in 18 months . On September 28 , the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared seven Florida counties as disaster areas ; this allocated federal funding for debris removal and repairing damaged public facilities . After the storm 's passage , there were more than 32 @,@ 000 insurance claims for homes , and 10 @,@ 000 claims for damaged cars . 
 In response to the flooding in St. John 's , Newfoundland , the city mayor activated the city 's Emergency Preparedness Program . On September 27 , about a week after the passage of the storm , the Emergency Measures Organization began accepting applications for flood @-@ related damage . By about a month after the storm , 169 applications were processed , with an additional 1 @,@ 762 received by the Emergency Measures Organization . Eligibility for the disaster assistance included restoration to property or household items of an essential nature . A few days after the passage of the storm , the government of Newfoundland appealed to the federal government for federal disaster relief fund ; the government later approved . Ultimately , disaster relief assistance totaled $ 6 @.@ 3 million ( 2001 CAD ) , primarily to individual assistance .

 Star Wars Episode I : Battle for Naboo ( known as Star Wars : Battle for Naboo on the PC ) is an arcade @-@ style action game co @-@ developed by Factor 5 and LucasArts ; LucasArts supplied most of the art and level @-@ design , while Factor 5 provided the programming , tools , sound , and most of the cut @-@ scene and art post @-@ production work . It is a spiritual sequel to the successful Star Wars : Rogue Squadron released two years earlier . Despite the similarities between the two games , the development team designed a completely new game engine for Battle for Naboo and included land- and water @-@ based combat in addition to aerial combat . 
 Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy , the game takes place entirely during the events depicted in the film Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace . Players control Gavyn Sykes , a lieutenant in Naboo 's Royal Security Forces . As the game progresses , Sykes and the Royal Security Forces fight the Trade Federation in 15 missions that take place on Naboo or in the space immediately surrounding it . The game concludes after the player completes a mission that recreates the film 's climactic assault on the Trade Federation 's Droid Control Ship . 
 Battle for Naboo was published by LucasArts and THQ and released for the Nintendo 64 in December 2000 . A Windows port was released three months later in March 2001 . The Nintendo 64 version received generally positive reviews ; critics praised the game 's tight and responsive controls , but expressed dislike for the game 's Episode I setting . The game 's PC port was less well @-@ received , with critics citing poor visuals and difficult controls . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 A follow @-@ up to the previous game Star Wars : Rogue Squadron , Battle for Naboo is a fast @-@ paced , arcade @-@ style action game . Each of the game 's 15 levels introduces mission objectives that must be completed to progress to the next level . Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines . Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids , laser and missile turrets , Armored Assault Tanks ( <unk> ) , Multi @-@ troop transports ( <unk> ) , gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform ( <unk> ) . 
 The heads @-@ up display features a health meter , a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons . Depending on the level , the player can control several different air , land and water vehicles . Aircraft are the Naboo N @-@ 1 Starfighter , the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser , while land and watercraft are the Flash and Gian speeders , the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy <unk> . Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement , as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability . The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level ; however , after a level is completed , it can be replayed with any available craft that falls within its air , land or watercraft specification . Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid @-@ level . Seven bonus power @-@ ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game . These bonuses improve a craft 's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game . 
 The player 's performance is measured throughout the game , and performance statistics are checked after each level against four medal benchmarks . Each benchmark contains six categories : completion time , number of enemies destroyed , shot accuracy , number of friendly craft and structures saved , number of bonuses collected and lives remaining . If a player 's performance exceeds one of the level 's four benchmarks in all five categories , a medal — bronze , silver , gold or platinum — is awarded on completion . Unlike other medal benchmarks , platinum medal benchmarks are undisclosed to the player . Acquiring medals promotes the player 's rank and helps unlock hidden content . 
 = = = Unlockable content = = = 
 Battle for Naboo includes a number of unlockable secrets . The player can unlock three bonus levels : " Trade Federation Secrets " , " Coruscant Encounter " and " Dark Side " . These levels are made available when the player obtains all bronze , silver or gold medals , respectively , on every level . Alternatively , they can be unlocked via password . Several craft are also available when unlocked . The Sith Infiltrator , a Swamp Speeder and an AAT may be selected when the player enters the correct passwords or achieves all gold or platinum medals , respectively , on all levels . A TIE fighter and a playable model of a 1969 Buick Electra 225 based on a car owned by the game 's sound designer , Rudolph Stember , can be unlocked via password only . 
 The development team also included early game design sketches and audio commentary for each of the game 's 15 standard levels , unlockable via passwords . Each level features more than five minutes of audio that totals over an hour of commentary in all . IGN likened the " captivating " commentary to DVD bonus material and believed the addition could start a trend in video games . MTV reporter Stephen Totilo believes that this audio commentary " may very well be " the earliest in video gaming .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Battle for Naboo takes place in the fictional Star Wars galaxy . The overarching conflict is an escalating battle between the Trade Federation and the people of Naboo . All 15 missions occur during the events depicted in Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace . The taxation of trade routes is in dispute and the Trade Federation has sent an invasion force to the planet 's capital city of Theed hoping to capture the planet and steal its resources . The planet 's queen , Padmé Amidala , has left the city for Coruscant to try to gain support from the Galactic Senate . To help defend the planet , Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes must form a resistance movement . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The game starts with an opening crawl resembling the ones featured in the Star Wars films . Further story details are presented through the game 's instruction manual , pre @-@ mission briefings , characters ' conversations during the game and in @-@ game cut scenes . During the Trade Federation 's initial invasion of Theed , Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes and Captain Kael are able to escape the capital and head into the surrounding farmland . The two attempt to protect civilian farmers , but Federation presence is too strong , and they retreat into the nearby swamps . There they learn of a smuggler hidden in the mountains who might aid them . With the help of farmer Ved <unk> , Sykes and Kael find Borvo the Hutt . Borvo agrees to assist the resistance movement against the Trade Federation after the group helps him escape Federation forces . 
 In their first strike against the Trade Federation , Kael , Sykes and Kol Kotha , a mercenary agent of Borvo 's , destroy the communications satellite Comm 4 . The satellite 's destruction temporarily disables a Federation base on the planet , allowing the resistance to successfully attack it and destroy numerous droids and heavy equipment . During the fight , Sykes commandeers a Federation gunboat and uses it to liberate labor camps along the <unk> River , escorting the freed prisoners to a rendezvous point among ruins to the north . 
 However , during the escort mission , Kael disappears and Sykes begins a search and rescue mission for the missing Captain . Sykes discovers a mortally wounded Kael near his crashed fighter , and it is revealed that Borvo had shot down Kael after he 'd learned of the Hutt 's secret plan to sell the escaped prisoners into slavery . Seeking vengeance and the freedom of his people , Sykes hunts down Borvo , assisted by a disgruntled Kotha who disagrees with Borvo 's betrayal . Though the Hutt is able to escape to Nal <unk> , the prisoners are saved . 
 Now in charge of the resistance on Naboo , Sykes leads a mission to liberate the Camp 4 , a detention center where the Trade Federation has placed most of Naboo 's important leaders . After the camp is freed , Sykes is contacted by Captain Panaka , and the plan to finally liberate Naboo is set in motion . After taking part in the diversionary attack on Theed that allows Queen Amidala and Panaka to infiltrate the Palace and capture Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray , Sykes joins the rest of Bravo Flight in the climactic assault on the Droid Control Ship . Partnered with R2 @-@ C4 , Sykes knocks out the Droid Control Ship 's Shield Generator , which allows young Anakin Skywalker to destroy the ship from within . With the Trade Federation army disabled , Naboo is freed . 
 = = Development = = 
 With Star Wars : Rogue Squadron and Star Wars Episode I : Racer already released under a three @-@ game exclusivity agreement signed by Nintendo , LucasArts began planning for the third and final game . After the success of Rogue Squadron in 1998 , LucasArts and Factor 5 started initial testing for a follow @-@ up in February 1999 . The team discussed how they could build on that success and began planning the development of a new game engine . Possible plot ideas involving the film Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace were also discussed . After it was released in May 1999 , the team watched the movie several times in an attempt to find interesting characters , situations and craft for the game . Factor 5 stated that tying a movie plot into a vehicle combat game was " hard " . They included all the characters and vehicles from the movie they could , and attempted to mix these elements with entirely new content . 
 During the development process , LucasArts supplied most of the art and level @-@ design , while Factor 5 provided the programming , tools , sound , and most of the cut @-@ scene and art post @-@ production work . After contemplating the idea of reusing Rogue Squadron 's game engine , the team decided it was necessary to develop a new engine from scratch . Being more familiar with the Nintendo 64 , Factor 5 was able to write Battle for Naboo 's microcode by identifying the previous engine 's strengths and weaknesses . Factor 5 stated that many of Battle for Naboo 's technical aspects ( such as a farther draw distance ) " simply would not have been possible " using the Rogue Squadron engine . The game uses a particle system that was written in microcode for the Nintendo 64 's Reality Signal Processor . The team first developed the technique to display falling snow in Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine , another Nintendo 64 game that was developed simultaneously by the company . The result allowed Battle for Naboo to have rain and the snow effects that display up to 3 @,@ 000 particles at any given time without compromising the game 's frame rate and without using the system 's central processing unit . Explosions and fountains also use these particle effects . 
 Skywalker Sound supplied the development team with sound directly from The Phantom Menace for use in Battle for Naboo . Because its music is fully interactive and in real @-@ time , the game required new material to be composed and pieces from the movie to be rewritten . Factor 5 again used its own sound drivers called <unk> to handle the game 's sound , as it did with Rogue Squadron ( then called <unk> FX Surround ) . The game includes voice work from voice actors Jeff <unk> , Roger L. Jackson , Doug Boyd and Terence McGovern . 
 Unlike Rogue Squadron , which was developed and released for the Nintendo 64 and Windows simultaneously , Battle for Naboo was ported to Windows and released two months later . The Windows version features enhanced resolution and textures and includes a mouse @-@ supported menu interface . On October 24 , 2001 , it was re @-@ released as a part of the LucasArts Archive Series .

 Many reviews compared Battle for Naboo to Star Wars : Rogue Squadron . GamePro remarked that the games share the same " exciting aerial combat , sturdy controls , and ... absorbing story line " , and IGN 's Fran Mirabella III wrote , " Battle for Naboo proves to be a worthy follow up to Rogue by improving on nearly everything that held it back from perfection . " EGM believed that , " if you liked Rogue Squadron , it 's a good bet you 'll like Naboo even more . " GameSpot 's Ryan Davis , however , thought that the game remained fun despite the " general lack of innovation over its predecessor " and believed it to be " one of the best Episode I titles to hit the market " . The Nintendo 64 version received mostly positive reviews and received an aggregate score of 82 percent and 84 from GameRankings and Metacritic , respectively . 
 Battle for Naboo 's controls were described as tight and responsive . Reviewers praised the addition of ground vehicles , which were completely absent from Rogue Squadron . Both Davis and Mirabella remarked that this addition keeps the game from getting stale or redundant . Nintendo Power thought that the game is at its best when the action isn 't grounded , however , describing some of the ground missions as " tedious " and " uninspired " . Some reviewers believed that the game 's Episode I setting is less engaging than Rogue Squadron 's original trilogy setting . Mirabella stated that " any fan of Rogue Squadron should enjoy Battle for Naboo just as much if they can get past the Episode I barrier " , and Davis wrote that the game 's setting " does not carry the same impact as the story of the original [ trilogy ] . " 
 The game 's visuals were a source of disagreement between some critics . Extended Play 's Matthew Keil wrote that the game 's visuals are the " most notable improvement " over Rogue Squadron . Mirabella agreed and went on to call Battle for Naboo " one of the prettiest games to grace the N64 . " Both Keil and Mirabella praised the game for being less dependent on distance fog and " vastly " improving the draw distance over Rogue Squadron . Davis , however , wrote that " the graphics in Battle for Naboo are exactly the same as those of Rogue Squadron , flaws and all " , and Nintendo Power 's Andy Meyers cited " drab backgrounds and dry cinemas " . EGM enjoyed the game 's models and lighting , but thought the environments looked " blurry " . Reviewers ' opinions on the game 's music and sound effects were generally less divided . Keil stated that the game showcases Factor 5 's audio talents , and Mirabella and Davis described the audio as " atmospheric " and " immersive " , respectively . One EGM reviewer lamented " the low @-@ quality cartridge Episode I music " , but another thought the sound was impressive . 
 With aggregated scores of 57 percent and 54 from GameRankings and Metacritic , respectively , Battle for Naboo 's PC port garnered significantly lower review scores than its Nintendo 64 counterpart . Many complaints about the PC version stemmed from the fact that the game was not optimized for the PC when it was ported . Computer Games Magazine 's Adam Fleet thought the game was ugly , citing " truly bland textures and sad @-@ looking 2D sprites " . Next Generation 's Jim Preston bluntly wrote that the " graphics suck . " Of the audio , GameSpot 's Giancarlo Varanini wrote , " [ it ] isn 't that bad , but it isn 't quite as good as the audio in other similar games " , and goes on to describe the music as sounding " tinny . " Varanini also took issue with the PC version 's aiming controls , stating that because Battle for Naboo was originally designed for the Nintendo 64 's analog controller , it is difficult to aim using a PC 's digital keyboard . Preston agreed , writing that controlling the game is " nearly impossible " with a digital controller or mouse . 
 = Abbey Road = 
 Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album by English rock band the Beatles , released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records . The recording sessions for the album were the last in which all four Beatles participated . Although Let It Be was the final album that the Beatles completed before the band 's dissolution in April 1970 , most of the album had been recorded before the Abbey Road sessions began . A double A @-@ side single from the album , " Something " / " Come Together " , released in October , topped the Billboard chart in the US . 
 Abbey Road is a rock album that incorporates genres such as blues , pop and progressive rock , and it makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer and the Leslie speaker . Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited together to form a single piece . The album was recorded amidst a more collegial atmosphere than the Get Back / Let It Be sessions earlier in the year , but there were still frequent confrontations within the band , particularly over Paul McCartney 's song " Maxwell 's Silver Hammer " , one of four tracks on which John Lennon did not perform . He had privately left the group by the time the album was released and McCartney publicly quit the following year . 
 Although Abbey Road was an immediate commercial success and reached number one in the UK and US , it received mixed reviews , with some critics describing its music as inauthentic and bemoaning the production 's artificial effects . Many critics now view the album as the Beatles ' best and rank it as one of the greatest albums of all time . In particular , George Harrison 's contributions , " Something " and " Here Comes the Sun " , are considered to be among the best songs he wrote for the group . The album 's cover features the four band members walking across a zebra crossing outside Abbey Road Studios and has become one of the most famous and imitated images in the history of recorded music . As of 2011 , Abbey Road remains one of the Beatles ' best @-@ selling albums .

 After the unpleasant recording sessions for the proposed Get Back album ( later released as Let It Be ) , Paul McCartney suggested to the music producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album " the way we used to do it " , free of the conflict that had begun following the death of Brian Epstein and carried over to the sessions for the White Album . Martin agreed , on the strict condition that all the group – particularly John Lennon – allow him to produce the record in the same manner as earlier albums , and that discipline would be adhered to . 
 The first sessions for Abbey Road began on 22 February 1969 , only three weeks after the Get Back sessions , in Trident Studios . There , the group recorded a backing track to " I Want You ( She 's So Heavy ) " with Billy Preston accompanying them on Hammond organ . No further group recording occurred until April due to Ringo Starr 's commitments on the film The Magic Christian . After a small amount of work that month and a session for " You Never Give Me Your Money " on 6 May , the group took an eight @-@ week break before recommencing on 2 July . Recording continued through July and August , with the last backing track , for " Because " , being taped on 1 August . Overdubs continued through the month , with the final sequencing of the album coming together on 20 August – the last time all four Beatles appeared in a studio together . 
 McCartney , Starr and Martin have positive recollections of the sessions , while George Harrison said , " we did actually perform like musicians again " . Lennon and McCartney had enjoyed working together on the non @-@ album single " The Ballad of John and Yoko " in April , contributing friendly banter between takes , and some of this camaraderie carried over to the Abbey Road sessions . Nevertheless , there was a significant amount of tension between the group members . According to Beatles author Ian MacDonald , McCartney had an acrimonious argument with Lennon during the sessions . Lennon 's wife Yoko Ono had become a permanent presence at Beatles recordings and clashed with other members . Halfway through recording in June , Lennon and Ono were involved in a car accident . A doctor told Ono to rest in bed , so one was installed in the studio so she could supervise the recording process from there . 
 The album 's two @-@ halves were a compromise ; Lennon wanted a traditional release with distinct and unrelated songs while McCartney and Martin wanted to continue their thematic approach from Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band by incorporating a medley . Lennon ultimately disliked Abbey Road as a whole and felt that it lacked authenticity , calling McCartney 's contributions " [ music ] for the <unk> to dig " and not " real songs " and describing the medley as " junk ... just bits of songs thrown together " . During the sessions , Lennon expressed a desire to have all of his songs on one side of the album , with McCartney 's on the other . 
 Nobody was entirely sure that the work was going to be the group 's last , though Harrison said " it felt as if we were reaching the end of the line " . After the album was released , the Get Back / Let It Be project was re @-@ examined , with work continuing into 1970 . Therefore , Let It Be became the last album to be finished by the Beatles , even though its recording had begun before Abbey Road . 
 By September 1969 , after the recording of Abbey Road , Lennon had formed a new group , the Plastic Ono Band , in part because the Beatles had rejected his song " Cold Turkey " . While Harrison worked with artists such as Leon Russell , Doris Troy , Preston and Delaney & Bonnie through to the end of the year , McCartney took a hiatus from the group after his daughter Mary was born on 28 August . On 20 September , Lennon formally announced his departure to the other Beatles . Abbey Road was released on 26 September . The single " Something " / " Come Together " followed in October , with Lennon releasing the Plastic Ono Band 's version of " Cold Turkey " the same month . The Beatles did not promote Abbey Road directly , but no public announcement was made of the band 's split until McCartney announced he was leaving the group in April 1970 , at which point they officially disbanded . 
 = = = Side one = = = 
 = = = = " Come Together " = = = = 
 " Come Together " was an expansion of " Let 's Get It Together " , a song Lennon originally wrote for Timothy Leary 's California gubernatorial campaign against Ronald Reagan . A rough version of the lyrics for " Come Together " was written at Lennon 's and Ono 's second bed @-@ in event in Montreal . 
 Beatles author Jonathan Gould suggested that the song has only a single " pariah @-@ like protagonist " and Lennon was " painting another sardonic self @-@ portrait " . MacDonald has suggested that the " juju eyeballs " has been claimed to refer to Dr John and " spinal cracker " to Ono . The song was later the subject of a lawsuit brought against Lennon by Morris Levy because the opening line in " Come Together " – " Here come old flat @-@ top " – was admittedly lifted from a line in Chuck Berry 's " You Can 't Catch Me " . A settlement was reached in 1973 whereby Lennon promised to record three songs from Levy 's publishing catalogue for his next album . 
 " Come Together " was later released as a double A @-@ side single with " Something " . In the liner notes to the compilation album Love , Martin described the track as " a simple song but it stands out because of the sheer brilliance of the performers " . 
 = = = = " Something " = = = = 
 Harrison was inspired to write " Something " during sessions for the White Album by listening to label @-@ mate James Taylor 's " Something in the Way She Moves " from his album James Taylor . After the lyrics were refined during the Let It Be sessions ( tapes reveal Lennon giving Harrison some songwriting advice during its composition ) , the song was initially given to Joe Cocker , but was subsequently recorded for Abbey Road . Cocker 's version appeared on his album Joe Cocker ! that November . 
 " Something " was Lennon 's favourite song on the album , and McCartney considered it the best song Harrison had written . Frank Sinatra once commented that it was his favourite Lennon – McCartney composition ( though the song was actually Harrison 's ) and " the greatest love song ever written " . Lennon contributed piano to the recording and while most of the part was removed , traces of it remain in the final cut , notably on the middle eight , prior to Harrison 's guitar solo . 
 The song was issued as a double A @-@ side single with " Come Together " in October 1969 and topped the US charts for one week , becoming the first Beatles number @-@ one single that was not a Lennon – McCartney composition ; it was also the first Beatles single from an already released album . Apple 's Neil Aspinall filmed a promotional video , which combined separate footage of the Beatles and their wives . 
 = = = = " Maxwell 's Silver Hammer " = = = = 
 " Maxwell 's Silver Hammer " , McCartney 's first song on the album , was first performed by the Beatles during the Let It Be sessions ( as can be seen in the film ) . He wrote the song after the group 's trip to India in 1968 and wanted to record it for the White Album , but it was rejected by the others as " too complicated " . 
 The recording was fraught with tension between band members , as McCartney annoyed others by insisting on a perfect performance . The track was the first Lennon was invited to work on following his car accident , but he hated it and declined to do so . According to engineer Geoff Emerick , Lennon said it was " more of Paul 's granny music " and left the session . He spent the next two weeks with Ono and did not return to the studio until the backing track for " Come Together " was laid down on 21 July . Harrison was also tired of the song , adding " we had to play it over and over again until Paul liked it . It was a real drag " . Starr was more sympathetic to the song . " It was granny music " , he admitted , " but we needed stuff like that on our album so other people would listen to it " . Roadie and assistant Mal Evans played the anvil sound in the chorus . 
 = = = = " Oh ! Darling " = = = = 
 " Oh ! Darling " was written by McCartney in the doo @-@ wop style , similar to contemporary work by Frank Zappa . It was tried at the Get Back sessions , and a version appears on Anthology 3 . It was subsequently re @-@ recorded in April , with overdubs in July and August . 
 McCartney attempted recording the lead vocal only once a day . He said : " I came into the studios early every day for a week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear . I wanted it to sound as though I 'd been performing it on stage all week . " Lennon thought he should have sung it , remarking that it was more his style . 
 = = = = " Octopus 's Garden " = = = = 
 As was the case with most of the Beatles ' albums , Starr sang lead vocal on one track . " Octopus 's Garden " is his second and last solo composition released on any album by the band . It was inspired by a trip to Sardinia aboard Peter Sellers ' yacht after Starr left the band for two weeks with his family during the sessions for the White Album . Starr received a full songwriting credit and composed most of the lyrics , though the song 's melodic structure was partly written in the studio by Harrison . The pair would later collaborate as writers on Starr 's solo singles " It Don 't Come Easy " , " Back Off Boogaloo " and " Photograph " . 
 = = = = " I Want You ( She 's So Heavy ) " = = = = 
 " I Want You ( She 's So Heavy ) " was written by Lennon about his relationship with Ono , and he made a deliberate choice to keep the lyrics simple and concise . Author Tom Maginnis thought the song had a progressive rock influence , with its unusual length and structure , repeating guitar riff , and white noise effects , though he noted the " I Want You " section has a straightforward blues structure . 
 The finished song is a combination of two different recording attempts . The first attempt occurred almost immediately after the Get Back / Let It Be sessions , in February 1969 , with Preston . This was subsequently combined with a second version made during the Abbey Road sessions proper in April . The two sections together ran to nearly 8 minutes , making it the Beatles ' second @-@ longest released track . Lennon used Harrison 's Moog synthesizer with a white noise setting to create a " wind " effect that was overdubbed on the second half of the track . During the final edit , Lennon told Emerick to " cut it right there " at 7 minutes and 44 seconds , creating a sudden , jarring silence that concludes the first side of Abbey Road ( the recording tape would have run out within 20 seconds as it was ) . The final mixing and editing for the track occurred on 20 August 1969 , the last day all four Beatles were together in the studio . 
 = = = Side two = = = 
 = = = = " Here Comes the Sun " = = = = 
 " Here Comes the Sun " was written by Harrison in Eric Clapton 's garden in Surrey while Harrison took a break from stressful band business meetings . The basic track was recorded on 7 July 1969 . Harrison sang lead and played acoustic guitar , McCartney provided backing vocals and played bass and Starr played the drums . Lennon was still recuperating from his car accident and did not perform on the track . Martin provided an orchestral arrangement in collaboration with Harrison , who overdubbed a Moog synthesizer part on 19 August , immediately before the final mix . 
 The song was not released as a single but still attracted critical praise . It has been featured several times on BBC Radio 4 's Desert Island Discs , having been chosen by Sandie Shaw , Jerry Springer , Boris Johnson and Elaine Page . The Daily Telegraph 's Martin Chilton said it was " almost impossible not to sing along to " . Since digital downloads have become eligible to chart , it reached number 56 in 2010 after the Beatles ' back catalogue was released on iTunes . 
 Harrison recorded a guitar solo for this track that did not appear in the final mix . It was rediscovered in 2012 , and footage of Martin and Harrison 's son Dhani listening to it in the studio was released on the DVD of Living in the Material World . 
 = = = = " Because " = = = = 
 " Because " was inspired by Lennon listening to Ono playing Ludwig van Beethoven 's " Moonlight Sonata " on the piano . He recalled he was " lying on the sofa in our house , listening to Yoko play ... Suddenly , I said , ' Can you play those chords backward ? ' She did , and I wrote ' Because ' around them . " The track features three @-@ part harmonies by Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , which were then triple @-@ tracked to give nine voices in the final mix . The group considered the vocals to be some of the hardest and most complex they attempted . Harrison played the Moog synthesizer , and Martin played the harpsichord that opens the track . 
 = = = = Medley = = = = 
 Side two contains a 16 @-@ minute medley of several short songs , recorded over July and August and blended into a suite by McCartney and Martin . Some songs were written ( and originally recorded in demo form ) during sessions for the White Album and Get Back / Let It Be , which later appeared on Anthology 3 . While the idea for the medley was McCartney 's , Martin claims credit for some structure , adding he " wanted to get John and Paul to think more seriously about their music " . 
 The first track recorded for the medley was the opening number , " You Never Give Me Your Money " . McCartney cites the band 's dispute over Allen Klein , and what McCartney viewed as Klein 's empty promises , as an inspiration for the song 's lyrics . MacDonald doubts this given that the backing track , recorded on 6 May at Olympic Studios , predated the worst altercations between Klein and McCartney . The track is a suite of varying styles , ranging from a piano @-@ led ballad at the start to arpeggiated guitars at the end . Both Harrison and Lennon provided guitar solos with Lennon playing the solos at the end of the track , which Beatles author Walter Everett considers his favourite Lennon guitar contribution . 
 This song transitions into Lennon 's " Sun King " which , like " Because " , showcases Lennon , McCartney and Harrison 's triple @-@ tracked harmonies . Following it are Lennon 's " Mean Mr. Mustard " ( written during the Beatles ' 1968 trip to India ) and " Polythene Pam " . These in turn are followed by four McCartney songs , " She Came in Through the Bathroom Window " ( written after a fan entered McCartney 's residence via his bathroom window ) , " Golden Slumbers " ( based on Thomas Dekker 's 17th @-@ century poem set to new music ) , " Carry That Weight " ( reprising elements from " You Never Give Me Your Money " , and featuring chorus vocals from all four Beatles ) , and closing with " The End " . 
 " The End " features Starr 's only drum solo in the Beatles ' catalogue ( the drums are mixed across two tracks in " true stereo " , unlike most releases at that time where they were hard panned left or right ) . Fifty @-@ four seconds into the song are 18 bars of lead guitar : the first two bars are played by McCartney , the second two by Harrison , and the third two by Lennon , with the sequence repeating . Harrison suggested the idea of a guitar solo in the track , Lennon decided they should trade solos and McCartney elected to go first . The solos were cut live against the existing backing track in one take . Immediately after Lennon 's third and final solo , the piano chords of the final part of the song begin . The song ends with the memorable final line , " And in the end , the love you take is equal to the love you make " . This section was taped separately to the first , and required the piano to be re @-@ recorded by McCartney , which was done on 18 August . An alternative version of the song , with Harrison 's lead guitar solo played against McCartney 's ( with Starr 's drum solo heard in the background ) , appears on the Anthology 3 album and the 2012 digital @-@ only compilation album Tomorrow Never Knows . 
 = = = = " Her Majesty " = = = = 
 " Her Majesty " was recorded by McCartney on 2 July when he arrived before the rest of the group at Abbey Road . It was included in a rough mix of the side two medley , appearing between " Mean Mr. Mustard " and " Polythene Pam " . McCartney disliked the way the medley sounded when it included " Her Majesty " , so he asked for it to be cut . The second engineer , John <unk> , had been instructed not to throw out anything , so after McCartney left , he attached the track to the end of the master tape after 20 seconds of silence . The tape box bore an instruction to leave " Her Majesty " off the final product , but the next day when mastering engineer Malcolm Davies received the tape , he ( also trained not to throw anything away ) cut a playback lacquer of the whole sequence , including " Her Majesty " . The Beatles liked this effect and included it on the album . 
 " Her Majesty " opens with the final , crashing chord of " Mean Mr. Mustard " , while the final note of " Her Majesty " remained buried in the mix of " Polythene Pam " . This is the result of " Her Majesty " being snipped off the reel during a rough mix of the medley on 30 July . The medley was subsequently mixed again from scratch although " Her Majesty " was not touched again and still appears in its rough mix on the album . 
 Original US and UK pressings of Abbey Road do not list " Her Majesty " on the album 's cover nor on the record label , making it a hidden track . The song title appears on the inlay card and disc of the 1987 remastered CD reissue , as track 17 . It also appears on the sleeve , booklet and disc of the 2009 remastered CD reissue , but not on the cover or record label of the 2012 vinyl reissue .

 Three days after the session for " I Want You ( She 's So Heavy ) " , Harrison recorded solo demos of " All Things Must Pass " ( which became the title track of his 1970 triple album ) , " Something " and " Old Brown Shoe " . The latter was re @-@ recorded by the Beatles in April 1969 and issued as the B @-@ side to " The Ballad of John and Yoko " the following month . All three of these Harrison demos were later featured on Anthology 3 . 
 During the sessions for the medley , McCartney recorded " Come and Get It " , playing all the instruments . It was assumed to be a demo recording for another artist but McCartney later said that he originally intended to put it on Abbey Road . It was instead covered by Badfinger , while McCartney 's original recording appeared on Anthology 3 . 
 The original backing track to " Something " , featuring a piano @-@ led coda , and " You Never Give Me Your Money " , which leads into a fast rock @-@ n @-@ roll jam session , have appeared on bootlegs .

 Abbey Road has remained in print since its first release in 1969 . The original album was released on 26 September in the UK and 1 October in the US on Apple Records . It was reissued on vinyl in the US under Capitol on 27 December 1978 , while a CD reissue of the album was released in 1987 , with a remastered version appearing in 2009 . The remaster included additional photographs with additional liner notes and the first , limited edition , run also included a short documentary about the making of the album . 
 The album continues to be reissued on vinyl . It was included as part of the Beatles ' Collector 's Crate series in September 2009 and saw a remastered LP release on 180 @-@ gram vinyl in 2012 . 
 = = Commercial performance = = 
 Abbey Road sold four million copies in its first two months of release . In the UK , the album debuted at number 1 , where it remained for 11 weeks before being displaced for one week by the Rolling Stones ' Let It Bleed . The following week ( which was Christmas ) , Abbey Road returned to the top for another six weeks ( completing a total of 17 weeks ) before being replaced by Led Zeppelin II . In all it spent 81 weeks on the UK albums chart . 
 Reaction overseas was similar . In the US , the album spent 12 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart . It was the National Association of Recording Merchandisers ( NARM ) best @-@ selling album of 1969 and was number four on Billboard magazine 's top LPs of 1970 year @-@ end chart . Abbey Road was certified 12 × platinum by the RIAA in 2001 . In Japan , it was one of the longest @-@ charting albums to date , remaining in the top 100 for 298 weeks during the 1970s . 
 In June 1970 , Allen Klein reported that Abbey Road was the Beatles ' best @-@ selling album in the US with sales of about five million . By 1992 , Abbey Road had sold nine million copies . The album became the ninth @-@ most downloaded on the iTunes Store a week after it was released there on 16 November 2010 . A CNN report stated it was the best @-@ selling vinyl album of 2011 . It is the first album from the 1960s to sell over five million albums since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales . In the US , the album had sold 7 @,@ 177 @,@ 797 copies by the end of the 1970s . The album has sold over 31 million copies worldwide and is one of the band 's best @-@ selling albums . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Abbey Road received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics , who criticised the production 's artificial sounds and viewed its music as inauthentic . William Mann of the London Times said that the album will " be called gimmicky by people who want a record to sound exactly like a live performance " , although he considered it to be " teem [ ing ] with musical invention " and added : " Nice as Come Together and Harrison 's Something are – they are minor pleasures in the context of the whole disc … Side Two is marvellous … " Ed Ward of Rolling Stone called the album " complicated instead of complex " and felt that the Moog synthesizer " <unk> and <unk> " the band 's sound , adding that they " create a sound that could not possibly exist outside the studio " . While he found the medley on side two to be their " most impressive music " since Rubber Soul , Nik Cohn of The New York Times said that , " individually " , the album 's songs are " nothing special " . Albert Goldman of Life magazine wrote that Abbey Road " is not one of the Beatles ' great albums " and , despite some " lovely " phrases and " stirring " segues , side two 's suite " seems symbolic of the Beatles ' latest phase , which might be described as the round @-@ the @-@ clock production of disposable music effects " . 
 Conversely , Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker : " the truth is , their latest LP is just a natural born gas , entirely free of pretension , deep meanings or symbolism … While production is simple compared to past intricacies , it is still extremely sophisticated and inventive . " Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times found the album " refreshingly terse and unpretentious " , and although he lamented the band 's " cod @-@ 1920s jokes ( Maxwell 's Silver Hammer ) and … Ringo 's obligatory nursery arias ( Octopus 's Garden ) " , he considered that Abbey Road " touches higher peaks than did their last album " . John Mendelsohn , writing for Rolling Stone , called it " breathtakingly recorded " and praised side two especially , equating it to " the whole of Sgt. Pepper " and stating , " That the Beatles can unify seemingly countless musical fragments and lyrical <unk> into a uniformly wonderful suite ... seems potent testimony that no , they 've far from lost it , and no , they haven 't stopped trying . " 
 = = = Retrospective reviews = = = 
 Many critics have since cited Abbey Road as the Beatles ' greatest album . In a retrospective review , Nicole <unk> of PopMatters called it " an amazingly cohesive piece of music , innovative and timeless " . Mark Kemp of Paste viewed the album as being " among The Beatles ' finest works , even if it foreshadows the cigarette @-@ lighter @-@ waving arena rock that technically skilled but critically maligned artists from Journey to Meatloaf would <unk> throughout the ' 70s and ' 80s " . Neil McCormack of The Daily Telegraph dubbed it the Beatles ' " last love letter to the world " and praised its " big , modern sound " , calling it " lush , rich , smooth , epic , emotional and utterly gorgeous " . AllMusic 's Richie Unterberger felt that the album shared Sgt. Pepper 's " faux @-@ conceptual forms " , but had " stronger compositions " , and wrote of its standing in the band 's catalogue : " Whether Abbey Road is the Beatles ' best work is debatable , but it 's certainly the most immaculately produced ( with the possible exception of Sgt. Pepper ) and most tightly constructed . " Ian MacDonald gave a mixed opinion of the album , noting that several tracks had been written at least a year previously , and would possibly have been unsuitable without being integrated into the medley on side two . He did , however , praise the production , particularly the sound of Starr 's bass drum . 
 Abbey Road received high rankings in several " best albums in history " polls by critics and publications . Time included it in their 2006 list of the All @-@ Time 100 Albums . In 2009 , readers of Rolling Stone named Abbey Road the greatest Beatles album. and in 2012 , the magazine ranked it number 14 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die . 
 Musicologist Walter Everett interprets that most of the lyrics on side two 's medley deal with " selfishness and self @-@ gratification – the financial complaints in ' You Never Give Me Your Money , ' the miserliness of Mr. Mustard , the holding back of the pillow in ' Carry That Weight , ' the desire that some second person will visit the singer 's dreams – perhaps the ' one sweet dream ' of ' You Never Give Me Your Money ' ? – in ' The End . ' " Everett adds that the medley 's " selfish moments " are played in the context of the tonal centre of A , while " generosity " is expressed in songs where C major is central . The medley concludes with a " great compromise in the ' negotiations ' " in " The End " , which serves as a structurally balanced coda . In response to the repeated A @-@ major choruses of " love you " , McCartney sings in realisation that there is as much self @-@ gratifying love ( " the love you take " ) as there is of the generous love ( " the love you make " ) , in A major and C major , respectively .

 Abbey Road was recorded on professional eight @-@ track reel to reel tape machines rather than the four @-@ track machines that were used for earlier Beatles albums such as Sgt Pepper , and was the first Beatles album not to be issued in mono . The album makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer , and the guitar played through a Leslie speaker . The Moog is prominently featured , not merely as a background effect but sometimes playing a central role , as in " Because " where it is used for the middle eight . It is also prominent on " Maxwell 's Silver Hammer " ( played using a ribbon strip ) and " Here Comes the Sun " . The instrument was introduced to the band by Harrison who acquired one in November 1968 and subsequently used it to create his Electronic Sound album . Starr made more prominent use of the tom @-@ toms on Abbey Road , later saying the album was " tom @-@ tom madness ... I went nuts on the toms . " 
 Abbey Road was also the first and only Beatles album to be entirely recorded through a solid state transistor mixing desk , the <unk> Mk I , as opposed to earlier thermionic valve based <unk> desks . The TG console also allowed better support for eight @-@ track multitrack recording , helping the Beatles ' considerable use of overdubbing . Emerick recalls the TG desk used to record the album had individual limiters and compressors on each audio channel and noted the overall sound was " softer " than the earlier valve desks . 
 One of the assistant engineers working on the album was a 19 @-@ year @-@ old Alan Parsons . He went on to engineer Pink Floyd 's landmark album The Dark Side of the Moon and produce many popular albums himself with the Alan Parsons Project . <unk> also assisted on many of the sessions , and went on to become a successful engineer and producer , most noteworthy for his success on the scores for The Lord of the Rings film trilogy .

 The cover was designed by Apple Records creative director Kosh . It is the only original UK Beatles album sleeve to show neither the artist name nor the album title on its front cover , which was Kosh 's idea , despite EMI claiming the record would not sell without this information . He later explained that " we didn 't need to write the band 's name on the cover ... They were the most famous band in the world " . 
 = = = Imagery = = = 
 The front cover design , a photograph of the group on a zebra crossing , was based on ideas sketched by McCartney , and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road . At around 11 : 30 that morning , photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he stood on a step @-@ ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera . 
 In the scene , the group walk across the street in single file from left to right , with Lennon leading , followed by Starr , McCartney , and Harrison . McCartney is barefoot and out of step with the other members . Apart from Harrison , the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter . To the left of the picture , parked next to the zebra crossing , is a white Volkswagen Beetle motor @-@ car which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio . After the album was released , the number plate ( <unk> <unk> ) was stolen repeatedly from the car . In 1986 , the car was sold at auction for £ 2 @,@ 530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany . The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole ( c . 1911 – 13 February 2008 ) , an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later . On the original cover , McCartney holds a cigarette ; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image , without permission from either Apple or McCartney .

 The image of the Beatles on the crossing has become one of the most famous and imitated in recording history . The crossing is a popular destination for Beatles fans and there is a webcam featuring it . In December 2010 , the crossing was given grade II listed status for its " cultural and historical importance " ; the Abbey Road studios themselves had been given similar status earlier in the year . In 2013 , Kolkata Police launched a traffic safety awareness advertisement against jaywalking , using the cover and a caption that read : " If they can , why can 't you ? " The cover has been parodied on several occasions , not least from McCartney 's own 1993 live album , Paul Is Live . The Red Hot Chili Peppers ' The Abbey Road E.P. parodies the cover with the band crossing a similar zebra crossing near @-@ naked , though the musical content is different .

 The songs on Abbey Road have been covered many times and the album itself has been covered in its entirety . One month after Abbey Road 's release , George Benson recorded a cover version of the album called The Other Side of Abbey Road . Later in 1969 Booker T. & the M.G. ' s recorded McLemore Avenue ( the location of Stax Records ) which covered the Abbey Road songs and had a similar cover photo . 
 Additionally , several artists have covered some or all of the side @-@ B medley , including Phil Collins ( for the Martin / Beatles tribute album In My Life ) , The String Cheese Incident , Transatlantic and Tenacious D ( who performed the medley with Phish keyboardist Page McConnell ) . <unk> , a jam band including former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Phil Lesh , played the entire Abbey Road album during its Spring Tour 2011 . It began with a " Come Together " opener at Boston on 4 March and ended with the entire medley in New York City on 15 March , including " Her Majesty " as an encore .

 SM UB @-@ 44 was a Type UB II submarine or U @-@ boat for the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. UB @-@ 44 operated in the Mediterranean and disappeared in August 1916 . 
 UB @-@ 44 was ordered in July 1915 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in September . UB @-@ 44 was a about 37 metres ( 121 ft 5 in ) in length and displaced between 270 and 305 tonnes ( 266 and 300 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She was equipped to carry a complement of four torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and had an 5 @-@ centimeter ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun . As part of a group of six submarines selected for Mediterranean service , UB @-@ 44 was broken into railcar sized components and shipped to Pola where she was assembled and launched in April 1916 and commissioned in May . 
 In two patrols in her three @-@ month career , UB @-@ 44 sank one ship of 3 @,@ 409 gross register tons ( GRT ) . In early August 1916 , UB @-@ 44 departed from Cattaro for <unk> and never arrived . Her fate is officially unknown , but she may have been sunk by a torpedo boat near the island of <unk> on 8 August . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The German UB II design improved upon the design of the UB I boats , which had been ordered in September 1914 . In service , the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow . A major problem was that , because they had a single propeller shaft / engine combo , if either component failed , the U @-@ boat became almost totally disabled . To rectify this flaw , the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines ( one shaft for each engine ) , which also increased the U @-@ boat 's top speed . The new design also included more powerful batteries , larger torpedo tubes , and a deck gun . As a UB II boat , U @-@ 47 could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts , and nearly ten times as much fuel . To contain all of these changes the hull was larger , and the surface and submerged displacement was more than double that of the UB I boats . 
 The Imperial German Navy ordered UB @-@ 44 from AG Weser on 31 July 1915 as one of a series of six UB II boats ( numbered from UB @-@ 42 to UB @-@ 47 ) . UB @-@ 44 was 36 @.@ 90 metres ( 121 ft 1 in ) long and 4 @.@ 37 metres ( 14 ft 4 in ) abeam . She had a single hull with saddle tanks and had a draught of 3 @.@ 68 metres ( 12 ft 1 in ) when surfaced . She displaced 305 tonnes ( 300 long tons ) while submerged but only 272 tonnes ( 268 long tons ) on the surface . 
 The submarine was equipped with twin Daimler diesel engines and twin Siemens @-@ Schuckert electric motors — for surfaced and submerged running , respectively — that drove one propeller shaft . UB @-@ 44 had a surface speed of up to 8 @.@ 82 knots ( 16 @.@ 33 km / h ; 10 @.@ 15 mph ) and could go as fast as 6 @.@ 22 knots ( 11 @.@ 52 km / h ; 7 @.@ 16 mph ) while underwater . The U @-@ boat could carry up to 27 tonnes ( 27 long tons ) of diesel fuel , giving her a range of 6 @,@ 940 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 850 km ; 7 @,@ 990 mi ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) . Her electric motors and batteries provided a range of 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) while submerged . 
 UB @-@ 44 was equipped with two 50 @-@ centimeter ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and could carry four torpedoes . The U @-@ boat was also armed with one 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) Uk L / 30 deck gun . 
 UB @-@ 44 was laid down by AG Weser at its Bremen shipyard on 3 September 1915 . As one of six U @-@ boats selected for service in the Mediterranean while under construction , UB @-@ 44 was broken into railcar @-@ sized components and shipped overland to the Austro @-@ Hungarian port of Pola . Shipyard workers from Weser assembled the boat and her five sisters at Pola , where she was launched on 20 April 1916 . 
 = = Service career = = 
 SM UB @-@ 44 was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy on 11 May 1916 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Franz Wäger . UB @-@ 44 , Wäger 's fourth U @-@ boat command , was assigned to the Navy 's Pola Flotilla ( German : Deutsche U @-@ Halbflotille Pola ) . Although the flotilla was based in Pola , the site of the main Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy base , boats of the flotilla operated out of the Austro @-@ Hungarian base at Cattaro which was located farther south and closer to the Mediterranean . German U @-@ boats typically returned to Pola only for repairs . 
 On 30 June , Wäger and UB @-@ 44 achieved their only success when they sank the steamer <unk> 46 nautical miles ( 85 km ; 53 mi ) southeast of Cape <unk> , Crete . The 3 @,@ 409 @-@ gross register ton British steamer was carrying a general cargo from Glasgow for Alexandria when she went down with the loss of three men . 
 After Germany 's conquest of Romania ( see Romania during World War I ) , the German Imperial Navy had sufficient fuel oil for submarines located in the Black Sea . UB @-@ 44 and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and , en route , had to navigate through the Dardanelles , which had been heavily mined by the Allies in the middle of 1916 . UB @-@ 44 departed from Cattaro on 8 August for <unk> ( located on the Gallipoli peninsula ) to pick up a pilot for the trip through the Dardanelles , but never arrived . 
 UB @-@ 44 's fate is unknown . Two British post @-@ war reports list UB @-@ 44 as falling victim to the Otranto Barrage on 30 July but , as author Dwight Messimer points out , German records record UB @-@ 44 's departure from Cattaro nine days after that . Messimer reports that it is possible that UB @-@ 44 was sunk by the torpedo boat HMS 368 , which was reported by an Athenian newspaper as sinking a U @-@ boat 6 nautical miles ( 11 km ; 6 @.@ 9 mi ) on 8 August off <unk> with a lance bomb .

 = Dendrocollybia = 
 Dendrocollybia is a fungal genus in the family Tricholomataceae of the order Agaricales . It is a monotypic genus , containing the single species Dendrocollybia racemosa , commonly known as the branched Collybia or the branched shanklet . The somewhat rare species is found in the Northern Hemisphere , including the Pacific Northwest region of western North America , and Europe , where it is included in several Regional Red Lists . It usually grows on the decaying fruit bodies of other agarics — such as Lactarius and Russula — although the host mushrooms may be decayed to the point of being difficult to recognize . 
 Dendrocollybia racemosa fruit bodies have small pale grayish @-@ white or grayish @-@ brown caps up to 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) wide , and thin stems up to 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) long . The species is characterized by its unusual stem , which is covered with short lateral branches . The branches often produce spherical <unk> of translucent conidiophores on their swollen tips . The conidiophores produce conidia ( asexual spores ) by mitosis . Because the fungus can rely on either sexual or asexual modes of reproduction , fruit bodies sometimes have reduced or even missing caps . The unusual stems originate from black pea @-@ sized structures called sclerotia . The anamorphic form of the fungus , known as <unk> racemosa , is missing the sexual stage of its life cycle . It can reproduce at relatively low temperatures , an adaptation believed to improve its ability to grow quickly and fruit on decomposing mushrooms . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The genus Dendrocollybia was first described in 2001 , to accommodate the species previously known as Collybia racemosa . Before then , the so @-@ named taxon was considered to be one of four species of Collybia , a genus which had itself been redefined and reduced in 1997 , when most of its species were transferred to Gymnopus and <unk> . C. racemosa was originally described and named Agaricus <unk> by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797 , and sanctioned under that name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 . In his Systema Mycologicum , Fries classified it in his " tribe " Collybia along with all other similar small , white @-@ spored species with a convex cap and a fragile stem . In 1873 Lucien Quélet raised Fries ' tribe Collybia to generic rank . Samuel Frederick Gray called the species Mycena racemosa in his 1821 Natural Arrangement of British Plants ; both this name and Joanne Lennox 's 1979 Microcollybia racemosa are considered synonyms . 
 Rolf Singer 's fourth edition ( 1986 ) of his comprehensive Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa in section Collybia , in addition to the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia : C. tuberosa , C. cirrhata and C. cookei . A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C. tuberosa , C. cirrhata and C. cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum – Tricholoma – Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum , Tricholoma , <unk> , <unk> and the species C. racemosa . Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia . Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis . Based on these results , as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections , fruit body pigmentation , and <unk> reactions , they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C. racemosa . 
 The fungus is commonly known as the branched Collybia , or the branched shanklet ; Samuel Gray referred to it as the " <unk> high @-@ stool " . The genus name Dendrocollybia is a combination of the Ancient Greek words <unk> , meaning " tree " , and <unk> , meaning " small coin " . The specific epithet racemosa is from the Latin word <unk> — " a cluster of grapes " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of Dendrocollybia racemosa is typically between 3 to 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter , and depending on its stage of development , may be conic to convex , or in maturity , somewhat flattened with a slight rounded central elevation ( an umbo ) . The cap surface is dry and opaque , with a silky texture ; its color in the center is fuscous ( a dusky brownish @-@ gray color ) , but the color fades uniformly towards the margin . The margin is usually curved toward the gills initially ; as the fruit body matures the edge may roll out somewhat , but it also has a tendency to fray or split with age . There may be shallow grooves on the cap that correspond to the position of the gills underneath , which may give the cap edge a crenate ( scalloped ) appearance . The flesh is very thin ( less than 1 mm thick ) and fragile , lacking in color , and has no distinctive odor or taste . The gills are relatively broad , narrowly attached to the stem ( adnexed ) , spaced closely together , and colored gray to grayish @-@ tan , somewhat darker than the cap . There are additional gills , called lamellulae , that do not extend all the way to the stem ; they are interspersed between the gills and arranged in up to three series ( tiers ) of equal length . Occasionally , the fungus produces stems with aborted caps , or with the caps missing entirely . 
 The stem is 4 to 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 4 in ) long by 1 mm thick , roughly equal in width throughout , and tapers to a long " root " which terminates in a dull black , roughly spherical sclerotium . The stem may be buried deeply in its substrate . The stem surface is roughly the same color as the cap , with a fine whitish powder on the upper surface . In the lower portion , the stem is brownish , and has fine grooves that run lengthwise up and down the surface . The lower half is covered with irregularly arranged short branch @-@ like protuberances at right angles to the stem that measure 2 – 3 by 0 @.@ 5 mm . These projections are cylindrical and tapering , with ends that are covered with a slime head of conidia ( fungal spores produced asexually ) . D. racemosa is the only mushroom species known that forms conidia on side branches of the stem . The sclerotium from which the stem arises is watery grayish and homogeneous in cross section ( not divided into internal chambers ) , with a thin dull black outer coat , and measures 3 to 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 to 0 @.@ 24 in ) in diameter . American mycologist Alexander H. Smith cautioned that novice collectors will typically miss the sclerotium the first time they find the species . The edibility of D. racemosa is unknown , but as David Arora says , the fruit bodies are " much too puny and rare to be of value . " 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The spores are narrowly ellipsoid to ovoid , thin @-@ walled , hyaline ( translucent ) , with dimensions of 4 – 5 @.@ 5 by 2 – 3 µm . When stained with Melzer 's reagent , the spores turn a light blue color . The basidia ( the spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , measure 16 – 20 by 3 @.@ 5 – 4 µm , and taper gradually towards the base . Cystidia are not differentiated in this species . The cap surface is made of a cuticle of radial , somewhat agglutinated , rather coarse hyphae that differ chiefly in size from the underlying tissue — initially 1 – 3 µm in diameter , becoming 5 – 7 µm wide in the underlying tissue . The hyphae are clamped , and encrusted with shallow irregularly shaped masses that are most conspicuous in the surface cells . The gill tissue is made of hyphae that project downward from the cap and arranged in a subparallel fashion , meaning that the hyphae are mostly parallel to one another and are slightly intertwined . The hyphae are clamped , with a narrow , branched compact subhymenium ( a narrow zone of small , short hyphae immediately beneath the hymenium ) composed of hyphae 2 – 3 µm in diameter . The conidia are 8 @.@ 5 – 12 by 4 – 5 µm , peanut @-@ shaped , non @-@ amyloid ( not changing color when stained with Melzer 's reagent ) , clamped , and produced by fragmentation of the coarse mycelium . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . Asexual spores are 10 @.@ 0 – 15 @.@ 5 by 3 – 4 µm , ellipsoid to oblong , non @-@ amyloid , and contain granular contents . The grayish color of the fruit bodies is caused by encrusted pigments ( crystalline aggregates of pigment molecules , possibly melanin ) that occur throughout the tissue of the stem and cap , including the gills ; these pigments are absent in Collybia species . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 In contrast to the three species of Collybia , D. racemosa shows negligible reactivity to common chemical tests used in mushroom identification , including aniline , alpha @-@ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , phenol , and phenol @-@ aniline . 
 The cortex ( outer tissue layer ) of the sclerotium can be used as a diagnostic character to distinguish between D. racemosa and small white specimens of Collybia . The hyphae of the cortex of D. racemosa are " markedly angular " , in comparison with C. cookei ( rounded hyphae ) and C. tuberosa ( elongated hyphae ) . The cortical layer in D. racemosa has an arrangement that is known as textura <unk> — with the hyphae arranged like a jigsaw puzzle . Heavy deposits of dark reddish @-@ brown pigment are evident throughout the cortical tissue in or on the walls and the tips of hyphae . The remaining Collybia species , C. cirrhata , does not form sclerotia . 
 = = = Anamorph form = = = 
 The anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle , and typically reproduce by the process of mitosis in conidia . In some cases , the sexual stage — or teleomorph stage — is later identified , and a teleomorph @-@ anamorph relationship is established between the species . The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two ( or more ) names for one and the same organism , one based on the teleomorph , the other ( s ) restricted to the anamorph . <unk> racemosa ( formerly known as <unk> <unk> , described by Alfred <unk> in 1932 ) was shown to be the anamorphic form of Dendrocollybia racemosa . The <unk> ( reproductive structures made of compact groups of erect conidiophores ) produced by T. racemosa always grow on the stem of Dendrocollybia racemosa . The anamorph has an unusually low optimum growth temperature , between 12 and 18 ° C ( 54 and 64 ° F ) , within a larger growth range of 3 and 22 ° C ( 37 and 72 ° F ) . It is thought this is an adaptation that allows the mycelium to grow quickly and enhance its chances of fruiting on agaric mushrooms , which are generally short @-@ lived . 
 = = Habitat , distribution , and ecology = = 
 Dendrocollybia racemosa is a saprobic species , meaning it derives nutrients by breaking down dead or dying tissue . Its fruit bodies grow on the well @-@ decayed remains of agarics , often suspected to be Lactarius or Russula , although the hosts ' identities are often unclear due to an advanced state of decay . A 2006 study used molecular analysis to confirm Russula crassotunicata as a host for D. racemosa . This Russula has a long and persistent decay period , and , in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States where the study was conducted , provides a " nearly year @-@ round substrate for <unk> species " . Dendrocollybia is one of four agaric genera obligately associated with growth on the fruit bodies of other fungi , the others being <unk> , Asterophora , and Collybia . Dendrocollybia is also found less commonly in deep coniferous duff , in groups or small clusters . The fungus can form sclerotia in the mummified host fruit bodies , and may also develop directly from their sclerotia in soil . The fungus is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere , but rarely collected " probably due to its small size , camouflage color , and tendency to be immersed in its substrate . " In North America , where the distribution is restricted to the Pacific Northwest , fruit bodies are found in the late summer to autumn , often after a heavy fruiting period for other mushrooms is over . In Europe , it is known from the United Kingdom , Scandinavia , and Belgium . Dendrocollybia racemosa is in the Danish , Norwegian , and British Red Lists . 
 The saprobic behaviors of Collybia and Dendrocollybia are slightly different . In the autumn , fruit bodies of C. cirrhata , C. cookei and C. tuberosa , can be found on blackened , leathery , mummified fruit bodies of their hosts . Sometimes , these species appear to be growing in the soil ( or from their sclerotium in soil or moss ) , but usually not in huge clusters . In these cases it is assumed that the hosts are remnants of fruit bodies from a previous season . In all observed cases of D. racemosa , however , the hosts have not been readily observed , suggesting that rapid digestion of the host ( rather than mummification ) may have taken place . Hughes and colleagues suggest that this may indicate the presence of a different enzymatic system , and a differing ability to compete with other fungi or bacteria . 
 = 2012 Tour de France , Prologue to Stage 10 = 
 The 2012 Tour de France began on 30 June , and stage 10 occurred on 11 July . The 2012 edition began with a prologue – a short individual time trial stage – where each member of the starting peloton of 198 riders competed against the clock – in Liège , Belgium with two more stages held in the country before moving back into France . The race resumed in Orchies for the start of the third stage ; also during the first half of the race , the peloton visited Switzerland for the finish to the eighth stage in Porrentruy , and contested another individual time trial stage – having returned to France – the following day . 
 Fabian Cancellara held the lead of the race throughout its opening Belgian leg ; having won the race @-@ commencing prologue , Cancellara defended it on the following two stages before the race returned to France . Cancellara maintained his overall lead for the rest of the race 's first week , before eventually losing time on the first true mountain stage of the race – stage seven – as he was dropped on the closing climb to La Planche des Belles Filles . As a result , Bradley Wiggins assumed the maillot jaune , becoming the first British rider to wear the jersey since 2000 . Wiggins maintained the lead for the following three stages , including his first victory at the Tour during the ninth stage individual time trial in Besançon . Wiggins held a lead of almost two minutes in the overall standings with the more mountainous second half of the Tour still to race . Two riders won multiple stages during the first half of the race ; Peter Sagan , in his first Tour de France , won three stages and also held the lead of the points classification , while André Greipel took back @-@ to @-@ back stage victories on the fourth and fifth stages . World champion Mark Cavendish achieved one stage victory , while French riders Thibaut Pinot and Thomas Voeckler each took breakaway victories . 
 The race was also marked by several large crashes , most notably on the sixth stage , when the majority of the field crashed with around 25 km ( 15 @.@ 5 mi ) remaining . In total , twelve riders had to abandon the race due to injuries suffered during the crash . During the race 's first rest day – held after the ninth stage individual time trial – the team hotel of the Cofidis squad , in Bourg @-@ en @-@ Bresse , was searched by French police and gendarmerie . One of team 's riders in the Tour , Rémy Di Gregorio , was arrested in relation to an ongoing anti @-@ doping case , and was immediately suspended by the French team ; although the case had been open since 2011 , when Di Gregorio was a member of the Astana team .

 30 June 2012 — Liège ( Belgium ) , 6 @.@ 4 km ( 4 @.@ 0 mi ) , ( ITT ) 
 The prologue was a short and fairly flat circuit around Liège , with expected stage times to be about eight minutes . The start ramp was located at Avenue Rogier next to the Parc d 'Avroy ; the riders then headed north by the Boulevard d 'Avroy and Boulevard de la <unk> . They then followed the Quai Roosevelt , along the Meuse , until the midway point when they returned on the opposite carriageway , before turning right towards Place Saint @-@ Lambert , in front of the Palais des Princes @-@ <unk> . From there , the riders rejoined the original route on the opposite carriageway of Boulevard de la <unk> before the finish line located on Boulevard d 'Avroy on the opposite side of the Parc d 'Avroy from the start . 
 With several tight corners , the prologue was expected to favour riders with good bike handling skills . The first rider to leave the start house in Liège was Argos – Shimano 's Tom Veelers , with most of the general classification contenders going towards the end of the starting order , as rain was not scheduled to disrupt the race . Veelers set a time of 7 ' 47 " for the course – which was near @-@ identical to the 2004 prologue held in the city , won by then @-@ Fassa Bortolo rider Fabian Cancellara , over a 6 @.@ 1 km ( 3 @.@ 8 mi ) parcours – but this was immediately beaten by Orica – GreenEDGE rider Simon Gerrans , who went five seconds quicker around the course . Gerrans ' lead was also not to last for long , as Ukrainian national champion Andriy Hryvko ( Astana ) bettered his mark by 14 seconds ; the time was ultimately good enough for tenth place in the stage results . Hryvko held the lead for over an hour , as no other rider could get within three seconds of his time at that point . 
 It was not until Gerrans ' teammate Brett Lancaster , a former prologue winner at the Giro d 'Italia , that Hryvko 's time was beaten ; Lancaster recorded a time four seconds quicker , crossing the line at 7 ' 24 " . Team Sky rider Edvald Boasson Hagen marginally bettered Lancaster 's time to assume the lead for a time , but French champion Sylvain Chavanel ( Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step ) set a mark of 7 ' 20 " for the course . His time held until the final ten riders to take to the course ; Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) trailed Chavanel by six seconds at the intermediate time @-@ check – coming around halfway through the test – but paced the second half better to negate the deficit , and beat the time of Chavanel by around half a second . Cancellara , the pre @-@ stage favourite , recorded the fastest time of 3 ' 35 " to the intermediate point , and extended his eventual stage @-@ winning margin to seven seconds by the finish ; in the process , Cancellara won his fifth Tour prologue stage , a record . 
 Of other overall contenders , defending champion Cadel Evans ( BMC Racing Team ) , Liquigas – Cannondale 's Vincenzo Nibali and Garmin – Sharp rider Ryder Hesjedal , the winner of May 's Giro d 'Italia , all placing solidly inside the top twenty riders . Nibali 's teammate Peter Sagan and world time trial champion Tony Martin ( Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step ) , who both had been tipped as favourites to win the stage , both encountered difficulties on the course during their respective runs . Sagan lost time after he overshot one of the 180 @-@ degree hairpin bends and had to clip out of the pedals , while Martin – who had set a similar time to teammate Chavanel at the intermediate time @-@ check – suffered a puncture , and ultimately finished 23 seconds down on Cancellara 's time .

 1 July 2012 — Liège ( Belgium ) to Seraing ( Belgium ) , 198 km ( 123 @.@ 0 mi ) 
 The Tour remained in Belgium for the first full day 's racing with a stage through the rolling countryside of the Ardennes . After four Category 4 climbs en route , the race finished at Seraing , a municipality just outside Liège . The finish was at the top of a long and fairly steep drag – the Côte de Seraing – rising for 2 @.@ 4 km ( 1 @.@ 5 mi ) at an average of 4 @.@ 7 % , which was expected to suit the race 's puncheurs such as BMC Racing Team rider Philippe Gilbert , who won a similar finish in the opening stage of the 2011 Tour at Mont des Alouettes . 
 Six riders – <unk> Gène ( Team Europcar ) , Euskaltel – Euskadi rider Pablo Urtasun , Ag2r – La Mondiale 's Maxime Bouet , Nicolas Edet of Cofidis , Anthony Delaplace ( Saur – Sojasun ) and Saxo Bank – Tinkoff Bank rider Michael Mørkøv – advanced clear of the main field in the early running of the stage ; the sextet managed to extend their advantage to a maximum of almost five minutes around a quarter of the way through the stage . By this point , Mørkøv and Urtasun had both scored a point towards the mountains classification , having led over the Côte de <unk> and the Côte de Francorchamps respectively . Overall leader Fabian Cancellara was being paced by his RadioShack – Nissan teammates , and help to stabilise the gap to the leaders at around three minutes . Mørkøv then proceeded to win the two remaining climbs on the day , to take the race 's first polka @-@ dot jersey , becoming only the third Danish rider to have held the lead of that classification . 
 The breakaway also scored the major points at the stage 's intermediate sprint point in <unk> , where Gène took the honours ahead of Urtasun and Edet , while in the main field , Orica – GreenEDGE 's Matthew Goss out @-@ sprinted his former teammates Mark Cavendish ( Team Sky ) and André Greipel ( Lotto – Belisol ) for seventh place . RadioShack – Nissan were joined by Gilbert 's BMC Racing Team squad in order to reduce the lead advantage ; it was cut to around a minute with 30 km ( 18 @.@ 6 mi ) to go , and the break was eventually caught inside of 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining . The field remained together onto the Côte de Seraing , but halfway up the climb , Cancellara attacked and only Peter Sagan ( Liquigas – Cannondale ) could hold pace with him . Team Sky 's Edvald Boasson Hagen later bridged up to the duo , and it was left to the three riders to fight it out for the stage win , with the reduced peloton chasing behind . Cancellara attacked first , but Sagan came around the outside and <unk> to his fourteenth victory of 2012 , ahead of Cancellara – who maintained his overall lead – and Boasson Hagen . Gilbert led home the peloton in fourth , as 22 @-@ year @-@ old Sagan became the youngest rider to win a Tour stage since Lance Armstrong in 1993 . 
 = = Stage 2 = = 
 2 July 2012 — Visé ( Belgium ) to Tournai ( Belgium ) , 207 @.@ 5 km ( 128 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 The race remained in Belgium for one more day with a flat course heading almost due west from Visé . There was one fourth @-@ category climb of the Côte de la Citadelle de Namur during the stage , but it was expected to ultimately result in a sprint finish in Tournai . Three riders – French pairing Anthony Roux of FDJ – BigMat and Team Europcar rider Christophe Kern , along with Michael Mørkøv ( Saxo Bank – Tinkoff Bank ) , wearing the polka @-@ dot jersey as mountains classification leader following his part in the breakaway on the first stage – went clear around 25 km ( 15 @.@ 5 mi ) after the start of the stage , making the early breakaway from the field , and the trio managed to extend their advantage over the main field to around eight minutes , around 20 km ( 12 @.@ 4 mi ) later . 
 RadioShack – Nissan took up duties at the front of the peloton in order to reduce the gap that the leaders had held ; although by the time that Mørkøv scored the point for crossing the summit of the Côte de la Citadelle de Namur first , around 40 km ( 24 @.@ 9 mi ) later , the lead had only been reduced to around six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes . Again , the breakaway took top points on offer at the intermediate sprint point in <unk> , with Kern taking maximum points for Team Europcar for the second successive day . None of the trio elected to contest the sprint , while back in the main field , Matthew Goss ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) again won the sprint contest for fourth place ahead of Rabobank rider Mark Renshaw , Mark Cavendish of Team Sky and the previous day 's stage winner , Liquigas – Cannondale 's Peter Sagan . With around 30 km ( 18 @.@ 6 mi ) remaining of the stage , Roux attacked his two fellow breakaway companions , going off on his own as Mørkøv and Kern allowed themselves to fall back into the confines of the main field . 
 Roux managed to gain an advantage of almost a minute , but he too was brought back by the main field inside the final 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) of the stage . Orica – GreenEDGE , Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step and Lotto – Belisol held the front with Argos – Shimano sprinter Marcel Kittel falling off the back of the field , as he was suffering from stomach problems ; instead their focus would be left with his lead @-@ out man Tom Veelers . The field remained together for the sprint finish in Tournai ; Lotto – Belisol led it out for Greipel , with Sagan just behind . Cavendish moved up the order , behind two other riders – Orica – GreenEDGE 's Daryl Impey and Team Katusha rider Óscar Freire – and slid in behind Greipel with around 300 m ( 980 ft ) to go . Cavendish launched his sprint off Greipel 's wheel with 200 m ( 660 ft ) left , and got the better of him by half a wheel to take his 21st Tour stage victory , moving out of a tie with Luxembourg 's Nicolas Frantz for sixth place on the all @-@ time Tour stage wins list . Greipel , Goss , Veelers and Lampre – ISD 's Alessandro Petacchi completed the top five on the stage , with Sagan taking the points classification lead , and the green jersey , from RadioShack – Nissan 's Fabian Cancellara with sixth place . Cancellara maintained his seven @-@ second overall lead over Cavendish 's teammate Bradley Wiggins .

 3 July 2012 — Orchies to Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer , 197 km ( 122 @.@ 4 mi ) 
 Following its three @-@ day opening salvo in Belgium , the Tour moved back to France , starting in Orchies – where the fifth stage team time trial of the 1982 race was abandoned in progress due to industrial action – before heading west towards Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer . There were six climbs within the closing 65 km ( 40 @.@ 4 mi ) of the parcours – all 1 @.@ 7 km ( 1 @.@ 1 mi ) long or shorter – including the final 700 m ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) long climb up to the finish , with an average gradient of 7 @.@ 4 % . Like the first stage , the course was ideally favoured towards the puncheurs . 
 There was a fast @-@ paced start to the stage with several short and punchy attacks , but were closed down immediately . However , a five @-@ rider move was allowed to be initiated after 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) , with Ag2r – La Mondiale 's Sébastien Minard , Rubén Pérez of Euskaltel – Euskadi , Andriy Hryvko representing the Astana team , Saxo Bank – Tinkoff Bank rider Michael Mørkøv – continuing his run of being in the breakaway in each of the road stages so far – and Giovanni Bernaudeau of Team Europcar all breaking free , quickly gaining a lead of around two minutes . Their lead eventually reached a maximum of over five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes before RadioShack – Nissan and Liquigas – Cannondale made their presence at the front of the peloton , for their respective classification leaders Fabian Cancellara ( overall ) and Peter Sagan ( points ) . The breakaway again scored the major points at the intermediate sprint point in <unk> ; Team Sky rider Mark Cavendish won the bunch sprint for sixth place , despite being boxed in by Vacansoleil – DCM 's Kenny van Hummel , with the two riders later exchanging words . 
 Mørkøv extended his mountains lead by crossing each of the first two climbs ahead of his rivals , while behind , several large crashes in the peloton took down a number of riders . Two riders suffered fractures and had to abandon on the route : Team Sky 's Kanstantsin Sivtsov ( tibia ) and Movistar Team 's José Joaquín Rojas ( collarbone ) . Mørkøv and Hryvko dropped their breakaway companions , and managed to hold off until 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to go when Mørkøv cracked on the Côte du Mont Lambert . Hryvko held off until the top of the climb , where he was then caught himself . Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step 's Sylvain Chavanel attacked with 5 @.@ 5 km ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) to go , and at one point , put fifteen seconds between himself and the field , but he was caught 450 m ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) before the finish by the BMC Racing Team @-@ led field . Sagan comfortably took the sprint for the line , holding enough of a lead to free @-@ wheel the closing metres and performing a " running man " salute akin to Tom Hanks 's character in 1994 film Forrest Gump . A one @-@ second time difference between Sagan and the field – led home by Team Sky 's Edvald Boasson Hagen , Peter Velits ( Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step ) and Cancellara – was announced by the organisers , with all riders that were delayed in a crash in the closing metres , given the same time as Boasson Hagen et al . 
 = = Stage 4 = = 
 4 July 2012 — Abbeville to Rouen , 214 @.@ 5 km ( 133 @.@ 3 mi ) 
 The first half of the stage followed the coast of Picardy and Normandy along the English Channel through Dieppe to the intermediate sprint point of Fécamp , before turning inland towards the finish at Rouen , with four fourth @-@ category climbs during the 214 @.@ 5 km ( 133 @.@ 3 mi ) parcours . The wind on the coast was expected to have an influence on the race , while the two tight turns to get over the Guillaume le Conquérant Bridge with 1 km ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) to go , were potentially disruptive for the lead @-@ outs ahead of an expected sprint finish along the quayside in Rouen . 
 A three @-@ rider breakaway was formed in the early kilometres of the stage , with the riders all representing French @-@ licensed Professional Continental teams . Home riders David Moncoutié ( Cofidis ) and Anthony Delaplace ( Saur – Sojasun ) were joined by Japan 's Yukiya Arashiro representing Team Europcar , as they set about gaining an advantage of over eight @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes from the main field . On the day , Moncoutié and Delaplace would ultimately share the four categorised climbs between them , each scoring two points towards the mountains classification ; while Arashiro , the best sprinter among the trio , took maximum points at Fécamp . The now @-@ customary bunch sprint for the minor points was again taken by Team Sky 's Mark Cavendish , after launching his sprint off the rear wheel of Orica – GreenEDGE 's Matthew Goss . Rabobank 's Mark Renshaw just edged out points leader Peter Sagan of Liquigas – Cannondale for sixth place points . A light rain shower hit the race with around 50 km ( 31 @.@ 1 mi ) remaining , before the first crash of the day with Saxo Bank – Tinkoff Bank 's Jonathan Cantwell and Sagan 's teammate Vincenzo Nibali among those delayed , but both would later rejoin the main field . 
 The lead gap continued to dwindle as the race wore on , with Delaplace eventually leaving his breakaway companions behind with 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to go . Six more riders looked to join the leading trio but all riders were eventually brought back 3 @.@ 5 km ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) ahead of the finish . Inside the final 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) , another crash took down a number of riders including Cavendish and lead @-@ out man Bernhard Eisel , as well as the Garmin – Sharp duo Robert Hunter and Tyler Farrar . The final sprint was between the sprint trains of Lotto – Belisol , Argos – Shimano and Orica – GreenEDGE ; Jürgen Roelandts , Marcel Sieberg and Greg Henderson set the tempo for André Greipel to lead it out from the front , and Greipel achieved a stage victory at the Tour for the second consecutive year , the first such occurrence for a German rider since Erik Zabel . Alessandro Petacchi ( Lampre – ISD ) beat Argos – Shimano 's Tom Veelers to the line for second , with Goss and Sagan – the latter despite being delayed by the late @-@ stage crash – rounding out the top five .

 5 July 2012 — Rouen to Saint @-@ Quentin , 196 @.@ 5 km ( 122 @.@ 1 mi ) 
 This was a very flat day 's racing heading in a north @-@ easterly direction with no rated climbs , with a wide straight finish in the Champs @-@ Élysées Park . As a result , the stage was expected to favour the sprinters . Almost immediately after the peloton rolled out of the start in Rouen , FDJ – BigMat 's Mathieu Ladagnous , was the first rider to break the confines of the main field and was allowed to go clear without resistance . He was joined by three more riders over the next few kilometres , as Pablo Urtasun of Euskaltel – Euskadi , Saur – Sojasun 's Julien Simon and Cofidis rider Jan Ghyselinck provided assistance , and soon the quartet held an advantage of 5 ' 30 " after 40 km ( 24 @.@ 9 mi ) of the stage . 
 It was at that point that Marcel Kittel , Argos – Shimano 's main sprinter , abandoned the race due to his ongoing gastroenteritis . The leaders held an advantage of around three minutes as they approached the intermediate sprint point in Breteuil , coming after 107 @.@ 5 km ( 66 @.@ 8 mi ) of the parcours . Ladagnous took the maximum points on offer , as the four leaders rolled through the line without competition . As it was the previous day , Mark Cavendish ( Team Sky ) led the main field across the line , ahead of Orica – GreenEDGE 's Matthew Goss and Rabobank rider Mark Renshaw . The gap remained around the three @-@ minute mark until 40 km ( 24 @.@ 9 mi ) to go , when it was gradually brought back by the peloton . At 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) , the lead quartet held a lead of 20 seconds , while in the peloton , another big crash occurred ; among those hitting the tarmac were points leader Peter Sagan ( Liquigas – Cannondale ) and Garmin – Sharp 's Tyler Farrar . 
 Farrar , suffering his fourth crash of the race , fell after a clash of elbows with Argos – Shimano rider Tom Veelers ; after the stage , an angered Farrar tried to board the Argos – Shimano team bus to voice his feelings towards Veelers , but was escorted away by Garmin – Sharp staff , including general manager Jonathan Vaughters . Ghyselinck attacked with just 1 @.@ 1 km ( 0 @.@ 7 mi ) remaining , gaining some space from his three breakaway companions . He faded on the finishing incline , as Urtasun and Ladagnous both passed him ; Urtasun was ultimately passed by the sprinters with 200 m ( 660 ft ) to go . Goss launched his sprint first , with Ghyselinck 's teammate Samuel Dumoulin on his wheel ; but for the second stage running , it was André Greipel ( Lotto – Belisol ) who took victory ahead of Goss , Saxo Bank – Tinkoff Bank 's Juan José Haedo , Dumoulin and Cavendish . RadioShack – Nissan 's Fabian Cancellara maintained the yellow jersey – earning the 27th of his career – which set a record for a rider not to have won the Tour , surpassing France 's René <unk> .

 6 July 2012 — Épernay to Metz , 207 @.@ 5 km ( 128 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 This was the last flat stage before the race entered the mountains ; during the 207 @.@ 5 km ( 128 @.@ 9 mi ) parcours , there was one fourth @-@ category climb of the Côte de <unk> , around 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) after the intermediate sprint point , coming at 135 @.@ 5 km ( 84 @.@ 2 mi ) in the commune of Saint @-@ Mihiel . The race finished near the Centre Pompidou where another bunch sprint was expected . Once again , it was a four @-@ rider breakaway that was allowed to be instigated in the early kilometres . David Zabriskie ( Garmin – Sharp ) was the first rider to go off the front , and he was later bolstered by Team Europcar 's Davide Malacarne , Cofidis rider Romain <unk> and Saxo Bank – Tinkoff Bank 's Karsten Kroon , who joined him after around 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) of racing . They later established a maximum lead of around six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes early in the stage . 
 Around 35 km ( 21 @.@ 7 mi ) into the stage , there was a minor crash involving the winner of the previous two stages , André Greipel ( Lotto – Belisol ) , and overall contenders Robert Gesink ( Rabobank ) and Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) amongst others . Greipel suffered a dislocated shoulder in the crash , although all riders would later rejoin the main field ; Greipel did not contest the intermediate sprint for points , where Kroon led over the line in the breakaway , while behind , it was Orica – GreenEDGE 's Matthew Goss that took the most available points from the main field – eleven for fifth – ahead of Team Sky 's Mark Cavendish and points leader Peter Sagan of Liquigas – Cannondale . Zabriskie crossed the summit of the Côte de <unk> first to claim the point on offer for the mountains classification , while in the peloton , there was another minor crash ; Greipel was involved again , as were his teammate Jelle Vanendert and Rabobank 's Bauke Mollema . Again , the peloton splintered due to the crashes , but due to a reduction in pace , those delayed were able to rejoin the main field . 
 With 25 km ( 15 @.@ 5 mi ) of the day 's stage remaining , a much larger crash delayed the majority of the field . According to Lampre – ISD 's Danilo Hondo , the crash was caused by his teammate Davide Viganò while adjusting his jersey and fell into a ditch , causing other riders to stack up behind . Amongst the riders that were delayed by the crash were Fränk Schleck ( RadioShack – Nissan ) , Steven Kruijswijk ( Rabobank ) , Gesink , Mollema , Valverde , Vanendert , Lampre – ISD 's Michele Scarponi , Team Europcar 's Pierre Rolland and the entire Garmin – Sharp team with the exception of Zabriskie . Cavendish was also delayed , but although he was able to avoid the crash , he picked up a puncture in the process . Four riders abandoned the race on the route due to injuries suffered ; Garmin – Sharp 's Tom Danielson – who had already been racing with a separated shoulder – suffered trauma to his other shoulder , hip and arm , and was sent to hospital ; he was joined there by Viganò ( damaged shoulder ) , Euskaltel – Euskadi 's Mikel <unk> ( dislocated elbow ) , and Vacansoleil – DCM 's Wout Poels , who tried to ride on for 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) but eventually had to abandon ; he was later diagnosed with a ruptured spleen and kidney , as well as three broken ribs and bruised lungs . After completing the stage , Team Katusha 's Óscar Freire ( broken rib and punctured lung ) , Imanol Erviti of the Movistar Team ( " loss of muscle mass " ) , and Maarten Wynants of Rabobank ( broken ribs and punctured lung ) had to withdraw as well . 
 After the crash , the race had split into many distinct groups ; the breakaway still held a minute 's lead over a reduced peloton of around sixty riders , with those delayed in several more groups a few minutes and more behind . With nearly all of their riders able to get through the chaos , Orica – GreenEDGE took up pace @-@ making on the front of the peloton , in the hopes of getting Goss the stage victory . The breakaway held a 15 @-@ second lead with 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) to go , but it took until the final 2 @.@ 5 km ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) to catch them , with Zabriskie holding off to 1 @.@ 3 km ( 0 @.@ 8 mi ) remaining . This set up the sprint , with Goss going first , while Sagan was nearly boxed in by Vacansoleil – DCM 's Kris <unk> as he suffered a snapped chain with 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) to go ; he made it round him and soon passed Greipel , who faded in the closing stages , and he picked up his third stage victory of his début Tour , becoming the fifteenth rider to do so . With Edvald Boasson Hagen ( Team Sky ) and Ryder Hesjedal ( Garmin – Sharp ) among those delayed , Sagan moved into the top ten overall along with Maxime Monfort ( RadioShack – Nissan ) , as Monfort 's teammate Fabian Cancellara maintained the overall lead once again .

 7 July 2012 — <unk> to La Planche des Belles Filles , 199 km ( 123 @.@ 7 mi ) 
 The race entered the high mountains with a first @-@ time finish at 1 @,@ 035 m ( 3 @,@ 396 ft ) at the ski resort of La Planche des Belles Filles in the Vosges . After two third @-@ category climbs , the final climb was 5 @.@ 9 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) long and averaged 8 @.@ 5 % with places of the climbs reaching 14 – 20 % in the closing stages . Following on from the crash the previous day , five more riders abandoned the race prior to the stage ; Giro d 'Italia winner Ryder Hesjedal of Garmin – Sharp ( hip and leg ) , was joined on the sidelines by teammate Robert Hunter ( vertebrae ) , Ag2r – La Mondiale 's Hubert Dupont ( sprained ankle , fractures to vertebrae and radius ) , Movistar Team 's Iván Gutiérrez ( knee ) , and Euskaltel – Euskadi 's <unk> <unk> , who fractured his collarbone . 
 An initial breakaway of nineteen riders went clear after 11 km ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) , but it was eventually reduced to seven riders , representing seven different teams , by the time the race reached the 20 km ( 12 @.@ 4 mi ) mark . They eventually established a lead of nearly six minutes around a third of the way through the stage ; by the intermediate sprint point in <unk> , it had been reduced by a minute , as Cyril Gautier ( Team Europcar ) took the twenty points for first over the line , and Peter Sagan ( Liquigas – Cannondale ) extended his points lead by one , as he beat Matthew Goss ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) in the main field sprint , for eighth place . Saxo Bank – Tinkoff Bank 's Chris Anker Sørensen crossed both of the third @-@ category climbs first ahead of Rabobank 's Luis León Sánchez , but the peloton started reducing their advantage by each passing kilometre . Astana 's Dmitry Fofonov launched an attack at the front , which dislodged Gautier from the lead group ; the peloton remained a minute in arrears , with Team Sky holding station and setting the tempo , protecting Bradley Wiggins from any danger . 
 Jurgen Van den Broeck of Lotto – Belisol , Movistar Team rider Alejandro Valverde , and Rabobank 's Robert Gesink encountered difficulties at this point , and would lose over a minute by the end of the day . Sørensen and Orica – GreenEDGE 's Michael Albasini were the last of the leaders to be caught , with just over 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) remaining .

 8 July 2012 — Belfort to Porrentruy ( Switzerland ) , 157 @.@ 5 km ( 97 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 The race entered Switzerland after 65 km ( 40 @.@ 4 mi ) of the parcours , going through the Jura Mountains with a total of seven rated climbs including the first @-@ category Col de la Croix – the summit of which was at 789 m ( 2 @,@ 589 ft ) after a 3 @.@ 7 km ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ) , 9 @.@ 2 % average gradient climb – 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) before the finish in Porrentruy . Ten riders made the immediate breakaway from the peloton , but the gap that they had achieved was closed down by the Astana team ahead of the day 's first climb , the Côte de <unk> . Jens Voigt of RadioShack – Nissan attacked off the front of the lead group to take the point on offer for the mountains classification , and was joined by several more riders on the descent ; however , the group only held a gap of twenty seconds at the 50 km ( 31 @.@ 1 mi ) mark . 
 Jérémy Roy attacked from the peloton for FDJ – BigMat , and soon caught and passed Voigt on the road ; while in the peloton , Samuel Sánchez ( Euskaltel – Euskadi ) had to abandon the race , after crashing with teammate Jorge <unk> and Movistar Team 's Alejandro Valverde , and suffered a fractured metacarpal in his left hand . Roy was joined by Astana rider Fredrik Kessiakoff on the day 's fourth climb , the Côte de <unk> , while a 22 @-@ rider chase group formed behind the duo . Steven Kruijswijk ( Rabobank ) and Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step 's Kevin De Weert left that group , and soon joined up with the two leaders on the Côte de <unk> , before Kessiakoff left them behind , after attacking once again . He held a lead of 1 ' 45 " over the dwindling chase group on the penultimate climb , the Côte de la <unk> , and eventually the group had reduced to just French pairing Tony Gallopin ( RadioShack – Nissan ) and Roy 's teammate Thibaut Pinot , the youngest rider in the Tour . 
 Gallopin lost ground to Pinot on the final climb , and soon Pinot was chasing after Kessiakoff on the climb itself ; he ultimately caught him towards the summit of the climb . Kessiakoff could not stick with Pinot on the climb , with Pinot crossing the summit with a 12 @-@ second advantage over Kessiakoff . The group of overall contenders had also been reduced , with Lotto – Belisol 's Jelle Vanendert setting the tempo for teammate Jurgen Van den Broeck , around a minute @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half behind Pinot . With boisterous support from his team manager Marc Madiot , Pinot maintained an advantage of a minute into the final 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , as Kessiakoff was swept up by the small chasing group . Van Den Broeck and Cadel Evans ( BMC Racing Team ) looked to go clear in the closing stages , but they were brought back ; while at the front , Pinot soloed to a 26 @-@ second margin of victory , ahead of Evans , Gallopin and the rest of the group . Kessiakoff took the polka @-@ dot jersey from Chris Froome ( Team Sky ) , as Froome 's teammate Bradley Wiggins maintained the overall lead into the following day 's individual time trial .

 9 July 2012 — Arc @-@ et @-@ <unk> to Besançon , 41 @.@ 5 km ( 25 @.@ 8 mi ) , ( ITT ) 
 The first of two lengthy individual time trial stages was fairly flat with rolling hills in the early kilometres before the parcours entered the valley of the River Doubs at <unk> . It was expected that the main contenders for the general classification were to emerge after this stage . As was customary of time trial stages , the riders set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage . Thus , Brice Feillu of Saur – Sojasun , who , in 178th place , trailed overall leader Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) by one hour , eleven minutes and thirty @-@ nine seconds , was the first rider to set off on the stage . Feillu ultimately recorded a time of 57 ' 33 " for the course , which was not bettered until the thirteenth rider to complete the course , Vacansoleil – DCM rider Gustav Larsson , who recorded a time over three minutes quicker than Feillu . 
 He completed the course in a time of 54 ' 19 " , and his time held for around an hour before his teammate Lieuwe Westra assumed top spot ; despite being ten seconds down on Larsson at the second intermediate time point , Westra completed the final portion of the course some twenty seconds quicker , and recorded a time of 54 ' 09 " . Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step 's Tony Martin , the world champion , was the next rider to assume the top spot , setting the first time underneath 54 minutes ; he set a time of 53 ' 40 " , despite riding with a fractured scaphoid bone in his left wrist and suffering a flat tyre in the opening 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) of the stage . Fabian Cancellara of RadioShack – Nissan improved the quickest time benchmark ; he set the fastest time at each of the two intermediate time points on the stage , and having passed the rider who started three minutes before him on the road , Rabobank 's Bauke Mollema , Cancellara established a time for the course of 52 ' 21 " , beating Martin 's time by 1 ' 19 " . 
 His time was threatened by BMC Racing Team rider Tejay van Garderen , as he went beneath the time of Cancellara at each of the intermediate time checks , but faded towards the end and fell nine seconds outside of his target . Ultimately , only two riders beat Cancellara 's time , both riding for Team Sky . Chris Froome improved upon van Garderen 's times at the splits , but maintained his pace until the end , setting a time half a second inside 52 minutes , beating Cancellara 's time by 22 seconds . Wiggins went even quicker and by the time he had finished , he had put 35 seconds into his teammate with a time of 51 ' 24 " , winning his first Tour stage . Wiggins also put substantial time into his major general classification rivals , as the margin on the day ranged between 1 ' 43 " for Cadel Evans ( BMC Racing Team ) who finished sixth on the stage , and 3 ' 29 " for Cofidis rider Rein Taaramäe , who was 28th and lost the white jersey as leader of the young rider classification to van Garderen .

 11 July 2012 — Mâcon to Bellegarde @-@ sur @-@ Valserine , 194 @.@ 5 km ( 120 @.@ 9 mi ) 
 After a rest day , the Tour remained in the Jura Mountains , with much of the day 's route the same as that followed on stage five of the 2012 Critérium du Dauphiné , including the Tour 's first passage over the hors catégorie climb of the Col du Grand Colombier ; a 17 @.@ 4 km ( 10 @.@ 8 mi ) long climb , reaching an altitude of 1 @,@ 501 m ( 4 @,@ 925 ft ) at an average gradient of 7 @.@ 1 % , but with sections in excess of 12 % . The Tour then passed over the 1 @,@ 051 m ( 3 @,@ 448 ft ) Col de Richemond , 20 @.@ 5 km ( 12 @.@ 7 mi ) before the finish ; the race descended towards <unk> before a gradual uphill finish in Bellegarde @-@ sur @-@ Valserine . 
 Several small attacks occurred in the early kilometres of the stage , and the peloton allowed the riders to establish an advantage off the front of the main field . It eventually amounted to some twenty @-@ five riders in the breakaway , including Lampre – ISD rider Michele Scarponi – the highest @-@ placed rider in the group , some ten minutes in arrears of race leader Bradley Wiggins ( Team Sky ) – and the top two riders in the points classification , Liquigas – Cannondale 's Peter Sagan and Matthew Goss of Orica – GreenEDGE . After Saxo Bank – Tinkoff Bank 's Michael Mørkøv took maximum points over the first climb of the day , the Côte de <unk> , the next focus was on the intermediate sprint point at <unk> ; Sagan launched his sprint first but was beaten to the line by both Goss and FDJ – BigMat 's <unk> <unk> , with Goss reducing Sagan 's lead in the standings to 27 points . The breakaway group split apart on the Col du Grand Colombier ; only Scarponi , Team Europcar 's Thomas Voeckler , Rabobank rider Luis León Sánchez and Dries Devenyns of Omega Pharma – Quick @-@ Step remained at the front . 
 Voeckler crossed the summit of the climb first , taking the 25 points on offer for the hors catégorie climb . The peloton crossed five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes later . Voeckler also took maximum points at the Col de Richemond , and as a result , took the polka @-@ dot jersey for the mountains classification lead from Astana rider Fredrik Kessiakoff . Sagan had dropped back to aid his teammate Vincenzo Nibali , who had attacked on the descent of the Col du Grand Colombier , but both riders were not to stay in front ahead of the Team Sky @-@ led peloton . RadioShack – Nissan 's Jens Voigt made up a minute on the lead quartet to join them , with around 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining ; Devenyns looked to go clear in the closing stages , but Voeckler had kept most in hand to take his third career Tour stage victory , three seconds ahead of Scarponi and seven ahead of Voigt . Wiggins remained on the wheel of his closest rival , Cadel Evans of the BMC Racing Team , to maintain his 1 ' 53 " lead in the general classification into the Alps .

Recording sessions took place in a San Antonio , Texas recording studio . Her husband , Chris Pérez wrote , in his 2012 book about his and Selena 's relationship , that during the recording session for the song : " there was a noticeable difference between her voice on [ this song ] and [ the one 's on ] Entre a Mi Mundo ( 1992 ) , especially . I can 't say that it was an improvement , exactly , because I always thought that Selena 's voice sounded incredible . It 's just that her voice was richer and more mature than before , and her singing was more emotional and powerful as a result . " 
 During the recording sessions , Selena added the ad libitum " oh baby " onto " Amor Prohibido " , which A.B. believed the song would " not have been the same if she had not added the ' oh baby ' part . " In a 2002 interview , A.B. confessed to wanting " Bidi Bidi Bom Bom " released as the lead single but found that Selena and EMI Latin pushed for " Amor Prohibido " instead .

 Lyrically , musicologist Howard Blumenthal interpreted " Amor Prohibido " as a " love forbidden " story by an unprivileged girl who is separated by social class from her love interest and finds that true love is what really matters . Marco Torres of the Houston Press saw similarities between the lyrical content of " Amor Prohibido " and that of Selena 's and Pérez 's relationship — who were banned from having a romantic relationship because Pérez was a rocker by Selena 's father – manager Abraham Quintanilla , Jr . ; who later accepted the relationship . The lyrics have also drawn similarities among female teenagers ' " trouble " partners and their parents forbidding their relationship . 
 The lyrical content of " Amor Prohibido " has foster various opinions from several authors , journalist , and musicologist who found themes in the lyrics to those facing the LGBT community . It has since become an anthem for the LGBT community because of its lyrics . According to Deborah Paredez in her 2009 book <unk> , the lyrics of " Amor Prohibido " invokes " a legibly queer text " that resonates with the LGBT community . This was echoed by Emma Perez in her book The <unk> Imaginary : Writing Chicanas into History ( 1999 ) , who found that the LGBT community reconceptualized the song and found that the recording was most popular with drag queens at nightclubs . Perez further explained that the lyrical content of forbidden love between two people of different social class was altered with prohibited love between same @-@ sex couples . Alejandra Molina of The Orange County Register reported on a tribute to Selena by LGBT fans in Santa Ana , California who found the singer 's songs to be " ambiguous " and that " Amor Prohibido " was interpreted " as a love that is forbidden due to a person 's sexuality , race or class . " 
 Other music critics have called the song a Romeo & Juliet @-@ esque recording with society opposing a relationship based on socio @-@ economic status or a look into modern society 's views on romantic relationships . Author Ellie D. Hernández wrote in her book about Chicano culture that " Amor Prohibido " spoke of " social and cultural desire that transcends the boundaries of romantic love " . Hernández believed that the central theme of the song dwells on social divisions , class , and race " that divides [ Selena ] from her beloved . " which " suggests hegemonic crisis informing Selena 's lamentations . " Hernández believes that the lyrics spoke about modern societal views on romantic relationships and that one must " live in accordance " to those views or face " emotional banishment from her family and culture . " Hernández ended her interpretation of the lyrics that " risking everything for this love is not at all an innocent choice but a decision abundant with agency and consciousness that begins as a consequence of the forbidden .

Skiers missing an arm use a technique that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm . Skiers with cerebral palsy have the introduction of ski poles delayed as skiers may overgrip them .

 Para @-@ alpine skiers in this classification have their choice regarding how many skis and ski poles they wish to use , along with the type of ski poles they wish to utilize , which may include outriggers . The rules FIS rules governing ski boots and bindings are not enforced for this class , with different requirements than rules that apply to that equipment for able @-@ bodied competitors . For below the knee amputees in this class , their ski boot may have their prosthetic leg built into it . In para @-@ Nordic skiing , skiers use two skis and have an option to use one or two ski poles . 
 Across both types of skiing , LW9 competitors use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able @-@ bodied . If they are using outriggers , these are fitted to the skier based the height of the skier 's hip joint when the skier is standing . While learning to ski , skiers in this class with cerebral palsy may use ski @-@ bras , <unk> cords , outriggers , slant boards or toe boards . In the Biathlon , athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting . 
 = = Technique = = 
 Outriggers are used to stop using a technique that involves bringing the skiers elbows from their raised position down to their hips while pushing the outriggers down . When using the outrigger , skiers do not rotate their arms as this changes the location of the ski on the snow . 
 Skiers missing an arm use a technique that corrects lateral balance issues resulting from the missing arm . A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation . Skiers with hemiplegia have to be trained to use both sides of their body equally . If they do not , they are likely to fall over when their skis cross in front of them . 
 One of the skiing techniques used by this class is called the three track method , and was developed as part of the American Training System . For skiers with an amputation , one of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle , knee and hip . This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity . The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis . This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill . The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again . The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain , followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop . After this , the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift . This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line , which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge . Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie , beginning turns , parallel turns , short swings and moguls . 
 In teaching skiers with cerebral palsy , instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them . Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement . One method of learning to ski for competitors with cerebral palsy in this classification is the American Teaching System . They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is , and how to put it on and take it off . Next , skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain . After this , the skier learns how to side step , and then how to fall down and get back up again . The skier then learns how to do a straight run , and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift . This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers , wedge turns , wide track parallel turns , how to use ski poles , and advanced parallel turns . 
 In the Biathlon , all Paralympic athletes shoot from a prone position .

 A factoring system is used in the sport to allow different classes to compete against each other when there are too few individual competitors in one class in a competition . The factoring system works by having a number for each class based on their functional mobility or vision levels , where the results are calculated by multiplying the finish time by the factored number . The resulting number is the one used to determine the winner in events where the factor system is used . For the 2003 / 2004 para @-@ Nordic skiing season , the percentage for LW9 using the classic technique was 85 @-@ 95 % and percentage for free was 82 @-@ 95 % . The percentage for the 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 ski seasons was 85 @-@ 95 % for classic and 82 @-@ 96 % for free technique .

 In para @-@ Alpine events , this classification is grouped with standing classes who are seeded to start after visually impaired classes and before sitting classes in the slalom and giant slalom . In downhill , Super @-@ G and Super Combined , this same group competes after the visually impaired classes and sitting classes . For alpine events , a skier is required to have their ski poles or equivalent equipment planted in the snow in front of the starting position before the start of the race . In cross @-@ country and biathlon events , this classification is grouped with other standing classes . The IPC advises event organisers to run the men 's standing ski group after the blind men 's group and before the blind women 's group . Women 's standing classes are advised to go last . 
 During competition , LW9 skiers cannot use a limb not in a ski for competitive advantage to gain speed or keep balance by putting it in the snow . If they do so , the rules state they will be disqualified from the event .

 " Vogue " ( <unk> as " vogue " ) is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki for her third studio album , Duty ( 2000 ) . It was written by Hamasaki , while production was handled by Max Matsuura . It premiered on April 26 , 2000 as the lead single from the album . Her third consecutive lead single to be produced by Matsuura , the song is part of a trilogy from Duty ; the other two singles being " Far Away " and " Seasons " . 
 Musically , " Vogue " was described as a Japanese pop song with musical elements of Latin pop . The lyrics discusses her presence in the music industry . Upon its release , the track garnered positive reviews from music critics , who praised the composition and Hamasaki 's song writing . It also achieved success in Japan , peaking at number three on the Oricon Singles Chart and four on the TBS Count Down TV chart . " Vogue " has sold over 767 @,@ 000 units in Japan . 
 The accompanying music video for " Vogue " was directed by Wataru Takeishi ; it features two children in a post @-@ apocalyptic city , reading a book that contains video imagery of Hamasaki in a cherry blossom field . Both the music video and the song has appeared on several compilations by Hamasaki , including A Best ( 2001 ) and A Complete : All Singles ( 2008 ) .

 " Vogue " was written by Hamasaki , while production was handled by Japanese musician Max Matsuura . The song was composed and arranged by long @-@ term collaborator Kazuhito Kikuchi , whilst Japanese musician Naoto Suzuki co @-@ arranged it . This was Kikuchi 's final collaboration with Hamasaki , until he returned as the main composer for her sixth studio album , My Story ( 2004 ) . For the track 's instrumentation , Suzuki played the keyboards , Naoki <unk> played the guitar , and Takahiro Iida mixed the final composition . It was selected as the lead single from Duty , and was released on April 26 , 2000 by Avex Trax . 
 The maxi CD of the single contains the original composition and its instrumental version , plus seven remixes and the b @-@ side " Ever Free " . " Vogue " is her first single to include an unreleased non @-@ album b @-@ side since her 1999 single " <unk> on You " , and remains her final to do so . As a single from the Duty trilogy , which included Hamasaki 's singles " Far Away " and " Seasons " , the singles were released as a DVD single and VHS . It included the three mini @-@ music videos , alongside the making of the videos and a TV commercial . The CD and digital cover sleeve has a close @-@ up of Ayumi Hamasaki 's face , edited with digital effects . The song 's title , " Vogue " , is present on cover .

 " Vogue " was recorded in 2000 at Avex Studios and Prime Sound Studios in Tokyo , Japan . The song was described as a Japanese pop song with musical elements of Latin pop . As part of the trilogy set with " Far Away " and " Seasons " , " Vogue " highlights the theme of the present . With this , " Far Away " details the past and " Seasons " discusses Hamasaki 's future . The trilogy set also focuses on hopelessness , a reflection of Hamasaki 's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous songs . Based on her song writing , she described her feelings after the writing all the tracks from Duty as " unnatural " and was constantly " nervous " for the final result . A staff reviewer from Amazon Japan noticed the trilogy set had a " healing effect " that was absent on Hamasaki 's two previous studio albums .

 " Vogue " received highly favourable reviews from music critics . Alexey Eremenko , who had written her extended biography at AllMusic , highlighted the song as an album and career stand out track . A staff reviewer from Yahoo ! GeoCities reviewed Hamasaki 's greatest hits album A Best , and singled out the song as one of her best tracks . They commented that " Vogue " was the best examples of " classic J @-@ pop music . " Morimosa from Nifty.com complimented Hamasaki 's song writing ; he compared the song writing to the rest of the songs from Duty , and commended how she inducted a " pessimistic " nature rather than " anxiety " or " aggression " . Hamasaki hosted an online voting poll for fans to choose their favourite tracks to be featured on her Ayumi Hamasaki 15th Anniversary Tour . As a result , " Vogue " was included on the list . The song was remixed as an orchestral song for her remix album ayu @-@ mi @-@ x III Acoustic Orchestra Version ( 2003 ) , and was commended alongside other tracks for its " rich melody " .

 = Interception of the Rex = 
 The interception of the Rex was a training exercise and military aviation achievement of the United States Army Air Corps prior to World War II . The tracking and location of an ocean @-@ going vessel by B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses on 12 May 1938 was a major event in the development of a doctrine that led to a United States Air Force independent of the Army . The mission was ostensibly a training exercise for coastal defense of the United States , but was conceived by planners to be a well @-@ publicized demonstration of the capabilities of " heavy bombers ( as ) long range instruments of power " . 
 The flight was conducted during coastal defense maneuvers held by the Air Corps without the participation of the United States Navy , and apparently without understanding of their purpose by the Army Chief of Staff . Both had continuing disagreements with the leaders of the Air Corps over roles and missions , with the Navy disputing its maritime mission and the Army seeking to limit its role to that of supporting ground forces . 
 With a characteristic flair for creating publicity , the Air Corps ' General Headquarters Air Force ( its combat organization ) not only successfully made the interception at sea , but exploited both live radio news coverage and dramatic photographs . Although the publicity resulted in a short @-@ term setback for Air Corps ambitions , within a year both U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and future Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall became new proponents of long @-@ range air power .

 = = = Ostfriesland = = = 
 In July 1921 , promoting the concept of an independent Air Force , Gen. Billy Mitchell staged a series of aerial bombing exercises that resulted in the sinking of the former German battleship Ostfriesland by the U.S. Air Service . Although he incurred the enmity of the Navy , which considered the achievement nothing more than a publicity stunt , Mitchell continued to discredit the value of the battleship as the main weapon for projection of power by sinking several more obsolete ships in the next two years . However the Air Service was limited by Army policy to being an auxiliary of the ground forces and was unable to obtain a role that would employ the use of long distance bombers . 
 = = = The " Shasta Disaster " = = = 
 When the Air Service was renamed the Air Corps in 1926 , the Joint Army @-@ Navy Board was in the process of reconsidering service responsibilities in coastal defense . Both Chief of Air Corps Major General Mason Patrick and Rear Admiral William A. Moffett , Chief of the Navy 's Bureau of Aeronautics , resisted any restrictions on range or missions for their respective services ' aircraft . The resulting Joint Action statement was vague regarding Air Corps actions over water but " left the door open " for the Navy 's interpretation of its own authority , which was that the shore @-@ based coastal patrol mission was its prerogative . Efforts by the War Department to clarify the issue were rebuffed by the Navy to the extent that the Secretary of War warned President Herbert Hoover in 1930 that the situation was endangering national defense . 
 On 7 January 1931 , Army Chief of Staff Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Navy CNO Adm. William V. Pratt reached an agreement modifying the Joint Action statement by assigning the coastal defense role for land @-@ based aircraft to the Air Corps . This came at a time when the Air Corps was seeking a mission to justify the development of all @-@ metal monoplane bombers , and theorists at the Air Corps Tactical School were advocating the use of long @-@ range heavy bombers . In August of that year , to garner publicity and generate favorable public opinion , <unk> Frank M. Andrews , on the staff of outgoing Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. James <unk> , proposed to bomb another ship during joint maneuvers with the Navy off the coast of North Carolina . Before the mission Col. Roy Kirtland , the base commander at Langley Field , cautioned reporters that the operation was to be only a bombing exercise using small bombs , and that " nothing spectacular " should be expected . 
 The United States Shipping Board made available a World War I cargo ship , the <unk> gross ton USS Mount Shasta , that had been tied up in the James River for a decade . An Army mine vessel towed the hulk to sea 60 nautical miles ( 111 km ) off Currituck Beach Light . The next morning , August 11 , Major Harbert A. Dargue led nine B @-@ 3A and B @-@ 5 bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Group , little different from the Martin NBS @-@ 1s that had destroyed the Ostfriesland , to locate and attack the Mount Shasta , but a combination of bad weather and failed communications resulted in the planes being unable to locate the ship . Worse , the failure was witnessed by several dozen reporters , movie newsreel crews , a broadcast team from NBC radio , and observers from both the Army and Navy , some aboard airplanes that did find the ship . The Navy responded immediately with scornful public mocking of the effort . When a second attempt three days later scored only a few hits with inadequately small 300- and 600 @-@ pound bombs , and failed to sink the Mount Shasta , a pair of United States Coast Guard ocean @-@ going tugboats used small guns to sink it . 
 Despite its earlier disclaimer and subsequent explanations , the Air Corps was highly embarrassed by the incident , referred to as " the bombing flop " within the service . Navy Captain Dudley Knox dubbed it " the Shasta Disaster " , and the New York Evening Post commented that " the Navy evened up an old score " . Hanson W. Baldwin , military editor of the New York Times and a Naval Academy graduate , averred that it was " illustrative of the inefficiency of land @-@ based pilots over water . " As a result , Andrews and six subordinates were replaced by incoming Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. Benjamin Foulois , and the Secretary of War recommended that the Air Corps ' budget be slashed . Andrews and <unk> Henry H. Arnold ( executive officer of the Air Materiel Division at Wright Field ) , however , expressed concerns about the apparent lack of capability and possible failures in Air Corps training demonstrated by the fiasco . 
 Two months later a second opportunity presented itself . Another old ship , the Haines , sank in shallow water while being towed off Plum Tree Island and became a hazard to navigation . The 2nd Bombardment Group redeemed itself by completely destroying the derelict from the air , even though their only visible target was a ten @-@ foot @-@ square float marker . This accomplishment , however , went entirely unpublicized . 
 Regardless of the MacArthur @-@ Pratt agreement , the Navy had gone ahead with development of land @-@ based patrol aircraft and expansion of its naval air stations , and in 1933 formally repudiated the agreement after Adm. Pratt retired . On 11 September 1935 , the Joint Board , at the behest of the Navy and the concurrence of Gen. MacArthur , issued a revised Joint Action statement that reasserted the limited role of all Air Corps missions , including coastal defense , as auxiliary to the " mobile Army " . However , long @-@ range bomber advocates interpreted its language to mean that the Air Corps could conduct long @-@ range reconnaissance , attack approaching fleets , reinforce distant bases , and attack enemy air bases , all in furtherance of its mission to prevent an air attack on America . 
 = = = Joint Air Exercise No. 4 = = = 
 On 4 March 1937 , the 2nd Bombardment Group , now commanded by Lt. Col. Robert Olds , received the first of the newly developed B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers , with 12 delivered during the spring and summer of 1937 . Designated the YB @-@ 17 because of its prototype status , the Flying Fortress was the first multi @-@ engine long @-@ range bomber acquired by the Air Corps , despite resistance from the Army General Staff over its necessity , and the centerpiece of the General Headquarters Air Force ( GHQ Air Force ) . 
 The B @-@ 17s made their first significant operational contribution during Joint Air Exercise No. 4 , an Army @-@ Navy summer maneuver conducted at sea west of San Francisco , California . Authorized by a directive of President Roosevelt issued 10 July 1937 , the exercise used the target ship Utah to represent a hostile fleet of two battleships , an aircraft carrier , and nine destroyers . A patrol wing of 30 Navy planes commanded by Rear Admiral Ernest J. King was assigned to locate the fleet , after which a force of 41 Air Corps bombers ( including seven B @-@ 17s operating from March Field ) would attack it . War Department orders limited the Air Corps aircraft to operating no more than 300 nautical miles ( 560 km ) offshore , even though the directive had specified an exercise area out to 500 nautical miles ( 930 km ) . 
 The exercise began at noon on 12 August 1937 and was scheduled to end in 24 hours . After several hours of searching through a foggy <unk> that extended 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) offshore , Navy planes found the Utah 275 nautical miles ( 510 km ) from the coast and tracked it heading northwest . Air Corps bombers were sent to attack the ship but searched well into the evening without locating it . Admiral King then found an error in the Navy 's position reports , which he later attributed to " clerical error " . The Utah had actually been 50 nautical miles ( 93 km ) west of the search area provided to the Air Corps . Worse , the ship disappeared into the extensive low fog during the night , breaking the contact by the Navy 's scout planes . The poor weather also prevented an early morning search for the Utah . 
 Brig. Gen. Delos Emmons , commander of the GHQ Air Force 's 1st Wing , dispatched bombers at 0900 on 13 August to search an area of 30 @,@ 000 square miles ( 78 @,@ 000 km2 ) entirely covered by low clouds . Olds surmised that the Utah had feinted towards San Francisco , then reversed course to attack the industrial Los Angeles area . Accompanied by Maj. Gen. Frank Andrews ( commanding the GHQ Air Force ) , he flew in the lead B @-@ 17 above the clouds , patrolling an area 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) offshore . A Navy patrol aircraft located the Utah at 11 : 00 steaming southeast 285 nautical miles ( 530 km ) off the coast . The 2nd BG bombers responded to the position report and located the Utah shortly before the noon termination of the exercise . From an altitude of 400 feet they attacked the former battleship with Navy @-@ supplied water bombs . 
 When the Navy protested the low @-@ altitude attack , claiming that evasive action could have avoided the attack , both B @-@ 17s and B @-@ 18s repeated the mission the next day . They found the Utah and bombed it , with the B @-@ 17s bombing from 18 @,@ 000 feet . The Air Corps produced photographs and bombing data that showed it achieved a higher percentage of hits and near @-@ misses than earlier Navy tests , and the Navy subsequently had the exercise classified " Secret " . The joint report sent to the president by the secretaries of the Navy and War omitted the information showing the success both in navigation and bombing . Despite the secrecy restriction , the success of the B @-@ 17s was leaked to radio commentator <unk> Carter , who disclosed it to the public . 
 In an attempt to overcome this compartmentalization , Andrews bypassed the chain of command on 8 January 1938 , in a memorandum of his own regarding a minor joint air exercise held in November 1937 off the Virginia Capes . There four B @-@ 17s had found and successfully bombed Navy target vessels . Andrews sent a memo directly to Roosevelt 's military aide , Col. Edwin M. Watson , that included confidential Navy memoranda confirming the accuracy of the Army 's bombing .

 = = = Northeast Maneuvers = = = 
 In May 1938 the Air Corps conducted one of the largest maneuvers in its history . 468 officers , 2 @,@ 380 enlisted men , and 131 aircraft were drawn from all three wings of the GHQ Air Force and based at 18 airports in the northeast United States , " from Schenectady , New York , and Aberdeen , Maryland , westward to Harrisburg , Pennsylvania " . Included were eight B @-@ 17s of the 2d Bombardment Group . All were assigned as the " Blue Force " defending New England from the " Black Force " , an attacking aircraft carrier fleet . The Navy , involved in fleet exercises off the West Coast , did not provide ships to play the role of the Black Force . The Army publicized the resulting scenario as depicting simultaneous attacks on America by hostile fleets on both coasts , with the Air Corps tasked to defend against one of them . 
 Attached to the exercise was Lt. Col. Ira C. Eaker , the Chief of the Air Corps ' Information Division . Eaker , who had a degree in journalism and had just completed a course in news photography at the University of Oklahoma , used the maneuvers as a platform for publicizing both the capabilities and materiel deficiencies of the Air Corps . His assistant was 2d Lt. Harris Hull , a reservist on temporary duty for the exercise who was a reporter for the Washington Post in civilian life . When newspapers , including the Los Angeles Times , criticized the maneuvers for using a " mythical fleet " as a target , Hull suggested that an ocean liner be substituted for naval vessels . He learned that the Italian Line 's SS Rex was bound for New York and would pass the 1 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 900 km ) mark on 11 May . Eaker recommended the interception of the liner to Gen. Andrews , who concurred and received approval from the office of the Army 's Chief of Staff . Hull arranged to receive position reports from officials of the line . 
 Olds , whose B @-@ 17s were deployed to Olmsted Field in Harrisburg , was given the assignment of locating the Rex as far at sea as possible , and assigned Major Vincent J. Meloy , the commanding officer of the 20th Bomb Squadron , to act as nominal head of the Black Force . Olds selected three aircraft from the 49th Bomb Squadron for the mission . On the afternoon of 11 May 1937 , Olds and his crews flew from Olmsted to the staging base at Mitchel Field on Long Island . 
 Assigned as lead navigator was 1st Lt. Curtis E. LeMay , who had navigated the finding of the Utah and been a participant in a goodwill mission to South America in February that had won the group the MacKay Trophy . The Chief of the Materiel Division 's Photographic Section , Maj. George W. Goddard , flew co @-@ pilot in aircraft No. 81 to document the mission using a specially @-@ modified Graflex camera . Reporters were also invited to accompany the mission . They included Hanson Baldwin , possibly because of his earlier excoriation of the " Shasta Disaster , " and a radio crew from the National Broadcasting Company ( which on 4 April 1937 , had made a live six @-@ minute broadcast from a B @-@ 17 at Langley Field ) to broadcast from aboard the lead aircraft while it made the interception . 
 The Blue Force bombers and crews were : 
 LeMay used the Rex 's noon position report of 11 May in conjunction with known routes and speeds of ocean liners bound for New York to calculate an intercept point for the next day , based on the ship 's expected noon position for 12 May . An updated position report to refine his calculations was expected that evening but not received . Weather conditions deteriorated during the night , with a forecast that " ceilings would be down to nothing " in the vicinity of the anticipated interception .

 At 08 : 30 on 12 May , the three B @-@ 17s had begun to taxi in a rain squall when a morning position report from Rex was relayed to LeMay . It indicated that the liner was then 725 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) from New York , farther east than his original computations had placed it . LeMay 's original flight plan had incorporated an area search if necessary , but weather conditions and the ship 's distance from Long Island precluded that possibility . 
 The B @-@ 17s took off from Mitchel Field at 08 : 45 and cruised east from Sandy Hook at 170 mph on a true course of 101 degrees through rain , hail , downdrafts , and an intense headwind that reduced their ground speed by 11 @.@ 5 mph . LeMay was unable to check the effect of the winds on ground speed and drift because of a heavy overcast that limited their altitude to 1 @,@ 100 feet ( 340 m ) . At 10 : 00 they emerged into good weather that lasted an hour . LeMay took double drifts until the B @-@ 17s had to separate to transit a cold front . At 11 : 15 they reassembled in clear weather on the other side , where LeMay checked their course again . He calculated an intercept time of 12 : 25 for his pilot , who in turn passed it to Meloy to schedule the live radio broadcast . At noon the B @-@ 17s encountered an area of " scattered rain squalls , " spreading into a line abreast formation with the aircraft 15 nautical miles ( 28 km ) apart to increase their chances of spotting the Rex . 
 At 12 : 23 , the bombers broke out of a squall line , and Cousland in No. 81 immediately sighted the Rex . " There it is ! There it is ! " he transmitted by radio to the other pilots , " 81 to 80 , twelve o 'clock . " At 12 : 25 , as predicted , the B @-@ 17s flew by the Rex while it was 620 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) east of Sandy Hook . The aircraft reversed course and came up the ship 's port side , with No. 82 flying wing on No. 80 " at smoke stack level " . From the co @-@ pilot 's seat of No. 81 , Goddard took a series of photographs with the Graflex . In the waist position of No. 80 , Meloy made voice contact by radio with the ship 's captain , who invited " all members of the flight to come down to lunch . " The ship 's passengers filled its decks , waving to the bombers , with a group of Americans purportedly singing the Star Spangled Banner . 
 Because of the bad weather , the B @-@ 17s returned individually to Mitchel Field . Cousland 's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail , damaging all the forward surfaces of the plane , and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine . As a result , Cousland lagged behind the others , landing at 16 : 30 . The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing the Statue of Liberty at 09 : 30 as it entered New York Harbor . 
 The NBC radio crew aboard the lead bomber made its live broadcast coast @-@ to @-@ coast as the bombers flew by the Rex . The Army 's low @-@ altitude photographs were featured the next day on the front pages of hundreds of newspapers . Eaker exploited a trust of Americans in radio broadcasts and in photography , particular to that era , to bolster the credibility of Air Corps claims that air power was essential in defending the western hemisphere . In addition to the Rex episode , the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well @-@ publicized mock attack on New York City , and arranged the first voluntary blackout in the United States , also planned by Eaker , during a mock raid on Farmingdale , New York , on 16 May . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Impact = = = 
 The response of the War Department was to curb further expansion of the Air Corps and its roles . On 16 May , the day of the " Farmingdale raid , " the Army 's deputy chief of staff , Maj. Gen. Stanley Embick , approved a request from Air Corps chief Maj. Gen. Oscar Westover to substitute a single Boeing <unk> @-@ 20 ( an advanced design of the Boeing B @-@ 15 ) for two B @-@ 15s ordered for Project A , the development program for the very long range bomber . On 9 June , however , Secretary of War Harry Woodring countermanded the approval , which he had endorsed only three weeks before . On 3 August , the Army went on to cancel orders for 67 more B @-@ 17s authorized under a " balanced " plan Woodring himself had put forth in March , instead allocating the funds to buy smaller combat aircraft , and forbade any further spending for R & D of long @-@ range bombers . 
 It was not until January 1939 , when U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a public statement calling for an expansion of the Air Corps in anticipation of the coming of World War II and the needs of the United States in defending the Western Hemisphere , that Army policy was reversed . Gen. George C. Marshall , who was soon to move up from head of the War Plans Division to be the Army 's chief of staff , received personal instruction on the capabilities and strengths of long @-@ range bombers from new Air Corps chief Gen. Henry H. Arnold . 
 = = = Operational restriction = = = 
 The day after the rendezvous with the Rex , Chief of Staff General Malin Craig telephoned Andrews and issued an order that restricted all Air Corps aircraft to operating within 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) of the coast . Arnold , Eaker , Olds , and Lt. Col. Carl Spaatz all believed that complaints from the Navy motivated the order . Spaatz , who personally answered the call , recorded that Andrews requested the order be issued in writing , but Arnold states he never saw a written order . 
 Two Air Corps historians state that no evidence exists that the Navy was behind the order . One explained that Craig believed the Air Corps violated War Department policy on publicity , while the second asserted that Craig was unhappy about not being provided details of the mission before it was publicly announced , and thus issued the order to ensure full notification before granting exceptions to the restriction . Deputy chief of staff Embick made the claim that the restriction had been issued only as a safety measure . Greer , however , in his history of Air Corps doctrine , firmly attributes the restriction to the Navy , noting that in November 1938 it achieved a new modification of the Joint Action statement specifically granting it the authorization for long @-@ range land @-@ based flights that the Army was denied , and immediately prepared six major bases to conduct them . A fourth historian , in a biography of Arnold , stated that the restriction had actually been promulgated on 1 September 1936 , at the insistence of the Navy , but was not enforced by Craig until after the Rex incident . 
 In any event , the restriction fomented further interservice enmity between the Air Corps and the Navy that did not abate until World War II . The Navy specifically included the 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) limit in plans for joint maneuvers in 1939 that was deleted only after Andrews objected to Marshall , who had replaced Embick as deputy chief of staff . Emmons , who succeeded Andrews as commander of GHQ Air Force , complained in his " Report on Annual Tactical Inspection " , dated 28 July 1939 , that because of the operational restriction , navigation training in the Air Corps had suffered . 
 Despite this , exceptions to the restriction quickly became the norm . Only a month after the interception of the Rex , B @-@ 17s intercepted the 22 @,@ 000 @-@ ton liner SS Queen of Bermuda 300 nautical miles ( 560 km ) at sea on 12 June , and aircraft based in Hawaii twice located Army transports at similar distances during the summer of 1938 . In March 1939 , Arnold , as Chief of the Air Corps , was given specific authority by the chief of staff to grant exceptions as he saw fit , provided they were unpublicized and he notified the War Department well in advance . 
 = = = Subsequent history of the participants = = = 
 Andrews was not reappointed as commander of General Headquarters Air Force when his term expired on 1 March 1939 . Exactly as happened with Billy Mitchell , he was returned in rank to colonel ( his permanent establishment rank ) and assigned as air officer of the Eighth Corps Area in San Antonio , Texas . His " exile " in San Antonio was brief , however . In August , prospective Army Chief of Staff Marshall had Andrews promoted over the objections of Secretary Woodring and General Craig , beginning a climb to higher command for Andrews that culminated in promotion to lieutenant general and appointment as commander of the European Theater of Operations . Many senior airmen believed he was possibly being groomed to command the Normandy invasion . However , Andrews was killed in the crash of a B @-@ 24 Liberator long @-@ range bomber in Iceland in May 1943 while returning to Washington , D.C. 
 Capt. Archibald Y. Smith was promoted to colonel during World War II , commanded the <unk> Bomb Group ( B @-@ 17 ) in the U.K. , and became a prisoner of war in July 1944 . Continuing his career after the war in the United States Air Force , he died in the crash of his B @-@ 26 in Oregon in April 1949 . Cousland also became a colonel and commanded the first B @-@ 17 group in England , the 97th BG , although he was relieved of command by Col. Frank A. Armstrong just before it was to go into combat . Cousland finished the war commanding the 21st Bombardment Wing , a processing unit for personnel returning from overseas . 
 Seven of the participants became general officers . Hull was recalled to active duty to be an intelligence officer in World War II , then remained in the Air Force as a career . He retired as a brigadier general in 1964 . Meloy served as a brigadier general in the Air Transport Command and retired in 1946 . Goddard was recognized as the principal aerial photography expert of the USAF and retired in 1953 as a brigadier general . Caleb V. Haynes and his crew won the MacKay Trophy in 1939 flying an earthquake relief mission to Chile in the XB @-@ 15 , and delivered the first B @-@ 24 Liberator overseas in early 1942 . Assigned initially to the Tenth Air Force , he was the first commander of the Assam @-@ Burma @-@ China Ferry Command , the airlift operation flying supplies over the Hump to China . Haynes went on to command the bombers of the China Air Task Force under Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault , became a brigadier general , commanded the India Air Task Force , and retired from the USAF as a major general in 1953 . 
 Olds ( whose son , Brig. Gen. Robin Olds , became a fighter pilot icon ) , was promoted to major general and commanded the Second Air Force , but died of a heart @-@ related condition in April 1943 at the age of 46 . 
 Eaker and LeMay had important roles as commanders in the strategic bombing campaigns of World War II . Eaker took command of the Eighth Air Force in 1942 , and the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces in 1944 . He retired in 1947 as a lieutenant general , but was promoted on the retired list to 4 @-@ star general in 1985 in recognition of his accomplishments . In the autumn of 1942 , LeMay led the 305th Bomb Group , one of the four " pioneer " B @-@ 17 groups of the Eighth Air Force . He advanced to higher commands in the Eighth Air Force before holding a series of B @-@ 29 Superfortress commands in the Pacific in 1944 – 45 , culminating in command of the Twentieth Air Force . LeMay commanded and reorganized the Strategic Air Command into an instrument of national policy and became the fifth Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force in 1961 . 
 Laid up in Trieste harbor , Italy , by the war , the Rex was seized by Nazi Germany when Italy surrendered in 1943 . On September 8 , 1944 , she was attacked twice by Royal Air Force and South African Air Force Beaufighters . She was set on fire , then rolled over and sank after being struck by numerous rockets and cannon shells . The purpose of the attack was to prevent her from being used to block the harbor entrance . The wreck was partially scrapped in the 1950s , but around one @-@ third of it still remains . 
 The YB @-@ 17s quickly became obsolete and were transferred in October 1940 to the 19th Bomb Group at March Field , California , when the 2d BG acquired newer models . During World War II they operated again at Langley Field until mid @-@ 1942 . The Air Corps belatedly put the B @-@ 17 into mass production beginning in July 1940 , but at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor still had only 198 in service . However , 12 @,@ 000 were produced during the war , became the backbone of the air war against Germany , and were an iconic symbol of the AAF . 
 The 2nd Bomb Group received newer B @-@ 17s and served in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with both the Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces . GHQ Air Force assumed its designated wartime role in November 1940 , was renamed Air Force Combat Command in June 1941 , but went out of existence in March 1942 in a major reorganization of the United States Army Air Forces .

 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate the death of a federal construction worker and the destruction of various property that can only be tied to an escaped elephant . Unfortunately , the only witnesses claim to have seen no animals which might have caused the turmoil . Soon , Mulder and Scully discover the local zoo whose claim to fame is that they 've never had a successful animal birth .

 = = Plot = = 
 In Fairfield , Idaho , two janitors witness an invisible force storm down a city street ; a road worker is later killed by the force on the highway . The next day , an elephant suddenly materializes in front of an oncoming big rig . The driver manages to stop in time , but the elephant soon collapses and dies , over forty miles away from where it disappeared the night before at the Fairfield Zoo . 
 Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) survey the damage in the city , which appears to have been caused by an elephant even though none was seen . Ed Meecham , an animal handler at the zoo , recounts how he came to the elephant 's locked cage to find it empty . His boss , Willa Ambrose , tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances . She blames the zoo 's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals . The group 's leader , Kyle Lang , denies any involvement in the elephant 's release . Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she took from their country ten years prior . 
 Mulder contacts Frohike and Byers , who say that Fairfield is known for its animal disappearances and UFO sightings . They also mention Ambrose 's gorilla , who is known to communicate using American Sign Language . Meanwhile , Scully follows one of Lang 's activists as he sneaks into the zoo , running into Meecham inside . The activist attempts to free a tiger , but after a flash of light , the tiger seemingly disappears . The activist is promptly mauled to death , with the killing captured on his night vision camera . When questioned , Lang denies any responsibility for the death . Ambrose introduces the agents to the gorilla , Sophie , who has been cowering in her cage and expresses an apparent fear of light . 
 Scully performs a necropsy on the elephant , revealing it to be pregnant — which is impossible , since no animal at the zoo has ever brought a pregnancy to term . The tiger reappears at a Boise construction site , and is shot dead by Meecham when it charges at Ambrose ; the zoo is shut down the next day over the incident . Mulder tells Ambrose that the tiger was also pregnant , and explains his theory that extraterrestrial aliens are impregnating endangered animals as part of " their own Noah 's Ark . " Mulder thinks that Sophie is pregnant and afraid of her baby 's abduction . Sophie confirms Mulder 's suspicions when she makes signs for " baby go flying light " . 
 Sheriff 's deputies order Ambrose to release Sophie into protective custody , presumably to be sent back to Malawi . Ambrose unsuccessfully seeks help from Lang , her former boyfriend , but he advises to let Sophie return to the wild . Lang later goes to see Ambrose at the warehouse where Sophie is being prepped for shipping , but finds her cage empty . He is then mysteriously killed by a falling crate . Scully finds that Lang was struck with a cattle prod and suspects Ambrose of killing him , but she claims that Meecham is responsible . Mulder goes to arrest Meecham , who is keeping an angered Sophie at another warehouse near Boise . Meecham suddenly locks Mulder in Sophie 's room , where the enraged gorilla attacks and injures him . 
 A bright light appears and causes Sophie to vanish , but not before she gives Mulder a final message in sign language . When Mulder gives the message to Ambrose the next day , she says it means " man save man . " Ambrose and the agents are then called to the highway , where Sophie has been struck by a car and killed . Ambrose and Meecham are charged with manslaughter for Lang 's death . As the agents leave Idaho , Mulder says through narration that he believes alien conservationists were behind the events in Fairfield .
