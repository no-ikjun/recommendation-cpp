 While on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the park in 1850 , brothers Elijah and Clemuel Ricketts were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel 's parlor floor . In 1851 or 1853 they bought 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 000 ha ) , including what is now Lake Ganoga and some of the park , as their own hunting preserve , and built a stone house on the lake shore by 1852 or 1855 . The stone house served as their lodge and as a tavern ; it was known as " Ricketts Folly " for its isolated location in the wilderness . Clemuel died in 1858 and Elijah bought his share of the land and house . The Ricketts family was not aware of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865 , when they were discovered by two guests from the stone house who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek . 
 Elijah 's son Robert Bruce Ricketts , for whom the park is named , joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery . After the war , R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land around the lake from his father . By 1873 he controlled or owned 66 @,@ 000 acres ( 27 @,@ 000 ha ) , and eventually this grew to more than 80 @,@ 000 acres ( 32 @,@ 000 ha ) , including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park . 
 While the stone house had served as a home and inn since its construction , in 1872 R. Bruce Ricketts built a three @-@ story wooden addition north of the house . The addition used lumber from a sawmill Ricketts and his partners operated from 1872 to 1875 , about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) southeast of the stone house . The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873 ; Ricketts ' brother Frank , for whom a waterfall is named , managed it from then until 1898 . Many of the hotel 's guests were Ricketts ' friends and relations , who arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September . In 1876 and 1877 , Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel ; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock , later known as the " Father of Forestry " in Pennsylvania . 
 The waterfalls and Ganoga Lake were the hotel 's biggest attractions . By 1875 Ricketts had named the tallest waterfall Ganoga Falls ; he eventually named 22 of the waterfalls . Ricketts gave most of them Native American names , and named others for relatives and friends . Ricketts renamed Long Pond as Ganoga Lake in 1881 . The name Ganoga was suggested by Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew ; it is an Iroquoian word which Buckalew said meant " water on the mountain " in the Seneca language . Donehoo 's A History of the Indian Villages and Place Names in Pennsylvania identifies it as a Cayuga language word meaning " place of floating oil " and the name of a Cayuga village in New York . Whatever the meaning , Ricketts also named the glen with the tallest waterfall in the park " Ganoga " . 
 Ricketts ' stone house served as the base for the Ozone hiking club of Wilkes @-@ Barre 's excursions on the mountain ; the club gave its name to Ozone waterfall in the park . In 1879 Ricketts started the North Mountain Fishing Club , for anglers on the lake and creek . Guests of the hotel paid one dollar to fish as a club member . In 1889 Ricketts hired Matt <unk> and five other men to build the trails along the branches of Kitchen Creek and its waterfalls . It took them four years to complete the trails and stone steps through the glens . 
 One of the highest spots on North Mountain ( and in the park today ) was an outlook point where Ricketts built a 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) wooden observation tower for his guests . After the first tower collapsed , he built a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) replacement , and named the site Grand View . From the tower , people could see for 20 miles ( 32 km ) . 
 = = = Lumber era = = = 
 For over 20 years , Ricketts was " land poor " ; he owed much on the mortgages on his vast land holdings , and there were no good means to transport the estimated 1 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 board feet ( 3 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 m3 ) of lumber from most of his land to sawmills . Large @-@ scale lumber operations of that time floated logs on major streams or used logging railroads , but neither was available to Ricketts . His small sawmill near the stone house closed by 1875 , and he was only able to sell two major tracts of land in his lifetime . In 1872 he sold 14 @,@ 000 acres ( 5 @,@ 700 ha ) north of the park to a group of investors that included himself ; this deal seems to have been for shares of stock ( not cash ) , and the deed for the sale was not recorded until 1893 . Ricketts sold 13 @,@ 000 acres ( 5 @,@ 300 ha ) along Bowman Creek , including the easternmost parts of the park , to Albert Lewis in 1876 ; Lewis hoped to build a branch line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad along the creek . In the 1870s and 1880s , Ricketts tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to find partners and investors who would help him cut the lumber on his land and build a rail line to it . 
 Finally in 1890 , Harry Clay Trexler , J.H. Turrell , Ricketts , and partners formed the Trexler and Turrell Lumber Company and leased 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 000 ha ) of Ricketts ' land near Ganoga Lake . The company built a sawmill and lumber town named Ricketts on <unk> Creek . The town , which was in both Sullivan and Wyoming counties , had 800 inhabitants at its peak and extended into the northernmost section of the park . Rail lines were built to the mills at Ricketts , including the Bowman Creek branch of the Lehigh Valley Railroad which opened in 1883 , and also provided passenger service to the hotel on Lake Ganoga . According to Petrillo 's Ghost Towns of North Mountain : Ricketts , Mountain Springs , Stull : " Ricketts was on the verge of financial disaster for two decades until the Lehigh Valley Railroad was constructed through his lands . " 
 Trexler and Turrell paid Ricketts $ 50 @,@ 000 in both 1890 and 1891 , and continued to cut his land and pay him for the timber until 1913 . By 1911 , the main sawmill at Ricketts could cut 125 @,@ 000 board feet ( 290 m3 ) a day and was supported by three locomotives with 62 cars on 22 miles ( 35 km ) of track . Within the park , the area around what became Lake Jean was cut in the 1890s , and Cherry Ridge ( east of Red Rock Job Corps Center ) and land around Lake Leigh were the last areas cut by the Ricketts mill . Timber in the east part of the park and along Bowman Creek was cut by Lewis ' company , which also used logging railroads and even ran track down the Allegheny Front at Phillips Creek . Lewis ' firm built a splash dam on Bowman Creek to help float logs downstream in 1891 , then used the lake to cut ice for refrigeration . A second dam and lake were added in 1909 and the icehouses were on state park land ; the ice industry supported the small village and post office of Mountain Springs . Ricketts ran his own ice cutting business on Ganoga Lake from 1895 to about 1915 . 
 Within a decade of the railroad reaching his lands , Ricketts was out of the hotel business . The North Mountain House hotel was threatened by a forest fire in 1900 ; the subsequent loss of much of the surrounding old @-@ growth forest led to decreased numbers of hotel guests . Changing tastes may have also played a role in the decline in popularity ; the hotel had over 150 guests in August 1878 , but only about 70 guests in August 1894 . The wooden addition was torn down in 1897 or 1903 , and " despite profits , Ricketts became disenchanted with the hotel business and closed his hotel in 1903 " , though the stone house remained the Ricketts family 's summer home . Passenger rail service to Ganoga Lake ended when the hotel closed ; the fishing club closed that year as well , but was re @-@ formed in 1907 . In 1903 another large fire on North Mountain threatened the sawmill in the lumber town of Ricketts . 
 Not all of Ricketts ' plans were financially successful ; between 1905 and 1907 he built three dams to generate hydroelectric power within what became the park , forming Lake Leigh at the site of Sickler 's mill , Lake Rose at the site of Dodson 's mill , and Lake Jean ( which incorporated the natural Mud Pond ) north of these . Lakes Leigh and Jean were named for Ricketts ' daughters , while Rose was a Ricketts family name . The Lake Leigh dam was made of concrete and cost $ 165 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 4 @,@ 190 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) , while the other two dams were log cribs filled with earth and cost a total of $ 300 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 7 @,@ 619 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . If the project had been successful , the plan was to rebuild the two log and timber dams in concrete , however , the " dams were poorly constructed and could not be used for hydroelectric purposes " . After the Panic of 1907 , Ricketts wife told him to stop the hydroelectric project before he lost all of their money ; this prompted him to say " I used to be land poor , but now I 'm dam poor " .

 In 1913 , Ricketts opened the glens and their waterfalls to the public , charging $ 1 for parking . Although this fee was unpopular , it remained in place until the land became a state park . After Ricketts died in 1918 , the Pennsylvania Game Commission bought 48 @,@ 000 acres ( 19 @,@ 000 ha ) from his heirs , via the Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company , between 1920 and 1924 . This became most of Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13 , west of the park in Sullivan County . These sales left the Ricketts heirs with over 12 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 900 ha ) surrounding Ganoga Lake , Lake Jean and the glens area of the park . An area encompassing 22 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 @,@ 900 ha ) was approved as a national park site in 1935 , and the National Park Service operated a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at " Ricketts Glynn " ( sic ) . The funding to create a National Park at Ricketts Glen was " sidetracked " in 1936 when the money was redirected to the Resettlement Administration for " direct relief " . Similar projects at French Creek , Raccoon Creek , Laurel Hill , Blue Knob , and Hickory Run were also defunded ( all are now Pennsylvania state parks ) . The financial difficulties of the Great Depression and World War II brought an end to this plan for development . 
 Arthur James , the Governor of Pennsylvania , signed legislation creating Ricketts Glen State Park on August 1 , 1941 . The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania bought 1 @,@ 261 acres ( 510 ha ) , including the glens and their waterfalls , from the heirs for $ 82 @,@ 000 on December 31 , 1942 . The new state park opened to the public on August 1 , 1943 ; however , the park 's official history says " recreational facilities first opened in 1944 " . The state bought a total of 16 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 500 ha ) more from the heirs in 1945 and 1950 for $ 68 @,@ 000 ; the park today has about 10 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 000 ha ) from the Ricketts family and about 3 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 ha ) acquired from others . 
 The state 's original plans for the new park included building an inn , an 18 @-@ hole golf course and country club , and a winter sports complex for skiing , ice boating , and tobogganing , as well as a beach with bathing facilities , cabins , and a tent camping area . Only the last three were actually built , all south of Lake Jean ; the Hayfield area north of Lake Jean was to have had the facilities for golf and tennis , and the inn and winter sports complex were to have been atop Cherry Ridge , at an elevation of 2 @,@ 461 feet ( 750 m ) . 
 A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50 @,@ 000 visitors that year , and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land . The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt , all the stone steps were replaced , and signs were added . Out of concern for greater safety , footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs , overhanging rock ledges were removed in places , and the trail was rerouted near some falls . In the southern end of the new park , the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls , as well as a new parking area for 200 cars and a concession stand , both along Pennsylvania Route 118 ( PA 118 ) . 
 The state made other improvements in the park , including replacing or removing all of Ricketts ' dams . At Lake Jean it built an earthen dam in 1949 – 1950 to replace Ricketts ' 1905 timber dam ; the new dam increased the size of Lake Jean to 245 acres ( 99 ha ) and its eastern end now included the former Mud Pond . On April 20 , 1958 , the 1907 concrete dam at Lake Leigh developed a hole , causing Pennsylvania State Police to evacuate close to 2 @,@ 000 people from the park . Engineers from the state inspected the dam and made a second breach in the dam near ground level , draining the lake . The resulting flow of water destroyed some of the hiking paths in Glen Leigh and the fish stocked in the lake wound up in Kitchen Creek . The Lake Jean dam was repaired in 1956 . The last of Ricketts ' dams , at Lake Rose , was breached in 1959 after remnants of a hurricane filled the lake to capacity . The rest of the 1905 dam was removed in 1969 . At Grand View the state built a wooden fire tower at the site of Ricketts ' earlier observation tower , then replaced it with a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) steel tower . The tower is usually closed to the public , but may be visited if it is staffed by a forest fire warden . From the tower , three states and eleven Pennsylvania counties can be seen . 
 Ricketts Glen State Park was the site of a Cold War era radar station . The Benton Air Force Station in the north of the park at what is now the Red Rock Job Corps Center was constructed during 1950 and 1951 . Part of the 648th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron based at Fort Indiantown Gap , the radar station was a " frontline defender of national security " . About 300 airmen served at the radar station during the height of the Cold War . Barracks were constructed and recreational facilities for the airmen were provided . In 1963 the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) began jointly operating the radar station ; the 648th Squadron was inactivated in 1975 and the Job Corps center was established in 1978 , using the barracks and recreational facilities as the Red Rock Job Corps Center . As of 2010 , the radar dome is still fully functional and is used by the FAA as an auxiliary radar to the tower at Wilkes @-@ Barre / Scranton International Airport . 
 On October 12 , 1969 , the Glens Natural Area and its waterfalls was named a National Natural Landmark , and it became a Pennsylvania State Park Natural Area in 1993 , which guarantees it " will be protected and maintained in a natural state " . In 1987 the park 's ten cabins opened . In 1997 the park was named one of the first 73 Important Bird Areas in the state by the Pennsylvania chapter of the National Audubon Society . That same year heavy rains washed out two bridges on the Falls Trail ; because of the difficulty of transporting materials on the trail , an Army National Guard helicopter dropped 36 @-@ foot ( 11 m ) poles into the glens to rebuild the bridges in early 1997 . In the winter of 1997 ice climbing was allowed in the Ganoga Glen section of the park for the first time . That same year training was undertaken by local fire companies to rescue people injured in the park when icy conditions make reaching and transporting them especially treacherous . In 1998 a project to " repair and improve the Falls Trail " began , with three park employees carrying materials in on foot to stabilize the trail , fix steps , cut down on erosion , and repair some bridges . Originally planned to take four years ; it ended up taking six years to complete and cost nearly $ 1 million . 
 In September 1999 the remnants of Hurricane Floyd caused massive damage to the park , temporarily closing it and downing thousands of trees . The DCNR hired Carson Helicopters to salvage timber from the downed beech , cherry , maple , and oak trees for $ 994 @,@ 000 ; a crew of 36 workers spent several months cutting the fallen trees into manageable logs , then helicopters flew the logs to the Hayfield area of the park . The salvage operation ran until the fall of 2001 , and yielded 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 board feet ( 8 @,@ 300 m3 ) of lumber . The operation had revenue of almost $ 7 million , and had the ecological advantage of not requiring heavy logging equipment or new roads in the park . 
 Some of the money from the helicopter logging operation was used for park improvements , including a new $ 1 @.@ 7 million visitor center and park office , which opened in December 2001 . In 2002 the park had " up to a half @-@ million visitors each year " . Beginning in 2003 the campsites in the park , by then over 50 years old , were refurbished . In 2004 the park and surrounding Pennsylvania State Game Lands were named an Important Mammal Area , and in July the park was featured as a day trip in the Travel section of The New York Times . On June 28 , 2006 a 100 @-@ year flood caused widespread damage in the park , washing out many of the recently completed improvements to the hiking trails along Kitchen Creek . In 2007 the park was one of the first ten parks to be featured in the Pennsylvania Cable Network 's series on the state 's park system . The DCNR has named Ricketts Glen one of " 25 Must @-@ See Pennsylvania State Parks " , citing its old @-@ growth forest and many waterfalls and its status as a National Natural Landmark . 
 = = Geology and climate = = 
 Ricketts Glen State Park covers two different physiographic provinces : the Allegheny Plateau in the north , and the Ridge @-@ and @-@ Valley Appalachians in the south . The boundary between these is a steep escarpment known as the Allegheny Front , which rises up to 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) above the land to the south . Within the park , Kitchen Creek has its headwaters on the dissected plateau , then drops approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) down the Allegheny Front in 2 @.@ 25 miles ( 3 @.@ 62 km ) . Much of this drop occurs in Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen , two narrow valleys carved by branches of Kitchen Creek , which come together at Waters Meet . Ricketts Glen lies south of and downstream from Waters Meet , and here the terrain becomes less steep . There are 24 named waterfalls in the three glens . 
 The rocks exposed in the park were formed in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370 and 340 million years ago , when the land was part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America . The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded , causing a build @-@ up of sediment made up primarily of clay , sand and gravel . Tremendous pressure caused the formation of the sedimentary rocks that are found in the park and in the Kitchen Creek drainage basin : sandstone , shale , siltstone , and conglomerates . 
 There are four distinct rock formations within Ricketts Glen State Park . The most recent and highest of these is the late Mississippian Mauch Chunk Formation , composed of " grayish @-@ red shale , siltstone , sandstone , and some conglomerate " . This forms the highest points on the Allegheny Plateau and is found north of Lake Jean , forming the land beneath the Red Rocks Job Corps Center and Cherry Ridge to the east . The next formation below this is the Mississippian Pocono Formation , which is buff or gray sandstone with conglomerate and siltstone inclusions . This forms most of the Allegheny Plateau and underlies the park office , Lake Jean and the former Lakes Rose and Leigh . The boulders of the Midway Crevasse , which the Highland Trail passes through , are Pocono Formation sandstone . 
 The third of the rock formations within the park is the Huntley Mountain Formation , from the late Devonian and early Mississippian . This is made of layers of olive green to gray sandstone and gray to red shale . The Huntley Mountain Formation is relatively hard and erosion resistant . It caps the Allegheny Front and has kept it from eroding as much as the softer Catskill Formation , to the south . The Catskill Formation is the lowest and oldest layer in the park , and is composed of red shale and siltstone up to 370 million years old . The Allegheny Front within the park is named North Mountain and Red Rock Mountain , with the latter name coming from an exposed band of Huntley Formation red shale and sandstone visible along Pennsylvania Route 487 ( PA 487 ) . 
 Geologists and the official Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types . Wedding @-@ cake falls descend in a series of small steps . Within the park , this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone . In bridal @-@ veil falls , the second type , water falls over a ledge and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below . Within the park , this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation . In the park , the harder caprock which forms the ledge from which the bridal @-@ veil falls drops is gray sandstone . The softer red shale below is eroded away by water , sand and gravel to form the plunge pool . Brown 's book Pennsylvania waterfalls : a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls : falls , cascade , slide , and chute . 
 About 300 to 250 million years ago , the Allegheny Plateau , Allegheny Front , and Appalachian Mountains all formed in the Alleghenian orogeny . This happened long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited , when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America , forming Pangaea . In the years since , up to 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather . At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today . 
 The effects of glaciation have made Kitchen Creek within the park " unique compared to all other nearby streams that flow down the Allegheny Front " , as it is the only one with an " almost continuous series of waterfalls " . Before the last ice age , Kitchen Creek had a much smaller drainage basin ; during the ice age , glaciers covered all of the park except the Grand View outcrop . About 20 @,@ 000 years ago the glaciers retreated to the northeast and glacial lakes formed . Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a <unk> , or channel , that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek . Glacial deposits of debris 20 to 30 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 to 9 @.@ 1 m ) thick formed a dam blocking water from Ganoga Lake and what became Lake Jean from draining into Big Run , a tributary of Fishing Creek . The water was instead diverted into the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek . 
 These diversions added about 7 square miles ( 18 km2 ) to the Kitchen Creek drainage basin , increasing it by just over 50 percent . The result was increased water flow in Kitchen Creek , which has been cutting the falls in the glens since . The gradient or slope of Kitchen Creek was fairly stable for its flow when it had a much smaller drainage basin , as Phillips Creek to the east still does . Kitchen Creek is now too steep for its present amount of water flow , and over time erosion will decrease the creek 's slope and make it less steep . There are rocks with glacial striations visible within the park . 
 According to the United States Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System , Ricketts Glen State Park is at an elevation of 2 @,@ 198 feet ( 670 m ) . The two highest points in the park are Cherry Ridge , made of Mauch Chunk Formation rock , at 2 @,@ 461 feet ( 750 m ) , and the Grand View outcrop of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone , at 2 @,@ 444 feet ( 745 m ) . The highest elevation waterfall in the park is Mohawk Falls in Ganoga Glen at 2 @,@ 165 feet ( 660 m ) ; the lowest elevation waterfall is Adams Falls , in Ricketts Glen just south of PA 118 , at 1 @,@ 214 feet ( 370 m ) .

 Ricketts Glen State Park is on the Allegheny Plateau , which has a continental climate with occasional severe low temperatures in winter and average daily temperature ranges ( the difference between the daily high and low ) of 20 ° F ( 11 ° C ) in winter and 26 ° F ( 14 ° C ) in summer . The park is in the Huntington Creek watershed , where the mean annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches ( 1016 to 1219 mm ) . Weather records for Ricketts Glen State Park show that the highest recorded temperature at the park was 103 ° F ( 39 ° C ) in 1988 , and the record low was − 17 ° F ( − 27 ° C ) in 1984 . On average , January is the coldest month , July is the hottest month , and June is the wettest month .

 It has been estimated that before the arrival of William Penn and his Quaker colonists in 1682 , up to 90 percent of what is now Pennsylvania was covered with woods : over 31 @,@ 000 square miles ( 80 @,@ 000 km2 ) of eastern white pine , eastern hemlock , and a mix of hardwoods . By 1890 , Ricketts ' land was the largest tract of old @-@ growth forest remaining in the state , and though he made his fortune clearcutting nearly all his land , the forests in the glens of Ricketts Glen State Park were " saved from the lumberman 's axe through the foresight of the Ricketts family " . The rough terrain of the glens made it difficult to harvest timber from the area . Many of the old @-@ growth trees are believed to be over 500 years old , and ring counts on fallen trees have revealed ages of over 900 years . 
 The forests in and around Ricketts Glen State Park are some of the most extensive in northeastern Pennsylvania , and provide habitat for a wide variety of woodland creatures . The swampy areas in the park provide a habitat for plants like black gum , yellow birch , cinnamon fern , sphagnum and various sedges . The old @-@ growth forest in the Glens Natural Area is mostly eastern hemlock , eastern white pine , and oaks , and the park is home to 85 species of shrubs , woody vines , and trees , including seven kinds of conifers . 
 The streams and lakes of Ricketts are fisheries for many fish species , although fishing is prohibited in the glens area . In 2009 , 4 @.@ 15 miles ( 6 @.@ 68 km ) of Kitchen Creek downstream from Waters Meet and all of Phillips Creek were classified as Class A Wild Trout Waters , defined by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as " streams which support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long @-@ term and rewarding sport fishery " . 
 Lake Jean is home to brook trout , brown trout , brown bullhead , and yellow bullhead . Acid rain with a pH near 3 @.@ 0 has altered the ecology of the lakes and region ; in Lake Jean low pH has decreased the number and quality of insects and plankton at the base of the food chain . Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant , including fathead minnows , muskellunge , pumpkinseed , walleye , and yellow perch . Predators like chain pickerel and largemouth bass are relatively few in number , and adult fish appear to grow rapidly but breed comparatively poorly . Since 1996 , the DCNR has added 11 short tons ( 10 @.@ 0 t ) of powdered lime to the lake each year to make the pH more neutral . 
 = = = Glens Natural Area = = = 
 A registered National Natural Landmark since 1969 , the Glens Natural Area is the main scenic attraction in the park and covers 2 @,@ 845 acres ( 1 @,@ 151 ha ) . Among perhaps 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) of old @-@ growth forest , two branches of Kitchen Creek cut through the deep gorges of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh and unite at Waters Meet ; then flow through Ricketts Glen . These old trees are commonly up to 100 feet ( 30 m ) tall , with diameters of almost 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) . The park has a great variety of trees as it lies at the boundary between the northern and southern types of hardwoods . In 1993 , the state designated the Glens Natural Area a State Park Natural Area , which means that it " will be protected and maintained in a natural state " . No buildings or latrines are allowed in the natural area , and the bridges in it are built with wood , not steel or concrete . 
 A series of trails parallels the branches of Kitchen Creek as they course down the Glens . Glen Leigh features eight named waterfalls and is south of the former Lake Leigh . Ganoga Glen is southeast of the former Lake Rose and has ten named falls , including the 94 @-@ foot ( 29 m ) Ganoga Falls , the tallest in the park . The DCNR recognizes three named waterfalls in Ricketts Glen just south of Waters Meet , plus Adams Falls 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) farther downstream at PA 118 . Adams Falls , the southernmost and one of the most scenic in the park , is about 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 160 m ) south of PA 118 , via an easy stroll along a trail from the parking lot . 
 Brown 's Pennsylvania waterfalls : a guide for hikers and photographers recognizes these 22 named falls plus two more in the park . One is on Shingle Cabin Brook as it enters Kitchen Creek just south of Waters Meet ; the other , Kitchen Creek Falls , is directly below the PA 118 highway bridge , which obscures much of the view . There are also several unnamed falls in the park , such as a good @-@ sized unnamed waterfall on a tributary of the Ganoga Glen branch of Kitchen Creek , or the " forgotten falls " on the South Branch Bowman Creek . 
 The Falls Trail includes the trails through the glens , plus the 1 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) Highland Trail , which connects the top ends of Ganoga Glen and Glen Leigh to form a 3 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 1 km ) triangular loop , and passes through the " Midway Crevasse , " a crack in Pocono Formation rock . All but two of the named waterfalls are either on the triangular loop or 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) south of it . Hiking the entire Glens area on the Falls Trail loop , beginning and ending at PA 118 , covers 7 @.@ 2 miles ( 11 @.@ 6 km ) . A shorter hike involves parking at Lake Rose , near the junction of Ganoga Glen and the Highland Trail . 
 = = = Mammals = = = 
 Ricketts Glen State Park was named part of an Important Mammal Area because it " support [ s ] critical habitat for a wide range of mammals " ; Pennsylvania has 64 wild mammal species . The park has an extensive forest cover of hemlock @-@ filled valleys and hardwood @-@ covered mountains , which makes it a habitat for big woods wildlife . Animals such as white @-@ tailed deer , black bear , red and gray squirrels , porcupine , and raccoon are seen fairly regularly . Less common creatures include beaver , bobcat , coyote , fisher , mink , muskrat , red fox , and river otter . In addition to mammals , Ricketts Glen is also known for its wild turkeys , wild flowers , butterflies , dragonflies , and the occasional timber rattlesnake . 
 White @-@ tailed deer became locally extinct on Ricketts ' land by 1912 , mirroring the sharp decline in Pennsylvania 's deer population from overhunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The state imported nearly 1 @,@ 200 white @-@ tailed deer from Michigan between 1906 and 1925 to re @-@ establish the species throughout Pennsylvania , and Ricketts brought deer to the area of the park in 1914 . Pennsylvania 's deer population rebounded from roughly one thousand in 1905 to roughly one million in 1928 . Deer are now one of the most numerous mammals in the park , and their overbrowsing threatens development of trees and plants there . The deer eat most of the saplings and shrubs before they can reach their full size , which reduces the number of low lying plants many birds use for shelter . The white @-@ tailed deer became the official state animal in 1959 . By 2001 , deer populations had increased to the point where it was feared that " Pennsylvania is losing its vegetative diversity from deer over @-@ browsing " . 
 Other locally extinct mammals in Pennsylvania include bison , grey wolf , lynx , marten , moose , mountain lion , and wolverine . Beaver and river otter have been successfully reintroduced . In 1995 and 1996 , 39 fishers were released in the State Game Lands adjoining the park , and breeding populations appear to have been reestablished . The coyote seems to have come to the state in the 1930s . Black bear and wild turkey populations were also severely affected by overhunting and loss of habitat ; the recovery of their populations in the 20th century has been " aided by the re @-@ growth of the eastern deciduous forest " . Bears prefer a mixed forest of hickory and oak with an understory of shrubs such as blueberry and laurel ; they use patches of coniferous forest for cover during the winter months . 
 = = = Important Bird Area = = = 
 Pennsylvania Important Bird Area ( IBA ) # 48 , also known as the North Mountain IBA , encompasses 114 @,@ 978 acres ( 46 @,@ 530 ha ) , including all 13 @,@ 047 acres ( 5 @,@ 280 ha ) of the state park and Pennsylvania State Game Lands Numbers 13 , 57 , and 66 . The Pennsylvania Audubon Society designated the IBA , which is defined as a globally important habitat for the conservation of bird populations . Ricketts Glen State Park is featured in the Audubon Society 's Susquehanna River Birding and Wildlife Trail Guide . 
 Ornithologists and bird watchers have recorded a total of 75 species at Ricketts Glen State Park and within the IBA . Several factors contribute to the high total of bird species observed : there is a large area of forest in the park , as well as great habitat diversity . The location of the IBA along the Allegheny Front also contributes to the diverse bird populations . The IBA is said to be the " largest extant forest " in northeastern Pennsylvania and one of the largest forests in the state of Pennsylvania . The North Mountain IBA has officially been adopted by the North Branch Bird Club and is " well @-@ known " by members of the Greater Wyoming Valley Audubon , Valley Forge Audubon , and the Pennsylvania Society for Ornithology . 
 Ricketts Glen State Park provides a breeding habitat for four species of flycatchers and two species of waterthrushes . American bittern nest near the park . Bald eagle are frequent visitors to the park , and some ornithologists believe they may be nesting there since adult pairs have been observed with their young . The park is a nesting location for three " rare " birds , including two birds of prey ( the northern goshawk and northern harrier ) , and Swainson 's thrush , as well as one " at risk " duck , the green @-@ winged teal . 
 Ricketts Glen State Park has extensive acreage of " interior forest " that is far from open space ; several bird species that are area @-@ sensitive are found within these forests in the park , including the black @-@ throated green warbler , red @-@ eyed vireo , dark @-@ eyed junco and black @-@ capped chickadee . Two species of owl , barred and northern saw @-@ whet , inhabit the deep forests . The hemlock forests of the glens are home to the Louisiana waterthrush , Acadian flycatcher , Blackburnian warbler , blue @-@ headed vireo , magnolia warbler , brown creeper , golden @-@ crowned kinglet and winter wren . Wood thrush are found in the lower elevations of the park and are replaced within the ecosystem by hermit thrush at the higher elevations . The Canada warbler and black @-@ throated blue warbler are on several watchlists , but are common within the park . The Canada warbler inhabits blueberry thickets with white @-@ throated sparrow , while the black @-@ throated blue warbler is found in the forests atop the plateau with the least flycatcher . Common raven are regularly seen soaring over the forests of the park looking for carrion . Canada goose are present in the park and have been classified as a " pest " due to their high numbers and the large amount of fecal waste they leave on the shores of Lake Jean . Ricketts Glen 's forests also support populations of Nashville and yellow @-@ rumped warblers , yellow @-@ bellied <unk> , red @-@ breasted nuthatch , and purple finch .

 Ricketts Glen State Park has 10 modern cabins that are available to rent on a year @-@ round basis . All cabins are furnished with electric heat , two or three bedrooms , living room , kitchen , and bath . Cabin renters must bring their own household items such as linens and cookware . One cabin is ADA accessible . There are 120 campsites at Ricketts Glen State Park . Each campsite has access to washhouses with flush toilets , showers , and laundry tubs . The campsites also have fire rings and picnic tables . There are two camping areas on the shores of Lake Jean , with one of the campgrounds on a peninsula . There is also an organized group tenting area , which can accommodate six groups of up to 40 persons . 
 The 600 @-@ foot ( 180 m ) beach on Lake Jean is open from mid @-@ May through mid @-@ September . A concession stand and modern restrooms are at the beach .

Charcoal grills are provided for use at the picnic areas . 
 = = = Environmental education and trails = = = 
 Environmental education specialists lead guided tours of parts of the park from March through November . The walks give school groups , scouting organizations , and other visitors a close and informed look at natural wetlands , old @-@ growth forests , waterfalls , flora and fauna , and geologic formations . Other programs are held in the park office , on topics such as safety around wild animals . In summer and fall , park educators lead " Ghost Town Walks " to the ruins of the lumber village of Ricketts and to adjoining State Game Lands . 
 There are 26 miles ( 42 km ) of hiking trails at Ricketts Glen State Park , and a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 20 @.@ 1 km ) trail loop is open for horseback riding . The trails range from " easy " hikes like the Beach Trail along Lake Jean , to " difficult " hikes such as the Falls Trail loop , which passes by many of the waterfalls of the park . In 2001 , John Young in Hike Pennsylvania : An Atlas of Pennsylvania 's Greatest Hiking Adventures wrote of the Falls Trail : " This is not only the most magnificent hike in the state , but it ranks up there with the top hikes in the East . " In 2003 , Backpacker Magazine named the park 's Falls Trail loop one of its 30 favorite day hikes in the contiguous United States . 
 Many of the trails in the park are difficult and hikers are urged to use caution , especially on the Falls Trail , which is steep and often wet and slippery . Each year hikers fall in the glens and have to be rescued , which usually takes dozens of volunteers and up to 11 hours because of the remote locations and rugged terrain . As of 2008 , the former concession stand along PA 118 in the southern end of the park was used for storage of rescue equipment . 
 Falls Trail is a 7 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 11 @.@ 6 km ) difficult loop , estimated to take 4 to 5 hours to hike . The January 2009 issue of Backpacker Magazine named the Falls Trail loop the best hike in Pennsylvania , as part of the magazine 's Reader 's Choice Awards . It boasts a series of wild , free @-@ flowing waterfalls , each cascading though rock @-@ strewn clefts , and passes through a stand of old @-@ growth forest . The park 's website stresses the difficulty of the trail , and The New York Times calls it " difficult and potentially dangerous " near the top of glens . The Falls Trail was " rehabilitated " in 2008 to make the " easier to hike " . The trail is closed during the winter months to hiking , but it is open to ice climbing . The ice climbers must use an ice axe , crampons , and rope . 
 Highland Trail is a 1 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) moderate hiking trail at the top of the Falls Trail loop . It passes through the Midway Crevasse , a narrow gap between two large blocks of Pocono sandstone conglomerate . 
 Ganoga View Trail is a 2 @.@ 8 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 5 km ) moderate trail named for Ganoga Falls , the highest waterfall in the park . Ganoga View Trail is an alternative route to Ganoga Falls and less difficult than the Falls Trail . 
 Grand View Trail is a moderate 1 @.@ 9 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 1 km ) trail which reaches an elevation of 2 @,@ 449 feet ( 746 m ) , the highest point on Red Rock Mountain ( which is part of the Allegheny Front ) .

 = Mario & Luigi : Partners in Time = 
 Mario & Luigi : Partners in Time , known in Japan as Mario & Luigi RPG 2 × 2 ( マリオ & <unk> × 2 , Mario ando Ruīji Aru Pī Jī Tsū bai Tsū ) , is a role @-@ playing video game developed by AlphaDream and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console in 2005 . It is the second game in the Mario & Luigi series , and is the sequel to Mario & Luigi : Superstar Saga for the Game Boy Advance . The game was followed by Mario & Luigi : Bowser 's Inside Story , released in 2009 . 
 Although the sequel to Superstar Saga , the game 's plot is unrelated to that of its predecessor with an emphasis on the time @-@ traveling theme , which involves the protagonists traveling between the past and present of the Mushroom Kingdom . The adventure follows Mario , Luigi , Baby Mario , and Baby Luigi as they search for Princess Peach , who has been abducted by an alien species known as the Shroobs . The gameplay centers on the co @-@ operation between the quartet , who must use their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role @-@ playing game elements , but with a turn @-@ based battle system focused on timing accuracy . The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor , especially in its plot and themes . 
 Partners in Time was positively received by the media , gaining an aggregate score of 86 @.@ 80 % from Game Rankings and an 87 from Metacritic . Like its predecessor , the game was praised by critics for its characterization and comical style , as well as its use of the DS 's dual screen and the rumble feature . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay of Partners in Time , with an emphasis on role @-@ playing games elements and co @-@ operative puzzle solving , is similar to that of its predecessor , although gameplay differences exist between the games . For the majority of Partners in Time , the overworld of the game is presented on the DS 's touchscreen , while a map is present on the top screen , showing relevant information such as the location of each character and save albums . Additionally , the perspective changes when battling or accessing the inventory , and when the quartet is separated into two pairs , in which a pair is visible on each screen . 
 = = = Overworld = = = 
 The player is able to control the four main protagonists — Mario , Luigi , Baby Mario , and Baby Luigi — either as a quartet or alternatively in separate pairs . The player can choose to separate the adults from the babies , which is usually required when entrances or holes in the overworld are too small to be accessed by the adult characters . Such instances form multiple puzzles in the game , in which items or switches can be only be accessed by use of the babies ' specific qualities . The pairs can also perform special moves while they are separated , which are gained as the player progresses through the game . Each action attained is assigned to a specific button on the DS for a character , which is present on the screen ; pressing the corresponding button results in the action . These actions , such as the " Spin Jump " that allows the older brothers to twirl through the air , are required to advance through the game and solve the various puzzles . 
 The game retains many of the RPG aspects present in its predecessor , including the interaction with non @-@ player characters , which is required to advance the plot and gameplay . Each character 's progress is measured by experience points , which are needed to " level up " , a process by which battle @-@ related statistical fields such as speed and power are boosted . As in Superstar Saga , there is also a currency used to purchase items and status @-@ enhancing equipment known as badges and clothes . 
 = = = Battle = = = 
 The battle system is similar to its predecessor 's , with the effectiveness of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions . The battles still consist of turn @-@ based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi , although these are compounded by the babies ' actions during an attack . The Bros. moves — moves performed by Mario and Luigi collectively — have been replaced by Bros. Items , which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld . Similar to the Bros. moves , these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all four characters collectively . Only the adults receive damage , even though the babies will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle . The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled , and the party will not be able to defend itself with hammers , which are wielded exclusively by the babies . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Unlike Superstar Saga , Partners in Time is not set in the Beanbean Kingdom , but the traditional Mushroom Kingdom featured in most games of the Mario series . The setting features a mixture of locations , from those that appeared in previous Mario games , such as Bowser 's Castle , to original locations such as <unk> . Mario and Luigi can travel into the past via " time holes " , which is how the concept of baby characters is introduced . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The game begins as Professor E. Gadd completes his newest invention of a time machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star , which is presented at Peach 's Castle . Peach enters the time machine into the past , but fails to return , only leaving a member of an alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine . The Mushroom Kingdom of the past had actually been invaded by the Shroobs , with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle . After defeating the monster , a time hole opens , leaving a passageway into the past . While searching for Peach , Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves , and agree to locate the crystal shards , which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach 's journey . <unk> , the brothers collect all of the shards , while being pestered by Baby Bowser ( Bowser in the past ) who wants the Cobalt Star . At the end , they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob , who serves as the game 's final boss character . The story ends when she is defeated , Peach is rescued , and the past returns to normal . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Partners in Time features both original characters and those that were introduced before the game . Professor E. Gadd provides the player with advice throughout the game , while Toadsworth teaches the player new moves and skills to progress through the adventure . Although the older Peach is kidnapped , Baby Peach is retrieved from the past into the present by Toadsworth , where she is nurtured by both the old and young renditions of him . Baby Bowser appeared near the beginning of the game in the past to kidnap Baby Peach , although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario <unk> and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs . Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards , and later attacking the group with his older self . Kamek the Magikoopa , Petey Piranha and Fawful , an antagonist from Mario & Luigi : Superstar Saga , appear in the game as well . 
 The Shroobs , introduced in Partners in Time , are fungal like creatures who are the main antagonists of the game . The Shroobs derive from the " Shroob planet " and are ruled by Princess Shroob , who is the primary antagonist . After invading the Mushroom Kingdom , both she and her twin sister , Elder Princess Shroob , are defeated . Different species of Shroobs ( with designs based on existing Mario franchise characters and enemies ) are present throughout the game as both minor enemies and boss characters . AlphaDream also introduced <unk> , a talking briefcase who gives the player advice regarding items and accessories , which he stores . 
 = = Development = = 
 Nintendo revealed Partners in Time at E3 2005 , where a playable demonstration of the game was available . The demos consisted of three levels , each accompanied with a tutorial to guide the player . Each level had a different objective and represented the characters ' abilities in the game , such as the use of the hammer . Between the game 's unveiling at E3 and its release , Nintendo of America revealed details of the game relating to Partners in Time 's plot and gameplay , as well as the fact that it would be compatible with the " Rumble Pak " feature . AlphaDream , developers of Superstar Saga , developed this game , with experienced contributors to the Mario series such as Koji Kondo and Charles Martinet working on sound support and voice acting , respectively . The music was composed by Yoko Shimomura , who also scored Superstar Saga . Partners in Time was first released in North America on November 28 , 2005 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Partners in Time received positive reviews , with reviewers lauding the game 's use of characters and plot . IGN 's Craig Harris commended the game 's comic style , stating " much of the charm from Mario & Luigi comes from the focus on humor that 's bizarre and out there " . Despite this , GameSpot 's Ricardo Torres stated that " The self @-@ referential humor that gave the original game its bite isn 't as prevalent " . Nintendo World Report 's Jonathan <unk> praised the game for returning to the traditional Mushroom Kingdom setting , claiming it led to more distinctive character and plot elements . While appreciating Partners in Time 's use of humour , RPGamer 's Derek Cavin criticised the game 's plot , describing it as " a basic story that doesn 't develop as much as it could have " . The game 's characterisation in particular was well received , with Eurogamer commending <unk> , who was compared to Fawful , a character in Superstar Saga . 
 Critics welcomed Partners in Time 's use of the dual screen , as well as the rumble pak feature . GameSpot criticised the momentary use of the touchscreen , labeling it as " tacked on " ; Eurogamer 's John Walker , also critical of this , felt that the game was better without utilising the DS 's touchscreen . Reviewers complained about the game 's controls , expressing difficulty with coordinating the four characters , with problems arising specifically in enemy encounters with characters that were not being controlled . The alterations to the battle system received a mixed response — GameSpot praised the more complicated and " richer " boss fights , while Nintendo World Report criticised the added complexity , stating " the growth in enemy resilience outpaces your growth in strength , so battles get longer and longer " . IGN noted that " Partners in Time 's quest starts out a little too easy " , although they acknowledged that the game became increasingly difficult as it progressed . 
 Partners in Time 's visuals and presentation were well received , with Eurogamer describing it as " utterly lovely " . GameSpot appreciated the " added flair " in animation gained by the DS , although the perspective made such things as hitting blocks and countering attack " trickier than it should be " . Torres proceeded to criticise the game 's soundtrack , labeling it as the " weakest link " , although other critics lauded the game 's audio . On its first week of release in Japan , Mario & Luigi : Partners in Time sold 132 @,@ 726 units . As of July 25 , 2007 , Mario & Luigi : Partners in Time has sold 1 @.@ 39 million copies worldwide . In addition , the game has received the Editors ' Choice Award at IGN . The game was ranked 50th in Official Nintendo Magazine 's " 100 Greatest Nintendo Games " feature .

 = Burnham Pavilions = 
 The Burnham Pavilions were public sculptures by Zaha Hadid and Ben van Berkel in Millennium Park , which were located in the Loop community area of Chicago , Illinois . Both pavilions were located in the Chase Promenade South . Their purpose was to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnham ’ s Plan of Chicago , and symbolize the city 's continued pursuit of the Plan 's architectural vision with contemporary architecture and planning . The sculptures were privately funded and reside in Millennium Park . The pavilions were designed to be temporary structures . 
 Both Pavilions were scheduled to be unveiled on June 19 , 2009 . However , the Pavilion by Hadid endured construction delays and a construction team change , which led to nationwide coverage of the delay in publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal . Only its skeleton was availed to the public on the scheduled date , and the work was completed and unveiled on August 4 , 2009 . The van Berkel pavilion endured a temporary closure due to unanticipated wear and tear from August 10 – 14 . 
 = = Details = = 
 In June 2008 , there was an announcement that the pavilions would be constructed . The pavilions were commissioned by the Burnham Plan Centennial Committee , a group of civic leaders who collaborated closely with the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs , the Art Institute of Chicago , and Millennium Park Inc . On April 7 , 2009 , the designs were unveiled for the pavilions set to open on June 19 and to continue on display on the south end of the Chase Promenade until October 31 . Delays were caused as a result of manufacturing . This may cause the pavilions to stay on exhibit until November . Additionally , the Hadid Pavilion may be situated in a different part of the park for part of 2010 . The choices of Hadid and van Berkel were somewhat controversial because Burnham was a classicist and they are both avant @-@ garde modernists . Additionally , local architects complained that it was a bit of a slight that two European architects were chosen to produce works to serve as the focal points of the Burnham Plan Centennial celebration . The pavilions were scheduled to be a focal point of the centennial celebration of the 1909 Plan of Chicago , which is a yearlong celebration . However , Hadid 's Pavilion encountered manufacturer 's difficulty in executing Hadid 's complex , computer @-@ aided design . 
 = = = The Hadid Pavilion = = = 
 The pavilion by Hadid , the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize , is a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework exceeding 7 @,@ 000 pieces . Although the frame is composed of 7 @,@ 000 individually bent pieces , no two of which are alike , the shell is made up of a mere 24 custom @-@ made panels of fabric . As expected it accommodates a centennial @-@ themed , audio and video presentation on its interior fabric walls . Its opening was originally expected to be delayed until at least mid @-@ July 2009 . The themed presentation that portrays Chicago ’ s transformation as a result of Burnham 's plan is by London @-@ based , Chicago @-@ trained filmmaker Thomas Gray . It is accompanied by a multi @-@ channel soundtrack created by Chicago 's Lou Mallozzi of Experimental Sound Studio . The pavilion is described as resembling a " futuristic camping tent " . Hadid conceptualized how tension alters appearance as fabric is pulled taut or twisted , which resulted in the elliptical structure and its strategic light @-@ availing gashes and pod @-@ like openings for visitors to experience . The diagonal lines in the structure are a reflection of Burnham ’ s 1909 city plan , which envisioned a fanned grid of streets emanating diagonally from Chicago ’ s city center out into the suburbs . 
 The project was daunting in its physical complexity . TenFab Design , a tensioned fabric trade @-@ show booth design company from Evanston , Illinois , worked nearly five months with numerous structural engineers on plans before construction could begin . As an example the inclusion of a 400 @-@ pound ( 180 kg ) projector challenged the dynamics of the lightweight structure . The centennial committee initiated discussions with TenFab in November 2008 at which time the company requested a six @-@ month design and assembly schedule , but the company was not hired until late February 2009 . The expected completion fell behind schedule . 
 In July , construction responsibilities were passed from TenFab Design to a Fabric Images , an Elgin , Illinois @-@ based company , and the anticipated opening was delayed until August 1 , and the new contract has penalties for delays beyond that date . As the construction costs of the privately funded project ballooned from $ 500 @,@ 000 to $ 650 @,@ 000 due to the change in materials and contractors , the difference was compensated for by a shift in funds from the advertising budget . The unfinished work was visible for the opening weekend on June 19 , but the following Monday it was tented while being completed . Eventually , a canvas stretched across the frame to form a structure that resembled a cocoon . 
 On July 20 , the fabric began being formed around the aluminum shell while it remained in the tent , and although construction was expected to be completed on August 1 , the opening was not anticipated at that time due to both weekend crowds and the cost of disassembling the tent on the weekend . The weekday opening should allow officials a better opportunity to gauge the wear and tear on the structure by visitors . What eventually amounted to over 1 @,@ 600 yards ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) of fabric was stitched and fitted by over a dozen workers . It opened to the public on August 4 as rescheduled . Upon the completion of the temporary exhibition , the pavilion will be deeded to the city to lend or rent out to other cities . It is not designed to withstand snow loads of a Chicago winter . The pavilion is made of aluminum , donated by Marmon / Keystone Industries , a member of the Marmon Group , and a tensile fabric . 
 The current pavilion is not Hadid 's original design , which had a greater emphasis an angularity and incorporated hard surfaces of wood and aluminum . When the committee sent the original proposal out for bid " it was way over budget . " Hadid eventually submitted a new cost @-@ conscious design of a cloth shell supported by aluminum ribs of different sizes . The pavilion 's inner walls were planned to serve as projection surfaces for a film about Chicago by Gray . 
 Hadid had previously been commissioned to a temporary pavilion for the London 's Serpentine Gallery in 2000 . The pavilion was such a success that the gallery has added annual temporary pavilions every year since . Architects such as Frank Gehry and artists like Olafur Eliasson have attempted to achieve the same success in the subsequent years . She also created a mobile temporary work for Chanel that was displayed in Hong Kong , Tokyo and New York in 2008 . Hadid will design the London Aquatics Centre for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the Guangzhou Opera House in China . 
 The Chicago Tribune 's Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning architecture critic Blair Kamin spoke glowingly of the pavilion upon its August 4 , 2009 , completion , describing it as " a virtuoso display of structure , space and light " with an " arresting combination of naturalistic forms and alien shapes , plus a dazzling video installation " . He notes that pavilion resembles a conch shell with openings like shark 's mouths . By daylight the pavilion is enticing , but the use of sunlight limits the multimedia duality to dusk and until the park 's closing , when the 7 @.@ 5 minute video is able to be seen on the pavilion 's inner surface . He felt that the pavilion succeeded in enticing the viewer to envision a better future for Chicago in a manner like Burnham did himself . Kamin is very wary of the public 's likelihood of damaging the pavilion . His concerns were born out quickly as stanchions were required to curb human nature . 
 = = = The van Berkel Pavilion = = = 
 The pavilion by van Berkel of <unk> , referred to by some as the <unk> pavilion , is composed of two parallel rectangular planes joined by curving scoops . It is built on a steel frame and has a skin of glossy white plywood that starts off in familiar right angles and that graduates into double curves of bent plywood . It is situated on a raised platform and it hosts a grid of 42 computer @-@ controlled , LED lights on the underside of the roof . The floor slab is cantilevered and is sliced by a ramp entrance making it ADA accessible . The roof , which is described as floating , also has eye @-@ like openings . The pavilion is composed of steel donated by Chicago @-@ based ArcelorMittal and is intended to be de @-@ constructed and recycled . 
 The pavilion did not prove to be durable enough for the interactive environment of Millennium Park . Kamin feels that the Pavilion was designed more for veneration like indoor museum works of art and outdoor sculpture on pedestals . However , skateboarders , avid fireworks spectators and youthful climbers have been part of the multiple causation of the decline of the pavilion that led to its closure during the week of August 10 – 14 .

 The Burnham Plan is credited with guiding the transformation of the city from an industrial center to leading contemporary city . The Wall Street Journal describes the plan as unrivaled in its elegance and ambition for urban planning and describes Chicago as a monumental manifestation of the plan . The unveiling of the Pavilions was part of a June 19 citywide centennial celebration that included concerts by the Grant Park Orchestra , directed by Carlos Kalmar . The concert featured the world premiere of Michael Torke 's symphony and chorus work entitled Plans , that was paired with Rachmaninoff 's Piano Concerto No. 3 . The ongoing celebration includes lectures , walking tours and art exhibitions throughout the calendar year . The pavilions are accompanied by exhibit panels that promote the Burnham Plan Centennial celebration and continuing opportunities to pursue the plan 's vision for Metropolitan Chicago . The pavilions serve as a focal point for the public ’ s attention to steer them toward the hundreds of exhibits , events , and other activities of the more than 250 Centennial Program Partners in the Chicago metropolitan area . The ground near the pavilions host an interactive touch @-@ screen public kiosk installation geared toward " inventing the future " of the metropolitan Chicago region . 
 = Batrachotomus = 
 Batrachotomus / <unk> / is a genus of prehistoric archosaur . Fossils of this animal have been found in southern Germany and dated from the Ladinian stage of the Middle Triassic period , around 242 to 235 million years ago . Batrachotomus was described by palaeontologist David J. Gower 22 years after its discovery . 
 The locality where Batrachotomus lived was a swampy region and the name comes from the Greek <unk> / <unk> ( frog ) and tome / <unk> ( cutting , slicing ) , which refers to its preying on the large amphibian Mastodonsaurus . In contrast with sprawling reptiles , like crocodiles , this large carnivore was very agile with locomotor superiority due to its erect stance . A remarkable feature seen on its back was a row of paired , flattened bony plates . Batrachotomus was possibly an early relative of Postosuchus , which lived during the dawn of the dinosaurs . 
 = = Description = = 
 Batrachotomus was a heavily built , large quadrupedal reptile reaching 6 metres ( 20 ft ) in length . A trait that characterized Batrachotomus , compared to other crurotarsans , was a series of paired small plates on its back which were attached to each vertebra . These bony deposits forming scales are called osteoderms . Flattened and leaf @-@ shaped , these extended from behind the head along the column and reducing in size , ended at the tail . There is also evidence that osteoderms were present on the ventral region of the tail , as seen in <unk> ferox , and even on the flank , belly and limbs . 
 Like rauisuchians , Batrachotomus walked with an erect posture , although the limbs were not located directly under the trunk . The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70 % of the hindlimbs . The toe bones ( phalanges ) are poorly preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal ( bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones ) which was hooked in shape . However , hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five . 
 Batrachotomus had a tall and narrow skull estimated at 40 to 50 cm ( 1 @.@ 3 to 1 @.@ 6 ft ) in length . It had five pairs of fenestrae ( skull openings ) , two pairs of which were for the eyes ( called orbits ) and the nostrils . Behind the orbits were two temporal fenestrae . These holes probably helped to reduce the weight of the skull and enabled the jaw to open more widely . As a typical archosaur , Batrachotomus had two antorbital fenestrae between the orbits and nostrils , and a fifth pair of small openings at the rear part of the lower jaw . 
 The jaws contained sharp teeth which were compressed laterally and unequal in size and shape , and this variation of tooth shape is known as heterodonty . The teeth on the premaxillae ( bones at the very tip of the upper jaw ) were slender , unlike those of the maxillae ( the main tooth @-@ bearing bones in the upper jaw ) which had a straight posterior edge . The upper jaw bore 30 teeth , with each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11 , while the lower jaw held 22 teeth . 
 = = Discovery and history = = 
 Remains of Batrachotomus have been found in southern Germany , mainly in the <unk> fossil locality in northern Baden @-@ Württemberg . Fossil collector Johann G. <unk> discovered the first specimens in a 1977 excavation at the Erfurt Formation , dated from the <unk> ( late Ladinian ) age . Other remains attributed to Batrachotomus have been collected in <unk> @-@ <unk> , about 10 km east of <unk> Hall , and in <unk> . The most notable are from <unk> @-@ <unk> , which are represented by well preserved ribs and vertebrae ( MHI 1895 ) , and evidence of forelimbs and hindlimbs ( SMNS <unk> ) . Batrachotomus today is displayed in the <unk> Museum , <unk> , Stuttgart . 
 The fossils recovered from a <unk> remained undescribed until 1999 and palaeontologists referred to the genus simply as " <unk> " or " <unk> " . In 1999 , palaeontologist David J. Gower described the holotype ( SMNS <unk> ) from the 1977 excavation , which is the largest specimen of the genus , comprised by incomplete skull and postcranial materials . Anatomy of the braincase ( SMNS <unk> ) was made three years later , shedding light on the evolutionary relationships of the poorly known group of Rauisuchia . In 2009 , Gower and Rainer R. Schoch reported a detailed reconstruction of the postcranial skeleton for the first time . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Batrachotomus was a <unk> , a member of a family of carnivorous archosaurs within the larger group Rauisuchia . The family name " Prestosuchidae " was established in 1966 by American paleontologist Alfred Romer . <unk> were quadrupedal reptiles , medium to large in size , characterized by erect posture , large and narrow skull and large antorbital openings . 
 Attention was first brought to Batrachotomus in 1993 by Michael Parrish , a palaeontologist at Northern Illinois University . Parrish hypothesized that Batrachotomus ( then " <unk> " ) belonged to the family of <unk> , another clade of carnivorous reptiles , and species of <unk> . However , the description of the braincase and a revisited cladistic analysis by Benton and Walker , showing the close relationships between Batrachotomus and <unk> , led to the transfer of Batrachotomus to the family Prestosuchidae . 
 Sterling J. Nesbitt ( 2011 ) revised the classification of basal archosaurs , and using the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for this group ( to date ) found Prestosuchidae to be non @-@ monophyletic . The members of this clade were recovered as basal <unk> , of which Batrachotomus was found to be the most derived i.e. most closely related to the clade containing Crocodylomorpha and <unk> . Subsequent derivatives of this analysis further support this hypothesis . In a yet to be formally published revision of <unk> , a medium @-@ sized ( ~ 5 m long ) " rauisuchian " from the upper <unk> Group of Wyoming , it was recovered as the sister taxon of Batrachotomus using a derivative of Nesbitt ( 2011 ) analysis . 
 The cladogram below follows an analysis by Sterling J. Nesbitt ( 2011 ) : 
 = = Paleoecology = = 
 Since 1977 , the rich vertebrate fauna found at Baden @-@ Württemberg reflect a moist region of the Middle Triassic in Germany . Along with Batrachotomus , palaeontologists recovered remains of fishes , amphibians , such as <unk> and Mastodonsaurus , and even animals like <unk> and the distinct marine reptile <unk> . Flora of the locality consisted of horsetails , ferns , cycads and conifers , suggesting that there was rich vegetation . 
 = Cyclone Agni = 
 Severe Cyclonic Storm Agni was a tropical cyclone of the 2004 North Indian Ocean cyclone season notable for its record proximity to the equator . It was the second North Indian Ocean cyclone to receive a name , after Onil earlier in the year . Agni formed on November 28 well to the southwest of India in the Arabian Sea , and steadily intensified as it tracked northwestward . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated peak 1 minute sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , while the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) estimated peak 3 minute sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) ; the IMD is the official warning center for the north Indian Ocean . After peaking , it weakened due to wind shear , dry air , and cooler waters , and the JTWC issued its final advisory on December 3 as it approached the coast of Somalia . The remnants of Agni moved along the Somalian coastline until dissipating on December 5 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical disturbance was observed on November 19 about 800 km ( 500 mi ) southeast of Colombo , Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal . The disturbance tracked westward , gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) on November 22 . After passing south of Sri Lanka , it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone . The circulation associated with the system continued westward , reorganizing on November 26 in the Arabian Sea . Despite being located unusually close to the equator , the disturbance maintained convection , or thunderstorms , which was becoming organized around the weak low @-@ level circulation . With low wind shear and diffluence aloft , the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing . 
 While the system was organizing , the center crossed the equator to reach about 0 @.@ 5 ° S , thus becoming an anticyclonic circulation in the southern hemisphere . This was unusual , as the Coriolis effect is nonexistent along the equator — the Coriolis effect refers to planetary vorticity , which provides the spin in a cyclone . The JTWC later assessed the system as remaining in the northern hemisphere , reaching as far south as 0 @.@ 7 ° N , or about 80 km ( 50 mi ) from the equator . After the circulation organized further beneath the convection , the JTWC issued another TCFA at 0300 UTC on November 28 . Three hours later , the agency classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 05A about 1300 km ( 800 mi ) southwest of the southern tip of India . In a post @-@ season analysis , the JTWC estimated the cyclone became a tropical storm six hours earlier . At around the same time , the IMD classified it as a " low pressure area ... likely to become well marked . " 
 Upon being classified , the tropical cyclone was moving northwestward under the influence of a ridge over India . Its outflow to the north and south became better defined , although its proximity to the equator limited its southerly outflow somewhat due to wind shear . Early on November 29 , the IMD classified the system as a depression , and throughout the day it rapidly intensified to become a cyclonic storm ; a cyclonic storm is a tropical cyclone with at least 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) winds sustained for 3 minutes . Around that time , the JTWC assessed the cyclone as reaching peak winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , sustained for 1 minute , along with gusts to 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Late on November 29 , the cyclone weakened slightly , only to regain its peak intensity by November 30 ; at that time , it developed a banding eye , and was located about 1500 km ( 900 mi ) southeast of the coast of Somalia . At 1200 UTC on November 30 , the IMD issued its first complete advisory on the cyclone , naming it Severe Cyclonic Storm Agni and estimating peak winds at 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) ; the agency predicted the storm would continue northwestward and strengthen slightly before weakening . At its peak , the cyclone had a barometric pressure of 985 mbar . 
 After reaching peak intensity , an increase in wind shear caused the eye to disappear , and the convection decreased significantly . On December 1 , the IMD estimated Agni weakened to cyclonic storm status , around which time the center became exposed from the convection . The cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear , the presence of dry air , and cooler water temperatures , and by December 2 , the IMD downgraded Agni to depression status , which was its final warning on the system . As it approached the coast of Somalia , it turned westward due to the building of a ridge over Saudi Arabia . Despite unfavorable conditions , thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation , which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity . By late on December 3 , Agni weakened to below tropical storm status , and the JTWC issued its final warning while the storm was about 450 km ( 275 mi ) south @-@ southeast of Cape Guardafui — the easternmost point of the Horn of Africa . The circulation became difficult to locate by early on December 4 , by which time the system had little remaining convection . It turned southwestward and later to the south , moving ashore on eastern Somalia before dissipating on December 5 near <unk> <unk> over water . 
 = = Records , naming , and impact = = 
 According to RSMC New Delhi , Cyclone Agni developed into a depression at 1 @.@ 5 ° N , which is the same latitude as where according to RSMC Tokyo , Tropical Storm Vamei formed during December 2001 . However , according to RSMC La Reunion , the precursor low to Cyclone Agni moved into the Southern Hemisphere and became an anticyclone as it had kept its counter @-@ clockwise circulation . 
 Agni was the second storm in the north Indian Ocean to receive a name , after the IMD began tropical cyclone naming in the middle of 2004 . 
 As the cyclone was weak when it moved over Somalia , no casualties or significant damage was reported . 
 = Christmas Party ( The Office ) = 
 " Christmas Party " is the tenth episode of the second season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's sixteenth episode overall . It was written by Michael Schur and directed by Charles McDougall . It was first broadcast on December 6 , 2005 on NBC . The episode guest stars David Koechner as Todd Packer . 
 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton , Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In this episode , the office throws a Christmas party and plays Secret Santa . Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) , having put a lot of effort into finding a gift for Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) , becomes frustrated when Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) makes everyone play " Yankee Swap " , and an iPod that Michael bought for Ryan Howard ( B.J. Novak ) becomes the hot object of the game . 
 The episode received positive reviews from television critics , with many applauding Michael 's " Yankee Swap " scene . The episode was nominated for two Primetime Emmy awards , one for Outstanding Single @-@ Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series , and one for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series . " Christmas Party " earned a Nielsen rating of 4 @.@ 3 in the 18 – 49 demographic , being viewed by 9 @.@ 7 million viewers , making it , at the time of its airing , the highest @-@ rated episode of the season . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The office staffers hold a " Secret Santa " gift exchange at their Christmas party . Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) received Pam Beesly 's ( Jenna Fischer ) name , and puts a great deal of effort into getting her the perfect gift ( a teapot filled with some small items and a personal letter from him to her ) . Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) buys a $ 400 video iPod as his gift to Ryan Howard ( B.J. Novak ) , far exceeding the $ 20 limit . He is disappointed by the handmade item he receives from Phyllis Lapin ( Phyllis Smith ) and introduces a " Yankee Swap " , in which someone can choose to steal someone else 's gift or open a new one . 
 Jim is left feeling uncertain about the fate of his special present for Pam — which is eventually claimed by Dwight — while the staff competes for the iPod . Although Pam ends up with the iPod at the end of the swap , she elects to trade the iPod for Jim 's gift that was meant for her to show her appreciation . While she goes through the various aspects of her gift , Jim sneaks the letter he wrote for her into his pocket . 
 After ruining his staff 's mood , Michael disobeys company policy by buying an obscene amount of alcohol for the Christmas party to compensate . Everyone ends up having a good time , with the exception of Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) , who is furious that she received no appreciation for her efforts toward arranging the Christmas party , as well as the fact that Kelly makes advances on Dwight , whom Angela is secretly dating . The episode ends with a drunken Meredith Palmer ( Kate Flannery ) exposing herself to a shocked Michael , who takes a picture and then quickly flees .

 " Christmas Party " was written by Michael Schur , who portrays Mose Schrute in the series . The episode was his third contribution after the first season entry " The Alliance " and second season episode " Office Olympics " . B.J. Novak later noted that , compared to Schur 's previous episode " The Alliance " , the " driving force of the mayhem " in the episode is Michael 's desire to make all of his workers " happy " , rather than him being " a jerk " . The scene wherein Dwight plugs the Christmas tree in , only for the office to be underwhelmed by the dismal lights was based on a real moment Schur and his wife experienced during their first Christmas together . Schur based the Christmas party sequences on a scene in Rushmore that happens after the main character does his Vietnam play . He noted that he wanted it to be " pastiche @-@ y " and feature " small groups of people talking to each other " . Meredith flashing Michael was based on a real @-@ life experience Greg Daniels 's dad had at a former job ; at the end of one particular Christmas party , there was a stain on the office couch , which he called an " inappropriate ending " for the party . Daniels 's father kept pressuring him to make a Christmas episode of The Office , and so Daniels utilized this experience . 
 Daniels was unsure as to what to call the Christmas exchange . He had heard the names " Nasty Christmas " , " White Elephant " , and " Yankee Swap " used to describe the game , and so he wrote all three into the script in order " to cover all regions of the country " . Schur created a list of who receives what gift in order to preserve continuity in the episode . Gifts featured in the episode include Toby giving Angela a baby poster , Kelly getting Oscar a shower radio , Michael buying Ryan an iPod , Kevin buying a foot bath for himself , Creed giving Jim an old shirt , Oscar buying Creed a keychain , and Jim purchasing Pam a teapot . The teapot was chosen because it needed to fit other gifts inside of it , as well as be something that Dwight could have a use for later on in the episode . Fischer was allowed to pick the color of the teapot featured in the episode . She picked teal , due to it being her then @-@ husband James Gunn 's favorite color . Jenna Fischer recalled that fans always ask her what Jim wrote in Pam 's note . Fischer noted that John Krasinski wrote the note himself and that the contents are " a secret " . Jim finally gives Pam the note in the penultimate ninth season episode " A.A.R.M. " 
 Reportedly , the writers for the show wanted Michael to " give a cool gift that the show 's co @-@ workers would later resent " . They eventually decided that he would buy an iPod for Ryan . Apple Inc. received over four minutes of publicity for the device , despite the fact that the company did not pay for the placement . The poster that Toby gives to Angela was created by one of the show 's prop workers . Several of the series ' crew members brought in their own children for the picture , an act that Kate Flannery jokingly called " so great " . Schur revealed in the commentary for the episode that Stanley bought Kelly her nameplate , Dwight 's <unk> were intended for Phyllis , Meredith bought Dwight shot glasses , Ryan got Toby a book of short stories , Angela purchased Stanley a picture frame , and Pam drew Meredith a picture of the office . Pam 's picture was initially drawn by an on @-@ staff artist . However , the producers felt that he was not able to capture Pam 's " feminine side " and so several young female artists were asked to draw the building . One was eventually chosen , and the artists returned to draw Pam 's doodles in the later episode " Boys and Girls " .

 The episode was directed by Charles McDougall , his first credit for the series . According to Kinsey , McDougal , in order to set the characters ' moods , would start every scene by saying " everyone happy , Angela pissed ! " McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene , due to it being a largely stationary sequence . The cold opening was shot four different times , and almost every time , the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree " crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell " . The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos was based on a deleted scene from the earlier season two episode " The Fire " , where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation . The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow . Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake , but he was pleased with the final results . According to Fischer , on the last day of shooting , the cast had a snowball fight — a scene that is included in the episode — which she called a " magic moment " . Fischer later recounted that the prop egg <unk> and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days , an act that she felt was revolting . In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for " 30 minutes " between takes . Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong , but Smith refused to speak to them , in order to stay in character . The series ' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie . Thus , the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie . Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot . During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall , Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break , so she decided to stomp on them . Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head . 
 During the flashing scene , Carell told Flannery that he " wasn 't staring at " her breasts , rather , he was looking at her clavicle . Despite what it appears on camera , Flannery was not completely topless , as she was wearing pasties . The scene was shot several times ; Flannery admitted that the shooting was <unk> and it felt like they had been shooting the one scene for " 14 hours " . To preserve Flannery 's modesty , the series ' monitors were shut off and the memory card for the digital camera was removed . Carell actually took pictures during the Christmas party shoot . All of the photos were released online . 
 The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Oscar and Creed moving a desk , Phyllis confiding to the camera that her new boyfriend is Bob Vance , Dwight comparing humans opening presents to bears , Kevin singing " Christmas in Hollis " by Run DMC , Angela scolding Kelly , and Michael explaining that Christmas is about seeing people envy the gifts that you give to others .

 = Battle of Schliengen = 
 At the Battle of Schliengen ( 24 October 1796 ) , both the French Army of the Rhine and Moselle under the command of Jean @-@ Victor Moreau and the Austrian army under the command of Archduke Charles of Austria claimed victories . The village of Schliengen lies in the present @-@ day Kreis Lörrach close to the border of present @-@ day Baden @-@ Württemberg ( Germany ) , the Haut @-@ Rhin ( France ) , and the Canton of Basel @-@ Stadt ( Switzerland ) . 
 During the French Revolutionary Wars , Schliengen was a strategically important location for the armies of both Republican France and Habsburg Austria . Control of the area gave either combatant access to southwestern German states and important Rhine river crossings . On 20 October Moreau retreated from Freiburg im Breisgau and established his army along a ridge of hills . The severe condition of the roads prevented Archduke Charles from flanking the French right wing . The French left wing lay too close to the Rhine to outflank , and the French center , positioned in a 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) semi @-@ circle on heights that commanded the terrain below , was unassailable . Instead , he attacked the French flanks directly , and in force , which increased casualties for both sides . 
 Although the French and the Austrians claimed victory at the time , military historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage . However , the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen . A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine , when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy . The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . 
 = = Background = = 
 Initially , the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as a dispute between the French king and his subjects , and not something in which they should interfere . As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident , they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family ; this Declaration of Pilnitz ( 27 August 1791 ) threatened ambiguous , but quite serious , consequences if anything should happen to the royal family . The position of the revolutionaries became increasingly difficult . Compounding their problems in international relations , French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter @-@ revolution . Finally , on 20 April 1792 , the French National Convention declared war on Austria . In this War of the First Coalition ( 1792 – 98 ) , France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her , plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire . Despite some victories in 1792 , by early 1793 , France was in terrible crisis : French forces had been pushed out of Belgium ; also there was revolt in the Vendée over conscription ; wide @-@ spread resentment of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy ; and the French king had just been executed . The armies of the French Republic were in a state of disruption ; the problems became even more acute following the introduction of mass conscription , the levée en masse , which saturated an already distressed army with thousands of illiterate , untrained men . For the French , the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved especially disastrous , although they had achieved some success in other theaters of war ( see for example , War of the Pyrenees ( 1793 – 95 ) ) . 
 = = = Campaign in 1796 = = = 
 The armies of the First Coalition included the imperial contingents and the infantry and cavalry of the various states , amounting to about 125 @,@ 000 ( including three autonomous corps ) , a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force by the standards of the Revolutionary wars . In total , though , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief Archduke Charles ' troops stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea and Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser 's , from the Swiss @-@ Italian border to the Adriatic . Habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army , but the thin white line of Habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from Basel to Frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of their opponents . Compared to French coverage , Charles had half the number of troops covering a 211 @-@ mile ( 340 km ) front that stretched from Renchen near Basel to Bingen . Furthermore , he had concentrated the bulk of his force , commanded by Count Baillet Latour , between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt , where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely , as it offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna , with good bridges crossing a relatively well @-@ defined river bank . To his north , Wilhelm von Wartensleben 's autonomous corps covered the line between Mainz and Giessen . The Austrian army consisted of professionals , many moved from the border regions in the Balkans , and conscripts drafted from the imperial circles . 
 Two French generals , Jean Baptiste Jourdan and Jean Victor Moreau , commanded ( respectively ) the Army of Sambre @-@ et @-@ Meuse and the Army of the Rhine and Moselle at the outset of the 1796 campaign . The French citizens ' army , created by mass conscription of young men and systematically divested of old men who might have tempered the rash impulses of teenagers and young adults , and had already made itself odious , by reputation and rumor at least , throughout France . Furthermore , it was an army entirely dependent upon the countryside for its material support . After April 1796 , pay was made in metallic value , but pay was still in arrears . Throughout the spring and early summer , the unpaid French army was in almost constant mutiny : in May 1796 , in the border town of Zweibrücken , the 74th Demi @-@ brigade revolted . In June , the 17th Demi @-@ brigade was insubordinate ( frequently ) and in the 84th Demi @-@ brigade , two companies rebelled . The French commanders understood that an assault into the German states was essential , not only in terms of war aims , but also in practical terms : the French Directory believed that war should pay for itself , and did not budget for the payment or feeding of its troops . 
 In Spring , 1796 , when resumption of war appeared eminent , the 88 members of the Swabian Circle , which included most of the states ( ecclesiastical , secular , and dynastic ) in Upper Swabia , had raised a small force of about 7 @,@ 000 men . These were literally raw recruits , field hands and day laborers drafted for service , but usually untrained in military matters . It was largely guess work where they should be placed , and Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location . Consequently , in early late May and early June , when the French started to mass troops by Mainz as if they would cross there — they even engaged the Imperial force at Altenkirchen ( 4 June ) and Wetzler and Uckerath ( 15 June ) — Charles thought that main attack would occur there and felt few qualms placing the 7 @,@ 000 @-@ man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl . On 24 June , though , at Kehl , Moreau 's advance guard , 10 @,@ 000 , preceded the main force of 27 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 000 cavalry directed at the Swabian pickets on the bridge . The Swabians were hopelessly outnumbered and could not be reinforced . Most of the Imperial Army of the Rhine was stationed further north , by Mannheim , where the river was easier to cross , but too far away to support the smaller force at Kehl . Neither the Condé 's troops in Freiburg nor Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg 's force in Rastatt could reach Kehl in time to support them . Within a day , Moreau had four divisions across the river . Thrust out of Kehl , the Swabian contingent reformed at Rastatt by 5 July . There they managed to hold the city until the French turned both flanks . Charles could not move much of his army away from Mannheim or Karlsruhe , where the French had also formed across the river , and Fürstenberg could not hold the southern flank . Furthermore , at Hüningen , near Basel , on the same day that Moreau 's advance guard crossed at Kehl , Ferino executed a full crossing , and advanced unopposed east along the German shore of the Rhine with the 16th and 50th Demi @-@ brigades , the 68th , 50th and 68th line infantry , and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons . 
 The Habsburg and Imperial armies were in danger of encirclement , as the French pressed hard at Rastatt . Ferino moved quickly east along the shore of the Rhine ; from there , an approach from the rear might have flanked the entire force . To prevent this , Charles executed an orderly withdrawal in four columns through the Black Forest , across the Upper Danube valley , and toward Bavaria , trying to maintain consistent contact with all flanks as each column withdrew through the Black Forest and the Upper Danube . By mid @-@ July , the column encamped near Stuttgart . The third column , which included the Condé 's Corps , retreated through Waldsee to Stockach , and eventually Ravensburg . The fourth Austrian column , the smallest ( three battalions and four squadrons ) , Ludwig Wolff de la Marselle , marched the length of the Bodensee 's northern shore , via Überlingen , Meersburg , Buchhorn , and the Austrian city of Bregenz . 
 Given the size of the attacking force , Charles had to withdraw far enough into Bavaria to align his northern flank in a perpendicular line with Wartensleben 's autonomous corps to protect the Danube valley and deny the French primary access to Vienna . His own front would prevent Moreau from flanking Wartensleben from the south and together they could resist the French onslaught . In the course of this withdrawal , he abandoned the Swabian Circle to the French . For the Swabians to negotiate neutrality , their militia needed to disband . At the end of July , eight thousand of Charles ' men executed a dawn attack on the camp of the remaining three thousand Swabian and Condé 's immigrant troops , disarmed them , and impounded their weapons . As Charles withdrew further east , the neutral zone established in Swabia expanded , eventually to encompass most of southern German states and the Ernestine Duchies . 
 = = = Summer of maneuvers = = = 
 The summer and fall included various conflicts throughout the southern territories of the German states as the armies of the Coalition and the armies of the Directory sought to flank each other : 
 By mid @-@ summer , the situation looked grim for the Coalition : Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east @-@ northeast despite Charles ' orders to unite with him . It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would outmaneuver Charles by driving a wedge between his force and that of Wartensleben . At Neresheim on 11 August , Moreau crushed Charles ' force , forcing him to withdraw further east . At last , however , with this loss , Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction , moving his corps to join at Charles ' northern flank . At Amberg on 24 August , Charles inflicted a defeat on the French , yet that same day , his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg . Regardless , the tide had turned in the Coalition 's favor . Both Jourdan and Moreau had overstretched their lines , moving far into the German states , and were separated too far from each other for one to offer the other aid or security . The Coalition 's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau , similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben . As the French withdrew toward the Rhine , Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward . On 3 September at Würzburg , Jourdan attempted to halt his retreat . Once Moreau received word of the French defeat , he had to withdraw from southern Germany . He pulled his troops back through the Black Forest , with Ferino supervising the rear guard . The Austrian corps commanded by Latour drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4 @,@ 000 men taken as prisoners , some standards and artillery , after which Latour followed at a more prudent distance .

 The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the Swiss Cantons . The High Rhine ( <unk> ) , the 80 @-@ mile ( 130 km ) stretch between the Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen and Basel , cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed ; in such places as the former rapids at Laufenburg , it moves in torrents . A few miles north and east of Basel , the terrain flattens . The Rhine makes a wide , northerly turn , in what is called the Rhine knee , and enters the so @-@ called Rhine ditch ( Rheingraben ) , part of a rift valley bordered by the Black Forest on the east and Vosges Mountains on the west . In 1796 , the plain on both sides of the river , some 19 miles ( 31 km ) wide , was dotted with villages and farms . At the farthest edges of the flood plain , especially on the eastern side , the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon . Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest , creating deep defiles in the mountains . The tributaries then wound in rivulets through the flood plain to the river . 
 The landscape was impressive , but rugged . As a nineteenth @-@ century traveler described it , 
 the mountains in the vicinity [ of Müllheim ] are bold ; the dark ravines contrasting with its sunny fronts offer some exquisite scenes . The Rhine ... lay revealed before us for many a league , twisting and twining like a serpent of silver ... dotted with innumerable islands , and flowing through a most extensive plain , perfectly flat . Our elevation was considerable and the eye ranged over a great extent of country : <unk> [ sic ] , in France , and the level country as far as Bingen , would have been seen to their furthest limits had not the distance melted the extreme verges into ' thin air ' . Many were the villages , and hamlets , and woods sprinkled over the landscape .... 
 The traveler described additional walks , in which the forest of dark pine bordered directly on the road , " <unk> [ sic ] by glades in which browsed sheep and goats . " 
 The Rhine River itself looked different in the 1790s than it does today ; the passage from Basel to Iffezheim was " corrected " ( straightened ) between 1817 and 1875 . Between 1927 and 1975 , a canal was constructed to control the water level . In 1790 , though , the river was wild and unpredictable , in some places four times wider or more than it is in the twenty @-@ first century , even under regular water levels . Its channels wound through marsh and meadow , and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods .

 Throughout September and early October , Charles maintained his pressure on Moreau 's army , pushing it further to the west . On 18 September , part of an Austrian division under Feldmarschall @-@ Leutnant Petrasch swept from Karlsruhe , south to Kehl and stormed the Rhine bridgehead there ; he succeeded in holding it , with high losses ( about 2 @,@ 000 of his 5 @,@ 000 men were killed , wounded or missing ) . Immediately , though , General Schauenburg , the French garrison commander , counter @-@ attacked and drove the Austrians back ; the French lost 1 @,@ 200 killed or wounded , and 800 captured . Even though the French still held the crossing at Kehl and Strasbourg , Petrasch 's Austrians prevented Moreau from using the crossing to escape to France , leaving as his only reliable route to France the bridge at Hüningen . If Moreau , at that point situated in Freiburg , withdrew too soon from the Breisgau , Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino ' s column would be trapped there . 
 The next contact occurred on 19 October at Emmendingen , in the Elz valley which winds through the Black Forest . The section of the valley involved in the battle runs southwest through the mountains from Elzach , through Bleibach and Waldkirch . Just to the southwest of Waldkirch , the river emerges from the mountains and flows north @-@ west towards the Rhine , with the Black Forest to its right . This section of the river passes through Emmendingen before it reaches Riegel . Riegel sits in a narrow gap between the Black Forest and an isolated outcropping of volcanic hills known as the Kaiserstuhl . Here the archduke split his force into four columns . 
 Column Nauendorf , in the upper Elz , had 8 battalions and 14 squadrons , advancing southwest to Waldkirch ; column Wartensleben had 12 battalions and 23 squadrons advancing south to capture the Elz bridge at Emmendingen . Latour , with 6 @,@ 000 men , was to cross the foothills via Heimbach and <unk> , and capture the bridge of <unk> , between Riegel and Emmendingen , and column Fürstenberg held <unk> , about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Riegel . Michael Fröhlich and Condé ( part of Friedrich Joseph , Count of Nauendorf 's column ) were to pin down Ferino and the French right wing in the Stieg valley . Nauendorf 's men were able to ambush Saint ' Cyr 's advance ; Latour 's columns attacked Beaupuy at Matterdingen , killing the general and throwing his column into confusion . Wartensleben , in the center , was held up by French riflemen until his third ( reserve ) detachment arrived to outflank them . In the ensuing melee , Wartensleben was mortally wounded . The French retreated across the rivers , destroying all the bridges . 
 Lack of bridges did not slow the Coalition pursuit . The Austrians repaired the bridges by Matterdingen , and moved on Moreau at Freiburg . On 20 October , Moreau 's army of 20 @,@ 000 united south of Freiburg im Breisgau with Ferino 's column . Ferino 's force was smaller than Moreau had hoped , bringing the total of the combined French force to about 32 @,@ 000 . Charles ' combined forces of 24 @,@ 000 closely followed Moreau 's rear guard from Freiburg , southwest , to a line of hills stretching between Kandern and the river . 
 = = = French dispositions = = = 
 After a retreat of approximately 38 miles ( 61 km ) in which his rear guard was continually harassed by the vanguard of his enemy , Moreau halted at Schliengen and distributed his army in a 7 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 12 km ) semicircle along a ridge that commanded the approaches from Freiburg . He placed his right wing , commanded by Ferino , at the neighboring heights of Kandern ( altitude 1 @,@ 155 feet ( 352 m ) ) and Sitzenkirch , and his left wing at Steinstadt . His center occupied the village of Schliengen ( altitude 820 feet or 250 meters ) , which lay about 3 miles ( 5 km ) from the Rhine river . His entire force guarded a front protected by a small stream , the 14 @-@ mile ( 23 km ) long Kander that meandered out of the mountains west of Kandern and plunged 755 feet ( 230 m ) into the Rhine when it passed Steinstadt . For extra protection , Moreau also posted a body of infantry in front of his center , giving it added depth . His position on the heights gave him the advantage in any approach ; his troops could fire downhill on any advancing troops . The French position , in the chain of abrupt and woody heights , seemed nearly impregnable . 
 = = = Austrian strategy = = = 
 The Austrian army , augmented by the Army of Condé under the prince 's command , approached from Freiburg . Charles had a couple of options open to him . Any direct assault on the French position would be costly ; Moreau had chosen an almost unassailable position , especially for his center . Any Habsburg force would have to cross the Kandern ; in most cases , it would have to advance uphill into withering fire . Charles could avoid a battle by leaving a force to keep the French occupied and directing a part of his army through the mountains to the left of the Kandern , descending into the valley to Wies and disrupt the French line with Hüningen . However , this operation would take time , and the roads were bad from the rain , making any such maneuver difficult . 
 Rather than see his enemy slip from his grasp , Charles decided to turn Moreau 's right flank at Kandern . He redistributed the four columns : Condé 's Emigré Corps formed the far right column , and Condé 's grandson , Louis Antoine , Duke of Enghien , commanded its vanguard ; the second column , commanded by the young but reliable Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg , included 9 battalions and 26 squadrons . Charles ordered the first two columns to keep the left wing of the French army in check , preventing it from swinging around his own army 's rear in a flanking maneuver . This force also maintained contact with Petrasch 's force by Kehl . 
 The third column , commanded by the experienced Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour , included 11 battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry . The fourth , commanded by the dependable Friedrich Joseph , Count of Nauendorf , included the entire vanguard of Charles ' corps and approached on the far Austrian left . The two larger columns , under Latour and Nauendorf , were to attack the French right wing in force , and to turn it so that the French army 's back was to the Rhine . This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances : they would approach the French uphill from them . Nauendorf divided his column into several smaller groups , and approached Kandern from several sides , up the steep slopes , by coordinating contact between his column and Latour 's , using Maximilian , Count of Merveldt 's regiment as the link between them . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Condé 's Corps formed down river at Neuburg and Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg 's column formed at Müllheim . Their role was specific : keep the French left from flanking the main Austrian force . Yet , despite specific orders to the contrary , the Duke of Enghien , Condé 's grandson , led a spirited attack on Steinstadt with the Army of Condé ; they took the village with a bayonet charge and remained there under severe artillery and musket fire for the rest of the daylight hours . Republican fire continued , incessant and terrible . An officer was killed as he stood between the Royal Highnesses ( Condé , his son , and grandson ) and the Duke of Berry . Taking advantage of the royalist acquisition , the second column took the hill opposite Schliengen , which was heavily defended by General of Division Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr . Saint @-@ Cyr tried several times to retake the position , but Fürstenberg 's column clung to its prize throughout the day , despite a heavy cannonade from the French divisions opposite it . 
 On the opposite side of the battlefield , Latour 's column marched through part of the night to Feldburg , passed through <unk> at 47 ° 47 ′ N 7 ° 37 ′ E to Feldberg , after which it separated into two smaller columns . At 07 : 00 , the right column attacked Ferino 's positions in two vineyards which lay approximately 6 miles ( 10 km ) to the northeast at 47 ° 46 ′ 0 @.@ 12 ″ N 7 ° 39 ′ 0 @.@ 00 ″ E. This column forced the French to retire behind Liel at 47 ° 45 ′ N 7 ° 36 ′ E , 0 @.@ 8 miles ( 1 km ) east of Schliengen . The left column , meanwhile , had attacked another position by <unk> . After fierce fighting , Latour 's column dislodged the French after obstinate resistance ; the second portion of Latour 's column approached the hamlet <unk> from the reverse angle , and forced a French contingent from the village . <unk> combat followed as the Austrians made the steep , uphill advance . 
 The greater part of the battle , yet to come , fell to Nauendorf 's column . His men had marched all of the preceding night ; his column moved with the corps of General Latour to Feldburg , but by the castle of <unk> 3 @.@ 9 miles ( 6 km ) to the east at 47 ° 44 ′ 0 ″ N 7 ° 49 ′ 0 ″ E , it turned to the left ( west ) to penetrate to the source of the Kandern stream . Finally , by 14 : 00 , two in the afternoon , Nauendorf 's column had slogged through mud and muck and came fully into the action . Despite determined opposition , his troops ousted the French from Kandern and Sitzenkirch , and all the high ground above the river and <unk> . The fighting there , between Ferino 's and Nauendorf 's columns , was intense and horrific : Moreau later recounted that Ferino 's troops performed " prodigies of valor " from daybreak to nightfall . When Nauendorf finished pushing the French from Kandern , and two hamlets beside it , and he sent a note with this information to Latour . As the battle finished , a ferocious storm unleashed hail and wind . So ended the first day of the battle during which Charles ' army had successfully ousted both French flanks from their positions . Overnight , Charles drew up his plans to attack the French center on the following morning . It promised to be a long and bloody second day . 
 = = = Withdrawal = = = 
 Moreau appreciated his untenable position , especially on his right where the bulk of Charles ' force stood ready to attack again in the morning . The Austrian army occupied a line which passed obliquely across the extremity of his right , and another line which passed along his left ; they both intersected in front of him , where the main force of Charles ' army blocked any movement forward . With luck , his troops might hold the Austrians off another day , but there were hazards : principally , the Austrians could break either wing , swing behind him and cut him off from the bridge at Hüningen , which was his only escape route back to France . Consequently , that night he withdrew his right wing to the heights of <unk> at 47 ° 43 ′ N 7 ° 37 ′ E , a position scarcely less impregnable than that which it had abandoned . With a strong rear guard provided by Abbatucci and Lariboisière , he abandoned his position the same night and retreated part of the 9 @.@ 7 miles ( 16 km ) to Hüningen . The right and left wings followed . By 3 November he had reached Haltingen and evacuated his troops over the bridge into France . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 With their backs to the river , Ferino and Moreau had to retreat across the Rhine into France , but retained control of the fortifications at Kehl and Hüningen and , more importantly , the tête @-@ du @-@ ponts of the star @-@ shaped fortresses where the bridges crossed the river . Moreau offered an armistice to Charles , which the archduke was inclined to accept . He wanted to secure the Rhine crossings and send troops to northern Italy to relieve Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser at besieged Mantua ; an armistice with Moreau would allow him to do that . However , his brother , Francis II , the Holy Roman Emperor , and the civilian military advisers of the Aulic Council categorically refused such an armistice , forcing Charles to order simultaneous sieges at Kehl and Hüningen . These tied his army to the Rhine for most of the winter . He moved north with the bulk of his force to invest Kehl , and instructed Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg to conduct the siege in the south by Basel . While the Austrians besieged these Rhine crossings , Moreau had sufficient surplus troops to send 14 demi @-@ brigades ( approximately 12 @,@ 000 troops ) into Italy to assist in the siege at Mantua . 
 There are three general sources of Singapore law : legislation , judicial precedents ( case law ) , and custom . 
 Legislation is divided into statutes and subsidiary legislation . Statutes are written laws enacted by the Singapore Parliament , as well as by other bodies that had power to pass laws for Singapore in the past . Statutes enacted by these other bodies may still be in force if they have not been repealed . One particularly important statute is the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore , which is the supreme law of Singapore . Any law the Legislature enacts after the commencement of the Constitution that is inconsistent with it is , to the extent of the inconsistency , void . Subsidiary legislation , also known as " delegated legislation " or " subordinate legislation " , is written law made by ministers or other administrative agencies such as government departments and statutory boards under the authority of a statute ( often called its " parent Act " ) or other lawful authority , and not directly by Parliament . 
 As Singapore is a common law jurisdiction , judgments handed down by the courts are considered a source of law . Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation , or develop principles of common law and equity laid down , not by the legislature , but by previous generations of judges . Major portions of Singapore law , particularly contract law , equity and trust law , property law and tort law , are largely judge @-@ made , though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes . 
 A custom is an established practice or course of behaviour that is regarded by the persons engaged in the practice as law . Customs do not have the force of law unless they are recognized in a case . " Legal " or " trade " customs are not given recognition as law unless they are certain and not unreasonable or illegal . In Singapore , custom is a minor source of law as not many customs have been given judicial recognition .

 Statutes are written laws enacted by the Singapore Parliament , as well as by other bodies such as the British Parliament , Governor @-@ General of India in Council and Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements , which had power to pass laws for Singapore in the past . Statutes enacted by these other bodies may still be in force if they have not been repealed . One particularly important statute is the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore , which is the supreme law of Singapore . Any law the Legislature enacts after the commencement of the Constitution that is inconsistent with it is , to the extent of the inconsistency , void . Statutes of the Singapore Parliament , as well as English statutes in force in Singapore by virtue of the Application of English Law Act 1993 , are published in looseleaf form in a series called the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore , which is gathered in red binders , and are also accessible on @-@ line from Singapore Statutes Online , a free service provided by the Attorney @-@ General 's Chambers of Singapore . 
 Most statutes , apart from amending Acts and certain Acts such as Supply Acts , are assigned chapter numbers ( the word " chapter " is usually abbreviated " Cap . " ) . Revised editions ( abbreviated " Rev. Ed . " ) of statutes that consolidate all amendments to statutes within certain periods of time are published regularly . 
 = = = = Passage of bills through Parliament = = = = 
 A statute of the Singapore Parliament begins its life as a bill , which is usually introduced in Parliament by a government minister . In practice , most legislation is initiated by the Cabinet , either acting on its own or on the advice of senior civil servants . Bills go through the following stages in Parliament : 
 The introduction and first reading . 
 The second reading . 
 The committee stage . 
 The third reading . 
 At the first reading , the bill is introduced into Parliament , usually by the responsible minister . No debate on the bill takes place . The bill is considered has having been read after the MP introducing it has read aloud its long title and laid a copy of it on the Table of the House , and the Clerk of Parliament has read out its short title . Copies of the bill are then distributed to MPs , and it is published in the Government Gazette for the public 's information . The bill is then scheduled for its second reading . If a bill makes substantial , and not merely incidental , provision for : 
 imposing or increasing any tax or abolishing , reducing or remitting any existing tax ; 
 the borrowing of money , or the giving of any guarantee , by the Government , or the amendment of the law relating to the financial obligations of the Government ; 
 the custody of the Consolidated Fund , the charging of any money on the Consolidated Fund or the abolition or alteration of any such charge ; 
 the payment of money into the Consolidated Fund or the payment , issue or withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund of any money not charged on it , or any increase in the amount of such a payment , issue or withdrawal ; or 
 the receipt of any money on account of the Consolidated Fund or the custody or issue of such money , 
 the Minister for Finance must signify that the President has recommended the introduction of the bill , otherwise it may not be introduced in Parliament . 
 On the second reading , the minister responsible for moving the bill usually makes a speech explaining the objects and reasons behind the bill . The general merits and principles of the bill are then debated . 
 The bill then proceeds to the committee stage , where the details of the drafting of the proposed law are examined . Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial , it is referred to a committee of the whole Parliament ; in other words , all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause . Bills that are more controversial , or that require the views of interested groups or the public , are often referred to a select committee . This is a committee of selected MPs who invite interested people to make representations to the committee . Public hearings to hear submissions on the bill may be held . The select committee then reports its findings , together with any suggested amendments to the bill , to Parliament . 
 The bill then goes through a third reading . At this stage , only amendments not of a material character may be made to the bill . The minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill . The bill is then put to the vote . In most cases , a simple majority of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved . However , bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority : not less than two @-@ thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings . 
 = = = = Scrutiny of bills by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights = = = = 
 Once most bills have been passed by Parliament , they must be submitted to a non @-@ elected advisory body called the Presidential Council for Minority Rights ( PCMR ) . The PCMR 's responsibility is to draw attention to any legislation that , in its opinion , is a " differentiating measure " , that is , one that discriminates against any racial or religious community . When the Council makes a favourable report or no report within the time prescribed ( in which case the bill is conclusively presumed not to contain any differentiating measures ) , the bill is presented to the President for assent . 
 If the PCMR submits an adverse report , Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval , or decide to present the bill for the President 's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two @-@ thirds of all MPs . The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it was set up in 1970 . 
 Three types of bills need not be submitted to the PCMR : 
 Money Bills ; 
 Bills the Prime Minister certifies as affecting the defence or security of Singapore , or that relate to public safety , peace or good order in Singapore 
 Bills the Prime Minister certifies are so urgent that it is not in the public interest to delay enactment 
 = = = = Assent to bills by the President = = = = 
 The President generally exercises his constitutional function of assenting to bills in accordance with Cabinet 's advice and does not act in his personal discretion . Therefore , except in certain instances described below , he may not refuse to assent to bills that have been validly passed by Parliament . The words of enactment in Singapore statutes are : " Be it enacted by the President with the advice and consent of the Parliament of Singapore , as follows : " . 
 The President may act in his discretion in withholding assent to any of the following types of bills passed by Parliament : 
 A bill seeking to amend the Constitution that provides , directly or indirectly , for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon the President by the Constitution . 
 A bill not seeking to amend the Constitution that provides , directly or indirectly , for the circumvention or curtailment of the discretionary powers conferred upon the President by the Constitution . 
 A bill that provides , directly or indirectly , for varying , changing or increasing the powers of the Central Provident Fund Board to invest the moneys belonging to the Central Provident Fund . 
 A bill providing , directly or indirectly , for the borrowing of money , the giving of any guarantee or the raising of any loan by the Government if , in the opinion of the President , the bill is likely to draw on reserves of the Government that the Government did not accumulate in its current term of office . 
 A Supply Bill , Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill for any financial year if , in the President 's opinion , the estimates of revenue and expenditure for that year , the supplementary estimates or the statement of excess , as the case may be , are likely to lead to a drawing on the reserves that were not accumulated by the Government during its current term of office . 
 As regards a bill mentioned in paragraph 1 , the President , acting in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet , may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal the question of whether the bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution . If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect , the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal 's opinion is pronounced in open court . On the other hand , if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect , and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill , the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum . In that case , the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two @-@ thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum . If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal , the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30 @-@ day period . The procedure is similar for a bill mentioned in paragraph 2 , except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect , the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum . This ensures that changes to the President 's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes . 
 If the President withholds his assent to any Supply Bill , Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill referred to in paragraph 5 contrary to the recommendation of the Council of Presidential Advisers , Parliament may by resolution passed by not less than two @-@ thirds of the total number of elected MPs overrule the decision of the President . If Parliament does not do so within 30 days of the withholding of assent , it may authorize expenditure or supplementary expenditure , from the Consolidated Fund and Development Fund during the relevant financial year , provided that : 
 where the President withholds his assent to a Supply Bill , the expenditure so authorized for any service or purpose for that financial year cannot exceed the total amount appropriated for that service or purpose in the preceding financial year ; or 
 where the President withholds his assent to a Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill , the expenditure so authorized for any service or purpose shall not exceed the amount necessary to replace an amount advanced from any Contingencies Fund under Article <unk> ( 1 ) of the Constitution for that service or purpose . 
 If 30 days have passed after a Supply Bill , Supplementary Supply Bill or Final Supply Bill has been presented to the President for assent and her or she has not signified the withholding of assent , the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the expiration of the 30 @-@ day period . 
 Upon receiving presidential assent , a bill becomes law and is known as an Act of Parliament . However , the Act only comes into force on the date of its publication in the Government Gazette , or on such other date that is stipulated by the Act or another law , or a notification made under a law .

 Under section 27A ( 1 ) of the Miscellaneous Offences ( Public Order and Nuisance ) Act , it is an offence to appears nude in a public place , or in a private place and is exposed to public view . The penalty is a fine not exceeding $ 2 @,@ 000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both . The reference in sub @-@ section ( 1 ) to a person appearing nude includes a person who is clad in such a manner as to offend against public decency or order . 
 The Penal Code states the elements and penalties of common criminal offences such as homicide , theft and cheating , and also sets out general principles of criminal law in Singapore . 
 The Sale of Goods Act , an English Act made applicable to Singapore by the Application of English Law Act , sets out legal rules relating to the sale and purchase of goods . 
 The Women 's Charter sets out the law relating to marriage , divorce and separation , family violence , and the protection of women and girls . 
 = = = Subsidiary legislation = = = 
 Subsidiary legislation , also known as " delegated legislation " or " subordinate legislation " , is written law made by ministers or other administrative agencies such as government departments and statutory boards under the authority of a statute ( often called its " parent Act " ) or other lawful authority , and not directly by Parliament . Although there is no general requirement ( as there is in the United Kingdom ) for subsidiary legislation to be laid before Parliament for its information , this is usually done in Singapore . 
 Subsidiary legislation is known by a variety of names . Section 2 ( 1 ) of the Interpretation Act defines " subsidiary legislation " as meaning " any order in council , proclamation , rule , regulation , order , notification , by @-@ law or other instrument made under any Act , Ordinance or other lawful authority and having legislative effect " . 
 An Order in Council is a law made directly by the British Crown in the exercise of its prerogative law @-@ making power it previously possessed in respect of Singapore . Orders @-@ in @-@ council are made only on the advice of ministers , and operate subject to provisions made by or under any Act of Parliament . 
 A proclamation is an announcement made by or under the authority of the Crown . 
 Rules are generally legal instruments such as Rules of Court that regulate judicial or other procedure . 
 Regulations are legal instruments implementing the substantive content of Acts of Parliament that have a continuing regulating effect . 
 An order is a legal instrument that has an executive flavour and expresses an obvious command . Often , its effect is limited to a particular moment in time , rather than continuing . 
 A notification is a legal instrument that provides factual information . For example , notifications are used to inform the public of the dates of commencement of statutes and the appointment of individuals to government posts . 
 By @-@ laws are regulations made by certain public and private bodies , for instance , strata title management corporations . Their extent is usually limited to a relatively small geographical area or to the operations of a particular body only . 
 Subsidiary legislation must , unless otherwise expressly provided in any statute , be published in the Government Gazette and , unless expressly provided in the subsidiary legislation itself , takes effect and comes into operation on the date of its publication . 
 No subsidiary legislation made under an Act of Parliament may be inconsistent with the provisions of any Act . This means that any subsidiary legislation that was made ultra vires its parent Act ( that is , the Act did not confer power on the agency to make the subsidiary legislation ) or is not consistent with any other statute is void to the extent of the inconsistency . 
 Subsidiary legislation currently in force in Singapore is published in looseleaf form in a series called the Subsidiary Legislation of the Republic of Singapore , which is gathered in black binders . New subsidiary legislation published in the Gazette may be viewed for free on @-@ line for five days on the Electronic Gazette website .

 Under regulation 16 of the Environmental Public Health ( Public Cleansing ) Regulations made under the Environmental Public Health Act , any person who has urinated or defecated in any sanitary convenience with a flushing system to which the public has access shall flush the sanitary convenience immediately after using it . <unk> of this regulation is an offence punishable : 
 ( a ) for a first offence , to a fine not exceeding $ 1 @,@ 000 and to a further fine not exceeding $ 100 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction ; 
 ( b ) for a second offence , to a fine not exceeding $ 2 @,@ 000 and to a further fine not exceeding $ 200 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction ; and 
 ( c ) for a third or subsequent offence , to a fine not exceeding $ 5 @,@ 000 and to a further fine not exceeding $ 500 for every day or part thereof during which the offence continues after conviction . 
 The Miscellaneous Offences ( Public Order and Nuisance ) ( Assemblies and Processions ) Rules made under the Miscellaneous Offences ( Public Order and Nuisance ) Act require a permit for any public assembly or procession of five or more persons in any public place . The rationale given for this law is that a large group of people who gather for a peaceful purpose can turn violent . In the 1950s and 1960s there were several violent riots in Singapore , the last incident being the 1964 race riots in which 36 people were killed . Although there have only been a few minor protests since then , the authorities continue to take a tough stance against unlicensed outdoor protests . On 31 December 2000 , 15 members of Falun Gong consisting of 13 foreigners and two Singaporeans were arrested at MacRitchie Park for holding an illegal assembly . 
 Public speaking at Speakers ' Corner is regulated by the Public Entertainments and Meetings ( Speakers ' Corner ) ( Exemption ) Order made under the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act . 
 Under regulation 14 of the Rapid Transit Systems Regulations made under the Rapid Transit Systems Act , it is an offence to consume or attempt to consume any food or drinks while in or upon any part of the railway premises except in such places as are designated for this purpose by the Land Transport Authority or its licensee , or consume or attempt to consume any chewing gum or bubble gum while in or upon any part of the railway premises . Regulation 15 makes it an offence to spit , litter or soil any part of the railway premises . The maximum penalties for these offences are fines of up to $ 500 and $ 5 @,@ 000 respectively . 
 The Sale of Food ( Prohibition of Chewing Gum ) Regulations made under the Sale of Food Act prohibits the sale or advertisement for sale of any chewing gum . The prohibition does not apply to the sale or advertisement of any chewing gum in respect of which a product licence has been granted under the Medicines Act . Thus , it is now possible to purchase chewing gum for dental or medical purposes ( for instance , for the purpose of nicotine replacement therapy ) from pharmacies without a prescription . 
 = = Judicial precedents = = 
 As Singapore is a common law jurisdiction , judgments of the courts are considered a source of law . Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation , or develop principles of common law and equity that have been laid down , not by the legislature , but by previous generations of judges . Major portions of Singapore law , particularly contract law , equity and trust law , property law and tort law , are largely judge @-@ made , though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes . 
 Legal certainty and the orderly development of legal principles are promoted by the application of the doctrine of stare decisis , also known as the doctrine of binding precedent . According to this doctrine , the decisions of higher courts are binding on lower courts . Thus , judgments of the Court of Appeal are binding on the High Court , and judgments of both of these superior courts are binding on subordinate courts . A judge is generally not bound by previous decisions made by other judges in courts of the same level . Thus , a judge hearing a High Court case need not follow previous High Court decisions . Nonetheless , courts generally do so as a matter of comity , unless there are good reasons for doing otherwise . As the final appellate court in Singapore , the Court of Appeal is not bound by its previous decisions or those of predecessor courts such as the Privy Council . However , the Court continues to treat such decisions as " normally binding " and only departs from them " where adherence to such prior decisions would cause injustice in a particular case or constrain the development of the law in conformity with the circumstances of Singapore " . Only the ratio decidendi ( that is , the legal principle that determines the outcome ) of a case is binding according to the doctrine of stare decisis ; other legal principles expressed that are not crucial to the final decision ( obiter dicta ) are only persuasive . 
 As English courts do not form part of Singapore 's hierarchy of courts , decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts . However , as a result of Singapore 's colonial heritage , English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive , particularly as regards the development of the common law , and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments . Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law . For instance , Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas . 
 The Constitution provides that the President may refer to a tribunal consisting of not less than three judges of the Supreme Court for its opinion any question as to the effect of any provision of the Constitution that has arisen or appears likely to arise . Where a Constitutional Tribunal has given an opinion , no court has jurisdiction to question the opinion , or the validity of any law the bill for which was the subject of a reference to the Tribunal . 
 During Straits Settlements times , cases pertaining to Singapore appeared in various privately produced and official series of law reports such as <unk> 's Reports ( covering cases decided between 1808 and 1939 ) , the Straits Law Journal ( 1839 – 1891 ) and the Straits Settlements Law Reports ( 1867 – 1942 ) . From 1932 until 1992 , Singapore cases appeared regularly in the Malayan Law Journal ( MLJ ) , the only local series of law reports published continuously since the 1930s , except during World War II . The MLJ is still consulted for Singapore cases decided prior to full independence in 1965 . Since 1992 , judgments of the High Court , Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore have appeared in the Singapore Law Reports ( SLR ) , which is published by the Singapore Academy of Law under an exclusive licence from the Supreme Court of Singapore . The Academy has also republished cases decided since Singapore 's full independence in 1965 that appeared in the MLJ in special volumes of the SLR , and is currently working on a reissue of this body of case law . Cases published in the SLR as well as unreported judgments of the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts are available on @-@ line from a fee @-@ based service called <unk> , which is also managed by the Academy .

 Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) was a landmark Court of Appeal case in administrative law , specifically with regards to reviewing the grounds of detention without trial under the Internal Security Act . One of the main issues before the court was whether the test for judicial review was objective or subjective ; in other words , whether judges could examine whether the executive 's decision to detain a person was in fact based on national security considerations , as well as whether the executive 's considerations in determining the detention fell within the scope of the purposes specified in section 8 ( 1 ) of the Act . The court , in an obiter ruling , advocated the objective standard , stating : " All power has legal limits and the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power . " Although the case was legislatively overruled in respect of internal security matters by amendments to the Constitution of Singapore and the Internal Security Act , the principle still applies in judicial review proceedings not involving the Act . 
 Fay Michael Peter v. Public Prosecutor ( 1994 ) concerned an American teenager , Michael P. Fay , who was arrested in 1994 for vandalizing cars and stealing street signs . He pleaded guilty to two charges of vandalizing by spraying paint on a number of cars . On conviction by a subordinate court , he was sentenced to a total of four months ' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane . For the purposes of sentencing , other charges were taken into consideration , including 16 charges of vandalism involving paint . Fay appealed to the High Court against the sentences , arguing that ( a ) proviso to section 3 of the Vandalism Act required the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the indelible quality of the paint used before caning could be imposed ; ( b ) a probation order was appropriate in this case ; and ( c ) the trial judge below should have ordered a pre @-@ sentencing report with a view to ordering probation . The appeal was dismissed . The case generated intense media interest in the United States , culminating in a formal request from the US Government for the caning sentence not to be carried out . The Singapore Government rejected the request on the basis that foreigners in Singapore could not be held to a different standard from citizens . However , it recommended that the President reduce the caning from six strokes to four . 
 = = Custom = = 
 In law , a custom is an established practice or behaviour that is considered to be law by the persons engaged in it . Customs do not have the force of law unless recognized in a case . " Legal " or " trade " customs are not recognized as law unless they are certain and not unreasonable or illegal . In Singapore , custom is a minor source of law as not many customs have been given judicial recognition . 
 = = = Examples of custom = = = 
 The general reception of English law under the Second Charter of Justice ( see the article " Law of Singapore " ) was subject to three qualifications – one of which was that English law should be modified in application to Singapore so as not to cause injustice or oppression to the indigenous people of the island . Regard was to be had to their religions , usages and manners . This principle generally applied in family law and related matters . Thus in certain early , cases English law was modified by Chinese , Malay and Hindu customary law , and some native usages or customs acquired the force of law . However , the enactment of the Women 's Charter in 1961 has unified the family law for all ethno @-@ religious groups in Singapore except the Muslims , who are separately regulated by the Administration of Muslim Law Act . 
 Where Malay Muslims are concerned , the application of Muslim law is modified by Malay custom as regards marriage , divorce and the distribution of the estate of an intestate person . In fact , Muslim customary law and the Malay custom applicable to Malay Muslims appear to be the only strands of customary law that continue to have some significance in Singapore .

 = 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry = 
 The 22nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union army during the American Civil War . The 22nd Massachusetts was organized by Senator Henry Wilson ( future Vice @-@ President during the Ulysses Grant administration ) and was therefore known as " Henry Wilson 's Regiment . " It was formed in Boston , Massachusetts , and established on September 28 , 1861 , for a term of three years . 
 Arriving in Washington in October 1861 , the regiment spent the following winter in camp at Hall 's Hill , near Arlington in Virginia . It became part of the Army of the Potomac , with which it would be associated for its entire term of service . The regiment saw its first action during the Siege of Yorktown in April 1862 . It was involved in the Peninsular Campaign , particularly the Battle of Gaines ' Mill during which it suffered its worst casualties ( numerically ) of the war . Their worst casualties in terms of percentages took place during the Battle of Gettysburg ( 60 percent ) . The 22nd Massachusetts was present for virtually all of the major battles in which the Army of the Potomac fought , including the Second Battle of Bull Run , the Battle of Antietam , the Battle of Fredericksburg , the Battle of Chancellorsville , the Battle of Gettysburg and Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant 's Overland Campaign . The 22nd was especially proficient in skirmish drill and was frequently deployed in that capacity throughout the war . 
 During the Siege of Petersburg in October 1864 , the 22nd Massachusetts was removed from the lines and sent home to Massachusetts . Of the 1 @,@ 100 who initially belonged to the unit , only 125 returned at the end of their three years of service . Of these losses , roughly 300 were killed in action or died from wounds received in action , approximately 500 were discharged due to wounds or disease , and approximately 175 were lost or discharged due to capture , resignation , or desertion . 
 = = Organization and early duty = = 
 Henry Wilson , a Senator from Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate 's Committee on Military Affairs , witnessed the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21 , 1861 . The disastrous defeat of the Union army convinced Wilson , and the federal government in general , of the urgent need for more troops . Immediately after the battle , Wilson promised both President Abraham Lincoln and Massachusetts Governor John Andrew that he would raise a full brigade including units of infantry , artillery , cavalry and sharpshooters . 
 Wilson 's prestige encouraged the almost immediate formation of more than a dozen companies of infantry in and around Boston . The pressing need to send troops to the front required Wilson to abandon his original intention of raising multiple regiments of infantry and he instead selected the 10 companies closest to readiness , thus creating the 22nd Massachusetts Regiment . To this regiment were attached the 3rd Massachusetts Light Artillery and the 2nd Company Massachusetts Sharpshooters . Thus , the 22nd Massachusetts became one of the few infantry units in the Civil War with attached artillery and sharpshooters . 
 Many of the officers of the 22nd , and some of the enlisted men , had just completed an enlistment with early war regiments ( the so @-@ called " ninety day regiments " ) , including the 5th Massachusetts and the 6th Massachusetts . Five of the 10 companies were recruited in Boston . The remaining five came from Taunton , Roxbury , Woburn , Cambridge and Haverhill . 
 The regiment was signed into existence by Gov. Andrew on September 28 , 1861 . Wilson was appointed its first colonel . The recruits of the 22nd Massachusetts trained at a camp in <unk> , Massachusetts , during September and left for the front , numbering 1 @,@ 117 , on October 8 , 1861 . Traveling by railroad , the regiment paused in New York City , marching down Fifth Avenue , and was received with a formal ceremony and the presentation of a national battle flag made by a committee of the ladies of New York . 
 The 22nd arrived in Washington on October 11 , and on October 13 , marched across the Potomac to go into winter camp at Halls Hill , just outside Arlington , Virginia . Here the Army of the Potomac was organized during the winter of 1861 – 1862 . The 22nd became part of Brig. Gen. John H. Martindale 's brigade and was initially attached to the III Corps . 
 On October 28 , 1861 , Col. Wilson resigned his command , turning the regiment over to Col. Jesse Gove . Gove , a Regular Army officer , had seen service in the Mexican – American War . He was a strict disciplinarian and , according to John Parker ( the regimental historian ) Gove soon became the " idol of the regiment " . During its first winter of service , the 22nd remained at Hall 's Hill and became proficient in military drill . 
 = = Peninsular Campaign = = 
 Major General George B. McClellan , commanding the Army of the Potomac , determined to take the Confederate capital of Richmond via the Virginia Peninsula . This unexpected move would , in theory , allow McClellan 's army to move quickly up the peninsula rather than fighting through Northern Virginia . During March 1862 , the Army of the Potomac was gradually transferred by water to Fortress Monroe at the end of the Virginia Peninsula . On March 10 , 1862 , the 22nd left their winter camp and were shipped to Fortress Monroe . By April 4 , the regiment began to advance , along with many other elements of the Army of the Potomac , up the peninsula . 
 = = = Siege of Yorktown = = = 
 As Union forces approached Yorktown , Virginia they encountered defensive lines established by Confederate Major General John B. Magruder . Initially , Magruder 's forces numbered only 11 @,@ 000 with McClellan 's numbering 53 @,@ 000 . McClellan also had the rest of the Army of the Potomac en route and Union troops outside of Yorktown would soon number more than 100 @,@ 000 . Despite this , McClellan believed he faced a much larger force and settled in for a month @-@ long siege of Yorktown . 
 The 22nd Massachusetts saw their first action of the war near Yorktown on April 5 , 1862 , as the regiment was ordered to probe the Confederate lines . During the action , a portion of the regiment deployed as skirmishers under fire with great precision . The 22nd 's reputation for expertise at skirmish drill would continue throughout the war and the regiment would frequently be used in this capacity . Over the course of the month @-@ long siege , the 22nd was encamped near Wormley Creek approximately 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) southeast of Yorktown , frequently forming up at a moment 's notice in expectation of an attack . On May 4 , the Confederates evacuated their lines , retreating towards Richmond . The 22nd was on picket duty when rumors of the evacuation began to circulate . Colonel Gove determined to investigate and advanced the 22nd towards the Confederate trenches . According to the regimental historian , Gove was the first Union soldier to mount the Confederate works and the 22nd 's flag was the first planted on the ramparts outside of Yorktown . 
 Over the next three weeks , McClellan pushed his army northwest up the Peninsula towards Richmond . The 22nd traveled by steamship and by foot , eventually reaching Gaines ' Mill , Virginia where they set up camp on May 26 , 1862 , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) northeast of Richmond . During this movement , the V Corps of the Union army was formed and the 22nd became part of the 1st Brigade , 1st Division , V Corps . The regiment would remain a part of the V Corps for the duration of their service . 
 = = = Battle of Gaines ' Mill = = = 
 After seeing minor action in the Battle of Hanover Court House on May 27 , the 22nd remained in camp at Gaines ' Mill for nearly a month as McClellan positioned his army for an assault on Richmond . The men of the 22nd could see the steeples of Richmond from their camp . By this time , the regiment had been reduced to roughly 750 men due to sickness over the course of the campaign and minor casualties in action . 
 On June 25 , 1862 , McClellan ordered an ineffective offensive triggering the Seven Days Battles . On June 26 , General Robert E. Lee , who had recently taken command of the Army of Northern Virginia , launched a daring counter @-@ offensive intended to drive McClellan 's army away from Richmond . For the 22nd , the third day of the Seven Days Battles , the Battle of Gaines ' Mill , proved to be devastating as they suffered their worst casualties of the war . 
 On June 27 , 1862 , the V Corps , including the 22nd , pulled back to Gaines ' Mill after successfully repulsing the Confederate counter @-@ offensive at Mechanicsville . Although McClellan regarded Mechanicsville as a victory , he had lost the initiative to Lee and was already pulling his army away from Richmond despite holding the advantage of numbers . During the Battle of Gaines ' Mill , the 22nd was held in reserve , behind the other regiments of their brigade . Over the course of the day , the Union regiments in their front successfully repulsed several Confederate charges . But at 6 p.m. , the Union lines broke and the 22nd was suddenly exposed to the brunt of the Confederate attack . With the 22nd flanked on both sides , Colonel Gove soon gave the order to retire . Then , reluctant to yield the ground , he ordered the 22nd to about face and stand fast . Colonel Gove was killed almost immediately after delivering this order . His body was never recovered . Captain John Dunning , commanding Company D , was also killed . In the subsequent fighting the 22nd lost 71 killed , 86 wounded and 177 captured . Maj. William S. Tilton was captured and later paroled . With Lieutenant Colonel Charles Griswold on sick leave , command fell to Captain Walter S. Sampson . The 22nd eventually fell back to a ridge where they were able to make a stand with the 3rd Massachusetts Battery . 
 The regimental historian wrote , " It was a sad night for the Twenty @-@ second . Not a man but had lost a comrade , for one @-@ half of those who marched in the morning were no longer in the ranks . Colonel Gove was killed and that was , without a doubt , one of the greatest disasters of the day . " The 22nd Massachusetts and the 83rd Pennsylvania suffered roughly the same casualty rate and the two regiments lost more men killed in action than any other units on the field that day . Both regiments lost their colonels . 
 = = = Battle of Malvern Hill = = = 
 The 22nd played little role in the next three days of fighting , with the exception of brief action during the Battle of Glendale during which the regiment supported the 3rd Massachusetts Battery and was credited with saving the battery from capture . By June 30 , the regiment was encamped near Malvern Hill with the rest of the V Corps . The Army of the Potomac had retreated roughly 15 miles ( 24 km ) during a running fight over the past six days and was suffering low morale . However , by July 1 , the Union army was in a strong position and , that day , during the Battle of Malvern Hill , the Army of the Potomac finally stopped Lee 's offensive . The 22nd , during this action , was ordered to support the 5th United States Battery . While firing in line with the battery , the men of the 22nd sang " John Brown 's Body " and exhausted their 60 rounds of ammunition . After they were pulled off the line , the 22nd marched through the night to Harrison 's Landing . The regiment lost nine killed , 41 wounded and eight prisoners during the Battle of Malvern Hill , roughly 20 percent . 
 = = Northern Virginia Campaign = = 
 On July 15 , 1862 , while the 22nd was still in camp at Harrison 's Landing , Lieutenant Colonel Griswold returned from sick leave , was promoted to colonel and took command of the regiment . On August 14 , the regiment broke camp and marched with the V Corps to Newport News , Virginia . McClellan had abandoned his Peninsular Campaign and had been ordered to move the Army of the Potomac back to Northern Virginia to support the advance of a newly organized Union army , the Army of Virginia , under the command of Major General John Pope . The 22nd was transported by steamship to <unk> Creek , Virginia , by railroad to Fredericksburg , and by August 28 they had marched with the V Corps to Gainesville , Virginia . In the course of this march , the 22nd was detached from their brigade and assigned to picket duty . As a result , the regiment played no role in the subsequent Second Battle of Bull Run on August 30 , 1862 , in which the rest of their brigade was heavily engaged . 
 Following the disastrous defeat of Pope 's army at the Second Battle of Bull Run , the Army of the Potomac , with McClellan still in command , was quickly reorganized outside of Washington during the first week of September 1862 . The 22nd returned to their old camp at Halls Hill , Virginia , which they had occupied the previous winter . Sen. Wilson visited the 22nd at Halls Hill . Finding just 200 war @-@ torn men in contrast to the 1 @,@ 100 he had recruited , Wilson , with tears in his eyes , asked , " Is this my old regiment ? " 
 = = Maryland Campaign = = 
 The 22nd did not stay long at Halls Hill . With the Army of the Potomac in disarray and the Confederates on the offensive , an attack on Washington was expected at any moment . The 22nd was shifted to several different defensive entrenchments outside of Arlington , Virginia during the first week of September . Lee , however , set out to invade Western Maryland , the lead elements of his army crossing the Potomac on September 4 , 1862 . McClellan was slow to react to this development , but began moving elements of the Army of the Potomac northwest from Washington on September 6 . On September 10 , Lieutenant Colonel Tilton , having been released from Libby Prison through an officer exchange , returned to the 22nd and took command . The 22nd left Arlington on September 12 . The march through Maryland was remembered by the 22nd as wearisome and profoundly dusty . 
 = = = Battle of Antietam = = = 
 As the Union army approached , Lee chose to make a stand at Sharpsburg , Maryland along Antietam Creek . On September 17 , 1862 , the armies engaged in the Battle of Antietam . The V Corps was held in reserve in the center of Union lines during the battle . The 22nd had a clear view of both flanks of the Union army and watched the assaults that took place over the course of the day . The V Corps , however , took no part in these assaults . Historians have criticized McClellan for his uncoordinated attacks at Antietam and for not committing the V Corps which might have broken Lee 's army . 
 = = = Battle of Shepherdstown = = = 
 Lee evacuated Sharpsburg on September 18 , retreating towards Virginia . The 22nd , with other regiments of its corps , moved through the town the next day . As the Confederate army crossed over the Potomac , two divisions of the V Corps , including the 22nd Massachusetts , were ordered to cross into Virginia via Blackford 's Ford at Shepherdstown , Virginia ( now West Virginia ) . The movement was an ineffective attempt on McClellan 's part to prevent the escape of Lee 's army . The pursuing Union forces were hit with a decisive Confederate counterattack at the Battle of Shepherdstown on September 20 , 1862 , causing the Union divisions to quickly retreat in disorder back across the Potomac . The 22nd struggled across the river and reached the Maryland shore " half drowned " . The engagement ended any efforts by McClellan to pursue Lee 's army . 
 = = Fredericksburg Campaign = = 
 The 22nd Massachusetts remained in camp on the Maryland side of the Potomac for more than a month . On October 30 , 1862 , the 22nd broke camp and began marching south into Virginia . On November 5 , Lincoln removed McClellan from command of the Army of the Potomac and replaced him with Major General Ambrose Burnside . The army moved to Falmouth , Virginia , where Burnside spent weeks orchestrating his attack on Fredericksburg just across the Rappahannock River . 
 = = = Battle of Fredericksburg = = = 
 The Army of the Potomac , having constructed pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock , commenced the Battle of Fredericksburg on the morning of December 13 , 1862 . The Confederate army occupied the city of Fredericksburg and a high ridge behind the city known as Marye 's Heights . By late morning , Union forces had taken the city and began the assault on Marye 's Heights . At approximately 3 : 30 in the afternoon the 22nd Massachusetts , with the rest of Colonel James Barnes 's brigade , crossed one of the pontoon bridges and moved through a railroad cut to the outskirts of the city . The regiment numbered about 200 men . Barnes 's brigade was ordered to relieve a brigade of the IX Corps which had made a charge on the stone wall along Marye 's Heights and become pinned down by Confederate fire . By the time they formed up battle lines on the open slope in front of Marye 's Heights , the 22nd was under intense artillery fire from the Confederates . According to the regimental historian , " the men instinctively turned their sides to the storm " of bullets , shot and shell as they advanced and casualties were heavy . Their brigade reached Nagle 's brigade and the 22nd relieved the 12th Rhode Island , taking shelter on ground covered by that regiment 's casualties . Here the 22nd fired in prone position , exhausting their ammunition , yelling and cheering to keep up their courage . 
 Around nightfall , the 22nd was relieved by the 20th Maine . Falling back to a sunken road on the outskirts of Fredericksburg , the 22nd was still exposed to Confederate artillery and took cover as best they could . Many of the regiment had thrown away their haversacks in an effort to lighten their burden before the charge and were subsequently without food . During the night , they resorted to searching the haversacks of fallen soldiers for rations . 
 Just before dawn on December 14 , ammunition was issued and the 22nd moved forward slightly , to about the position on the open slope that they had occupied the day before . Here they spent another day pinned to the ground , unable to advance or retire due to the constant fire of Confederate riflemen . Nightfall finally brought relief as another unit took their place on the field and the 22nd retired to the city of Fredericksburg . 
 The 22nd spent the next day , December 15 , in the city of Fredericksburg , hearing rumors that Burnside intended to personally lead another assault on the heights . But no attack materialized , night came , and the V Corps crossed the pontoon bridges back to Falmouth , with the 22nd acting as rear guard . During the battle of <unk> , the 22nd lost 12 killed and 42 wounded , roughly 28 percent casualties . 
 = = Camp Gove = = 
 The 22nd set up winter camp on the outskirts of Falmouth , Virginia on December 22 , 1862 . The camp was located about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) northeast of Stoneman 's Station , now known as <unk> Station . The men built crude log huts with improvised chimneys made of mud and sticks . Here the regiment would remain for approximately six months during the first half of 1863 . The camp was named " Camp Gove " in honor of their fallen colonel . 
 While at Camp Gove , the 22nd Massachusetts , with the rest of the V Corps , was frequently deployed on expeditions of varying importance . On January 20 , 1863 , the regiment took part in the infamous Mud March during which Burnside attempted to attack the flank of the Confederate army which was still encamped at Fredericksburg . The roads were so impassable that the Union army bogged down and the entire effort was aborted . The 22nd returned to Camp Gove five days after they left . 
 The 22nd also participated , in a minor capacity , in the Battle of Chancellorsville . On April 27 , Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin 's division , including the 22nd , was ordered to secure the fords along the Rapidan River . It was a long , rapid , forced march for the division . The Confederate army launched a daring and successful flank attack against the Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville on May 2 , 1863 , during which the 22nd saw little action . The Union army , badly defeated , retreated back across the Rappahannock and the 22nd returned to Camp Gove on May 8 . 
 In late May , Colonel Tilton of the 22nd was promoted to the command of the brigade and Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Sherwin assumed command of the 22nd . 
 = = Gettysburg Campaign = = 
 On May 28 , 1863 , the 22nd Massachusetts packed up and left Camp Gove . Their corps was deployed along the Rappahannock , upriver of Fredericksburg , as an observation force to determine what movements were being made by Lee 's army . In this , they were unsuccessful . Lee 's army slipped away from Fredericksburg on June 3 and began a long march that would lead to an invasion of Pennsylvania . The 22nd learned of Lee 's movements on June 13 when the V Corps was ordered to march northward . By this time , the entire Army of the Potomac was on the move . The two armies would eventually meet , almost three weeks later , at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . 
 = = = Battle of Gettysburg = = = 
 By June 30 , 1863 , the 22nd had reached Union Mills , Maryland after weeks of hard marching . On July 1 , they marched 10 miles ( 16 km ) to Hanover , Pennsylvania , completely unaware that elements of the Army of the Potomac had engaged the Confederates some 15 miles ( 24 km ) away in the first day of fighting during the Battle of Gettysburg . Not long after they settled down for the evening , orders came for them to march . The 22nd , and the rest of the V Corps , marched through the night to Gettysburg , reaching the battle around dawn on July 2 . The V Corps was stationed well behind the center of the Union lines , awaiting deployment to one flank or the other . The men of the 22nd fell to the ground and caught a few hours sleep even as the second morning of battle raged not far from their position . At Gettysburg , the regiment had only 67 men . 
 At about 4 p.m. , the V Corps was ordered to advance in support of the III Corps . Barnes 's division passed north of Little Round Top and deployed just south of the Wheatfield along a small , stony hill within sight of the Rose <unk> which was directly in their front . Once deployed , the soldiers of the 22nd began to pile paper cartridges on the ground in front of them , sensing they would be holding that ground for some time . 
 As the III Corps retreated , Tilton 's brigade was directly exposed to the oncoming Confederates . The 22nd was soon engaged by Kershaw 's brigade of South Carolinians . Apparently unnerved by the sudden Confederate advance and perceiving that his right flank was exposed , Brig. Gen. Barnes , the 22nd 's division commander , ordered the withdrawal of his division . The men of the 22nd picked up their cartridges and yielded the ground . This withdrawal back across the Wheatfield to <unk> 's Farm left a gap in the Union line . Barnes and Tilton were both subject to much criticism from other officers on the field for this withdrawal , which Barnes apparently ordered without consulting his superiors . The gap left by Barnes 's division was eventually filled by brigades of the II Corps after hard The 22nd fought from their new position along a stone wall on <unk> 's Farm and was eventually pulled back to the north side of Little Round Top by about 6 p.m. 
 On the third and final day of the Battle of Gettysburg , the 22nd was posted in the ravine between Little Round Top and Big Round Top . The ground was heavily wooded and rocky . Here they piled up stones and took shelter from the Confederate sharpshooters in Devil 's Den about 500 yards ( 460 m ) to their front . The regiment remained in this position while Pickett 's Charge , Lee 's unsuccessful attempt to break Union lines , took place well north of the 22nd 's position . 
 During the Battle of Gettysburg , the regiment suffered 15 killed and 25 wounded or 60 percent . In terms of percentages , this represented the regiment 's highest number of casualties in an individual battle . 
 = = Camp Barnes = = 
 On September 9 , 1863 , the 22nd was reinforced by 200 draftees , once again fielding respectable numbers . During the latter half of 1863 , the 22nd was involved in some minor engagements along the Rappahannock River including the Second Battle of Rappahannock Station and the Battle of Mine Run . No significant progress was made by the Army of the Potomac that fall , and the 22nd settled into a camp near Brandy Station , Virginia which they named " Camp Barnes " after their division commander who had been wounded at Gettysburg . In March 1864 , Col. Tilton was relieved of command of his brigade and returned to the command of the 22nd Massachusetts . 
 = = Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg = = 
 On April 30 , 1864 , the 22nd broke camp and marched southeast from Rappahannock Station . Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant had now assumed command of Union forces as general @-@ in @-@ chief and although Major General George Meade remained in command of the Army of the Potomac , Grant was determined to follow the army in the field , directing its movements . The resulting campaign during the spring of 1864 was known as the Overland Campaign and saw relentless attacks on the part of the Union army under Grant . The reinforced 22nd began the campaign with about 300 men . By the close of the campaign , the regiment would be reduced to about 100 . 
 During the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5 – 6 , 1864 , the regiment lost 15 killed and 36 wounded . The regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle of Spotsylvania on May 9 – 10 . On May 10 , the 22nd was ordered to take a line of rifle pits that had been abandoned by Union troops and taken by the Confederates . The 22nd deployed as skirmishers under the command of Major Mason Burt and advanced under heavy fire . The regiment was successful in taking the Confederate position , but at a heavy cost of 17 killed and 57 wounded , nearly 50 percent . During the Battles of North Anna and <unk> Creek , the 22nd acted again as skirmishers , winning praise for their maneuvers in advance of their division . 
 By this time , Grant had pushed Lee 's army south to within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of Richmond . The final assault of the Overland Campaign came with the Battle of Cold Harbor — a number of futile attempts by Grant over the course of June 1 – 3 to break the heavily entrenched Confederate lines . The 22nd was active during all three days of the battle , particularly on June 3 when they were again deployed as skirmishers in front of their brigade , now commanded by Col. Jacob B. Sweitzer , in the vicinity of Bethesda Church . Sweitzer 's brigade , with the 22nd in the advance , made a charge across open ground , pushing back the Confederate forces in their front . During the Battle of Cold Harbor , the 22nd lost 11 killed and 11 wounded , now numbering less than 100 . 
 Lee 's army now dug in around Petersburg , Virginia and the long Siege of Petersburg commenced with several frontal assaults on the Confederate position . The 22nd took part in the assault on June 18 , 1864 . Again the regiment was deployed as skirmishers in front of their brigade . They were ordered to take a ravine alongside the Norfolk Railroad . Advancing at a run in the face of heavy canister fire , the 22nd reached the ravine . However , in that position they were subjected to severe musket and artillery fire from the Confederates , and so they pushed forward to the Norfolk Railroad cut , forcing the Confederates back to their entrenchments . In the assault on Petersburg , the 22nd lost seven killed and 14 wounded . 
 During the latter part of June 1864 , the 22nd was marched to several different positions along the siege lines outside of Petersburg , expecting to participate in another assault . Finally , around June 30 , 1864 , the regiment was stationed in the trenches and remained there for six weeks . 
 = = Mustering out = = 
 On August 8 , 1864 , the 22nd was pulled from the trenches and posted on guard duty at City Point , Virginia , the main supply depot of the Union army . Maj. Gen. Meade had specifically requested a depleted unit whose term of service was nearly up for this duty . They remained there until October 3 , their three years of service having expired . Those of the regiment who had chosen to re @-@ enlist , along with the remaining draftees who had joined the unit in 1863 , were consolidated with the 32nd Massachusetts . The remaining men of the 22nd who had served their three years and did not wish to re @-@ enlist , 125 in number , returned to Boston by railroad , arriving on October 10 . After ceremonies in Boston , the regiment was officially mustered out on October 17 , 1864 .

 = = = Notable members = = = 
 After the war , several former members of the 22nd Massachusetts went on to achieve notable accomplishments in various fields . 
 Senator Henry Wilson , founder of the unit , was well known during the war for his antislavery political stance . After the war , he became one of the leading Radical Republicans in Congress , pressing for civil rights for former slaves and harsh treatment of former Confederates . In 1872 , the same year he was elected Vice @-@ President under Ulysses Grant , Wilson published the first volume of his History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power , a severe criticism of slave owners and their primary role , according to Wilson , in bringing about the Civil War . 
 Nelson A. Miles joined the 22nd Massachusetts as a first lieutenant but was soon transferred . In 1862 , he became colonel of the 61st New York Infantry . After the war , Miles became a colonel in the Regular Army and steadily rose through the ranks , ultimately becoming the Commanding General of the United States Army in 1895 . 
 Arthur Soden served as a hospital steward with the 22nd Massachusetts . After the war , he went on to become an influential figure during the formative years of Major League Baseball as president of the Boston Red Stockings and , briefly , as the president of the National League . 
 Marshall S. Pike was a well @-@ known singer , poet and songwriter before the war . He served as drum major for the 22nd regimental band and was taken captive at the battle of Gaines ' Mill . After his release in December 1862 , he was discharged and resumed his career as an entertainer and songwriter . 
 = = = Regimental Association = = = 
 As the remains of the regiment were en route back to Boston in October 1864 , the officers met to form a regimental association to organize annual reunions of the officers . These reunions were eventually opened to enlisted men and the reunions became large events . In 1870 , the regimental association was more formally organized with the election of officers and the establishment of by @-@ laws . Its purpose was " to preserve the history and perpetuate [ the 22nd 's ] deeds and their men " . The reunions were typically held at the Parker House in Boston . The association organized a number of projects in honor of the 22nd 's former members including placing a bust of Henry Wilson in the Massachusetts State House and the construction , in 1885 , of the 22nd Massachusetts regimental monument near the Wheatfield on the Gettysburg battlefield .

 Richard Hugh " Richie " McCaw <unk> ( born 31 December 1980 ) is a former New Zealand rugby union player , who captained the All Blacks – the country 's national team – in 110 out of his 148 test matches . He is the most capped test rugby player of all time . 
 McCaw predominantly played in the openside flanker position for the New Zealand , Crusaders and Canterbury teams , but had also played as blindside flanker and no . 8 . McCaw has won the World Rugby player of the year award a record three times ( equal with Dan Carter ) . His ability to anticipate play and adaptability to referee 's law interpretations are two of his key attributes . He was raised in <unk> in rural North Otago , before moving to Dunedin in 1994 to board at Otago Boys ' High School . In 1999 he moved to Christchurch to study at Lincoln University and was selected in the national under @-@ 19 team . The following year he played for the Under @-@ 21s and Canterbury in the National Provincial Championship ( NPC ) , before debuting in 2001 for the Crusaders in Super Rugby . 
 He was selected for the All Blacks ' 2001 end @-@ of @-@ year tour , despite having played only eight minutes of Super 12 rugby . His debut for New Zealand was against Ireland , where he was awarded man @-@ of @-@ the @-@ match and was selected as New Zealand 's first choice openside flanker for the 2003 World Cup . McCaw became a regular selection for New Zealand , only missing a few games due to recurring concussions . In 2006 he was appointed captain of the All Blacks – who he led at the 2007 World Cup . After their elimination in the quarter @-@ finals , his captaincy came under criticism , but he was retained and eventually led the team to consecutive world cup titles in the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cups , becoming one of only twenty dual Rugby Union World Cup winners . 
 During McCaw 's career , Canterbury won the NPC ( later ITM Cup ) five times , and the Crusaders have reached the Super Rugby semi @-@ finals nine times , going on to win the final on four of these occasions . Since his debut , the All Blacks have won seven Tri @-@ Nations titles , completed three successful Grand Slam tours and won the Bledisloe Cup eight times . In 2010 McCaw played his 100th Super Rugby game , made a record @-@ equalling 94th test appearance for his country , and became New Zealand 's most capped All Black captain – leading the side in 87 test matches , making him the highest capped test Captain in Rugby Union history . In 2010 his contract was NZ $ 750 @,@ 000 per year , making him the equal highest paid player in New Zealand . In the 2011 World Cup Pool game against France , McCaw became the first All Black to reach 100 caps . On 23 October , McCaw led his team to their second World Cup title in 24 years by beating France 8 – 7 in the final . In 2012 , after the win against the Springboks in Soweto , McCaw became the first rugby union player to win 100 tests – while at the time only having lost 12 games . 
 McCaw is the most @-@ capped player in rugby union history with 148 caps , having overtaken former Irish centre Brian O 'Driscoll 's record in 2015 . McCaw has also equaled the record for most appearances at the Rugby World Cup with English prop Jason Leonard . 
 His autobiography , Richie McCaw : The Open Side , was co @-@ written with Greg McGee and released on 9 October 2012 . In the United Kingdom and United States the book is titled The Real McCaw . It includes some criticism of Wayne Barnes ' appointment as the referee for the All Blacks ' 2007 Rugby World Cup quarter @-@ final , and gives McCaw 's perspective of the coaching appointment of Graham Henry over Robbie Deans . 
 TVNZ announced on July 6 , 2016 that a film about McCaw 's life is to be released in cinemas on September 1 , 2016 . The film , titled Chasing Great , is written and directed by Michelle Walshe and Justin Pemberton . 
 = = Early years = = 
 McCaw 's great @-@ great @-@ grandfather immigrated to New Zealand , from the Scottish Borders in 1893 , and settled in the <unk> Valley , South Canterbury . McCaw 's father still works the family farm and his mother is a local teacher . On New Year 's Eve 1980 , Richard Hugh McCaw was born in the nearby town of Oamaru . He grew up on his parents ' farm along with his sister Joanna . McCaw started flying gliders with his grandfather , a Tempest pilot during World War II credited with shooting down 20 V1 missiles , when he was nine years old . He played rugby for the local <unk> rugby club as a youngster , but it was not until 1994 , when he boarded at Otago Boys ' High School in Dunedin , that he started to take the game seriously . 
 In his last year at Otago Boys High , McCaw was head boy , <unk> accessit ( runner up ) to the dux and played in the school 's top rugby team . McCaw came to the attention of national selectors during a 5 @-@ all draw with Rotorua Boys ' High School in the 1998 New Zealand secondary schools rugby final in Christchurch . However , he failed to make the New Zealand Secondary Schools Team , losing out to Sam Harding , Angus McDonald and Hale T @-@ Pole . With Sam Harding moving south to study at the University of Otago , McCaw headed to Christchurch 's Lincoln University to study agricultural science and pursue his rugby interests . He achieved all but two papers for his Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree before rugby became his life . He received an honorary doctorate on recognition of his sporting achievements in April 2012 . 
 In 1999 , McCaw was selected in the New Zealand under @-@ 19 squad ( coached by Mark Shaw ) , which won the world championship in Wales . During that series , McCaw realised his All Blacks dream could be attainable . The following year he was selected in the New Zealand under @-@ 21 squad and debuted for Canterbury in the National Provincial Championship ( NPC ) against North Harbour . On 31 March 2001 , he made his Super Rugby debut with the Crusaders , playing a few minutes in a losing effort against the Hurricanes . That year he only played twice for the Crusaders , both times as a substitute , for a total of just eight minutes playing time . He did however play a full season with NPC champions Canterbury and captained the New Zealand Under 21s . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = International debut = = = 
 Although the then 20 @-@ year @-@ old McCaw had only played seventeen matches for Canterbury , John Mitchell , the new All Black coach , selected him for the 2001 end of year tour to Ireland , Scotland and Argentina . This led Josh Kronfeld , a former All Black openside flanker , to criticise the selection : " You might as well just give All Black jerseys to everybody . The fact they picked guys off one NPC season is bloody incredible " . 
 McCaw 's debut international test was against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on 17 November 2001 . His first touch of the game resulted in a knock @-@ on when he was hit in a tackle and New Zealand were trailing the Irish 16 – 7 at half @-@ time . In the second half the All Blacks recovered to win 40 – 29 and McCaw was named man of the match , receiving a standing ovation at the post @-@ match function . A turning point came in the second half when McCaw was able to steal the ball from Ireland , which led to a try to left wing Jonah Lomu . After the match McCaw recalled the experience : " it was a hell of a stadium to play at , a real rugby stadium , a big crowd – something I 'll always remember , very special . " 
 McCaw played all three tests on the tour , with the All Blacks beating Scotland 37 – 6 and winning 24 – 20 against Argentina . At the end of season rugby awards , McCaw was selected as both the New Zealand Rugby Football Union Under @-@ 21 and Air New Zealand NPC Division One Player of the Year . 
 = = = 2002 – 03 = = = 
 In the lead @-@ up to the 2003 World Cup McCaw was a regular player for Canterbury , the Crusaders and the All Blacks . In 2002 and 2003 the Crusaders competed in the Super Rugby final , beating the Brumbies in 2002 and losing to the Blues in 2003 . The Canterbury provincial rugby team lost the semi final to the eventual winners Auckland in 2002 . McCaw and the other All Blacks were " rested " during the 2003 national provincial championship . 
 In 2002 McCaw played for the All Blacks against the touring Ireland team ( 15 – 6 and 40 – 8 victories ) and in the Tri Nations against Australia and South Africa . Of the six 2002 test matches McCaw played in , five were won by New Zealand with the only loss to Australia . The 14 – 16 loss occurred in New Zealand 's third Tri Nations match and ensured the Bledisloe Cup stayed with Australia . During the All Blacks match against South Africa in Durban a pitch invader attacked Irish referee David McHugh as a scrum was being set , dislocating his shoulder in the process . McCaw and A.J. Venter wrestled the assailant off the referee and , according to McHugh , if they had not got involved his shoulder would have been broken . McCaw was rested , along with 20 other members of the Tri Nations squad , from the 2002 end @-@ of @-@ year tour to Europe . 
 In 2002 McCaw was voted as Newcomer of the Year by the International Rugby Players Association . This award is voted on by all international players , with players not allowed to vote for members of their own team . 
 After another successful campaign with the Crusaders in 2003 ( reaching the Super 12 finals ) , McCaw was again selected as first choice openside flanker for the All Blacks . In June he was involved in a narrow 13 – 15 defeat at home to England , was a non @-@ playing reserve in a 55 – 3 victory against Wales and played in a 31 – 23 win over France . The 2003 All Blacks retained the Tri Nations title , regained the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 1997 and were ranked second behind England leading into the World Cup . 
 McCaw was selected as openside flanker for the 2003 All Blacks World Cup squad and played in every game at the tournament . New Zealand won all their pool games and beat South Africa in the quarter finals to qualify for a semi @-@ final match @-@ up against Australia . In an upset , the Australians defeated the All Blacks , knocking them out of the tournament . At the end of the season awards McCaw received the Kel Tremain Trophy for the New Zealand Rugby Union player of the year .

 The Crusaders finished as runner @-@ ups in the 2004 Super 12 season , losing the final to the Brumbies . Following the World Cup , John Mitchell was dropped as All Black coach and replaced by Graham Henry . McCaw was selected as first choice openside flanker and made vice captain . In the first test against England he was escorted off the field after suffering concussion following a clash of heads with fellow All Black Xavier Rush . He was a late withdrawal from the second England test and then played 70 minutes against Argentina before again leaving the field due to dizziness . Still suffering headaches a month later , he withdrew from the rest of the home campaign and the 2004 Tri Nations to focus on recovery . McCaw returned to captain Canterbury to the finals at the tail end of the NPC season . In November 2004 he returned for the All Blacks ' end @-@ of @-@ season tour to Italy , Wales and France . He was made captain at the age of 23 for the first time against Wales as regular captain Tana Umaga was rested . 
 In April 2005 , while captaining the Crusaders , McCaw again suffered a concussion . He was stretchered off the field two minutes into the game after attempting a tackle on Bulls prop Richard Bands . After the incident , McCaw visited a young boy in hospital who had broken his neck playing rugby and started to question whether he should be playing the game . Another paraplegic in the ward told him he had broken his neck swimming on holiday in Fiji , convincing McCaw that it could happen anywhere , and you may as well " do what you enjoy " . A month later , in May 2005 , McCaw returned to training with the Crusaders and led them in their semi @-@ final and final victories . 
 McCaw returned to international rugby in 2005 , playing in the 91 – 0 victory over Fiji before the British and Irish Lions arrived . He then played the first two test against the Lions , including a record 48 – 18 victory in Wellington . The All Blacks defeated the touring Lions 3 – 0 in the series . McCaw was part of the successful Tri Nations campaign ( losing just one game ) and Grand Slam ( when victory is achieved against the four home nations ) end of year tour . He missed the game against England after suffering his third serious head knock against Ireland . Despite his injury concerns , McCaw was shortlisted for the 2005 IRB International Player of the Year , which was won by All Black team @-@ mate Dan Carter . 
 = = = 2006 – 07 = = = 
 McCaw led the Crusaders to the Super Rugby title again in 2006 . On May 2006 , at the age of 25 and after 36 test matches , McCaw was named captain of the All Blacks . His first two games as regular captain were against Ireland in New Zealand , while a separate squad led by Jerry Collins was named to travel to Argentina for a one off game . McCaw started his captaincy with victory over Ireland and then mentored stand @-@ in captain Jerry Collins in Argentina . New Zealand emerged as 2006 Tri Nations champions ( the only loss away to South Africa by one point ) and retained the Bledisloe Cup . A successful European tour saw comfortable victories against England , France twice and Wales . McCaw was captain in every match and after being short listed in 2002 , 2003 and 2005 was named the 2006 IRB International Player of the Year . 
 Because 2007 was a World Cup year , All Black management decided that a select group of 22 players , including McCaw , would undergo " reconditioning " by not playing in the first seven rounds of the Super 14 . McCaw returned to the Crusaders in the eighth round and helped them reach the semi @-@ finals . New Zealand then beat a below @-@ strength France team in two tests and won a one @-@ off test against Canada . McCaw started on the bench for the Canadian match , with Reuben Thorne returning as captain . The Tri Nations was shortened because of the World Cup , with each team playing the other two teams twice ( one home and one away game ) . Led by McCaw , New Zealand again dropped just one game ( this time a five @-@ point loss against Australia in Melbourne ) retaining the Tri Nations crown and the Bledisloe cup . 
 = = = = 2007 World Cup = = = = 
 The 2007 World Cup was held in France , Scotland and Wales . The All Blacks were in a pool that included Italy , Portugal , Scotland and Romania . The All Blacks comfortably made it through the pool play with scores of 76 – 14 , 108 – 13 , 40 – 0 and 85 – 8 respectively . McCaw made just three appearances ( two starts and one as a reserve ) due to Henry 's rotation policy . In the quarter @-@ finals the All Blacks lost to France 18 – 20 , resulting in New Zealand 's earliest exit from a World Cup . With semi @-@ final exits after being among the favourites at the 1991 , 1999 and 2003 World Cups , they were once again accused of " choking on the world 's biggest stage " . 
 An emotional McCaw could not hide his disappointment at the after @-@ match press conference : " If I knew the answers we would have sorted it out . We will be thinking about it for a long time " . McCaw denied New Zealand 's easy run into the quarter @-@ finals played a part in the loss " A lot of the guys have been through this before , they 've played big test matches . " Graham Henry 's policy of using squad rotation and resting key players during the Super 14 was criticised . McCaw also came under attack . He was accused of not inspiring his team , lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not providing enough leadership on the field .

 Despite much speculation that Henry would lose the All Black coaching job to coach Robbie Deans , he was retained on a contract for the next two years , later extended to include the 2011 World Cup . He immediately stated that he would retain McCaw as his captain . Robbie Deans instead signed with the Australian Rugby Union , becoming head coach of Australia . In Deans ' last season ( 2008 ) as Crusaders coach they won the Super Rugby title for the seventh time . Ireland and England toured to New Zealand in June 2008 and the All Blacks came away with a hard @-@ fought win against Ireland , and two comfortable victories against England . McCaw tore a ligament in his ankle against England and missed the start of the Tri Nations . 
 Rodney So <unk> was made stand @-@ in captain and started the Tri Nations with a win and two losses . McCaw returned for the fourth game and the All Blacks won the remaining three matches to retain the Tri Nations title and Bledisloe Cup . McCaw was seen as an inspiration after his return from injury , with Henry rating his performance in the 19 – 0 win in South Africa ( the first time the South Africans had been kept scoreless on home soil in 105 years ) as his best so far for the All Blacks . 
 In 2008 a fourth Bledisloe match was played in Hong Kong with the intention of expanding the game of rugby and in a close 19 – 14 game McCaw scored the match winning try . The Grand Slam tour to the United Kingdom and Ireland resulted in victories over Scotland ( 32 – 6 ) , Ireland ( 22 – 3 ) , Wales ( 29 – 9 ) and England ( 32 – 6 ) . During 2008 McCaw won every test he captained and a total of 26 out of 28 games he played in at all levels . The All Blacks won 13 of a record 15 tests , retained the Bledisloe Cup and Tri Nations Trophy , completed the Grand Slam and reclaimed the world No. 1 ranking from South Africa .

 The Crusaders , under new coach Todd Blackadder , had a slow start to the 2009 season , losing four of their first five games . They recovered to finish fourth on the table , losing the semi @-@ final at Loftus Versfeld to the Bulls . McCaw injured his knee and missed the start of the international season , returning for the Tri Nations tournament . South Africa beat the All Blacks in every match to win the title and regain the number 1 ranking , with New Zealand beating Australia three times to finish second . It was the first time New Zealand had not won the competition in five years and the fifth time since the Tri Nations started in 1996 . A fourth Bledisloe Test against Australia was played in Japan before New Zealand toured Europe . Although New Zealand won every match on tour , an earlier loss to France and three defeats by the South Africans were the most suffered by the All Blacks in a season since McCaw joined the team in 2001 . Despite the team 's relatively poor season , McCaw was named the IRB International Player of the Year for a second time . 
 The 2010 season started in much the same way with the Crusaders finishing fourth during the round robin stage and losing to the Bulls in the semi @-@ final . During the season McCaw played his 100th Super Rugby game in a losing effort against the Cape Town @-@ based Stormers . New Zealand recorded victories over the touring Ireland and Wales teams , Ireland losing their match by a record 66 – 28 after number eight Jamie <unk> received a red card for kneeing McCaw in the head . The All Blacks went through the Tri Nations undefeated with the final game of the tournament against Australia marking McCaw 's 52nd time captaining the All Blacks , surpassing Sean Fitzpatrick as New Zealand 's most @-@ capped test captain . 
 The fourth Bledisloe Cup match was again scheduled for Hong Kong and Australia ended a ten match losing streak to the All Blacks . It was to be the only loss the All Blacks would suffer that season as they went on to win another Grand Slam tour , defeating England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales . In the match against Ireland McCaw , along with team mate <unk> <unk> played in their 93rd test match passing Sean Fitzpatrick to become the most capped All Blacks . At the end of year McCaw was named the IRB International Player of the Year for the second successive season and the New Zealand sportsperson of the year at the Halberg awards .

 During preseason training in January 2011 McCaw injured his foot , subsequent x @-@ rays revealed that he had received a stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal of his right foot . It was determined his best chance of recovery was to undergo an operation where a pin was inserted . As a result , McCaw missed the opening two months of the <unk> season . During the All Black 's third Rugby World Cup pool match against France , McCaw became the first All Black to reach 100 test caps . However , it was also during this match McCaw re @-@ aggravated his foot injury . In order to rest his injury , he was forced to skip the more physical aspects of training and miss the All Blacks ' final pool match against Canada . Prior to the Quarter @-@ final against Argentina McCaw decided against having another x @-@ ray . Following the re @-@ occurrence of his injury it was uncertain whether McCaw could continue to play for the All Blacks , this forced the coaching staff to develop contingency plans and Matt Todd was called into the All Black training squad . McCaw was able to continue to play throughout the World Cup tournament and lifted the Webb Ellis trophy after a tense 8 – 7 victory over France . This was the lowest score in a final in World Cup history . After the final , the All Black coach Graham Henry stated " He can hardly walk and how he played today I just don 't know , " and he acknowledged the All Blacks probably would not have won without him . Following the World Cup x @-@ rays showed that the screw in his foot , necessary to stop the deterioration of the original injury had caused a second fracture . The fracture again , required a further operation . 
 After the Rugby World Cup McCaw was selected in the <unk> Dream Team . This team was determined by public vote , with over 160 @,@ 000 votes cast . In addition , for the second successive year McCaw was named the New Zealand sportsperson of the year at the Halberg awards . 
 = = = 2012 – 2015 = = = 
 Under new coach Steve Hansen , the All Blacks won 12 tests , drew one and only lost one test in 2012 , as well as winning the new Rugby Championship with a 100 % winning record . During this time McCaw overtook George Gregan for most times on the winning side with 94 . He also recorded his 100th win against South Africa in Dunedin . Richie McCaw was a nominee for the IRB Player of the Year award but lost out to team mate Dan Carter . 
 In the first half of 2013 , in order to rest his body and improve his chances of playing in the 2015 Rugby World Cup McCaw enforced the sabbatical clause in his NZRFU contract . As a result , he only played the latter rounds of Super Rugby , and missed the 2013 French Test Series . He later returned to captain the All Blacks as they successfully defended the Rugby Championship . During this campaign , McCaw equalled ( with Brian O 'Driscoll of Ireland and John Smit of South Africa ) the record as captaining the most test matches ( 83 ) . McCaw subsequently overtook this record when playing in Japan on 2 November 2013 . Following the All Blacks victory over the Springboks in Ellis Park , McCaw has played and won at every major Rugby Test stadium . Along with Kieran Read , McCaw led the All Blacks to a perfect season in 2013 , winning 14 out of 14 . 
 McCaw captained New Zealand for the 100th time on 22 November 2014 in the end of year international against Wales . He is the first rugby union player to achieve 100 caps as captain . 
 On 15 August 2015 , McCaw surpassed Ireland 's Brian O 'Driscoll world record , as the most capped rugby player when he won his 142 cap against Australia in the Bledisloe Cup . 
 On 31 October 2015 , McCaw captained New Zealand to retain the Rugby World Cup after a 34 @-@ 17 win against Australia in the final at Twickenham . 
 On 19 November 2015 , McCaw announced his retirement from rugby . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 McCaw predominately played at openside flanker , although he has played in the other " loose forward " positions of blindside flanker and number eight for the Crusaders . The openside flanker binds to the side of the scrum farthest from the touch @-@ line and is usually one of the first players to reach a breakdown . In 2008 , McCaw told the IRB : 
 " My main role as a flanker is , defensively , to tie in with the back line to ensure that the defence works well . On attack I think my primary role at first phase is to look after our ball . You attack the back line and I 'm usually the first person there to make sure we secure that ball . Thirdly I put pressure on break downs and make sure I disturb their ball and try to turn their ball over . " 
 McCaw is regarded as the best openside flanker of all time . He has been awarded the IRB Player of the Year a record three times and has been nominated on eight occasions . When he received the IRB Player of The Year award for the third time former Australian lock and award chairperson John Eales described him as " an outstanding captain , a world class player and a role model for our sport " . Along with Dan Carter , he is seen as one of the most influential members of the All Blacks . McCaw considers his ability to anticipate play as one of his most important skills . Australian openside David Pocock , who was also shortlisted for the IRB award , admires the way he reads the game as well as his ability to read the referee . One of McCaw 's strengths is his ability to re @-@ invent himself . For example , he adapted quickly to changes in the breakdown laws ( e.g. , the 2008 the Experimental Law Variations ( <unk> ) and the 2010 New IRB Law Interpretations ) and , over time , other areas of his game . 
 Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup , All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw 's and Dan Carter 's career efforts , distinguishing McCaw from Carter : 
 “ Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second , ” said Hansen . “ The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker , which is unheard of - you put your body on the line every time you go there . The challenge for the other guys now is to try and become as great as him and Dan . ” 
 Not all agree with McCaw 's playing style and many believe that he pushes the boundaries of legality . He has been labeled a " cheat " by both former South Africa coach Peter de Villiers and former Australian coach Bob Dwyer . Longtime Springboks lock Victor Matfield said in 2010 that the referees let " him get away with murder " at the breakdown . Shortly after the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final , veteran France back @-@ rower Imanol Harinordoquy said about McCaw 's play in that match , " He played the whole match in our camp . He did a lot of things and nobody [ specifically match referee Craig Joubert ] told him anything . Three minutes from the end of the game , I saw him dive on the side of a ruck and he stayed there for ages . " Media footage has been released pinpointing <unk> transgressions during a match against Australia . Former Australian coach Eddie Jones and flanker Phil Waugh say he does no more than any other good openside , but his skill at judging how the referee will interpret the breakdown is the main reason for his success . McCaw admits that he tests the referee early " to know what you can get away with " and that only an " idiot " would not adapt to their rulings . 
 Teammate Aaron Mauger , along with many New Zealand fans , have suggested that McCaw 's influence and playing style has made him a target for illegitimate play . International players Phil Waugh , Jamie <unk> , Marcus Horan , <unk> <unk> , Andy Powell , Dylan Hartley , Quade Cooper , Dean <unk> , Kevin McLaughlin and Scott Higginbotham have been accused of making " cheap shots " on McCaw . He has even been on the receiving end from his All Black teammates when playing for the Crusaders , with <unk> <unk> , Jerry Collins and Ali Williams becoming frustrated with his play . According to McCaw " what happens on the field stays on the field " and if he gets extra attention it is because he " must be doing something right " . 
 In 2012 , Wallabies fans and Australian media speculated about McCaw 's possible decline . To counter the McCaw threat Wallabies coach Robbie Deans and selectors wagered the potential returns in finishing games with two openside flankers on the field . In September 2012 after the All Blacks v South African Test in Dunedin , current South African coach <unk> Meyer said that McCaw was the greatest rugby player the world has ever seen .

 Despite McCaw being a Pākehā ( of European descent ) as captain he had occasionally led the haka for the All Blacks .

In addition to these in the final of the 2015 Rugby World Cup against Australia McCaw led the team in a post match Ka Mate haka ( <unk> <unk> led the <unk> Kapa o Pango version ) .

 In January 2013 it was reported that he had been seeing hockey player Gemma Flynn for the past six months . McCaw announced his engagement to Flynn in January 2016 . 
 His other sporting passion is flying and he has been made an honorary Squadron Leader in the Royal New Zealand Air Force . McCaw learned to fly gliders from his grandfather , who flew more than 300 missions in the Second World War . In 2009 he convinced the head of the Discovery network in Australia and New Zealand to do a show about gliding . They filmed McCaw gliding at <unk> on the extreme sports series Sportstar Insider , which was hosted by former Australian rugby league player Andrew Ettingshausen . After the 2010 Canterbury earthquake he auctioned a personal flying lesson through Trade Me to raise money for the badly damaged Hororata St Johns Church . He is also raising money for a young Samoan who broke his neck playing rugby and whose village was destroyed in the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami . It was revealed at his retirement announcement in 2015 that McCaw will work at Christchurch Helicopters , where he is a Director and Shareholder , and is obtaining a commercial helicopter licence . 
 In 2010 , McCaw and Dan Carter were on a NZ $ 750 @,@ 000 a year contract that will see them through to the end of the 2011 Rugby World Cup , making them the highest paid rugby players in New Zealand at the time . This contract would still apply if they had not been selected for the World Cup squad .

 In December 2011 , Prime Minister John Key revealed that he had asked McCaw about the possibility of a knighthood in the 2012 New Year Honours , but that McCaw had turned it down .

" No formal offer was ultimately made . McCaw was appointed a member of New Zealand 's highest honour , the Order of New Zealand , in the 2016 New Year Honours . The honour surpassed the knighthood he had previously turned down prior to his retirement because only 20 living New Zealanders can gain membership at any one time . 
 = Ascension ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Ascension " is the sixth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on October 21 , 1994 . It was written by Paul Brown , directed by Michael Lange , and featured guest appearances by Steve Railsback , Nicholas Lea , Steven Williams and Sheila Larken . The episode helped explore the series ' overarching mythology . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . However , the events of " Ascension " are a continuation of the plot of the preceding episode , " Duane Barry " . Following the kidnapping of Scully by an unhinged alien abductee Duane Barry ( Steve Railsback ) , Mulder races to track her down . 
 The decision to have the character of Scully abducted was driven by necessity , as Anderson had become pregnant and required time off from production . " Ascension " earned a Nielsen household rating of 9 @.@ 6 , being watched by 9 @.@ 2 million households in its initial broadcast , and received positive reviews from critics .

 Upon hearing the voicemail showing Dana Scully 's ( Gillian Anderson ) kidnapping by Duane Barry , her partner Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) heads to her apartment and surveys the crime scene . He meets with Scully 's mother , Margaret , who claims to have had a dream about her being taken away . The next morning , Assistant Director Walter Skinner tells Mulder that he is " too close " to the case to be involved , and orders another FBI agent , Alex Krycek ( Nicholas Lea ) , to escort him home . Meanwhile , Barry speeds down the Blue Ridge Parkway when he is pulled over by a highway patrol officer . When Scully — locked in the trunk — tries to get the officer 's attention , Barry kills him . Mulder reviews a video of the traffic stop , and sees that Scully is still alive . 
 Mulder realizes that Barry is heading to a ski resort at Skyland Mountain , the location of Barry 's original abduction ; he is attempting to follow through with his original plan of having the aliens abduct someone there in his place . Krycek informs the Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) of these findings before departing with Mulder . When they arrive , Mulder boards the resort 's aerial tramway in the hopes of reaching its peak before Barry . However , Krycek tries to delay Mulder by sabotaging the tramway 's journey upward . Mulder manages to complete the journey and witnesses a strange light in the area . Upon finding Barry 's car , Mulder sees no trace of Scully except her necklace . He then encounters a joyous Barry , who claims that she was taken by " them . " 
 When Mulder interrogates Barry , he becomes so enraged that he nearly strangles him , only to stop himself . When he leaves the room , he orders Krycek to not let anyone inside ; however , he finds Krycek talking to Barry when he returns . When Skinner arrives minutes later , Barry breaks into convulsions and dies . Later , at the FBI Academy in Quantico , Mulder attempts to question the doctor who performed Barry 's autopsy ; she refuses to provide details since it was performed by the military instead of the FBI , claiming no other doctors were available . Mulder and Krycek are ordered to take a polygraph test about Barry 's death . 
 Krycek meets with the Smoking Man , and suggests that they kill Mulder . However , the Smoking Man orders that Mulder be left alive , unless they want to risk " turning one man 's religion into a crusade " . A desperate Mulder tries to visit Senator Matheson , a patron of his work , only to be discouraged from doing so by his secretive informant , X ( Steven Williams ) . In his car , Mulder finds spent cigarettes from the Smoking Man 's meeting with Krycek . Realizing Krycek 's role in Scully 's abduction , Mulder submits a report to Skinner accusing Krycek of impeding his investigation and killing Barry . Skinner summons Krycek to his office , only to learn that he has disappeared . Skinner then announces to Mulder that he is officially re @-@ opening the X @-@ Files . 
 Mulder meets with Margaret Scully in a park , and tries to give her Scully 's necklace . Margaret returns the necklace to Mulder , asking that he give it to Scully when he finds her . Margaret also says that she had the dream again about losing her daughter ; Mulder takes this as a hopeful sign that Scully may still be alive . A mournful Mulder later returns to Skyland Mountain , to the field where Scully was abducted . Seemingly alone without her , he looks up into the stars .

 The idea to have Scully abducted originated when Gillian Anderson became pregnant in the middle of the first season . While initially upset , those in charge of the show never considered dropping the actress from the show . Ideas such as having Scully give birth to an alien baby were dismissed and ultimately the writers decided to work around the pregnancy by closing the X @-@ Files , separating Mulder and Scully , and eventually having her be abducted . This permitted the producers to have an explanation for Scully 's absence ( she appears in only two scenes in " Ascension " and not at all in the next episode , " 3 " ) . Series creator Chris Carter commented that both the censors and the producers were reluctant on showing Scully in the trunk , but he " fought for that image " as he considered it conveyed the sense of danger to the character . Carter added the scenes of the experiment were meant to be ambiguous on whether Scully was abducted by aliens , the military , or both . 
 " Ascension " featured guest appearances from Steve Railsback , Nicholas Lea , Steven Williams and Sheila Larken . David Duchovny provided his own stunts in this episode , including being dangled in the aerial lift , shot in a single day at Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver , British Columbia . The backdrop for Barry 's drive was done in a neighbouring mountain , Mount Seymour . The tagline for this episode is " Deny Everything " , replacing the usual phrase " The Truth is Out There . "

 In a retrospective of the second season in Entertainment Weekly , the episode was rated an A , being described as " an expertly paced race against time " . The handling of Anderson 's pregnancy was called " creative " , while the re @-@ opening of the X @-@ Files unit and the revelation of Krycek as a villainous character were noted as highlights . Writing for the A.V. Club , Zack Handlen called " Ascension " an " essential " episode , adding that it serves to " raise the stakes without losing the core of the show 's appeal , and solve a technical problem in the most creatively satisfying way possible " . Handlen also praised Nicholas Lea 's portrayal of agent Alex Krycek , but felt that the character 's role as a double agent was revealed too soon in the series .

 The episode was written and directed by series creator Rob Thomas . Although Thomas had previously written " Pilot " , " Credit Where Credit 's Due " , " Leave It to Beaver " , and " Normal Is the Watchword " , this is his first directing credit for the show and his first professional directing credit . In an interview , Thomas expressed nervousness around the shoot , especially when to call " Action . " Thomas also made sure that he directed an episode that he 'd written . When asked about how it came to be that Thomas directed an episode , he replied : 
 It could not have made less sense , for me to direct an episode right smack in the middle of the season . And it about killed me . For a month there , I was doing two jobs , and they 're both very full time , directing an episode and still running the show and looking at cuts of the show , looking at scripts , doing casting — all of that had to keep going while I was directing , and it was really difficult . I think if I direct in the future , it 'll be episode 20 , 21 , or 22 , so all the scripts are in , and I don 't have both hats on at the same time . 
 Being a first @-@ time director , the network is , what 's the word I 'm looking for – they don 't want a first @-@ time director directing one of their sweeps episodes , so it created a limited number of episodes that I could choose from . 
 The episode features the final regular appearance by Duncan Kane ( played by Teddy Dunn ) , after his character was written off the series . Duncan would later cameo in the season two finale , " Not Pictured " . Thomas attributed Duncan 's departure to the lack of fan interest in Veronica and Duncan 's relationship and the more enthusiastic reception to the Veronica @-@ Logan relationship , stating that " You know , we had two romantic possibilities for Veronica . One sort of dominated the fans ' interest . And it became clear that one suitor won out . " 
 From the very beginning of the series , fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan . However , he decided to keep playing the character . In a later interview , he said , " Obviously , I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience . You want your performance to be liked . You don 't want to suck . You don 't want people to think you suck . That wasn 't the goal . " Towards the end of the airing of the first season , he stated , " I 'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season . So people will either continue to hate me or things will change . Things are going to change for Duncan anyway , as the season resolves . There are going to be different sides of him that you 're going to get to see . " Before going into the filming of season two , Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show , and Dunn did not react badly to the news , as by that point , it " was actually a decision " for him to return for the second season at all . 
 The episode features a special guest @-@ starring appearance by actress Lucy Lawless as an FBI agent . " Donut Run " marks the final appearance of recurring character Celeste Kane .

 The episode received critical acclaim . Writing for The A.V. Club , Rowan Kaiser gave the episode a positive review , stating that the characters knowing facts that the audience doesn 't worked . " ' Donut Run ' actually does this well , in large part because the heist that we 're seeing — Duncan and Veronica stealing the coma baby — requires that Duncan and Veronica stage a breakup , meaning that Veronica seems to be a free , bitter agent for the bulk of the episode . " Price Peterson of TV.com heavily praised what he called a " great episode " and " a fitting send @-@ off for Duncan " . He elaborated that " as much as he and Veronica were a good match , there 's only so much you can do dramatically with a happy relationship , you know ? I 'm kind of glad she 's back to being a free agent again . " 
 Amy Ratcliffe of IGN called the episode the third best episode of the series , behind " Weapons of Class Destruction " and " Leave It to Beaver " . The publication stated that " this fast @-@ paced episode … had switches and secrets and is a tad reminiscent of Oceans 11 " and that the characterization of Vinnie Van Lowe was " a pleasing little touch . " Vulture listed the episode 's use of " How Can You Mend a Broken Heart " by Al Green and " Adelaide " by The Old 97 's on its list of " 16 Perfect Musical Moments from Veronica Mars " . Katie Atkinson of Entertainment Weekly ranked " Donut Run " as one of " the 10 essential episodes of Veronica Mars " , noting " The Air That I Breathe " by The Hollies as a musical standout . Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote called the episode the 2nd best of the series , behind " Not Pictured " , writing that " This episode is arguably the biggest game @-@ changer of Veronica Mars . It ’ s also one of the saddest , " also writing that it " featured one of the most moving scenes of the series . " BuzzFeed ranked the episode 14th on its list of the best Veronica Mars episodes , writing that " so many great things happen in this one . " 
 Reviews were not all positive . Television Without Pity gave a more mixed review , saying that there were " quite a few problems " with the episode and grading it a B- . The reviewer argued that the episode lacked clarity in the supporting characters ' involvement in the story and did not provide a satisfying or realistic conclusion to Veronica and Duncan 's relationship .

Developed in response to a requirement for a mobile anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) vehicle , the vehicle was produced by the White Motor Company between July 1942 and May 1943 . The only time it was ever used in combat was when the Americans landed at Anzio in January 1944 . It was replaced by the more heavily armed M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage in April 1944 . 
 The M13 evolved from a series of several unsuccessful prototypes that were trialed from 1940 to 1942 . Of these , the T1E4 was selected and given the official name of the M13 MGMC , before being placed into production . Half of the <unk> produced were converted into M16s on the production lines .

Each vehicle had a crew of five ( commander , driver , gunner , and two ammunition loaders ) .

 In October 1940 , development began to produce a vehicle in response to a long @-@ standing requirement for an anti @-@ aircraft vehicle to protect the U.S. Army 's mechanized troop convoys from aerial attack . The first vehicle produced in the development of a half track with an anti @-@ aircraft armament was the T1 , which had two M2 machine guns on a Bendix machine gun mount — as used on jeeps — on a 4 × 4 truck . The T1E1 had a power @-@ operated Bendix mount , and the T1E2 a Maxson mount . The <unk> had an electro @-@ dynamic Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft @-@ type turret . Evaluation of these test vehicles led to the T1E2 design being preferred . The T1E2 became the M16 Half @-@ track by replacing the M33 with the M45 mount and the M2 Half @-@ track chassis with the M3 Half @-@ track chassis . 
 = = = T1E4 and M13 = = = 
 The next stage of development was to use the T1E2 configuration on the longer chassis of the M3 Half @-@ track , since it could store more ammunition . This vehicle , originally designated as the T1E4 , was accepted into production as the M13 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage on 27 July 1942 . A total of 1 @,@ 103 examples of this variant were produced from 27 July 1942 to 15 May 1943 . Half of them ( 583 ) were converted into M16s by the White Motor Company before reaching the army . Deliveries began in late 1943 .

 The M13 served at the landing at Anzio with the VI Corps of the Fifth United States Army in January 1944 . It was used as an anti @-@ aircraft weapon during the initial landing and then later as a ground support weapon to repel heavy German panzer attacks on the beachhead . It was replaced three months later by the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage in April 1944 . Only 139 examples were deployed overseas by the U.S. Army .

 T1 – This variant used two M2 Browning heavy machine guns on a Bendix mount on a 4 × 4 truck . This model , like most of the others , was a prototype . It was tested in June – July 1941 at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds , but was rejected because of the " excessive dispersion of ammunition " . 
 T1E1 – Another prototype that used the Bendix mount on a M2 Half @-@ track Car . It was cancelled in April 1942 . 
 T1E2 – This variant was essentially the same as the T1E1 except the Bendix mount was replaced with the M33 Maxson mount . After the M33 was replaced with the M45 Quadmount it was accepted as the M16 Half @-@ track . 
 <unk> – A T1E1 with a Martin turret designed for use on bombers .

 T1E4 / M13 – The Martin turret was replaced by the M33 and was based on the M3 Half @-@ track . It was accepted as the M13 Half @-@ track in July 1942 . A total of 139 examples of this variant saw action at Anzio as a ground support weapon used to repel heavy German attacks . It was replaced by the M16 in April 1944 . 
 M14 Half @-@ track – This variant had the same armament as the M13 but used the slightly different M5 Half @-@ track chassis built by International Harvester for the Lend @-@ Lease Program . The M14 was mostly supplied to Britain , where they were converted back to regular half @-@ tracks . A total of 1602 were produced by International Harvester .

 = Suga Mama = 
 " Suga Mama " is a song recorded by American R & B singer Beyoncé Knowles for her second studio album , B 'Day ( 2006 ) . It was written by Knowles , Rich Harrison , and Makeba Riddick , and produced by Harrison and Knowles . " Suga Mama " is influenced by 1970s funk and rock music . An R & B and soul song , " Suga Mama " is built on a hip hop and jazzy beat , and samples Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers ' song " Searching for Soul " , written by Chuck Middleton . Lyrically , it features the female protagonist willing to pay large sums of money to keep her love interest contented . 
 " Suga Mama " was generally well received by music critics , who noted it as one of the highlights from B 'Day and complimented Harrison 's production . However , there was some limited criticism about Knowles ' vocal delivery on the song . Though not released as a single , " Suga Mama " had a music video filmed in black @-@ and @-@ white , and directed by Melina Matsoukas and Knowles , for the B 'Day Anthology Video Album . It received a limited release to British music TV channels . " Suga Mama " was added on the set list of Knowles ' world tour , The Beyoncé Experience ( 2007 ) .

 Knowles enlisted Harrison as one of the five co @-@ producers of B 'Day , and she arranged for him , Sean Garrett and Rodney Jerkins to be given individual rooms at Sony Music Studios in New York City . Knowles said she fostered " healthy competition " between the producers by going into each of their rooms and commenting on the " great beats " the others were creating . She and Harrison had previously collaborated on her 2003 single " Crazy in Love " , which uses a prominent soul music sample in a similar manner to " Suga Mama " . Fox News said that " Suga Mama " and " Freakum Dress " , Harrison 's other contribution to B 'Day " fall short of originality but mimic the Chi Lites [ sic ] percussion section [ of " Crazy in Love " ] yet again " , adding , " Harrison is like the Indiana Jones of soul , constantly pulling out forgotten gems of the past for sampling [ ... ] You can 't help but think : Thank God someone wrote music in the past that can be repurposed now .

 " Suga Mama " is a moderate R & B and soul song that displays influences of the 1960s as well as 1970s funk and rock music . It also song contains limited elements of the 1980s go @-@ go and sounds more closely resembling live music than Knowles ' previous recordings . According to the sheet music published by Hal Leonard Corporation , " Suga Mama " was composed using common time in the key of G minor , with a moderate tempo of 94 beats per minute . 
 Knowles ' vocals span from the low note of C4 to the high note of G5 as she sings on a hip hop and jazzy beat . The main instrumentation is provided by a bluesy guitar . IGN Music noted that " Suga Mama " is built of a " static grit groove " , and Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song consists of a mixture of " brute power and slick syncopation " . It samples Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers ' song " Searching for Soul " , which was written by Chuck Middleton . 
 " Suga Mama " features the female protagonist offering up the keys to her house and car , and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home , presumably so that he can listen to her collection of old soul records . These interpretations are shown in the lines : " It 's so good to the point that I 'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me what you want me to buy , my accountant 's waiting on the phone ... " . The woman also sees the man as a sex object , asking him to sit on her lap and " take it off while I watch you perform " . Staff members of USA Today contrasted " Suga Mama " with the 1999 song " Bills , Bills , Bills " by Destiny 's Child ( of which Knowles was a member ) , writing that " From needing somebody to pay her <unk> @-@ bills , [ Knowles is ] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction @-@ seeking ' Suga Mama ' . " Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings : " I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store " with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on ' Candyman ' ( 2007 ) . " On the other hand , Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song 's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner 's work . A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence .

 The song received generally positive reviews . Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , who reviewed B 'Day negatively , wrote that " Suga Mama " was the " best moment " on the album , and that it " owes much of its charm to lifts from Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers " . Likewise , Bernard Zuel The Sydney Morning Herald cited " Suga Mama " as one of the " good moments " on B 'Day , writing : " ... followed by a dud ... the slinky funk of ' Suga Mama ' is trodden on by the mechanical ' Upgrade U ' and then trampled by the posturing and eventually annoying ' Ring the Alarm ' " . Chris Richards of The Washington Post commented that Rich Harrison " delivers again with ' Suga Mama ' , twisting a vintage Soul Searchers sample into a gritty , loping groove . Beyonce sounds right at home on this one ... And while it doesn 't quite eclipse ' Crazy in Love ' , it 's still B 'Day 's finest moment . " Andy Kellman of Allmusic described " Suga Mama " as a " spectacularly layered " track . 
 Eb Haynes of AllHipHop considered " Suga Mama " to be an embodiment of " the woman wearing and buying $ 500 stiletto pumps . " Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic wrote that Knowles is as " sweet and faux @-@ innocent " as the 1960s soul stars in the song . Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that songs such as " Suga Mama " showcase of Knowles ' virtuosity and continued , " No one – not R. Kelly , not Usher , to say nothing of her rival pop divas – can match Beyoncé 's genius for dragging her vocal lines [ ... ] " . By contrast , IGN Music criticized Knowles ' vocals in the song , writing that she " comes in over the low @-@ end track with too much earnestness , drowning out the funky grooves with her piercing dramatic mezzo @-@ soprano . If she were a throaty alto , she 'd fit the beats that have been served up to her much more appropriately . "

The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing on top of a sugar cube , dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed , lying in a circle of light , and riding a mechanical bull . Knowles said she is meant to " slowly become a woman " during the video , adding " Well , a sexier woman – I 'm always a woman . " 
 Knowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars , which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc . Though she is from Texas , she had never previously been on mechanical bull . There were no problems during warm @-@ ups , but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster , causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot , leaning back and turning around . To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull , the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second ( see frame rate ) and Knowles sang twice as quickly , but it wasn 't until 4 : 00 am that they completed work .

 Carl Edgar Myers ( ( 1842 @-@ 03 @-@ 02 ) March 2 , 1842 – November 30 , 1925 ( 1925 @-@ 11 @-@ 30 ) ) was an American businessman , scientist , inventor , meteorologist , balloonist , and aeronautical engineer . He invented many types of hydrogen balloon airships and related equipment . His business of making passenger airship balloons and instrument balloons at his " balloon farm " was well known throughout the United States in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century . He invented a machine for varnishing fabric that would make it impervious to hydrogen so that the finished product could be made into large envelopes for lighter @-@ than @-@ air balloons . 
 Myers also experimented in making artificial rain in areas where rain was deficient for agriculture . He made oxy @-@ hydrogen balloons that were exploded at high altitude to cause rain . He contracted with the U.S. government and lumber companies to make these balloon " bombs " for the production of man @-@ made rain . 
 Myers was a manager for the 1904 St. Louis World ’ s Fair and the superintendent of their Aeronautic Concourse for balloon demonstrations and aerial races . He made balloon military warships and inventions that could be used for defense in case of attack by air by foreign interests and demonstrated at the Fair . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Myers , born March 2 , 1842 , was of German descent and the son of Abram Myers and Ann Ela Myers . His birthplace was Fort Herkimer in New York state , but he grew up in the nearby town of Mohawk . Myers attended a school run by a scientist , which stimulated his scientific curiosity . At school he became interested in the principles of electricity and all related matters . 
 Myers earned extra money from fulfilling requests for art work and building mechanical gadgets for others . He spent most of this money on materials for his experiments and on science books . He spent his extra time in workshops and laboratories to learn scientific principles , and his spare time in the woods to learn about nature . He was a leader among his classmates and the local teenagers . 
 Myers had mechanical understanding and could improve many devices . One was an invention that he patented of a kerosene lamp damper that reduced considerably the smoke from its flame . Another innovation , of which he was very proud , was an automatic self @-@ recording mercury barometer that recorded its measurements on a strip of paper ; with this meteorological instrument he kept a continuous barometric record that covered a span of 30 years . 
 = = Career = = 
 Myers made his own electrical @-@ mechanical apparatuses and tools . He turned his interests , hobbies and experiments into early entrepreneur ventures that earned money for him . He became at one time or another a delivery agent , bill collector , bank clerk , carpenter , chemist , electrician , gas @-@ fitter , mechanic , photographer , plumber , printer , telegrapher , and writer . 
 At nineteen Myers became a teller and cashier at the Mohawk Valley Bank starting July 5 , 1861 . General Francis E. Spinner was the treasurer of the bank at the time . His first year as a trainee was without pay . Myers then received a salary of $ 100 per year , being higher than normal since he put in extra attention to his work habits . He opened his own little telegraph office in July 1863 within the counting office of the bank . This was the first telegraph office for the town of Mohawk , New York . He constructed all the necessary telegraph equipment needed and taught himself Morse code so he could send and receive messages . Myers ' income from this bank telegraph business was one @-@ half of his total income . He eventually had to give up being a part @-@ time telegraph operator within the bank , as his bank responsibilities took up most of his time . He turned over the telegraph business to the local post office with Austin Shall as the operator . 
 Myers worked at Mohawk Valley Bank for six years . During this time he developed an interest in counterfeit money . He collected counterfeit bills and assembled a scrapbook of these for study . He then had another book of genuine bills ; he then compared the two to learn the counterfeiters ' techniques . He became an expert in detecting counterfeit bills . This became a valued interest to the bankers and Myers was given all the bank notes to pass through him for approval of genuineness . This ultimately became a basis for the present day method of detecting counterfeit bills . 
 Myers resigned from the bank in 1867 and moved to Hornellsville , New York . There he bought a photography gallery and ran the business for several years . Myers met Mary Hawley in Hornellsville and married her on November 8 , 1871 . She was 7 years younger , being born in 1849 . In 1873 Myers took up an interest in making hydrogen gas and ballooning . The couple moved back to Mohawk from Hornellsville in 1875 and began activities of balloon manufacturing and flying . Mary became his lab assistant and later a balloon pilot known as Carlotta , the Lady Aeronaut . 
 = = First balloons = = 
 Myers built his first balloon in the summer of 1878 in Mohawk Valley . It was over 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) in diameter and could contain 10 @,@ 000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas . The balloon material with its valve weighed almost one hundred pounds . The envelope material was high quality cotton cloth that was unbleached . It was varnished with linseed oil gum thinned with turpentine . Myers invented machinery that applied the coats of varnish onto fabric of silk or cotton . There were several coats of varnish applied to make a balloon envelope impervious to hydrogen . The first of these patented machines , that took fourteen days to construct , was in operation for seven years . Myers made sixty hydrogen balloons in sixty days in 1891 . He built a set of ten hydrogen gas balloons in five days in 1892 . 
 = = Gates mansion workshops = = 
 In 1889 Myers purchased the Gates Mansion Victorian style house with five acres of property that was located near Frankfort , New York , previously owned by Fred Gates of the Diamond Match Company . Here Myers and his wife went into the business of manufacturing passenger balloons and specialty purpose gas balloons , many for the US government . The balloons that had just been assembled were partially inflated outdoors to test if they held the hydrogen gas properly . Because of the large balloons half inflated and laid out on the property grounds , it gave the impression they were growing large mushrooms or some unusual new farm crop . In time people figured out they were really making balloons and it became known as the Frankfort " balloon farm . " 
 The three story mansion house was broken up into workshops and living quarters . The workshops were a chemistry lab , a print shop , a shipping room , a carpentry work area and machine shop facilities . The attic above the third story was devoted entirely for all the machines and associated tools necessary for the construction of airships . One first floor room was a large library with many books on aeronautics and science , where Myers researched often and brainstormed with his wife . There were out @-@ buildings scattered throughout the five acres that contained gas engines , chemical labs , and furnace facilities . 
 Newspapers reported that Myers had a monopoly on the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government . A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons . The fabric material was patterned , sewed together into large strips , and made ready for varnishing . He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that was used for the varnish application . Myers ' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen . The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house . This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind . It also provided a fire @-@ pit in case the flammable material caught on fire . There was a water @-@ hose handy for putting out a fire . 
 The liquid varnish was made with a large iron kettle that had a cover on it . Fire was applied under the kettle for the " cooking " of the raw linseed oil formula . The oil mix " cooked " for four to eight hours to a consistency of gum . The gum material was thinned to the consistency of syrup and poured into a sloping vat that lead into a Myers ' patented machine apparatus of various rollers , <unk> , and scrapers . They acted by pressure of springs and weights . 
 The raw wound fabric of silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers ' varnishing machine for processing . The processed wet fabric , soaked with varnish , was rubbed and pressed so the varnish would go into all the pores . The excess varnish was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry . The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber . This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas , that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal . The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas . 
 This same general area of the property was used also for the drying of the varnished fabric . This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line @-@ type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind @-@ break fences of canvas . Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying . After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished over and over again several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time . Each application of new varnish added a thin layer . 
 The basement of the house was used for generating hydrogen gas and pure oxygen . The hydrogen making apparatus consisted of a tank half filled with water . This tank was also filled with iron filings from Navy cast @-@ iron projectiles . Sulfuric acid was added into the tank of water and filings , which was slowly decanted . The acid separated the water into hydrogen and oxygen gases . The iron filings absorbed the oxygen gas which allowed the hydrogen to go up through a pipe into a wash @-@ barrel , which had another pipe to the balloon envelope . The freed hydrogen gas then filled the balloon , which had a lifting ability of 60 pounds per 1 @,@ 000 cubic feet of gas . The balloon was held down to the ground by sandbag weights so that when filled it didn 't float away . A 50 feet ( 15 m ) diameter balloon would hold 65 @,@ 000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas giving the filled balloon a lifting ability of about 4 @,@ 000 pounds . 
 Myers was known as the " Flying Dutchman " and the " Mohawk Dutchman " because of his location , name , and being a balloonist . His technology was developed to the extent that the balloons he made could hold hydrogen gas in an envelope for up to five days . – outdoors in all kinds of weather . 
 Myers wrote in newspaper articles how safe his hydrogen balloons were to travel in . One example he often gave was that of encountering rough weather , like a rain storm . He pointed out that an airplane could not stop and hover in mid @-@ air , whereas a balloon could . He pointed out that in a tempest or high wind a balloon was perfectly safe as long as the rider didn 't make any deliberate opposing moves . He claimed that passenger trips would soon be as commonplace as buying a ticket for them . 
 = = Torpedo airship = = 
 Myers " balloon farm " was the only place in America by 1902 where hydrogen balloons were manufactured , whether for the government or for private use . These hydrogen aircraft made by him came in a large variety and flew just like one would read about in a children 's book or dream of in a story . The public was allowed to walk through and view his place in the summertime . 
 The flying aerial @-@ craft airships were not just working models that went a few feet along a track , but flying machines driven by real people . They could ascend , turn and dive . These inventions and innovations of Myers consisted not just of air vessels , but also of scientific application balloons and specialty ordered curiosity balloons contrived of by other inventors . Some even gave the impression they were from the future or another world of advanced people . 
 Myers realised that normal , globe @-@ shaped hot air passenger balloons were subject to the whim of the direction of the winds . He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow . His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere . His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe . 
 Myers ’ new design would be similar to that of Alberto Santos @-@ Dumont 's balloons . The gas spindle balloon envelope would hold hydrogen gas , a lifting agent since it was lighter than the air around it . This new design was referred to as a " torpedo " airship . His first torpedo airship was 13 feet long and five feet in diameter in the center with its prow and stern sharply pointed . The airship also had a rudder in the front to help in its steering . 
 The envelope that held the hydrogen gas of Myers ' torpedo airship was made of red and yellow silk . One of its trips was a distance of 600 miles and it ran at an average speed of 12 miles an hour . It was powered forward by a propeller that spun at 5 @,@ 000 revolutions per minute . The caloric engine that drove the propeller was a spontaneous combustion engine " fed " with nitroglycerin semi @-@ translucent fuel pellets . This type of airship could hold up to 10 passengers or a combination of freight and crewmen . Myers ' " torpedo " airships were built later in larger versions . Some were entered in airship contests and one was demonstrated at the St. Louis World 's Fair of 1904 . It was 74 feet long and 21 feet in diameter . It contained 14 @,@ 000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas and would lift 900 pounds of weight . Myers made several successful experimental test flights at his Frankfort " balloon farm " before delivering it to a Mr. Benbow , the purchaser . After that it was referred to as the Benbow airship . The airship had four 10 horse @-@ power gasoline motors that ran propellers of 4 blades each . The four propellers could be manipulated in most any direction so the operator could steer the airship sideways right and left , go up and down , and forward and backwards as desired . 
 = = Sky @-@ cycle = = 
 Myers designed a new type balloon vessel based on Carlotta 's discoveries of aerodynamics and how airship bodies acted in the sky . Carlotta was the first woman to use a maneuverable airship . She used a cloth screw @-@ sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform . The platform car device weighted 11 pounds . This was the first time that an ordinary spherical balloon could be controlled by a person . Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta 's findings . For a more efficient steerable airship vessel he made his next balloon gas bag bottom flat so that it would act like an inclined plane . 
 This airship that lifted a rider consisted of a cigar @-@ shaped hydrogen balloon that looked like an inverted boat wrapped in netting . It had a velocipede seat and steering bar for a rider . A cloth screw propeller was operated by the rider through a cog wheel and ratchet attachment operated by the rider pedaling . He first called the hybrid invention an " air bicycle , " that navigated through the air like driving a bicycle . He later named it a " gas kite , " an " aerial velocipede " , an " aerial bicycle " , and ultimately a " sky @-@ cycle . " The propeller acted like a screw of a boat and propelled the airship forward and up with the backward air current generated . It could go to a thousand feet , be maneuvered , and brought back at will by the rider . Myers ' wife was an expert in sky @-@ cycling . 
 The airship had tumultuous times at the start . Professor A.W. Bernard of Nashville , Tennessee took claim to his invention in 1897 . Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers in the month of May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world 's first ' sky @-@ cycle ' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said . Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895 . Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26 , 1885 . He further explained that the only ' sky @-@ cycle ' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20 , 1897 . Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers ' previous recorded patents . 
 The newspapers then printed articles that explained Myers ' sky @-@ cycle ' airship to the general public , showing that the problems of aerial navigation had already been solved by Myers before August 1895 . He had previously done 3 experimental flights of the ' sky @-@ cycle ' at his Frankfort " balloon farm " in New York state . On August 4 , 1895 a reporter flew Myers ' ' sky @-@ cycle ' in the Brooklyn area of New York City in a forty @-@ mile an hour wind . Myers made on the spot the hydrogen needed for the airship . The 1895 demonstration event took place at the Rockwell Leather Works factory property at the corner of Flushing and <unk> avenues . 
 The article explains the sequence of events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895 . When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky @-@ cycle he gave word to the ground crew to let go of the ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky @-@ cycle into the air . The airship drifted up slowly at first , going towards the factory roof peaks . The driver @-@ reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky @-@ cycle airship rose up sharply , avoiding the building roofs . When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky @-@ cycle airship flew over the East River . The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky @-@ cycle floating above <unk> their whistles . 
 The sky @-@ cycle airship continued to climb to about two thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East <unk> Street . The reporter then steered the sky @-@ cycle to One Hundred and Twenty @-@ eighth Street . There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint . The reporter flew the sky @-@ cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P.B. <unk> in Yonkers . <unk> helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the airship down to the size of a flat carpet bag . He then drove the reporter with his sky @-@ cycle airship to the railroad station so he could get back to his place of origin . 
 The sky @-@ cycle was operated and navigated by the rider 's hands and first powered by the rider 's feet for forward motion . It was later equipped with gasoline engines built by Curtis . The sky @-@ cycle made many successful flights and trips with these engines . 
 = = Artificial rain = = 
 Myers once made balloons and equipment for the experimentation of making artificial rain and gained renown for that beyond any other scientist . The balloons were referred to as " bombs " – rain @-@ producing explosions . The first demonstration experiments , based on theories by Illinois engineer Edward Powers for making rain , were done in May 1891 for General Robert Saint George <unk> ( Patent Commissioner ) of Washington , D.C. at Myers ' Frankfort " balloon farm " . <unk> , who represented the United States Department of Agriculture , then had Myers make a few balloon " bombs " for a presentation in Washington , D.C. The rain producing tests were done successfully in the early part of July 1891 in front of government officials , scientists , chemists , and engineers . 
 There was government funding provided of $ 9 @,@ 000 then with support from Senators Charles B. Farwell and Leland Stanford for a full @-@ scale test experiment in northern Texas . There was to be completed a scientific analysis of the results . The man @-@ made rain project was to take place near the town of Midland . The equipment involved in this test was 100 " oxy @-@ hydrogen " balloons , dozens of kites six to twelve feet high , miles of copper wire , nitroglycerine , dynamite , and gunpowder . Myers provided all the balloons and the gases . Electric batteries and generators were also part of the on @-@ site equipment . The design of the rain experiment project was to have explosions stir up particle aggregation . Myers ' balloon " bombs " were the start of many such explosions that were to take place in the rain producing experiment . His balloon " bombs " were one part oxygen gas combined with two parts of hydrogen gas , which would make a huge explosion upon detonation . The side effect of this balloon explosion was that water was produced . This water would drop from the sky at some high altitude and the idea was that all of this action would stimulate the atmosphere to make rain . The balloons made by Myers for the government at his " balloon farm " would hold 500 to 5000 cubic feet of gas . Myers had complete charge of the government rain producing experiments for years . 
 Each ten foot diameter balloon was filled with one @-@ third oxygen and two @-@ thirds hydrogen . To do this , the empty balloon was spread out on the ground with plenty of room around it . It was then attached to a hose to start filling with oxygen gas . The other end of the hose went to a retort that was filled with <unk> of potassium and a small amount of manganese oxide . The retort was heated to a high temperature through a gasoline burner . Oxygen gas , generated at 600 cubic feet per hour , went through a lime @-@ water wash and from there to fill the balloon . The balloon was filled up one third of the way . The hose was then connected to the hydrogen gas generator and filled up the remaining two @-@ thirds of the way . The oxygen and hydrogen balloon was referred to as an " oxy @-@ hydrogen " balloon . Each gas had an electric fuse detonator inside , which made it a type of " bomb " when triggered electrically . Wires were used that led from the ground to the balloon and when an electrical charge was made by a dynamo , it passed through the wires to set off the detonator causing an explosion that was brighter than the sun . This caused the oxygen and hydrogen to react , creating water ( H2O ) . This man @-@ made water then acted as a nucleus for making rain out of the atmosphere . 
 Myers made one hundred oxy @-@ hydrogen balloon bombs for the government to do a full scale experiment of producing rain . The balloons were 10 , 12 , and 20 feet in diameter . The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man @-@ made weather modification . After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for . The news press release of August 20 , 1891 , reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o 'clock in the afternoon . At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week . The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen @-@ hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet . That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent . The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states . After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly . He contended that the Mohawk Valley was a good place to start rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains .

 Myers was already concerned in 1891 that Europe was much more advanced in balloon technology than the United States . He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that if any of the European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States . Newspapers printed his concerns that the next big war would be fought in the sky . Myers pointed out that Germany , France , England , Spain , the Netherlands , Belgium , Russia , Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus , schools of practice , and secret experimental construction plants making state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art propeller power driven airships for war . He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty @-@ eight miles an hour and such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty @-@ five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed . He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat . 
 Myers said that he was working on defense balloons that could stop them in case of an attack against the United States through a company in Chicago , known as the Chicago Captive Balloon Company . The newspapers printed a <unk> that warned against <unk> and starting rumors that could lead to developing unwanted war airships or a cause for other nations to make military equipment against this new war technology . 
 Myers made eleven hydrogen balloons for the Navy for Admiral Francis J. Higginson in 1902 for a military exercise . Ten of the balloons were six feet in diameter and used for signaling purposes that troops were nearby . The eleventh balloon of 12 @,@ 000 cubic feet capacity was twenty @-@ eight @-@ feet in diameter . It was capable of carrying two men and all their associated observation equipment . It was used by the Signal Corps for a high altitude observation platform to monitor enemy warships . This balloon was tethered to and controlled by a Navy ship . The intelligence gleaned about the enemy and its possible intentions could be passed on to the Army . 
 Myers predicted that a combination airship of his " torpedo " airship and " sky @-@ cycle " airship would be ideal for commerce , transportation , and sport events . He claimed that a " war craft " could be made to destroy any fleet , fort , or army within its range . He predicted that if such a combination airship was built and financed by a government then it would dominate the earth . 
 = = St. Louis World ’ s Fair = = 
 Myers made passenger balloons for the St. Louis Fair in 1904 . He was the superintendent of the Aeronautic Concourse of the St. Louis World ’ s Fair . He was one of the managers in charge of a purse of $ 200 @,@ 000 prize money for various balloon tournaments and races . He pointed out that building airships was very expensive and took knowledge of advanced balloon techniques that basically nobody in America had . Myers used as an example , to win the $ 20 @,@ 000 prize of the Aero Club the French balloonist Alberto Santos @-@ Dumont spent more than that amount in six airships he entered into the tournament to win . Myers himself had an over abundance of ideas for balloons , but was short on cash to make many of them a reality even though he had the necessary balloon knowledge . The newspapers printed that Myers was making a balloon capable of holding 75 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 cubic feet of hydrogen . 
 The World 's Fair airship exhibit was located south of Physical Culture hall and west of the Hall of Congress . The 14 acre " aerial harbor " facility was surrounded by a 42 foot high fence which is where all the airships were located . It was like a marine harbor that would hold steamships , but contained large balloons instead – that were all behind the world ’ s first scientific and largest air @-@ break wall . The north end of the area was equipment for making hydrogen gas to fill up these balloon envelopes of whatever shape and size they came in . The varnished silk bags that held the hydrogen gas were made by Myers . 
 Myers had also at the World ’ s Fair a torpedo shaped balloon . It was 13 feet in diameter and designed for warfare . The little electric motor propeller that pushed the large airship forward was the size of a fishing reel and smaller than Queen Victoria ’ s brooch on display in a building nearby . His torpedo warships would carry dynamite balls that could be dropped on the enemy remotely from a safe distance away . Myers described how the controlling could be done remotely by transmitting waves of light from a distance . 
 Myers and his wife did the first balloon ascension on the Fair grounds on July 4 to race the aeronaut Tracy A. <unk> to draw crowds . A second ascension was done by Myers on August 27 . He had a balloon race with professor G. E. Tomlinson to the Washington Monument . Both were unsuccessful . Myers landed 21 miles from his starting location and Tomlinson ended up hundreds of miles off course before he landed .

 Myers had commercialized the balloon industry and had a monopoly on the related business in the nineteenth century . He called himself " aeronautic engineer " in 1888 . He was a lecturer at Cooper Institute of New York and at Cornell University . Myers toured the United States and gave lectures on aeronautics on many occasions . He was one of the earliest members of the Aero Club of New York , as its fifth pilot . Myers ' inventions and innovations pertaining to balloon technology have been written up in Scientific American and other scientific journals . His " balloon farm " estate was used for many years by hundreds of aircraft enthusiasts .

 After a career of balloon ascending performances and managing the " balloon farm " business for several decades Myers retired in 1909 . Myers and his wife moved in 1910 to Atlanta , Georgia to live with their daughter , Elizabeth " Bessie " Aerial ( born 1881 ) . Myers died on November 30 , 1925 at the age of 83 and his wife died in 1932 , also at the age of 83 . During most of his life he was a member of the Episcopal Church and a Republican . In his later life in politics he associated himself with the prohibition party .

 " Cold Station 12 " is the fifth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the eighty @-@ first episode overall . It was directed by Mike Vejar from a script by Alan Brennert , and aired on November 5 , 2004 , on UPN . It comprises the middle @-@ act of a three @-@ episode arc , preceded by " Borderland " and followed by " The Augments " . 
 The series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . In this episode , after leaving Enterprise stranded , Doctor Arik Soong and his Augments travel to " Cold Station 12 " , a secretive pathogen and bio @-@ medical facility run by Starfleet Medical and the <unk> , where much of this episode 's plot unfolds . Once inside , they begin torturing the scientists with the goal of retrieving some 1 @,@ 800 augmented embryos , allowing them to expand their race . 
 The production team created several new sets to represent the space station itself , as well as re @-@ using some from " Borderland " to represent the Klingon starship . The make @-@ up team were required to make Brent Spiner look younger for flashbacks and to show the progression of a character 's exposure to a number of pathogens . The story @-@ arc has been considered one of the best seen in Enterprise , and critics praised " Cold Station 12 " , specifically for the special effects and character development , but felt that the death scene crossed the line . On first broadcast , the episode was watched by 2 @.@ 1 percent of the population according to Nielsen ratings , placing it in fifth position for the timeslot .

 After the escape of Doctor Soong and the Augments , Captain Archer and his crew proceed to the coordinates Soong had provided earlier in the mission . On <unk> IV , the away team find an abandoned building where the young Augments were raised and schooled by " father " Soong . They also capture a banished member of the Augments named Udar . Nicknamed " <unk> " by his Augment siblings after a handicapped character from the comic novel Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens , he is taken to Enterprise . Analysis reveals that although Udar 's DNA is similar to the other Augments , he has none of their enhanced abilities ( except for superior hearing ) . 
 Meanwhile , Soong and the Augments capture Barzai , a <unk> medical ship , and use it to enter the medical facility called Cold Station 12 ( C @-@ 12 ) . They soon overpower security and capture the scientists there , including its chief medical officer , Doctor Jeremy Lucas ( Doctor Phlox 's Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart ) . Due to security protocols , tensions begin to surface between Soong and Malik , as to how to coerce Lucas into divulging the entry codes . Malik convinces Soong to torture Lucas , and failing that , to expose a scientist to a deadly pathogen using a containment chamber . 
 Enterprise approaches within transporter range , and beams an away team ( including Phlox ) to the facility . They are soon detected , however , and imprisoned with the facility 's staff . Meanwhile , Commander T 'Pol , having lost contact with the team , attempts to destroy the station , but the Klingon ship intervenes . Malik uses Phlox 's friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas ( by threatening to expose him to a pathogen as well ) . Soong , who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C @-@ 12 , is now able to access the remaining 1 @,@ 800 , a carry @-@ over from the Eugenics Wars . Soong and the Augments then escape , but not before Malik kills <unk> , helps himself to a number of pathogen samples , and sets the viral containment fields to fail .

 The episode was the second of a three @-@ part storyline , which was intended to link Enterprise more closely to Star Trek : The Original Series with the return of genetically engineered " Augments " which had appeared alongside Khan Noonian Singh in " Space Seed " and the movie Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan . It was preceded by the episode " Borderland " , and followed by " The Augments " . Production on the episode began on August 24 , 2004 , and concluded on September 1 . There were several swing sets created for the episode , specifically to cover the scenes filmed on board the station . It re @-@ used the sets created for " Borderland " to represent the Klingon vessel captured by the Augments . There we also sets created to represent the compound where Soong raised the genetically altered humans , which was set up different as flashbacks to the character 's childhoods were also shot for this episode . It was directed by Mike Vejar , who had directed several earlier episodes of Star Trek , most recently " Stratagem " . It was written by Consulting Producer Alan Brennert , his first writing credit in the franchise . 
 There was some specific work required by the make @-@ up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to look younger which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make @-@ up . Also , the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character go through a series of levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong . These included colored contact lenses , prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was added to his eyes to make them bloodshot . 
 There were several guest actors in " Cold Station 12 " . The character , Dr. Jeremy Lucas , had been previously mentioned in the episodes " Dear Doctor " and " Doctor 's Orders " as a friend of Phlox . But " Cold Station 12 " marked the first occasion that the character appeared on screen , played by Richard Riehle . The actor had previously appeared in the Star Trek : The Next Generation episode " The Inner Light " as well as the Star Trek : Voyager episodes " Fair Haven " and the follow @-@ up episode " Spirit Folk " . Guest stars Spiner , Alec Newman and Abby <unk> resumed their roles from the previous episode in the trilogy , " Borderland " .

 " Cold Station 12 " was first broadcast on November 5 , 2004 , on UPN . According to Nielsen ratings , it was watched by 2 @.@ 1 percent of the population of the United States and by four percent of those watching television at the time . This put it in fifth place for the 8pm timeslot , behind Totally Outrageous Behavior and World 's Craziest Videos on Fox . 
 Bill Gordon , writing for the website Sci @-@ Fi Pulse , said that it was a " nearly flawless episode " , with his one critique in his analysis of the plot being targeted at Captain Archer telling Soong that they were sending over the self @-@ destruct code for the station . He said that there was an " epic " quality to " Cold Station 12 " that made him compare it to the Star Trek film franchise , saying that it had " stellar FX shots , to first class character and story development , to a quality of writing that has been sadly lacking in the Star Trek universe of late . " 
 In her review for TrekNation , Michelle Erica Green praised the episode , saying it was an improvement on " Borderland " and that Spiner was even better . But she found the murder of the doctor shocking and felt that it had gone too far . She said that themes raised in " Cold Station 12 " mirrored those which could have appeared on The Original Series but that this episode didn 't take the time to discuss them . She hoped that the final episode of the trilogy would cover that ground . The mini @-@ arc featuring the episodes " Borderland " , " Cold Station 12 " and " The Augments " were subsequently ranked the sixth best story of Enterprise by Den of Geek writer James Hunt . Viewing of " Cold Station 12 " was included alongside the Doctor Who episode " The Beast Below " in the course " Captain Picard Meets Dr. Who " at the University of Dubuque to demonstrate the idea of sacrificing one person to save many . 
 The first home media release of " Cold Station 12 " was as part of the season four DVD box set of Enterprise , originally released in the United States on November 1 , 2005 . The Blu ray release of the fourth season of Enterprise was on April 1 , 2014 . 
 = Parc Cwm long cairn = 
 Parc Cwm long cairn ( Welsh : <unk> hir Parc Cwm ) , also known as Parc le Breos burial chamber ( <unk> <unk> Parc le Breos ) , is a partly restored Neolithic chambered tomb , identified in 1937 as a Severn @-@ Cotswold type of chambered long barrow . The cromlech , a megalithic burial chamber , was built around 5850 years before present ( BP ) , during the early Neolithic . It is about seven 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 12 km ) west south – west of Swansea , Wales , in what is now known as Coed y Parc Cwm at Parc le Breos , on the Gower Peninsula . 
 A trapezoidal cairn of rubble – the upper part of the cromlech and its earth covering now removed – about 72 feet ( 22 m ) long by 43 feet ( 13 m ) ( at its widest ) , is revetted by a low dry @-@ stone wall . A bell @-@ shaped , south @-@ facing forecourt , formed by the wall , leads to a central passageway lined with limestone slabs set on end . Human remains had been placed in the two pairs of stone chambers that lead from the passageway . Corpses may have been placed in nearby caves until they decomposed , when the bones were moved to the tomb . 
 The cromlech was discovered in 1869 by workmen digging for road stone . An excavation later that year revealed human bones ( now known to have belonged to at least 40 people ) , animal remains , and Neolithic pottery . Samples from the site show the tomb to have been in use for between 300 and 800 years . North @-@ West European lifestyles changed around 6000 BP , from the nomadic lives of the hunter @-@ gatherer , to a settled life of agricultural farming : the Neolithic Revolution . However , analysis of the human remains found at Parc Cwm long cairn show the people interred in the cromlech continued to be either hunter @-@ gatherers or herders , rather than agricultural farmers . 
 Parc Cwm long cairn lies in a former medieval deer park , established in the 1220s CE by the Marcher Lord of Gower as Parc le Breos – an enclosed area of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) , now mainly farmland . The cromlech is on the floor of a dry narrow limestone gorge containing about 500 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 km2 ) of woodland . Free pedestrian access is via an asphalt track leading from the park 's entrance , which has free parking for 12 – 15 cars about 250 yards ( 230 m ) from the site . Parc Cwm long cairn is maintained by Cadw , the Welsh Government 's historic environment division . 
 = = History = = 
 From the end of the last ice age ( between 12 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 BP ) Mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherers began to migrate northwards from Central Europe ; the area that would become known as Wales was free of glaciers by about 10 @,@ 250 BP . At that time sea levels were much lower than today , and the shallower parts of what is now the North Sea were dry land . The east coast of present day England and the coasts of present day Denmark , Germany and the Netherlands were connected by the former landmass known as Doggerland , forming the British Peninsula on the European mainland . The post @-@ glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland , forming the Irish Sea . Doggerland was submerged by the North Sea and , by 8000 BP , the British Peninsula had become an island . By the beginning of the Neolithic ( 6 @,@ 000 BP ) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet ( 10 m ) lower than today . Historian John Davies has theorised that the story of <unk> 'r <unk> 's drowning , and tales in the Mabinogion of the water between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower , may be distant folk memories of that time . The warmer climate caused major changes to the flora and fauna of Great Britain , and encouraged the growth of dense forest that covered 80 – 90 % of the island . 
 Human lifestyles in North @-@ West Europe changed around 6000 BP ; from the Mesolithic ( Middle Stone Age ) nomadic lives of hunting and gathering , to the Neolithic ( New Stone Age ) agrarian life of agriculture and settlement . John Davies notes that such a transformation cannot have been developed by the people living in North @-@ West Europe independently , as neither the grain necessary for crops nor the animals suitable for domestication are indigenous to the area . Recent genetic studies conclude that these cultural changes were introduced to Britain by farmers migrating from the European mainland . They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land , developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production , and used a similar tradition of long barrow construction that began in continental Europe during the 7th millennium BP – the free standing megalithic structures supporting a sloping capstone ( known as dolmens ) , common across Atlantic Europe that were , according to John Davies , " the first substantial , permanent constructions of man " . Such massive constructions would have needed a large labour force ( up to 200 men ) suggestive of large communities nearby . However , in his contribution to History of Wales , 25 @,@ 000 BC AD 2000 , archaeologist Joshua Pollard notes that not all Neolithic communities were part of the simultaneous " marked transformations in material culture , ideology and technical practices " known as the Neolithic Revolution .
