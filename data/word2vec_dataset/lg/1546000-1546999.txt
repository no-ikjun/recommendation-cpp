 Rosemary Edna Sinclair ( born 17 November 1936 ) , also known as Rosemary Fenton , is an Australian environmental and children 's rights activist . She is involved in administrative approach related to developmental actions . She won the title of Miss Australia in 1960 . She has held many key posts at Telecom Australia . In 2002 , she was represented on the Broadband Advisory Group of Federal Government and was also a delegate to the United Nations Special Session on Children ( New York ) . In November 1988 , in association with Christine Stewart , she founded the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect ( <unk> ) to fully address issues related to child abuse . She also works as the Managing Director of the Australian Telecommunications ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Rosemary Fenton was born on Lord Howe Island on 17 November 1936 . Her father , Stanley Fenton , worked as a radio operator at the Civil Aviation Department on the island . Her schooling until matriculation was at the Presbyterian Ladies ' College , Sydney , a boarding school . She also did a course in nursing . When her mother died in 1952 , she returned to Lord Howe Island to look after her father and two younger siblings , brother Stan and sister Robyn . While she had left the island to attend secondary school , she used to come home twice a year . Her paintings adorned the walls of her father 's house . 
 Sinclair wanted to compete for the Miss Australia beauty contest . As she lived on the island keeping house for her family , she stitched her own clothes on the basis of a catalog she had obtained from Sydney . She tried these clothes on her younger 12- year old sister Robyn as a model . She won the Miss Australia title in November 1960 and was very modest about winning the crown . She then went on a prize @-@ winning tour of Hong Kong , Tokyo , Honolulu , San Francisco , and many other places . Thereafter , she worked as a model . 
 She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Arts , Law , and Business and a Master 's Degree ( MA ) in Commerce .

 Sinclair took up the environmental cause of her birthplace , the Lord Howe Island , in 1982 , when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site . Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island , Sinclair was unhappy with many of the planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status , as it affected the basic rights of the islanders . Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century ; she considered these trees ( though not indigenous ) as part of the island 's heritage . When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between the trees to stop the tree cutters . Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island . She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island , as the embankments were eroding . She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards . The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island 's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100 , which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years . Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve in a part of the island . She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years . All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised . In 1967 , she worked in the Prime Minister 's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo . 
 In 1980 , Sinclair became Managing Director of Australian Telecommunications Users Group ( <unk> ) , an NGO dedicated to protecting the rights of product users in Australia in the field of telecommunications .

 = Moltke @-@ class battlecruiser = 
 The Moltke class was a class of two " all @-@ big @-@ gun " battlecruisers of the German Imperial Navy built between 1909 – 1911 . Named SMS Moltke and SMS Goeben , they were similar to the previous Von der Tann unique battlecruiser , but the newer design featured several incremental improvements . The Moltkes were slightly larger , faster , and better armored , and had an additional pair of 28 centimeter guns . 
 Both ships served during World War I. Moltke participated in several major battles with the rest of the High Seas Fleet , including the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea , and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea . At the end of the war , Moltke was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow while the ships ' fate was being discussed during peace treaty negotiations . The ships were scuttled on 21 June 1919 to prevent their seizure by the Allies . 
 Goeben was stationed in the Mediterranean at the start of the war ; she escaped from pursuing Royal Navy ships to Constantinople . The ship , along with the light cruiser Breslau , was transferred to the Ottoman Navy soon after arrival . Strategically , Goeben played a very important role : she helped bring the Ottoman Empire into the war as a member of the Central Powers , and by acting as a fleet in being the ship prevented Anglo @-@ French attempts to force the Bosporus , and similarly stymied a possible advance by the Russian Black Sea Fleet . Goeben was retained by the new Turkish government after the war . Only slightly modified from her original configuration , the ship remained on active service with the Turkish Navy until being decommissioned on 20 December 1950 ; she was stricken from the Navy register on 14 November 1954 . Two years earlier , when Turkey joined NATO in 1952 , the ship was assigned the hull number B70 . The ship was unsuccessfully offered for sale to the West German government in 1963 . Without a group willing to preserve her as a museum , the ship was sold to <unk> <unk> in 1971 for scrapping . She was towed to the breakers on 7 June 1973 , and the work was completed in February 1976 . 
 = = Development = = 
 During a May 1907 conference , the German Naval Office decided to follow up the Von der Tann unique battlecruiser with an enlarged design . The 44 million marks allocated for the 1908 fiscal year created the possibility of increasing the size of the main guns from the 28 cm ( 11 in ) weapons of the preceding design to 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 in ) . However , Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , along with the Construction Department , argued that increasing the number of guns from 8 to 10 would be preferable , as the 28 cm guns had been deemed sufficient to engage even battleships . Tirpitz also argued that , given the numerical superiority of the Royal Navy 's reconnaissance forces , it would be more prudent to increase the number of main guns , rather than increase their caliber . The General Navy Department held that for the new design to fight in the battle line , 30 @.@ 5 cm guns were necessary . Ultimately , Tirpitz and the Construction Department won the debate , and Moltke was to be equipped with ten 28 cm guns . It was also mandated by the Construction Department that the new ships have armor protection equal or superior to Von der Tann 's and a top speed of at least 24 @.@ 5 knots ( 45 @.@ 4 km / h ) . 
 During the design process , there were many weight increases due to growth in the size of the citadel , armor thickness , additions to the ammunition stores , and the rearrangement of the boiler system . It was originally planned to build only one ship of the new design , but due to the strains being put on the Navy design staff , it was decided to build two ships of the new type . They were assigned under the contract names of " Cruiser G " and " Cruiser H " . As Blohm & Voss made the lowest bid for " Cruiser G " , the company also secured the contract for " Cruiser H " . The former was assigned to the 1908 – 09 building year , while the latter was assigned to 1909 – 10 . 
 The contract for " Cruiser G " was awarded on 17 September 1908 , under building number 200 . The keel was laid on 7 December 1908 , and the ship was launched on 7 April 1910 . " Cruiser G " was commissioned on 30 September 1911 as SMS Moltke . The ship 's namesake was Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke , the Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army in the mid 19th century . " Cruiser H " was ordered on 8 April 1909 with the building number 201 . The ship 's keel was laid on 12 August 1909 ; the hull was launched on 28 March 1911 . After fitting @-@ out , " Cruiser H " was commissioned on 2 July 1912 as SMS Goeben . The ship was named for August Karl von Goeben , a Prussian general who served during the Franco @-@ Prussian War .

The Moltke @-@ class ships had 15 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 78 % of the keel of the ships . They were considered to handle well , with gentle movement even in heavy seas . However , they were slow to answer the helm and were not particularly maneuverable . The ships lost up to 60 % speed and heeled 9 degrees at full rudder . The ships had a standard crew of 43 officers and 1010 men . While Moltke served as the I Scouting Squadron flagship , she was manned by an additional 13 officers and 62 men . While serving as the second command flagship , the ship carried an additional 3 officers and 25 men to the standard complement .

 Moltke and Goeben were powered by four @-@ shaft Parsons turbines in two sets and 24 coal @-@ fired Schulz @-@ Thornycroft boilers , divided into four boiler rooms . The boilers were composed of one steam drum and three water drums apiece , and produced steam at 16 standard atmospheres ( 240 psi ) . After 1916 , the boilers were supplemented with tar @-@ oil . The Parsons turbines were divided into high- and low @-@ pressure pairs . The low @-@ pressure turbines were the inner pair , and were placed in the aft engine room . The high @-@ pressure turbines were on either side of the low @-@ pressure pair , and were located in the forward wing rooms . The turbines powered four propellers , 3 @.@ 74 m ( 12 @.@ 3 ft ) in diameter .

 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament was ten 28 cm ( 11 in ) SK L / 50 guns in five twin turrets . The guns were placed in Drh.L C / 1908 turret mounts ; these mountings allowed a maximum elevation of 13 @.@ 5 degrees . This elevation was 7 @.@ 5 degrees less than in the preceding Von der Tann , and , as a consequence , the range was slightly shorter , at 18 @,@ 100 m ( 19 @,@ 800 yd ) , than the 18 @,@ 900 m ( 20 @,@ 700 yd ) of Von der Tann 's guns . In 1916 , during a refit , the elevation was increased to 16 degrees , for an increased range of 19 @,@ 100 m ( 20 @,@ 900 yd ) . One turret , Anton , was located fore , two aft ( Dora turret superfiring over Emil ) , and two , Bruno and Cäsar , were wing turrets mounted en echelon . The guns fired armor @-@ piercing and semi @-@ armor @-@ piercing shells , which both weighed 302 kg ( 670 lb ) . The guns could fire at a rate of 3 rounds per minute , and had a muzzle velocity of 895 m / s ( 2 @,@ 940 ft / s ) . A total of 810 of these shells were stored aboard the ship . 
 The ships ' secondary armament consisted of twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 45 cannon , mounted in the MPL C / 06 mounts as in Von der Tann . The guns had a total of 1800 shells , at 150 per gun . The 15 cm guns had a range of 13 @,@ 500 m ( 14 @,@ 800 yd ) at construction , although this was later extended to 18 @,@ 800 m ( 18 @,@ 373 yd ) . Initially , twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 45 guns were also fitted to defend the ships against torpedo boats and destroyers , but these were later removed , with the guns in the aft superstructure replaced with four 8 @.@ 8 cm Flak L / 45 guns . 
 Moltke and Goeben were also armed with four 50 cm ( 20 in ) torpedo tubes ; one fore , one aft , and two on the broadside , with 11 torpedoes stored . The torpedoes were of the G / 7 model , which weighed 1 @,@ 365 kg ( 3 @,@ 010 lb ) and carried a warhead weighing 195 kg ( 430 lb ) . The torpedoes had a maximum range of 9 @,@ 300 m ( 10 @,@ 200 yd ) at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ) , and 4 @,@ 000 m ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) when set at 37 knots ( 69 km / h ) .

 The ships were equipped with Krupp cemented armor . The level of armor protection for the Moltke class was increased from the Von der Tann design , to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in the forward main belt , 27 cm ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) in the citadel , and 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) aft . The casemates were protected by 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) vertically and 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) on the roofs . The forward conning tower was protected by 35 cm ( 14 in ) , and the aft tower had 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) of armor . The turrets had 23 cm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) on the face , 18 cm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) on the sides , and 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) on the roofs . The deck armor and sloping armor were both 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) , as was the torpedo bulkhead around the barbettes . The torpedo bulkhead was 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) in other , less critical areas . As with Von der Tann , the armor was Krupp cemented and nickel steel .

 Moltke replaced the armored cruiser Roon in the I Scouting Group on 30 September 1911 . On 19 April 1912 , Moltke and light cruisers Stettin and Bremen departed Germany for a goodwill visit to the United States , and arrived on 30 May . In early July , Moltke escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II 's yacht to Russia . Once the ship returned , the commander of the I Scouting Group made Moltke his flagship — a role in which she served until Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper transferred his flag to the newer battlecruiser Seydlitz on 23 June 1914 . 
 Moltke participated in most of the major fleet actions conducted by the German Navy during the First World War , including the Battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea , and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion in the Baltic . The ship took part in several operations to bombard the English coast , including the first raid on Yarmouth , the attack on the towns of Scarborough , Hartlepool , and Whitby , and the second raid on Yarmouth and Lowestoft . Moltke was damaged several times during the war : the ship was hit by heavy @-@ caliber gunfire at Jutland , and torpedoed twice by British submarines while on fleet advances . 
 Following the end of the war in 1918 , Moltke , together with most of the High Seas Fleet , was interned at Scapa Flow pending a decision by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet . The ship met her end when she was scuttled by her crew , along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in 1919 to prevent them from being seized by the British Royal Navy . The wreck of Moltke was raised on 10 June 1927 , and scrapped at Rosyth from 1927 to 1929 . 
 = = = Goeben = = = 
 Following the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912 , the German High Command decided to create a Mediterranean Division in an attempt to exert influence in the area . The new squadron consisted of Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau ; the two ships left Kiel on 4 November and arrived off Constantinople on 15 November . The ships visited several Mediterranean ports , including Venice , Pola , and Naples . The First Balkan War ended on 30 May 1913 , and there was some consideration given to withdrawing the pair to German waters . However , the conflict reignited less than a month later on 29 June , meaning the ships would have to remain in the area . 
 Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914 , Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon recognized the imminent outbreak of war , and so immediately sailed to Pola for repair work for Goeben . The ships were then ordered to steam to Constantinople . While en route , they were pursued by British forces , but Goeben and Breslau managed to evade them and reach Istanbul by 10 August 1914 . Goeben was transferred to the Ottoman Empire and renamed Yavûz Sultân Selîm after Sultan Selim I. Popularly known as Yavûz , she was designated as the flagship of the Ottoman Navy , but she retained her German crew . Goeben , flying the Ottoman flag , bombarded the Russian port of Sevastopol , captured and sank a Russian minesweeper , and damaged a destroyer on 29 October 1914 . The Russian government responded by declaring war on the Ottoman Empire on 1 November ; Britain and France followed suit on 5 November . By acting as a fleet in being , Goeben effectively blocked a Russian advance into the Bosporus , and defended against a similar incursion of British and French pre @-@ dreadnoughts . More powerful British and French warships — which could have dealt with Goeben — could not be risked in the heavily mined and U @-@ boat patrolled Turkish waters . 
 In 1936 she was renamed TCG Yavûz and remained the flagship of the Turkish Navy until 1950 , although the ship was largely stationary in <unk> from 1948 . In 1952 , Turkey joined NATO , and the ship was assigned the hull number " B70 " . Yavûz was decommissioned on 20 December 1950 , and removed from the navy register on 14 November 1954 . The Turkish government attempted to preserve the ship as a museum , including an offer to West Germany to sell the ship back in 1963 , but none of the efforts were successful . Goeben was sold for scrapping in 1971 , and was eventually broken up between 1973 and 1976 — the last remaining ship of the Imperial German Navy . 
 = Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë = 
 The Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë ( Albanian : Republika <unk> <unk> e Korçës ) was an autonomous state established in 1916 , by the local French forces , after the city of Korçë fell under their control , during World War I and lasted till 1920 . 
 Due to developments in the Macedonian Front of World War I the city of Korçë came under French control ( 1916 – 20 ) . During this time 14 representatives of Korçë and French Colonel Descoins signed a protocol that proclaimed the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë under the military protection of the French army and with Themistokli Gërmenji as Prefect of Police . 
 The new authorities introduced Albanian as the official language and replaced Greek schools with Albanian ones , which were forbidden during the Greek administration of the city . There was also a French school in Korçë and one of its many students was Enver Hoxha , who was apprentice ( 1927 — 1930 ) and then teacher ( 1937 — 1939 ) . He would later become the First Secretary of the Albanian Party of Labour , serving from 1941 until his death in 1985 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Republic of Korçë was established in 1916 during World War I. The Austro @-@ Hungarian army invaded northern Albania in the spring of 1916 , the Kingdom of Bulgaria 's army occupied the eastern parts of Albania , including the city of <unk> ( which was later handed over to Austria @-@ Hungary ) . The French army occupied Korçë and its surrounding areas on November 29 , 1916 . Italy occupied the port of Vlorë and the region of south Principality of Albania on December 1914 and in the autumn 1916 . 
 = = = Northern Epirus = = = 
 Korçë belongs to the region regarded as Northern Epirus , a region with substantial Albanian , Aromanian and Greek populations . The Greek national view was to classify all Aromanians and Orthodox Albanians as part of the Greek minority . The Great Powers signed the Protocol of Florence and awarded the region to the newly founded Principality of Albania on December 17 , 1913 . Gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable the Albanian forces to take control of the region . Consequently , to avert this possibility , pro @-@ Greek Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self @-@ governance . 
 = = = = Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus = = = = 
 On February 28 , 1914 , the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was declared in Gjirokastër and the provisional Government was formed to support the state 's objectives . The Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17 , 1914 and the Albanian Government officially recognized the area of Northern Epirus as an autonomous region within the Albanian state . Soon after the outbreak of World War I ( July 1914 ) , the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued . As the country split into a number of regional governments , Prince William departed the country in September 1914 .

 On October 27 , 1914 , after approval from the Great Powers , the Greek army re @-@ entered the area . During the Greek administration , and while the First World War continued , it had been agreed between Greece , Italy and the Great Powers that the final settlement of the Northern Epirote issue should be left to the future , after the war ended . After Venizelos ' resignation in December however , the succeeding royalist governments were determined to exploit the situation and pre @-@ determine the region 's future by incorporating it formally within the Greek state . In the first months of 1916 , Northern Epirus participated in the Greek elections and elected 16 representatives for the Greek Parliament . In March , the region 's union with Greece was officially declared , and the area was divided into the prefectures of Argyrokastro and Korytsa . 
 = = = = Bulgarian occupation of Korçë = = = = 
 After the beginning of Bulgaria 's engagement in First World War on the side of the Central Powers in autumn 1915 , many ethnic Albanians joined the Bulgarians who gave them weapons . The Kingdom of Bulgaria used its army to occupy the eastern part of Albania at the beginning of the occupation of Albania . 
 After the occupation of the eastern parts of Albania , inclusive of the city of Elbasan , on August 18 , 1916 the Bulgarian army , probably attempting to join Austrian forces in Albania and in a combined attack on the Italian army , occupied Korçë and ejected the Greek garrison from the city . Bulgaria 's objective was to persuade the Albanian leaders to elect Prince Kiril , second son of Ferdinand I of Bulgaria , as their king ( Albanian : <unk> ) . An additional reason for the Bulgarian occupation of Korçë was that Bulgarian positions in <unk> would be seriously threatened if the Allies gained control of Korçë .

 French troops entered Korçë on November 29 , 1916 during a military operation that aimed to connect the Allied front in <unk> in the Macedonian front to the region in south Albania , which was held by the Italian troops . French troops in Korçë were under General Maurice Sarrail , and under direct command of Colonel Descoins . There were two groups of rebels active in the region of Korçë , one was led by Themistokli Gërmenji and another by Sali <unk> . In the meantime , Albanian irregular bands , headed by <unk> and cooperating with the Austrian forces , completely ravaged Moscopole , and threatened that if Korçë would suffer the same fate if it did not raise the Albanian flag and surrender to Albanian authorities .

Themistokli Gërmenji came to Korçë from Pogradec , which was occupied by the armies of Austria @-@ Hungary and Bulgaria . The French officers appointed a commission led by Gërmenji . The commission had fourteen members , seven Christians and seven Muslims . The members of this commission were : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Vasil <unk> , Vasil <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Cale , <unk> Shabani , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Dishnica , Emin <unk> , <unk> Dishnica , Sali <unk> and Haki <unk> . 
 The commission held a meeting on December 10 at 9 am in the Saint George 's School and Gërmenji held a speech to the gathered men and after the meeting led the commission to the prefecture . In the prefecture they met with Colonel Descoins and with the other French officers . Haki <unk> approached to Colonel Descoins on behalf of the commission . Colonel Descoins informed the commission that they should sign a protocol . On December 10 , 1916 Colonel Descoins and the commission signed a protocol , according to which an autonomous province would be established on the territories of Korçë , <unk> , <unk> , Opar and Gora . It was also agreed that the 14 members of the commission would make up the administrative council , responsible for maintaining order . 
 = = = Protocol = = = 
 The text of the protocol , which stated that it was made according to the wishes of the Albanian delegates of kaza of Korçë , had 9 points that are summarized below : 
 the autonomous province of Korçë is established by this protocol , and refers to the territory of Korçë , <unk> , <unk> , Opar and Gora 
 the kaza Korçë will be governed by the Administrative Council with 14 members , half <unk> and half Muslim 
 appointments to the positions in the kaza will be made by French military authorities , based on the proposal of the administrative council 
 for maintaining order in the kaza , the prefect of police will be responsible , using newly established gendarmerie and police 
 there shall be established a special unit of " Albanian gendarmerie mobile " which would be responsible for safeguarding the territory 's independence and freedom of its people 
 for the same purpose there can be established a regular battalion of volunteers 
 Police , gendarmerie and volunteer troops would be under superior authority of the French officer 
 the official language is Albanian 
 the flag of the kaza Korçë will be traditional Skanderbeg flag with tricolor French flag 
 The new authorities in Korçë organized the police force and gendarmerie , a post office system and issued postage stamps . 
 = = = Statute = = = 
 On September 27 , 1917 General Maurice Sarrail proclaimed a new statute which repealed constitutional protocol . The Administration was entrusted to the commander of the army group Malik . The Administrative Council was replaced with an Advisory Council which was reduced to 12 members ( still half Muslims and half Christians ) . Territory under French administration was divided on two parts , north ( Pogradec ) and south ( Republic of Korçë ) of <unk> . 
 = = = Administration = = = 
 On December 10 , 1916 , Henry Descoins , the commander of the French garrison of Korçë , with the approval of Maurice Sarrail , declared the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë , and appointed Themistokli Gërmenji as prefect . In the following period the Greeks of the city were persecuted by the Albanian nationalist elements that aimed at acquiring control over Korçë . As a result , the local Greeks asked the French authorities to prolong their occupation until the end of World War I. 
 In the period of March 1917 – February 1918 , <unk> Dishnica was appointed as the Chairman of the Albanian Administrative Council . On the French side , the delegated governors of the Republic of Korçë were Henri Descoins ( December 10 , 1916 – May 11 , 1917 ) , Salle ( 1917 — 1919 ) and Reynard <unk> ( June 1919 – May 26 , 1920 ) . 
 The French delegated governors appointed an officer to be their delegate to the Council . The first officer appointed was reserve Lieutenant <unk> , who was replaced in the middle of January 1917 by a Lieutenant Siegfried . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 France intended to help in establishing 200 elementary schools on Albanian language , as part of the strategy of Albanian national affirmation . On the other hand , all the Greek schools were forced to close down , while the Greek element of the city was persecuted . The Albanian National Lyceum ( French : Le lycée de <unk> , Albanian : Liceu Kombëtar i Korçës ) high school in Korçë was established in 1917 . French authorities claim that they banned opening of the high school because they did not want to offend their Greek allies led by Eleftherios Venizelos ' Movement of National Defence , who claimed rights over the area . Some sources find this claim inappropriate , considering that the French Lycée in <unk> sent professor Vital Gerson to lead a small team of three Albanian professors to join a French officer , who gave some notions of French culture , on the opening ceremony of the school . The French National Lyceum was the first Albanian high school that was open to the students of all faiths . 
 = = = Currency = = = 
 The <unk> ( Albanian ) or franc ( French ) was the currency of the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë ( also written " <unk> " on the currency ) between 1917 and 1921 . It was subdivided into 100 centimes . The currency was introduced during the period of French occupation . It was only issued in paper money form , with notes issued in denominations of 50 centimes , 1 and 5 <unk> . Both paper money and post stamps were engraved by the soldier <unk> ( a student of Louis @-@ Oscar Roty ) .

 In September 1917 , General Maurice Sarrail undertook an action against the armies of Austria @-@ Hungary and Bulgaria in Albania , and on September 9 French troops captured Pogradec . Together with the armies of Bulgaria and Austria @-@ Hungary , there were Albanians , led by <unk> <unk> , fighting against the French troops . Themistokli Gërmenji was awarded the Croix de guerre in November 1917 , for his participation in the French capture of Pogradec with the battalion from Korçë . Although the French government considered appointing Essad Pasha <unk> to govern the Pogradec region it remained under French administration . 
 = = Disestablishment of the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë = = 
 In November 1917 , General Salle reported that the attempt at cooperation between Christians and Muslims had resulted in frequent difficulties . At the end of 1917 Gërmenji was accused of collaboration with the Central Powers and executed in <unk> after being sentenced to death by the French military court . 
 General Salle removed the already limited autonomy of the Council on February 16 , 1918 . After the <unk> and capitulations at the end of First World War , it was agreed that France and Italy should continue to govern the territories they occupied , and that France , Italy and the British Empire together should govern Shkodër . As a result , the French army moved from Korçë on June 15 , 1920 . After the French army left Korçë , the fate of the territory that it administered was decided by the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On December 12 , 1916 , Italy demanded explanations from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs , through its ambassador , stating that the establishment of the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë violated the Treaty of London . Austria @-@ Hungary used the French precedent in Korçë to justify the proclamation of the independence of Albania under its protectorate on January 3 , 1917 in Shkodër . The Kingdom of Italy followed suit when proclaiming the independence of Albania under its protectorate on June 23 , 1917 in <unk> . 
 Because General Maurice Sarrail had demonstrated a tendency to interfere in politics , Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau relieved him of his command in December 1917 . There was a strong French influence in Korçë even after the Autonomous Republic ceased to exist . The Albanian National Lyceum remained active until 1939 ; a French Military Cemetery was built and can still be seen in the city . 
 = Typhoon Kujira ( 2003 ) = 
 Typhoon Kujira , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Amang , was an extremely long @-@ lived tropical cyclone that lasted for 16 days affected the island nations of Micronesia , Taiwan , and Japan in April 2003 , as well as the earliest typhoon in a calendar year to ever make landfall on the latter . Forming from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April 9 well removed form any landmasses , Kujira quickly intensified in its early stages , and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis . Strengthening slowed afterwards , though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April 14 . Intensification continued and late on April 15 , Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 46 inHg ) . Following peak intensity , Kujira would begin to track northwest and oscillate in strength , cresting an additional two times in intensity . On April 21 , the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan . However , on April 24 , Kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken , and on April 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu . Following landfall Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to persist before these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline towards the end of April 2003 . 
 Shortly after developing , Kujira caused two fatalities in Pohnpei in addition to minor agricultural and infrastructure damage ; similar effects were felt in Guam . Several days later , the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other precautionary measures in the Philippines after forecasts indicated the potential for strong winds and rain . However , effects on the island chain associated with the storm remained minimal . The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan , making it the first April typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat . Unlike in the Philippines , however , Kujira would bring significant rainfall to Taiwan . Effects from the typhoon were most significant in Japan , particularly in the Ryukyu Islands . Strong winds , rain , and waves caused US $ 230 @,@ 000 ( ¥ 27 @.@ 8 million ) in agricultural damage on Ishigaki Island . One person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves . In Kyushu , heavy rainfall , peaking at 196 mm ( 7 @.@ 7 in ) in Ōita Prefecture , was reported . Overall , despite its distance away from land and weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall , Kujira resulted in three fatalities . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The systems that would develop into Typhoon Kujira began as a broad area of convection on April 6 centered south of Pohnpei and near the equator . At the time , the area of disturbed weather exhibited multiple circulation centers , and thus the system remained generally disorganized . On April 8 , however , the convection began to consolidate towards a common center within an area of low wind shear . As such , both the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified the storm system as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on April 9 . For much of the cyclone 's early existence , the low @-@ level circulation center remained east of the primary convection cell as it tracked northward . Nonetheless , the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm intensity just six hours after cyclogenesis , while the JMA continued to classify the system as a tropical depression . 
 Intensification was more gradual following April 9 . At 0000 UTC on April 11 , the JMA upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , thus identifying it with the name Kujira . At roughly the same time , Kujira began to curve towards a westward track due to a high pressure area to the north . Concurrently the ambient wind shear abated and the storm further consolidated , allowing for more quicker strengthening . Throughout the following day , Kujira developed a banding eye feature that would later consolidate into a distinct circular eye ; this was reflected with an upgrade to typhoon status by both the JTWC and JMA at 1800 UTC on April 12 and 0000 UTC on April 14 , respectively . On April 14 , a shortwave trough caused Kujira to track slightly more northwestward . Marked intensification continued , and late on April 15 , the JTWC upgraded the typhoon to super typhoon intensity , the first of the year , while Kujira was located 400 km ( 250 mi ) north @-@ northwest of Yap State . At roughly the same time Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Estimated 1 @-@ minute sustained winds at that time were 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , equivalent to that of a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson wind scale . Following peak intensity , Kujira continued to track westward as it entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) at 1200 UTC on April 16 , and as such the name Amang was assigned to the typhoon by the agency . 
 On April 17 , the tropical cyclone began to track slightly southwestward and encountered an area of dry air and enhanced wind shear , thus temporarily weakening Kujira . Despite the prolonged effects from these inhibitors , the typhoon restrengthened to a secondary peak intensity the following day . Though the JTWC indicated a significant increase in maximum sustained winds , the intensification was only reflected by the JMA with a slight drop in barometric pressure . Over the next two days Kujira would begin to track more northward due to a weakness in the nearby subtropical ridge and oscillate in strength due to an eyewall replacement cycle ; a tertiary peak in strength occurred on April 20 before subsequent weakening . This trend continued , and at 1800 UTC on April 21 , both the JMA and JTWC downgraded Kujira to tropical storm status . Following the system 's downgrade , Kujira became quasi @-@ stationary due to the presence of two nearby high pressure areas , and its motion became erratic . Despite hostile atmospheric conditions , the tropical storm remained intact with persistent , deep convection and organized rainbands . Late on April 23 , however , the cyclone began to drift towards the north as it made its closest approach to Taiwan . Throughout the following day , Kujira would continue to accelerate towards the northeast and weaken at the same time . At 1200 UTC on April 24 , PAGASA ceased issuing advisories on the storm as it had exited the agency 's area of responsibility . At 0300 UTC the next day , the JMA downgraded the storm to tropical depression intensity while the JTWC ceased monitoring of the system three hours later . At roughly the same time , Kujira made landfall near Ushibuka , Kumamoto at the same intensity . Weakening continued , and the JMA would continue to classify the system as a tropical depression until 1200 UTC on April 25 , when it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The JMA would continue to track the extratropical remnants of Kujira until they crossed the International Dateline on April 30 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Shortly after forming , Kujira tracked near Pohnpei , resulting in heavy rainfall across the island , peaking at 250 mm ( 10 in ) . Despite the typhoon 's far distance from the island , two people were killed – one died after being crushed by a prostrated tree , while the other was killed offshore for unknown reasons . It also caused minor damage to buildings and crops on the island . The outer rainbands of the typhoon would later bring gale @-@ force winds and heavy precipitation as it passed well south of Guam . Afterwards , the storm remained well removed from landmasses for a period of time . On April 18 , however , PAGASA issued a public storm warning signal No. 1 for Catanduanes in the Philippines due to the likelihood for gusty winds and rainfall . As Kujira neared the archipelago , the No. 1 warning was expanded to include the Babuyan Islands while a No. 2 warning was introduced for the Batanes Islands in northern Philippines . In preparation for the typhoon , the National Disaster Coordinating Council readied regional disaster coordinating councils and contingency plans while the Armed Forces of the Philippines prepared for any potential emergency situation . The Philippine Coast Guard patrolled Filipino waters throughout Kujira 's close passage in order to redirect ships away from the typhoon . Though the typhoon had also threatened to cancel the biennial San Fernando Race , the concurrent SARS outbreak which had impacted the Philippines ultimately resulted in its cancelling . Eventually any effects in the Philippines remained minimal . 
 As Kujira began to track towards Taiwan , the Taiwanese government issued land- and sea @-@ based warnings in advance of the storm . The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island . Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan , though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April 22 . This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone @-@ related warnings in Taiwan since 1978 . Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall , though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions . However , mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon . The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a contingency plan for the typhoon and had also undertaken other precautionary measures . Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed . The resultant rainfall from Kujira 's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months . 
 Effects from Kujira in Japan were of the greatest extent as opposed to other regions . Several flights were cancelled due to poor visibility in Ehime Prefecture as a result of cloudy conditions onset by the nearby typhoon , and roughly 1 @,@ 800 passengers were affected by these cancellations . Similar flight delays and cancellations also occurred in Kōchi Prefecture . As Kujira approached Japan , the storm brought rough seas to the Ryukyu Islands , where wave heights of 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) were recorded . In Okinawa , a women was swept away by the wave action . Though she was later rescued and transported to a nearby hospital , she later died of resulting injuries . Further south , on Ishigaki Island , intense rainfall and near @-@ record high wind gusts were reported . These combined effects caused US $ 230 @,@ 000 ( ¥ 27 @.@ 8 million ) in agricultural damage spread out over an area of 190 ha ( 460 acres ) . However , the heaviest rainfall associated with Kujira in Japan were on Kyushu . There , precipitation peaked at 196 mm ( 7 @.@ 7 in ) in <unk> , Ōita Prefecture . Five other locations , all of which were on Kyushu , reported rainfall totals in excess of 125 mm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) . Upon its final landfall near Ushibuka , Kumamoto , Kujira became the earliest typhoon in any given calendar year to make landfall in Japan . 
 = Independence Pass ( Colorado ) = 
 Independence Pass , originally known as Hunter Pass , is a high mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado in the United States . It is at elevation 12 @,@ 095 ft ( 3 @,@ 687 m ) on the Continental Divide in the Sawatch Range . The pass is midway between Aspen and Twin Lakes , on the border between Pitkin and Lake counties . 
 State Highway 82 traverses it , in the process reaching the highest elevation of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road . After Cottonwood Pass to the south , it is the second @-@ highest pass with an improved road in the state , the fourth @-@ highest paved road in the state and the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation , it is closed in wintertime , isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season . 
 When the pass is open in warmer weather , it is a popular destination . A scenic overlook near the pass allows visitors to take in the alpine tundra environment above treeline , and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert , Colorado 's highest peak and the second @-@ highest mountain in the contiguous United States . Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities , and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation . Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late spring and early summer . Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge . 
 The pass was formed by glacial action and erosion in the region , and its first recorded sighting was by Zebulon Pike in 1806 . Ferdinand Hayden surveyed it in 1873 . As part of the Continental Divide , it was the limit of European settlement in the region at the time , with the land to the west reserved for the Ute people . Prospectors who defied governor Frederick Walker Pitkin 's order crossed the pass on July 4 , 1879 , giving it its current name and setting up a similarly named village ( now a ghost town ) to its west . A toll road built across the pass was abandoned and neglected after a railroad connection was made to Aspen . A new road replaced it in the 1920s ; portions of the old route can still be seen along the western approach . The Independence Pass Foundation , based in Aspen , works to repair damage to the pass 's environment caused by both roads since 1984 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 At the pass , the main ridge of the Sawatch Range , and thus the Continental Divide , turns from running generally south to more southwesterly . North of the pass slopes rise to an unnamed 13 @,@ 440 @-@ foot ( 4 @,@ 100 m ) peak a half @-@ mile ( 1 km ) away ; a ridge of about the same length connects it to the nearest named summit , 13 @,@ 711 @-@ foot ( 4 @,@ 179 m ) Twining Peak . To the south the ridge rises more gently around Mountain Boy Gulch to an unnamed 13 @,@ 198 @-@ foot ( 4 @,@ 023 m ) summit 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) distant . The first named summit in this direction is Grizzly Peak , Colorado 's highest <unk> . 
 The terrain is level enough , and the ridge broad enough , to allow for a 500 @-@ foot ( 150 m ) parking lot along the south side of Highway 82 at the height of land . The pass is split evenly between Pitkin and Lake counties , as well as White River and San Isabel national forests . Boundaries of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness and the Mount Massive Wilderness are near the pass on the south and north respectively . The Hunter – Fryingpan Wilderness is also nearby . 
 West of the parking area is a small maintenance shed ; on the east are toilet facilities . Both are maintained by the U.S. Forest Service . A paved walkway system extends to a pair of overlooks 500 feet ( 150 m ) to the south allowing views in that direction over the Lake Creek valley to Mount Elbert , at 14 @,@ 440 feet ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) the highest peak both in Colorado and the Rocky Mountains , and La Plata Peak , another <unk> and the state 's fifth @-@ highest peak . A wide dirt path continues southward three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) along the ridge to an unnamed 13 @,@ 020 @-@ foot ( 3 @,@ 970 m ) summit . Across the road a use path leads 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) to the summits of the unnamed peak and Twining . 
 The pass comes roughly in the middle of a 32 @-@ mile ( 51 km ) stretch of Highway 82 between the two winter gates , a corridor that is sometimes referred to in its entirety as Independence Pass . Aspen is 19 miles ( 31 km ) to the west , with Twin Lakes 18 miles ( 29 km ) to the east . Beyond Aspen the highway continues down the valley to the mouth of the Roaring Fork at Glenwood Springs . East of Twin Lakes Highway 82 continues a short distance to its eastern terminus at U.S. Highway 24 , 15 miles ( 24 km ) south of Leadville . 
 On both approaches , the dropoff is steep enough for Highway 82 to require a 6 % grade and switchbacks : one on the west and three on the east . The former approach uses the narrow valley of the Roaring Fork River , a tributary of the Colorado , which rises from Independence Lake west of the pass . Its walls are steeper but shallower than those of the North Fork of Lake Creek , which drains into Twin Lakes Reservoir and the headwaters of the Arkansas River , on the east . 
 The pass is above tree line , so the surrounding terrain is alpine tundra . Open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock , particularly on the steep slope to the north . Snow lingers in some areas year @-@ round . Adjacent to the road and parking area are small ephemeral pools on the southwest , with a larger , permanent one north of the road . 
 = = History = = 
 Like the surrounding mountains , the pass was created by glaciation and erosion over thousands of years . Before European @-@ American settlers arrived , it was in the territory of the Ute Native American tribe . One of the earliest sightings by a European @-@ American was in 1806 , when Zebulon Pike , mapping the southern boundary of the Louisiana Purchase , spotted the gap in what would later be named the Sawatch Range from the upper Arkansas River valley . It was not explored until Ferdinand Hayden and his team surveyed it in 1873 . At the time it was known as Hunter Pass . 
 Three years later , in 1876 , Colorado became a state . At the time settlement had pushed as far west from its capital , Denver , as Leadville . There was a variety of metals and minerals in the surrounding mountains , and some miners had become rich from their claims there . Those who had not been so successful heard about reports from prospectors of abundant silver deposits further west , over the Divide . 
 Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin had ordered all settlers to stay to the east of the Divide , as the state and federal governments had not made peace with the Utes . Nevertheless , some defied the order , drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes . Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft , an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork . However , they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there , even though this made for a 100 @-@ mile ( 160 km ) journey , 40 miles ( 64 km ) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass . 
 On July 4 , 1879 , a group from Leadville struck gold in the uppermost Roaring Fork valley below the pass . Four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) to the west , they established a settlement in the upper Roaring Fork Valley that eventually took the name Independence from the holiday on which it was established . The pass , the lake from which the Roaring Fork rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well . The Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company , established to build a road through to the camps in the lower Roaring Fork Valley , improved the original path over the pass sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses could be used for the trip . 
 Independence grew quickly when more gold was found in the nearby mountains . Within two years of its settlement permanent buildings had replaced the original tents , and a mining concern from Leadville had bought up all the claims . In two years they produced gold worth $ 190 @,@ 000 ( $ 4 @.@ 66 million in modern dollars ) , funding the construction of a stamping mill and sawmill . In Aspen , further down the valley , silver was found in even greater abundance than Independence 's gold . B. Clark Wheeler , an early investor in those mines , funded the construction of a stage road to Leadville , the first road to cross the pass . It opened in November 1881 , with winter already in full swing at the pass . 
 The road charged 25 cents ( $ 6 in modern dollars ) for saddle horses and twice that for two @-@ axle stagecoaches . The tolls , collected at three separate gates , primarily reflected the cost of retaining a large crew of men with snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime ; they were able to keep the road open through its first five winters . When the snow was too deep , sleighs were used instead . During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full speed , with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic . A typical voyage over the pass required 10 – 25 hours and five changes of horses . 
 The road improved Independence 's economy , since coaches often stopped there on the multi @-@ day journey . However , the year of its construction would turn out to be the settlement 's economic peak year . Gold production dropped off after 1884 . Independence 's decline in population , remote location and severe high @-@ altitude winters cost it the opportunity to be seat of newly formed Pitkin County to Aspen , located on a larger plain further down the river and growing much more rapidly due to the Colorado Silver Boom . When a rail connection was made to that city in 1888 , the stage road fell into disuse , further hurting Independence 's economy . All but one of the remaining residents decamped as a group to Aspen on improvised cross @-@ country skis during the severe winter of 1899 . The holdout , J.R. Williams , remained until 1920 . The nearby Williams Mountains were named for him . 
 By then Aspen 's prosperity had receded as well . Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in response to the Panic of 1893 , which took the largest buyer of the city 's silver out of the market . Aspen began a period of steady decline known today as " the quiet years " as mines gradually closed down . The route over the pass remained useful , however . In 1895 a telephone line was routed over it . 
 Although its population had dropped below a thousand by the late 1920s , in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82 . Unlike the stage road , it was closed during the winter months . While most of the old route was used for the new road , a portion of the original grade remains three miles below the pass on the east side . It includes the foundation of the gatekeeper 's house and the remains of the gate . 
 During the Great Depression , another large public works project involved the pass . The federal Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) oversaw the construction of the Twin Lakes Tunnel , which diverted water from Grizzly Reservoir , on Lincoln Creek , a southern tributary of the Roaring Fork , to Twin Lakes , where it was used for irrigation purposes by beet and watermelon farmers in the Rocky Ford and Ordway areas . Starting in 1935 , 50 @,@ 000 acre @-@ feet ( about 61 @.@ 7 million m ³ ) were made available this way . 
 Another WPA effort recognized the pass as a scenic attraction . A travel guidebook for automobile touring produced by the Federal Writers ' Project gave as one route the trip along Highway 82 from Twin Lakes . It noted the distinctive landscape of the pass : 
 The highway rises in a series of loops and curves towards the Continental Divide . <unk> pines , gnarled and stubby from their fight for existence , give way to bare boulders , hardy grasses and the alpine vegetation of a world above the clouds . The road along the sheer face of the mountain , while steep , is one of the safest traversing a pass in Colorado . 
 A stone monument and several small lakes mark the summit of Independence Pass , the highest and probably the most impressive automobile pass in the state . An arctic meadowland overshadowed only by the topmost notches of the Sawatch Range , it rises far above the peaks that towered high when viewed from the Lake Creek valley . 
 After World War II , Aspen began to grow and prosper again due to the establishment of a popular ski resort , an annual music festival , and a relaxed lifestyle which attracted many celebrities and corporate executives to the city . Visitors to Aspen generally had to take Highway 82 up from Glenwood Springs or fly in , as few wanted to drive over the unpaved pass road . In 1967 the State Highway Department remedied this by paving the road over the pass . It has since been designated part of Colorado 's " Top of the Rockies " scenic byway by the state and federal departments of transportation . 
 = = Environment = = 
 The alpine biome of the pass extends below it on either side to an elevation of approximately 11 @,@ 500 feet ( 3 @,@ 500 m ) , or about the altitude of the <unk> Lake trailhead on the western side , Highway 82 's uppermost crossing of the Roaring Fork . Below it is a subalpine zone where lodgepole pine , Engelmann spruce , subalpine fir and aspen dominate the forest . A few patches of those trees persist above that elevation , but they are mostly stunted krummholz . 
 Tree growth above those patches is curtailed by the alpine climate of the pass . It is characterized by severe changes in temperature , high winds and the deep winter snow . The resulting short growing season is made even shorter by the thin soil . 
 The most predominant plant species in the alpine zone around the pass are the grass species adapted to the harsh climate . Other alpine flora , such as moss and lichens on the rocks , and wildflowers in season , make appearances . Shrubs that survive among them include strawberry , snowberry , willows and bog birch . Animals in the alpine zone include ptarmigans , small burrowing species like pika , marmots , and pocket gopher , and mountain goats . 
 Two types of rock are found in the pass and its vicinity . Quartz monzonite forms many of the cliffs , while the crags are biotite gneiss . The glaciation , which dates to as recently as 12 @,@ 000 years ago , smoothed much of the rock to the point of it being slippery .

To the west more <unk> — the Maroon Bells , Snowmass Mountain and Capitol Peak — stand out among the mountains . A trail with Braille interpretive plaques is available for visually impaired visitors . 
 Other outdoor recreation opportunities exist at and near the pass . Between the pass and Difficult Campground , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Aspen , there are many popular rock climbing areas , some with grades up to 5 @.@ 12 under the Yosemite Decimal System . The Grotto Wall across from Lincoln Gulch campground is a frequent destination . Closer to the pass are Instant Karma Cliff and <unk> 's Dome . A pair of rocks along either side of Highway 82 on the east approach to the pass are popular bouldering spots . 
 On the days after the pass reopens in the spring , backcountry skiers often take advantage of the remaining snow on the slopes . In years following heavy winters , skiing is possible into July . 
 Water @-@ based recreation is available near the pass as well , particularly on the Roaring Fork side . At the <unk> climbing cliffs eight miles ( 14 @.@ 4 km ) to the west of the pass , a short trail leads to an area along the river known as the Devil 's Punchbowl , with high stone cliffs on either side and waterfalls . It is a popular swimming hole due to its deep and cool waters . The river is popular with anglers casting for trout as well , and some even make the hike from the pass up to Blue Lake for its lake and cutthroat trout stocks . 
 Four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) west of the pass is the site of Independence , the village whose establishment on July 4 led to the pass 's current name . It has been a ghost town since the early 20th century . In 1973 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Most of its buildings were cannibalized for their building supplies , but a few log cabins remain . The Aspen Historical Society , in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service , built an interpretive trail with plaques . 
 In 2011 the USA Pro Cycling Challenge bicycle race around Colorado was held for the first time . A 131 @-@ mile ( 211 km ) stage from Gunnison to Aspen was routed over both Cottonwood and Independence passes . Spectators were allowed to camp at the pass ; their impact on the pass 's environment led to a ban on camping within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of it for the following year 's event . The Forest Service posted signs reminding spectators at the pass of the fragility of the surrounding tundra 
 = = Travel advisories and restrictions = = 
 The Colorado Department of Transportation ( CDOT ) restricts the use of Highway 82 through the pass . Most significant is the winter closure . The road is typically closed after the first significant winter snowfall , or by November 7 at the latest . CDOT tries to reopen just before Memorial Day weekend in late May , the traditional beginning of summer in the United States , when enough of the accumulated snowpack has melted to make it possible to clear and repair the road . Some years , after light winters , the pass has reopened as early as May 12 . Two gates , just east of Aspen on the west end and west of the remaining buildings of the stage stop of Everett on the east , prevent motor vehicles from passage . When the road is closed , Aspen is isolated from the east and Highway 82 up the valley from Glenwood Springs becomes the only vehicular access to the city during its busy ski season . 
 Even when the pass is open , not all vehicles may use the road . Oversized and overweight vehicles are prohibited from the pass , as are all vehicles or vehicle combinations longer than 35 feet ( 11 m ) regardless of weight or size . This precludes use of the pass by tractor trailers , buses , and recreational vehicles . 
 Some truck drivers use the pass despite the prohibition . They are generally either unaware of the restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices , or aware of it and willing to risk the fine for the sake of the time and distance saved . The resulting accidents have sometimes forced the closure of the pass . CDOT put up larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction . Aspen officials have suggested increasing the fines as a deterrent . 
 Driving through the pass is challenging . Both approaches require 6 % grades due to the height of the pass , and require navigating hairpin turns with speed limits of 10 mph ( 15 km / h ) . <unk> , particularly on the approach from Aspen , have narrowed some sections to a single lane 12 feet ( 4 m ) wide with temporary traffic lights . On the Twin Lakes approach , they have resulted in temporary closures . Other vehicles frequently enter the road unexpectedly at the many parking areas for campgrounds and other recreational attractions , and bicyclists make frequent use of Highway 82 as well . Lastly , the weather at the pass can be unpredictable and vary considerably from conditions in either Aspen or Twin Lakes . There may be thunderstorms on otherwise clear days , and snow can occur at any time of the year . CDOT advises anyone coming to the pass for outdoor recreation to take precautions against the effects of the high altitude and the changeable weather . 
 = = Independence Pass Foundation = = 
 Since the days of the stage road avalanches and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway , partly due to the massive disturbance of the land during the road 's construction . No attempt was made to remedy this until shortly after the automobile road was built . In the 1930s , as a relief project during the Great Depression , a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps replanted the slopes around Independence , by then abandoned for two decades . 
 At that time , Aspen was a faded mining town whose population had dwindled to fewer than a thousand . Later in the decade the first efforts to develop a ski resort began . They continued after World War II , and in the later decades of the 20th century the city began to grow again . Other than paving the road , CDOT was unable to undertake any significant improvements to the highway corridor due to its projects elsewhere in the state and the requirement to coordinate efforts with the Forest Service , which owns most of the damaged land . 
 Beginning in 1976 , Bob Lewis , an environmental activist in Aspen , organized revegetation efforts on some sections of the pass near the road that were having serious erosion problems . He realized eventually that a dedicated nonprofit organization would be a better way to address the many issues that remained . The Independence Pass Foundation ( IPF ) was established in 1989 . Its first project , coordinated with the Forest Service , CDOT and Pitkin County , was the reconstruction of a curve near the popular Weller Lake trailhead . 
 The success of the Weller Curve project cleared the way for work on the Top Cut , the 1 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) stretch just below the summit on the western side , which includes the most seriously eroded slopes anywhere in the pass corridor . Lewis had always intended to focus the IPF 's efforts on it , and the organization began the first of several ongoing projects there in 1996 . Work included the construction of stone retaining walls as well as revegetation . By the 2010s the results were evident . 
 With the success of these projects , IPF has been doing revegetation projects along the road below the Top Cut since 2004 . <unk> blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients . In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and rebar snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel . They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem , and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions . The last fence material was removed in 2012 . 
 IPF has undertaken other projects to promote awareness of the work that needs to be done at the pass to protect its distinctive environment . Groups from local schools have spent a day up in the pass working and learning . Many have adopted the same sites and work on them with a new class each year . Along with the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies , the foundation also cosponsors a " My Independence " all @-@ day walking tour of the pass for adults that covers ecological topics in depth . 
 Every May since 1994 , just before CDOT reopens the pass , the foundation holds its popular Ride for the Pass , a charity bicycle race that serves as a major outreach event and fundraiser . It follows a 9 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 15 @.@ 3 km ) route from the gate east of Aspen to the Independence townsite , climbing 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 760 m ) in the process . The IPF has canceled it twice due to poor weather . 
 = Planetarian : The Reverie of a Little Planet = 
 Planetarian : The Reverie of a Little Planet ( <unk> ～ <unk> ～ , Planetarian : Chiisana Hoshi no Yume ) is a Japanese post @-@ apocalyptic visual novel developed by Key , a brand of VisualArt 's whose previous works include Kanon and Air . It was released over the Internet on November 29 , 2004 for Windows PCs , and is rated for all ages . The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) and PlayStation Portable , as well as mobile devices . The story centers on a middle @-@ aged man who comes across a malfunctioning robot in a dead city . The man , known simply as " the junker " , stays with this robot for a time and attempts to fix the projector of the planetarium where the story takes place . 
 Key defines Planetarian as a " kinetic novel " , since its gameplay offers no choices or alternate endings . Instead , the player proceeds through the story solely by reading . The story is written by Yūichi Suzumoto and Planetarian is one of two Key games not to have Itaru Hinoue as an artist , using Eeji Komatsu instead . The game 's soundtrack was composed and arranged by Key 's signature composers Magome Togoshi and Shinji Orito . A light novel of short stories set in the world of Planetarian was released in April 2006 , and three audio dramas have also been produced . An original net animation adaptation premiered in July 2016 and an anime film will be released in September 2016 . Planetarian 's story , artwork and music have been praised , and the PS2 version ranked first for console games in terms of satisfaction in 2007 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Planetarian is a post @-@ apocalyptic visual novel in which the player assumes the role of the junker . Unlike traditional visual novels , no choices are given to the player in Planetarian to advance the story , and there is only one possible ending ; this is what Key referred to as a kinetic novel . The player can choose when to advance to the next dialogue screen or put the game on auto play . In this respect , the player does not play the game as if it were a video game , but plays it rather more like one would play a music track on a CD or play a DVD film . During gameplay , the player can choose to hide the text from view and go back to any previous lines . The game can be saved at any point in any of the five save slots available , and a load option is available where the player can load any of the automatically saved chapter markers , or choose to load any of the manually saved games . 
 By length of story , Planetarian is the shortest of Key 's games . Excluding the opening and ending sequences , there are 16 parts to the story ; the first half is set within the planetarium while the latter half is set outside in the ruined city where the planetarium resides . The novel takes four hours and forty minutes to complete on auto play . After the game has been completed at least once , two new options appear on the title screen . The first is a feature that allows the player to view twenty images of CG artwork observed in the game . The second option allows the player to listen to eight of the nine music tracks featured in the game . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 The game is set in a post @-@ apocalyptic world . It is said that due to the depletion of natural resources , overpopulation , and the failure of the Space Exploration Project , humanity has virtually eradicated itself through biological and nuclear warfare , turning a once prosperous civilization into complete ruin , cast in darkness and poisoned by constant rain from nuclear fallout . One military invasion in the past was at Mare Nectaris . The bloodshed continues 30 years after the war in a dystopic world via automated war machines , which kill anyone trespassing into their territory . Of the remaining humans , there are those known as " <unk> " who go around scavenging for anything in order to survive ; the protagonist in the story is one . 
 The main location where most of the story takes place is the fictional <unk> Department Store in a derelict city . It is based on the real <unk> Department Store of Hamamatsu , Shizuoka in Japan , although the planetarium on the rooftop is fictitious . The onset of the story takes place within the planetarium which is where the protagonist first meets Yumemi . The most prominent feature in the room when a show is not taking place is the large black planetarium projector called " Miss Jena " , which is placed on a stage in front of the seats . The planetarium has electricity when the protagonist arrives , but only for a short time . Once a year , for 168 hours , electricity in the planetarium is operational , but the projector is broken . The rest of the floors in the department store are in ruins ; mold and rats run rampant .

 The junker ( <unk> , <unk> ) 
 Voiced by : Daisuke Ono 
 The protagonist is a nameless middle @-@ aged soldier living the life of a " junker " — scavenging useful items among ruined cities to survive . He enters a derelict city searching for undamaged goods and finds an abandoned planetarium on the roof of a building he first thinks is a military facility . There , he meets Yumemi Hoshino , a gynoid designed to look like a young girl who annoys him greatly due to her constant talking . The protagonist has a tough personality that comes from trying to survive in a dystopic world . He carries a grenade launcher with him and covers himself with a waterproof coat to protect his skin from the toxic rain . For drinking water , his canteen has a water purifier that can purify the rain . He is constantly searching for rarer substances such as cigarettes and alcohol which can be sold at high prices . 
 Yumemi Hoshino ( <unk> , Hoshino Yumemi ) 
 Voiced by : Keiko Suzuki 
 Yumemi is a goodhearted but extremely talkative gynoid attendant of an abandoned planetarium ; she is designed to look like a young girl . Yumemi is slightly damaged and completely unaware of the changes that have occurred in the past 30 years , as none of the facilities and databases that she connects to exist anymore . Therefore , she treats the protagonist like a regular guest by calling him " Mr. Customer " ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ sama ) , speaks of the world as it was before the war , and fails to understand any information he tells her , other than things related to her job at the planetarium . The name " Hoshino Yumemi " itself is a pun — " hoshi " means star or planetary body ; " no " is a possessive particle ; " <unk> " is a dream or a reverie ; " mi " means see . Yumemi is the only character shown to the audience of the game . 
 Yumemi is very adamant about protecting humans and is happiest when she is helping those she serves . When she is unable to help someone , she gets terribly worried that she is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing him or her to someone who can . Protecting humans is her top priority and will even ignore previous orders to make sure no human is harmed when in her care . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 While dodging detection from war machines in a ruined city , the protagonist enters a building with a dome on the roof to search for usable supplies . Once inside the dome , he meets Yumemi , who offers to show him a special commemorative projection especially reserved for the <unk> customer , although he is in fact the <unk> customer . Despite his aggravation with her , he agrees to attend her show . However , the projector device , " Miss Jena " , has broken down and is in need of repair . After he repairs it , Yumemi starts the show , presenting a projection of the starry sky , something that cannot be seen from the surface because of the polluted skies . The power goes out in the midst of the show , but Yumemi proceeds through the rest of the event with no visuals at the request of the protagonist . 
 Afterward , both of them leave the planetarium , as Yumemi insists on escorting him back to his vehicle outside the city walls . The protagonist plans to transport Yumemi out of the city after her battery runs out and find a way to reactivate her . A machine the protagonist calls a fiddler crab , due to its design , is guarding the entrance to the city in which he came from , and he devises a plan to destroy it armed with only a grenade launcher . After his initial plan fails and he is forced to face the machine front on , Yumemi tries to protect the protagonist , but is blown in half by the war machine 's machine guns . 
 Yumemi spends her emergency battery life replaying her pre @-@ war memories to the protagonist using a tiny holographic projector on her ear . When the video fades , she reveals that she had known that the planetarium would never have more customers during the 30 years she was alone , despite her apparent infinite optimism up to this point . In her final moment as she " dies " in front of him , Yumemi ejects the memory card from her artificial brain for his safekeeping . Touched and completely shaken by the loss of the beautiful world she left in his mind , he throws away his gun and puts the memory card in his coat , before wandering off with a broken leg as the fallen war machine 's automated backup units are closing in on the scene . 
 = = Development = = 
 Planetarian is Key 's fourth visual novel , and had a small staff of three main people that did the majority of the work for the game 's first release . Unlike previous Key titles , Planetarian 's art director position was given to Eeji Komatsu instead of Itaru Hinoue who had held the position for the three previous games . Komatsu was chosen not only because of his specialty in depicting mechanics and robots , but also because he could represent short scenes which touch on a robot 's existence to reproduce a person 's ideals . Furthermore , Key was not short on staff at the time , and was not forced to outsource the artwork of Planetarian . Jun Maeda , Key 's main scenario writer and project planner , was left out of the project , and Yūichi Suzumoto was given the position of planning and scenario . The music , excluding a single piece composed by Shinji Orito , was arranged or composed entirely by Magome Togoshi , one of Key 's signature composers . Planetarian was the first game under the brand name <unk> to be described by the term " kinetic novel " . 
 In the original version , Yumemi is only voiced during the beginning and ending scenes , while other characters are not voiced . When Planetarian was released for Windows PCs on CD @-@ ROM , Yumemi had full voice acting . The PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) port offers full voice acting for the entire cast . Other changes to the PS2 version include a higher resolution for the computer graphics and an extended soundtrack . All other later versions contained full voice acting .

 = Town of Christchurch by @-@ election , 1860 = 
 The Town of Christchurch by @-@ election in 1860 was triggered by the resignation of Richard Packer as the Member of the House of Representatives for the Town of Christchurch electorate , and occurred during the term of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament . The previous representative of the electorate , the politician Henry Sewell , had returned after three years in England and the general expectation was that Sewell would be the sole contender for election . The Lyttelton Times wrote several provocative editorials , generally endorsing Sewell for his obvious ability , but criticising him for not publicly talking about his policies and plans . Sewell eventually arranged a public meeting the evening prior to nomination day ; this was the only public meeting during the election campaign . After a lengthy address , which was favourably received by the Lyttelton Times , a second contender for the office put his name forward at that meeting : the publican Michael Hart . Sewell , one of New Zealand 's most senior politicians at the time , was successful against the political novice Hart . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Candidates = = = 
 Henry Sewell had first come to New Zealand as the deputy chairman ( a paid position ) of the Canterbury Association in February 1853 . The Association was in financial crisis and Sewell was instrumental in resolving the debt issues for Canterbury Province . In August 1853 Sewell stood in New Zealand 's first general election , winning the Town of Christchurch electorate , which he represented in the 1st New Zealand Parliament . Sewell was re @-@ elected in the 1855 election and also elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council for the Lyttelton electorate in 1855 . In May 1856 , he became New Zealand 's first Premier . He resigned from Parliament later in 1856 but remained an unofficial member of Parliament 's executive and returned to England on ministerial duties . Sewell returned to New Zealand in early 1859 and again took up a previous role as Colonial Treasurer . By all accounts , Sewell was a senior politician . 
 Michael Hart arrived in Lyttelton with his wife and their two sons on the Cressy on 27 December 1850 , one of the First Four Ships reaching Canterbury . Before he came out to New Zealand , he had been a plumber . Hart founded the White Hart on the corner of High and Cashel Streets , the first hotel in Christchurch . The hotel opened on 15 November 1851 , less than a year after the organised settlement of Christchurch . In December 1852 , Hart catered for 150 guests who had assembled to farewell John Robert Godley , the founder of Canterbury who returned to England after his short stay in the colony . A well @-@ known man , Hart had no political experience ; he was never elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council .

 After Sewell 's resignation from Parliament in 1856 , Richard Packer won the resulting 1856 by @-@ election . Packer resigned from Parliament on 28 December 1859 , triggering the 1860 by @-@ election . The resignation was announced to the public via a statement in the Canterbury Standard , a newspaper published by Joseph Brittan . This was accompanied by a brief statement by Sewell , offering himself for election again . Hart accused Packer of having been a locum tenens ( i.e. a place holder ) for Sewell . 
 In an editorial , the Lyttelton Times welcomed Sewell 's intention of representing the electorate again , but criticised him for the briefness of his statement . The newspaper 's expectation was that Sewell should publicly state what his policies were , and not just rely on his past representation in Parliament . On 7 January 1860 , Sewell placed an advertisement in the Lyttelton Times , inviting electors to a meeting at the Mechanics ' Institute next to the Christchurch Town Hall on Friday , 13 January . 
 In an editorial on 11 January , the Lyttelton Times implied that Sewell 's election was a foregone conclusion ; no other candidates having come forward , so Sewell would simply be declared elected on nomination night . The editorial urged Sewell to address the issue of improved education when he again represented Christchurch in Parliament . On 14 January , the Lyttelton Times repeated and increased its criticism of Sewell 's policies and plans being unknown to the public , and it talked of the option of rejecting Sewell . An editorial said of Sewell : " a thick impenetrable haze has hitherto enveloped his relations with the public . " In 1860 , the Lyttelton Times was still based in Lyttelton ( the newspaper only moved to Christchurch in 1863 ) and was a bi @-@ weekly . When it went to print after the meeting in the Town Hall the previous night , the editorial expressed disappointment that they could not report on the meeting called by Sewell . 
 This ongoing criticism caused Sewell to provide his own report to the Lyttelton Times of the meeting with electors . The editor compared this report with the one supplied by their own reporter and , containing no substantial differences , decided to print Sewell 's account in the next edition on 18 January . The editorial defended the newspaper 's critical stance : " We disclaim all hostile feelings against Mr. Sewell ... we have not decided to thwart but to understand him . " The editor welcomed Sewell 's detailed address and expressed general satisfaction with Sewell 's statements . By finally addressing the electors , Sewell " removed the only objection urged against him . " 
 The meeting on 17 January was crowded . Many attendees were not electors , as franchise was attached to land ownership in excess of £ 50 , or yearly rental over £ 10 , and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long , including absentee owners in England . There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose Sewell . William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting . Sewell spoke at length about various issues : that he should be elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis , that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues , that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand 's postal service with England , that he did not have land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury , that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year . He disagreed with Stafford 's government on some issues . The two most important disagreements were land policy , where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments , rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north , and native policy , where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori ; in fact , the First Taranaki War started in March 1860 . As a solution , Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries ; this was the first time , as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware , that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician . The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel , and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862 . The Lyttelton Times argued , against the objection of many , that such an idea had merit for further consideration . 
 After Sewell had spoken , Michael Hart briefly addressed those present . He announced himself as a candidate and vouched his support for the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project . 
 = = Nomination = = 
 The nomination meeting was held on 18 January at the Town Hall . The returning officer , John Hall , read the writ . Richard Packer proposed Sewell as a candidate , and William Wilson seconded this . Hart was proposed by Mr Sutcliffe and seconded by Mr Rees . Both Sewell and Hart then spoke . Sewell stressed the importance of electing the right person , with reference to his experience and Hart being an unknown quantity . Hart argued that it was his right to put himself forward . Whilst Hart could not say that he received his qualifications from Oxford or Cambridge , he had obtained his " knowledge from the university of common sense " . He further argued that he was as able as Packer , whom he regarded as a locum tenens for Sewell . He criticised Sewell for not residing in Christchurch . 
 The returning officer , John Hall , after no other candidate came forward , asked for a show of hands and declared it to be in favour of Sewell , upon which Hart demanded a poll . Hall declared that the poll be held at the Town Hall the following day ( 19 January ) , from 9 am to 4 pm .

 110 votes were cast in the election . At the time , voting was done by the elector telling the election official his choice of candidate ( the secret ballot was introduced in 1871 ) and as a tally was being kept by interested parties , the result was immediately known . Sewell won the election by 77 votes to 33 . 
 Sewell served until the end of the term in November 1860 . At the end of the session , he was dissatisfied with the actions of his former fellow Government ministers and did not seek re @-@ election . Instead , he was appointed Registrar @-@ General of Lands by Edward Stafford . In August 1861 , he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council so that he could become part of the 2nd Fox Ministry as Attorney @-@ General .

 Chew Magna is a village and civil parish within the Chew Valley in the Unitary Authority of Bath and North East Somerset , in the Ceremonial county of Somerset , England . The parish has a population of 1 @,@ 149 . 
 To the south of the village is Chew Valley Lake . The village is on the B3130 road , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Bristol , 15 miles ( 24 km ) from Bath , 13 miles ( 21 km ) from the city of Wells , and 6 miles ( 10 km ) from Bristol Airport . 
 The village is close to the northern edge of the Mendip Hills ( a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ) , and was designated a conservation area in 1978 . There are many listed buildings reflecting the history of the village . The River Chew flows through the village . Just outside the village is Chew Magna Reservoir : this small Bristol Water supply reservoir intercepts the Winford Brook . 
 The village has approximately 1 @,@ 200 residents . There is one primary school , and an adjacent secondary school , several shops and small businesses , three churches , and three pubs serving the area . There is also a football pitch and children 's play area . The village frequently wins regional categories in the Calor Village of the Year competition , and is currently moving towards zero waste status , having been described as " probably the greenest parish in Britain " . 
 = = History = = 
 Chew Magna has long been the largest village in the district , and can trace its importance back to Saxon times . It was a thriving woollen centre in the Middle Ages - in 1086 for example having 108 households rendering £ 46 per year , most of its land being cultivated and having five mills , 29 cattle , 36 pigs , 448 sheep and 46 goats . It acquired market town and non @-@ represented borough status . The picture was not entirely benign as 22 of these households were serfs . 
 The manor of Chew was held by the Bishops of Bath and Wells from 1062 to 1548 , and therefore was called Chew Episcopi or Bishop 's Chew . The bishops built a palace near the church of St Andrews , which was visited by Henry III in 1250 . Chew Court is a surviving part of the palace and has its adjacent well head also listed for its long heritage . 
 According to Robinson its manors , lay and religious holdings formed an episcopal property held , as overlord , by <unk> , the last Saxon bishop and the name Magna comes from the Latin meaning ' the greater ' . This is supported by the Domesday Book which was made to specify the 1086 and the pre @-@ conquest holder , in both instances given as the " Bishop of Wells " . Hence its benefice was from the early medieval period converted from a rectory to a vicarage , with substantial <unk> adjoining named Bishop Sutton , Knowle with Knighton Sutton , North Elm , and Stone . Furthermore , it had the living of Dundry annexed to it . By 1848 all tithes had been commuted and the sole <unk> is listed in 1848 of the great tithes as George Smyth . 
 The parish was part of the hundred of Chew . 
 In the eastern corner of the south aisle of the church is a monument of the Baber family , who formerly had large possessions in the parish . Inserted in a window of the aisle , is a wooden effigy , supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville , a Knight of Henry III 's , who owned the northeastern estate named Norton Hautville , now Norton <unk> : in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach ( e ) y family who lived at Sutton Court . 
 = = = After the Dissolution of the Monasteries = = = 
 Since about 1600 , the name changed to Chew Magna as this has been the most important of the several villages along the banks of the River Chew and reflecting the reduced wealth of the established church from the Dissolution of the Monasteries onwards . 
 Around 1700 the Lord of the Manor was Sir William Jones , the Attorney General of England and in the 1820s it was the seat of Lord Lyttelton . Until about 1880 the village had toll roads and a toll house to collect the fees . 
 By 1848 the population was partly employed in coal mines in Bishop Sutton , and in the manufacture of stockings and of edge tools to a limited extent ; formerly there was a considerable factory for cloth . 
 During the late 19th and 20th centuries the importance of the wool trade in the village declined and it became largely a dormitory area for the cities of Bristol and Bath , although it has continued to be the commercial centre of the valley .

 During German bombing raids targeted on Bristol , many bombs fell in the parish : <unk> House on the road to Chew Hill was bombed . The nearly flat area just east of the Y @-@ junction on Chew Hill was initially chosen as a Starfish site area to be lit by fires to simulate Bristol in flames . Later , about half way between North Chew Farm and Manor Farm , North Wick was an area secured by Royal Air Force personnel , lit by fires , and with " automatic " guns to simulate anti @-@ aircraft guns . There was also a genuine heavy anti aircraft battery at <unk> farm . The area was guarded by pill boxes of which one remains on the west side of Blacklands ( map reference <unk> ) .

 St Andrew 's Church dates from the 12th century with a large 15th century pinnacled sandstone tower , a Norman font and a rood screen that is the full width of the church . In the church are several memorials to the <unk> of Sutton Court together with a wooden effigy of a Knight cross @-@ legged and leaning on one elbow , in 15th century armour , thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant , and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished . Another effigy in the north chapel is of Sir John St Loe , who was over 7 feet ( 2 m ) tall , and his lady . The armoured figure is 7 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 24 m ) long and his feet rest on a lion , while those of his lady rest on a dog . The church was restored in 1860 and has a register commencing in 1562 . The tower is about one hundred feet tall and was probably built about 1440 . There has been a clock on the tower since the early 1700s . There is a peal of eight bells in the tower . Tenor 28 cwt ( 3 @,@ 136 lb / 1 @,@ 422 kg ) in C. The original five bells were re @-@ cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six , and in 1898 four of these were re @-@ cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria . Two additional bells , the gift of Brigadier Ommanney , were added in 1928 to complete the octave , which still contains two of the Bilbie bells . The present clock , installed in 1903 , plays a verse of a hymn every four hours , at 8 am , noon , 4 and 8 pm , with a different hymn tune for every day of the week . The church is a Grade I listed building . 
 The churchyard contains several monuments which are Grade II listed buildings in their own right : the churchyard cross , Edgell monument , Fowler monument and a group of three unidentified monuments . In addition there is an early 19th @-@ century limestone round @-@ topped stone which bears the inscription to William Fowler " shot by an Highwayman on Dundry Hill 14 June 1814 aged 32 years " . Within the church are wooden plaques commemorating the nineteen people from the village who died in World War I and seven from World War II , and a bronze plaque to an individual soldier who died in 1917 .

 Next to the church is the Church House , which is also known as the Old School Room . The upstairs room was the local school from the mid or early 15th century , with the village poorhouse below . This has been a venue for social activity in the village and in 1971 underwent major renovation . It is a Grade II * listed building . Also close to the church is Chew Court , which was originally a bishop 's palace . It was largely rebuilt in 1656 , from which a little survives as the Chew Court of today including an Elizabethan doorway with Doric pilasters . The room over the gatehouse is said to have been used as a court @-@ room , with the turrets used for holding prisoners . Chew Court is a Grade II * listed building . 
 The Manor House has Tudor origins , including a fireplace dated 1656 , with a Gothic exterior from 1874 , largely redesigned by John Norton . Amongst the brought @-@ in pieces in the house are two South German reliefs , " The <unk> of St Catherine and St Sebastian " , from an altar of the early 16th century . There are also a series of panels in the Floris style , probably Flemish and with a repeating date 1562 . From 1680 to 1844 the Manor House was the home of prominent Quaker families including the <unk> , the Summers and the <unk> . William Penn preached here in 1687 . The house has 4 @.@ 9 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m2 ) of gardens laid out in the 19th century . The house is a Grade II * listed building and now forms part of the Sacred Heart Convent School . Two of the stables attached to the Manor House are Grade II listed . 
 The high street contains many old buildings . The Beeches was built in 1762 , with walls , railings , gates and piers of the same date , although the side wings were added later . Acacia House and <unk> House , which was formerly known as Myrtle House , are from the same period , while Barle House , Holly House , The Sycamores and Portugal House are slightly more recent . 
 On Battle Lane is the 18th century <unk> House , which was formerly the end house in a row of seven , and The Rookery and its lodge , which were built in the early 19th century . Harford Square is dominated by the construction , in 1817 , of Harford House and its accompanying stable block . 
 Just south of the village is the medieval Tun Bridge with three pointed arches including double arch rings , spanning 60 feet ( 18 m ) over the river , approached along one of the high pavements that are a feature of the village centre . It has three pointed arches , two of which have double arch rings built in two orders . At its widest point it is 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) wide and 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) in the centre . The two main arches are separated by a sharp <unk> 3 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) and tapering to 8 inches ( 20 @.@ 3 cm ) above which a 4 inches ( 10 @.@ 2 cm ) string course runs throughout the length of bridge . The bridge is thought to date from the late 15th century and is a Grade II listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument ( Avon No. 159 ) . The raised pavement and steps are themselves also listed Grade II . 
 Surrounding the village are several historic farmhouses including <unk> 's Farmhouse , which dates from the 15th century , and Knole Hill Farmhouse , dated 1763 . 
 = Tony Marchant ( cyclist ) = 
 Tony Marchant , also known as " Tippy " Marchant ( born 28 August 1937 ) is a former Australian track cyclist who along with Ian Browne won the 2000 m tandem event at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne . Marchant had little formal training and only took up the sport at the age of 16 because his friends liked the sport . In 1955 , Marchant shot to prominence after only two years in the sport , winning the 500 m time trial and the 5 mile event at the Junior Australian Championships . This resulted him being approached by Browne to team up in early 1956 and they promptly won the tandem event at the national championships to earn national selection . The pair were eliminated after losing their first two races but were given a reprieve when the Soviet Union pair were hospitalised in a crash and forced to withdraw . Thereafter Marchant and Browne were unbeaten and progressed to an unlikely Olympic gold . In 1957 , Marchant retired to play Australian rules football , again basing his decision on his friends ' interests . In 1958 he made a brief comeback as a professional , but with only sporadic success , he retired in 1961 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Marchant was born in Chelsea , Victoria , where he grew up . His father was a member of the Royal Australian Navy , who later became a bank manager . His father died when Marchant was young . This left his mother , a nurse , to raise Marchant and his four sisters and three brothers . Unlike his siblings , Marchant was interested in sport from a young age . He particularly took a liking to boxing , and won the school boxing championship at St Bede 's Christian Brothers College . In his teenage years , he fought about 25 bouts with the Chelsea Youth Club . 
 Influenced by three of his friends , Marchant took up cycling in 1953 at the age of 16 . He earned some money from selling flowers and delivering newspapers and bought a semi @-@ racing bike . Later , he was a given a proper racing bike from his first trainer Merv Norton . 
 Marchant began at the Chelsea Amateur Cycling Club , which did not even have a banked cycling track and was trained by Norton and <unk> Cramer . Marchant rose to prominence by winning the 500 metres ( m ) time trial at the 1955 Victorian Championships for juniors in only his second year of competition . He then won the 5 mile title and the 500 m time trial at the Australian Junior Championships . He added a silver medal in the sprint . 
 Marchant first teamed up with Ian Browne at the start of 1956 , just ten months before the start of the Melbourne Olympics . The older Browne selected Marchant because of the pure speed that Marchant had exhibited in the past year . They were a contrasting pair . Marchant was a short man of 170 cm ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) and 65 kg ( 143 lb ) , while Browne stood at 186 cm ( 6 @.@ 10 ft ) and 86 kg ( 190 lb ) , unusually tall for a cyclist . For a final test run before the pair formally committed to racing together , the pair simply had a few tandem sprints around the track . Browne sat in the front seat , while Marchant sat in the rear seat . The pair went on to win the 2000 m tandem event at the Australian Championships in 1956 , but going into the Melbourne Olympics , nobody , themselves included , regarded them as realistic medal chances . However , their mentor , former champion Billy Guyatt convinced them that they had the potential to make progress at international level . 
 Their training schedule consisted of individual training two or three times a week and two days a week of coordinated tandem training during the Olympic year . Marchant 's main tactical responsibility was to look to the outside for impending attacks while Browne patrolled the inside . Marchant devised a signal system , such as a head bump on Browne 's hip , or even a verbal shout when the opposition made a move . 
 = = Olympics = = 
 Ten nations were entered in the tandem competition , and in the first round , they were drawn with Germany and South Africa , who fielded their silver medallist pairing of Tom <unk> and Ray Robinson from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . The Australians made their move too early and led at the ringing of the bell at the start of the last lap , but they were overhauled well before the line as they faded in the final straight . Browne and Marchant were given another chance in the repechage round later in the same day . The Australians lead for three quarters of the distance , but were overhauled by their Czechoslovakian opponent in the final metres and were defeated in a photo finish . This would normally have meant that the Australians would have been eliminated , however the final repechage between the Soviet Union and the Germans resulted in a tangle , resulting in a heavy pile @-@ up . Neither teams finished the race , but the Soviets were hospitalised . The cycling officials decided that the bruised Germans would be forced to compete in a repechage sequel against the losers in the previous repechages to qualify . This allowed the United States and the Australians a reprieve . 
 The Australians seized their good fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11 @.@ 0 seconds ( s ) . Having been beaten twice after leading out , the Australians sat back before sweeping past the Germans and Americans in the final lap . Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter @-@ final , who had defeated them easily in the heats . This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200 m , clocking 10 @.@ 8 s to progress to the final , where they faced the Italy . Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello appeared to be in control at the start of the final lap . They had moved alongside the Australians with one and a half laps to go , but the Australians surprised them at the start of the final lap . The Italians came back to pull level at the start of the back straight , but the Australians held them off and pulled away to win by a length and a half . The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed . The Australians finished in a time of 10 @.@ 8 s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal . 
 The final took place on the third day of racing . The Australians came to the conclusion that their wheels and tyres were too heavy , so they sought to buy better cycling equipment from the defeated Germans . The Germans agreed , saying " Have ours and you will win the gold medal . " Australia were again pitted against the Czechoslovak Vaclav Machek and Ladislav <unk> . One of the reasons behind Australia 's return to form had been the return of Guyatt to a mentoring role . Guyatt had assisted them at the national championships , but they were assigned to another coach at the Olympics . Guyatt was regarded as a marketing @-@ style motivator and he attempted to give Browne and Marchant a psychological boost . Equipped with their new machines , Browne and Marchant employed a tactical trick devised by Guyatt . The Australian staff had noticed that the Czechoslovaks had always made their final burst from a certain point from the finish . During the final , Australian team manager Bill Young stood at the said point as the Australian led out . When Browne came to the point , he pulled upwards and pre @-@ emptively blocked the expected Czechoslovakian attack . As the Australians veered out to cut off the opposition attack , the two pairs made hip contact . This helped to stifle the attack and Australia went on to win the gold medal . Upon returning to his home town , he was mobbed by thousands of schoolchildren who had come to welcome him , and he was given a civic reception . 
 = = Later years = = 
 The following year in 1957 , Marchant unexpectedly left the sport , much to the dismay of the cycling community , which believed that he would continue to more success . He switched to playing Australian rules football because that was what his friends did . He felt that fitting in with his friends was more important , saying " I was a funny bloke . I did a lot on brilliance rather than hard work . I preferred to do what my mates were doing . " 
 After a year away from the bike , Marchant returned to cycling and turned professional in 1958 . Within a year he left for Europe with Ron Murray and Alan McLellan on the professional racing circuit . The trip was unsuccessful . The group did not take their track bikes with them , with Marchant ordering one from Italy . The equipment never arrived and he competed in Belgium and Copenhagen on borrowed bikes . Marchant only displayed glimpses of his ability , defeating the Italian champion in one outing and also winning the La Trobe race in Tasmania . Marchant then retired in 1961 . 
 During his cycling career , Marchant had worked as an apprentice shoe cutter . After his retirement , he continued along the same line of work , spending his entire working career in the shoe industry , designing and marketing women 's fashion shoes under the brand Imps and Cadets . He married in 1962 and has two children .

It was played at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington on September 30 , 2013 . The Rays defeated the Rangers , 5 – 2 , and advanced to the AL Wild Card Game against the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field , which they won 4 – 0 ; the Rangers failed to qualify for the postseason . 
 The tie @-@ breaker game was necessary after both teams finished the season with win – loss records of 91 – 71 and thus tied for the second Wild Card position in the AL . The Rangers were awarded home field for the game , as they won the regular season series against the Rays , four @-@ games @-@ to @-@ three . The game was televised on TBS . It was the fourth tie @-@ breaker in MLB history for a Wild Card spot , although it was the first since MLB adopted its current format of two Wild Card teams playing in a Wild Card Game in 2012 .

 = = Background = = 
 In Major League Baseball the two teams with the best record in each league who do not win a division play in the Wild Card Game . A number of teams were in competition for these Wild Card spots , along with their divisional competition . The Rangers spent over 80 days leading the American League West and shared the lead as late as September 4 . The Rays spent only a few days leading the American League East , but held a share of the lead as late as August 24 . The Cleveland Indians did not lead the American League Central after July 2 but remained close throughout the season and ultimately finished just a single game back of the Central champion Detroit Tigers . 
 Although other teams including the Kansas City Royals , Baltimore Orioles , and New York Yankees had vied for a Wild Card spot , the Indians , Rangers , and Rays all remained in contention until the end of the season . Entering the final day of the scheduled regular season , on which all three teams played , the Indians had a 91 – 70 record while both the Rangers and Rays had 90 – 71 records . These were the best non @-@ division @-@ leading records in the American League . Thus , the possibility existed ( had the Indians lost and the Rays and Rangers won ) for a three @-@ way tie for the two Wild Card spots , which would have required several tie @-@ breaker games to settle . However , all three teams won , leaving the Indians definitively in the Wild Card Game at 92 – 70 and the Rays and Rangers tied at 91 – 71 for the second spot . 
 The Indians finished the season strong , winning their last 10 games to clinch their Wild Card berth . The Rays were 16 – 12 in September , winning 8 of their last 10 . The Rangers were just 12 – 15 in September , although they also won eight of their final 10 games . Home field advantage for the tie @-@ breaker game was awarded to the Rangers , as they had won the season series against the Rays 4 games to 3 .

The Rays scored again in the sixth , as Longoria doubled to lead off the inning , and advanced to third base on a groundout by Young . The next batter , David <unk> , hit a double to right field that scored Longoria and put the Rays ahead , 4 – 1 . Rangers reliever Alexi Ogando entered the game with one out and recorded the final two outs to end the inning . 
 After a single and a stolen base from Andrus , Ríos doubled in the bottom half of the sixth to cut the score to 4 – 2 . A small controversy arose in the top of the seventh inning . Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive to center field . Replays showed that the ball bounced into <unk> Martín 's ( the Rangers ' center fielder ) glove after hitting the ground , making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit . However , the umpires ruled the play an out , ending the inning without a run scoring . Ultimately , the issue did not affect the outcome . The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers , extending their lead to 5 – 2 . Price closed the game in the ninth , recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game .

 David Price recorded the first complete game in a tie @-@ breaker game since Al Leiter in 1999 . The game counted as a regular season game in baseball statistics . For example , Evan Longoria 's third @-@ inning home run broke Stan Musial 's record for the most home runs in the last game of the season , setting the mark at seven . He went 3 @-@ for @-@ 4 with a double , a home run , and two RBI in the game overall . This left him 11 @-@ for @-@ 19 with seven home runs and ten RBIs in season finales from 2009 – 2013 .

The Rays played the Cleveland Indians in the American League Wild Card Game and advanced to the American League Division Series ( ALDS ) with a 4 @-@ 0 win . However , the Rays lost to the Boston Red Sox in the ALDS , 3 games to 1 . 
 = Graham Chapman = 
 Graham Arthur Chapman ( 8 January 1941 – 4 October 1989 ) was an English comedian , writer , actor , and one of the six members of the surreal comedy group Monty Python . He played authority figures such as the Colonel and the lead role in two Python films , Holy Grail and Life of Brian . 
 Chapman was born in Leicester and was raised in Melton Mowbray . He enjoyed science , acting and comedy , and after graduating from Emmanuel College , Cambridge and St Bartholomew 's Medical College , he turned down a career as a doctor to be a comedian . Chapman established a writing partnership with John Cleese , which reached its critical peak with Monty Python during the 1970s . Chapman left Britain for Los Angeles in the late 1970s , where he attempted to be a success on American television , speaking on the college circuit and producing the pirate film Yellowbeard , before returning to Britain in the early 1980s . 
 Chapman was openly homosexual and a strong supporter of gay rights , and was in a relationship with David Sherlock for most of his adult life . He was an alcoholic during his time at Cambridge and the early Python years , quitting shortly before working on Life of Brian . Chapman died of tonsil and spinal cancer on 4 October 1989 , on the eve of Monty Python 's 20th anniversary , and his life and legacy were commemorated at a private memorial service at St Bartholomew 's with the other Pythons . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Graham Arthur Chapman was born on 8 January 1941 at the Stoneygate Nursing Home , Stoneygate , Leicester , the son of policeman Walter Chapman and Edith Towers . He had an elder brother , John , who was born in 1936 . One of Chapman 's earliest memories was seeing the remains of Polish airmen who had suffered an aeroplane accident near Leicester , later saying the horrific sights of this remained in his memory . 
 Chapman was educated at Melton Mowbray Grammar School . He showed a strong affinity for science , sports and amateur dramatics , and was singled out for attention when a local paper reviewed his performance of Mark Antony in Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar . Graham and John Chapman were both avid fans of radio comedy , being especially fond of The Goon Show and Robert Moreton 's skill of telling jokes the wrong way round and reversing punchlines . Biographer Jim Yoakum said " the radio shows didn 't necessarily make him laugh . " 
 In 1959 , Chapman began to study medicine at Emmanuel College , Cambridge . He joined the Cambridge Footlights , where he first began writing with John Cleese . Following graduation , Chapman joined the Footlights show " Cambridge Circus " and toured New Zealand , deferring his medical studies for a year . After the tour , he continued his studies at St Bartholomew 's Medical College , but became torn between whether to pursue a career in medicine or acting . His brother John later said , " He wasn 't ever driven to go into medicine ... it wasn 't his life 's ambition . "

 = = = Pre @-@ Python career = = = 
 Following their Footlights success , Chapman and Cleese began to write professionally for the BBC , initially for David Frost but also for Marty Feldman . Frost had recruited Cleese , and in turn Cleese decided he needed Chapman as a sounding board . Chapman also contributed sketches to the radio series I 'm Sorry , I 'll Read That Again and wrote material on his own and with Bill Oddie . He wrote for The Illustrated Weekly Hudd ( starring Roy Hudd ) , Cilla Black , This is Petula Clark , and This Is Tom Jones . Chapman , Cleese , and Tim Brooke @-@ Taylor later joined Feldman in the television comedy series At Last the 1948 Show . It was Chapman 's first significant role as a performer as well as a writer and he displayed a gift for deadpan comedy ( such as in the sketch " The Minister Who Falls to Pieces " ) and imitating various British dialects . The series was the first to feature Chapman 's sketch of wrestling with himself . 
 Despite the show 's success , Chapman was still unsure about abandoning his medical career . In between the two series of At Last the 1948 Show he completed his studies at St Bartholomew 's , and became professionally registered as a doctor . Chapman and Cleese also wrote for the long @-@ running television comedy series Doctor in the House , and both appeared on a one @-@ off television special , How to <unk> People alongside Brooke @-@ Taylor and Michael Palin . One of Cleese and Chapman 's sketches , featuring a used car salesman refusing to believe a customer 's model had broken down , became the inspiration for the Dead Parrot sketch . Chapman also co @-@ wrote several episodes of Doctor in the House 's follow up , Doctor in Charge , with Bernard McKenna .

 In 1969 , Chapman and Cleese joined the other Pythons including Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones , and Palin for their sketch comedy show Flying Circus . The group 's writing was split into well @-@ defined teams , with Chapman collaborating almost exclusively with Cleese . Chapman was particularly keen to remove stereotypical punchlines in sketches and created The Colonel , who would stop them in mid @-@ flow by saying they were " too silly " . 
 Although the pair were officially equal partners , Cleese later thought that Chapman contributed comparatively little in the way of direct writing , saying " he would come in , say something marvellous and then drift off in his own mind . " The other Pythons have said that Chapman 's biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition for what was funny . Gilliam later recalled that " Graham would do the nudge that would push it into something extraordinary . " The show was an immediate success , and Chapman was delighted to learn that medical students at St Bartholomew 's crowded round the television in the bar to watch it . Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording , leading to the other Pythons calling him " the late Graham Chapman " . 
 Chapman 's main contribution to the Dead Parrot sketch , derived from the How to <unk> People piece and involving a customer returning a faulty toaster , was " How can we make this madder ? " He decided to replace the toaster with a dead Norwegian Blue parrot . Cleese said that he and Chapman believed that " there was something very funny there , if we could find the right context for it " . The group felt that Chapman had the best acting skills in the group . Cleese complimented Chapman by saying that he was " particularly a wonderful actor " . 
 Chapman played the lead role in two Python films , Holy Grail and Life of Brian . He was chosen to play the lead in Holy Grail because of the group 's respect towards his straight acting skills , and because the other members wanted to play lesser , funnier , characters themselves . Chapman did not mind being filmed fully nude in front of a crowd in Life of Brian , but the scene , filmed in Tunisia , caused problems with the female Muslim extras . 
 = = = Other work = = = 
 Chapman and Douglas Adams wrote a pilot for a TV series in 1975 , Out of the Trees , but it received poor ratings after being broadcast at the same time as Match of the Day and only this initial episode was produced . In 1978 , Chapman co @-@ wrote the comedy film The Odd Job with McKenna , and starred as one of the main characters . Chapman wanted his friend Keith Moon to play a co @-@ lead role alongside him , but Moon could not pass an acting test , so the part went to David Jason who had previously appeared on Do Not <unk> Your Set with Pythons Idle , Jones , and Palin . The film was moderately successful . 
 During the 1970s , Chapman became increasingly concerned about the Python 's income and finances . He moved to Los Angeles in the late 1970s to avoid British income tax . He guest @-@ starred on several television series including The Big Show . 
 In 1976 , Chapman began writing a pirate film , Yellowbeard , which came out of conversations between Chapman and Moon while in Los Angeles . Moon had always wanted to play Long John Silver , so Chapman began to write a script for him . Moon died in 1978 and the work stalled , eventually being rewritten by McKenna , then by Peter Cook . The film , which starred Chapman as the eponymous pirate , also featured appearances from Cook , Marty Feldman , Cleese , Idle , Spike Milligan , and Cheech & Chong . It marks the last appearance of Feldman , who suffered a fatal heart attack in December 1982 . The project was fraught with financial difficulties , and at times there was not enough money to pay the crew . It was released in 1983 to mixed reviews . David Robinson , reviewing the film in The Times said " the Monty Python style of comic anarchy requires more than scatology , rude words and funny faces . " 
 Chapman published his memoirs , A Liar 's Autobiography , in 1980 , choosing the title because he said " it 's almost impossible to tell the truth " . He returned to Britain permanently after Yellowbeard was released . He became involved with the extreme sports club Dangerous Sports Club , which popularised bungee jumping . Chapman was scheduled to perform a bungee jump himself , but it was cancelled due to safety concerns . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 After reuniting with the other Pythons in The Meaning of Life , Chapman began a lengthy series of U.S. college tours , talking about the Pythons , the Dangerous Sports Club and Moon , among other subjects . Saturday Night Live creator and Python fan Lorne Michaels persuaded Chapman to star in The New Show . 
 In 1988 , Chapman appeared in the Iron Maiden video " Can I Play with Madness " . He starred in a pilot of a proposed television series Jake 's Journey , but financial problems prevented a full series from being made . Chapman was intended to be cast in the Red Dwarf episode " Timeslides " , but died before filming started . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Chapman first met his long term partner , David Sherlock in Ibiza in 1966 . He later described realising he was homosexual as " an important moment in my life " . He told close friends about his relationship , including Cleese and Feldman the following year . Chapman and Sherlock moved to Belsize Park in 1968 , and the pair enjoyed visiting gay clubs in Central London . 
 Chapman first disclosed his homosexuality in public on British jazz musician George Melly 's television show , becoming one of the first celebrities to do so . He was a vocal spokesman for gay rights , supporting the Gay Liberation Front . In 1971 , Chapman and Sherlock adopted John Tomiczek as their son . Chapman met Tomiczek when the adolescent was a run @-@ away from Liverpool aged 14 . After discussions with Tomiczek 's father , it was agreed that Chapman would become Tomiczek 's legal guardian . Tomiczek later became Chapman 's business manager and died of a heart attack in 1992 . In 1972 , Chapman supported the newspaper Gay News , which listed him as one of the publication 's " special friends " in recognition . 
 Later , during his college tour , Chapman mentioned that a television audience member had written to the Pythons to complain about having a gay group member , adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned . With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation , Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him . Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman 's life . In the mid @-@ 1980s , having resettled in Britain , the three moved to Maidstone , Kent . 
 Chapman took up pipe smoking aged 15 , which continued for the remainder of his life . He began drinking heavily during his time at Cambridge and St Bartholomew 's , favouring gin . By the time Monty Python went on tour in 1973 , Chapman 's drinking had begun to affect his performance , causing him to miss cues to go on stage . He stopped drinking in Christmas 1977 , concerned at being able to act in Life of Brian successfully , and remained sober for the rest of his life . 
 = = Death = = 
 In 1988 , Chapman made a routine visit to a dentist , who found a small , but malignant tumour on one of his tonsils , leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy . The following year , the cancer had spread into Chapman 's spinal cord , where another tumour was surgically removed . Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life , but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable . According to his brother , Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July , by which time he was terminally ill . Shortly afterwards , Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus , the final time he appeared on television . 
 Chapman died on 4 October 1989 in Maidstone Hospital . At the time of his death , he was being visited by Sherlock , brother John and his sister @-@ in @-@ law , and fellow Pythons Palin and Cleese , the latter of whom had to be led out of the room to deal with his grief . Peter Cook had intended to visit , but arrived too late and was visibly shaken by the news . Chapman 's death occurred on the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus , and Jones called it " the worst case of party @-@ pooping in all history " . 
 = = = Memorial service = = = 
 The five surviving Python members had decided to stay away from Chapman 's private funeral to prevent it from becoming a media circus and to give his family some privacy . They sent a wreath in the shape of the famous Python foot with the message : " To Graham from the other Pythons with all our love . PS : Stop us if we 're getting too silly " . The Rolling Stones also sent a floral arrangement , saying " Thanks for all the laughs " . 
 A private memorial service for Chapman was held at St Bartholomew 's on 3 December , two months after his death . The service began with a chorus of the hymn " Jerusalem " sung in Engrish with a mock Chinese accent . Cleese delivered a memorable eulogy to Chapman with a shock humour that he believed Chapman would have wanted , and later became the first person at a televised British memorial service to say " fuck " . Palin delivered a eulogy to Chapman , as did Idle , quipping that Chapman had decided to die rather than listen to Palin once again . Idle also led the other surviving Pythons and Chapman 's close friends and family in a rendition of the song " Always Look on the Bright Side of Life " from The Life of Brian . He closed by saying , " I 'd just like to be the last person at this meeting to say ' fuck ' . " 
 Ten years after Chapman 's death , his ashes were first rumoured to have been " blasted into the skies in a rocket " with assistance from the Dangerous Sports Club . In a second rumour , Chapman 's ashes had been scattered on Snowdon , North Wales . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Since Chapman 's death , the speculation of a Python revival has been inevitably diminished . Subsequent gatherings of the Pythons have included an urn said to contain Chapman 's ashes . At the 1998 Aspen Comedy Arts festival , the urn was " accidentally " knocked over by Terry Gilliam , spilling the " ashes " on @-@ stage . The apparently cremated remains were then removed with a dust @-@ buster . Idle recalled meeting Sherlock saying " I wish he [ Chapman ] was here now " and Sherlock replied " Oh , but he is . He 's in my pocket ! " Asteroid <unk> <unk> , named in Chapman 's honour , is one of six asteroids named after the Python members . 
 In 1997 , Sherlock allowed Jim Yoakum to start the Graham Chapman Archives . Later that year , the novel Graham Crackers : Fuzzy Memories , Silly Bits , and Outright Lies was released . It is a semi @-@ sequel to A Liar 's Autobiography , with Chapman 's works compiled by Jim Yoakum . A compendium of writings , Calcium Made Interesting : Sketches , Letters , Essays & <unk> , also compiled and edited by Yoakum was published in 2005 in association with the David Sherlock and John <unk> trust . In 2000 , Chapman 's play O Happy Day was performed by Dad 's Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta , Georgia , with assistance of Cleese and Palin . In 2006 , the album and DVD Looks Like Another Brown Trouser Job was released , featuring a college lecture recorded in April 1988 . 
 In June 2011 , it was announced that Cleese , Jones , Gilliam and Palin would perform in a 3 @-@ D animated version of Chapman 's memoir A Liar ’ s Autobiography : Volume VI . Co @-@ director Jeff Simpson worked closely with Chapman 's estate and the surviving Python members to " get this exactly right " . The film , titled A Liar 's Autobiography : The Untrue Story of Monty Python 's Graham Chapman , was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2012 and premiered in the UK the following month as part of the BFI London Film Festival . The voices of Cleese , Gilliam , Jones , and Palin were spliced into commentary recorded by Chapman reading from his memoir and taped shortly before his death . The film 's official trailer quotes Chapman saying , " This is the best film I 've been in since I died . " 
 In September 2012 , a British Comedy Society blue plaque , to commemorate Chapman , was unveiled at The Angel pub in Highgate , North London , by Jones , Palin , Barry Cryer , Ray Davies and Carol Cleveland . Palin said , " This was Graham 's manor .... Highgate was his patch and he should be celebrated because he was a very good , brilliant , funny , nice , wise , kind man , who occasionally drank too much . " In December 2014 a green plaque funded by Leicestershire County Council was placed on Chapman 's former home in Burton Road , Melton Mowbray .

 = Snake Pass = 
 Snake Pass is a hill pass in the Derbyshire section of the Peak District , crossing the Pennines between Glossop and the Ladybower Reservoir at Ashopton . The road was engineered by Thomas Telford and opened in 1821 . The pass carries the A57 road between Manchester and Sheffield , but it is no longer the main signposted route between those two cities . 
 Like several other roads that cross the Pennines , Snake Pass has a poor accident record compared with roads in the UK generally , although more favourable compared with other roads in the area . It is regularly closed in winter because of snow , and has seen several longer @-@ term closures owing to subsidence following heavy rain . The road remains a popular route for tourists and motorcycles , however , and sections have been used for semi @-@ professional cycling races such as the Tour of Britain . 
 = = Route and location = = 
 Snake Pass runs through the National Trust 's High Peak Estate , and lies within the High Peak borough of Derbyshire ; much of it falls within the Hope Woodlands parish , the remainder being within the Charlesworth parish . It is part of the shortest route by road from Manchester to Sheffield . 
 The pass starts east of Glossop and climbs to the Pennines watershed between the moorland plateaux of Kinder Scout and Bleaklow to a high point of 1 @,@ 680 feet ( 510 m ) above sea level , where it crosses the Pennine Way . After this , it passes a public house that used to be known as the Snake Inn , and descends through forest to the Ladybower Reservoir at Ashopton . 
 The name of the road matches its winding route , but actually derives from the emblem of the Snake Inn , one of the few buildings on the high stretch of road . In turn , the pub 's name and sign were derived from the serpent on the Cavendish arms of William Cavendish , 6th Duke of Devonshire . In the early 21st century , the inn was renamed the Snake Pass Inn , such that the inn now refers to the road that referred to itself . 
 = = History = = 
 The first road between Glossop and Ashopton was the Doctor 's Gate , a Roman Road that follows the Shelf Brook between Shelf Moor and Coldharbour Moor , a route popular today with walkers and mountain bikers . In 1932 , an Iron Age axe thought to be more than 2 @,@ 000 years old was found near the site of this road . 
 The current road further south was designed as a toll road by Thomas Telford to improve communications east of Glossop , which was expanding as an industrial town . It was originally called the Sheffield to Glossop Turnpike and run by a turnpike trust , the Sheffield and Glossop Trust . An act of parliament to build the road was passed in 1818 , and construction was financed by the Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Devonshire . The road opened in 1821 , having cost £ 18 @,@ 625 to build . Upon opening , it was the highest turnpike road in England . The road was immediately popular and increased toll collections of traffic heading to Glossop . Tolls were abolished on the road in June 1870 . 
 The eastern end of the pass is by the River Derwent . The river is bridged by the Ashopton Viaduct , built as part of the Ladybower Reservoir project between 1935 and 1945 . 
 Although Snake Pass is still the shortest route between Manchester and Sheffield , the more northerly Woodhead Pass , which is less steep and at a lower altitude , is now the primary road link between the two cities . Unlike Snake Pass , the Woodhead route is a trunk road . Traffic levels on both passes remained similar until the 1980s , but the Woodhead Pass route is now favoured as it connects directly to the M1 , while Snake Pass leads into the centre of Sheffield . Despite Sheffield and Manchester being among the largest UK cities by population , there is no direct motorway link between the two . A Manchester to Sheffield motorway was first proposed in 1966 , and a small section bypassing Denton and Hyde has been built , now the M67 . The Woodhead Tunnel was closed in 1981 in anticipation of a road replacement , but linking the cities would have meant constructing many costly tunnels and viaducts across the Peak District . Consequently , the plans were shelved , but reports in December 2014 announced a revival of the scheme . 
 The road remains popular with drivers . In 2008 , a survey by Caterham Cars rated Snake Pass the best driving road in the UK . The following year , it was listed as one of the best roads for driving in Britain by Auto Trader magazine , who described it as " offering unparalleled views over Manchester " . 
 = = Safety = = 
 As would be expected for a road crossing the Pennines , Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits . Like many roads in the North of England passing through similar terrain , Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom . But it is not as dangerous as other roads bisecting hilly terrain in this part of England ; it was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010 , despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England . 
 In 2012 Derbyshire Police announced a campaign to monitor motorcyclists using the pass , who are particularly at risk of being involved in a fatal accident . 
 = = Weather = = 
 In winter the road is often the first of the routes between Sheffield and Manchester to be closed following snow in the area . In bad storms the entire road over the summit , including marker poles , has been buried in snow . In the winter months the road becomes icy , but gritting is not a priority as the A57 is only a " secondary " road at this point . Local councils prefer to treat streets in towns that are more likely to be used , as they believe that roads such as Snake Pass will be closed anyway . 
 In 1924 Derbyshire County Council spent £ 2 @,@ 000 installing underground telegraph wire cables beneath the road , as the above @-@ ground installations were continually broken and disrupted following snowstorms . The British winter of 2010 – 11 was the coldest for decades and the road was closed on numerous occasions . 
 Snake Pass has also been closed for longer periods owing to subsidence in the local area following rain . In January 1932 the road was closed after 200 tonnes of debris fell on it during a heavy rainstorm , covering the surface in as much as 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in places . In January 2008 a landslip at <unk> Moor following heavy rain caused the road to be closed to all traffic between Ladybower and Glossop , although access was still available to local premises and businesses including the Snake Pass Inn . A subsequent investigation by the British Geographical Survey showed the road has had a history of subsidence @-@ related long @-@ term closures dating back to the 1930s , including a 1970s project that attempted to strengthen the layer below the tarmac with local rock fill . The road reopened in February , but with temporary traffic lights at the point of the slip restricting traffic to one direction at a time . In 2012 the road had to be closed several times for resurfacing and strengthening . 
 = = Cycling = = 
 Snake Pass is a popular route for cyclists . A 1902 report on leisure cycling in the Lancashire Evening Post described the eastward journey from the summit to Ashopton as " nine miles unbroken freewheeling " and the scenery as " magnificent " . The road is one of only a few road climbs in the UK that are comparable in length and average gradient ( approximately 7 per cent for around 3 @.@ 2 miles ( 5 @.@ 1 km ) when starting in Glossop ) to those used in continental cycle racing . The road had been part of an 82 @-@ mile " Tour of the Peak " race , involving climbing the pass twice , and has frequently featured in the Tour of Britain along with another nearby favourite , Holme Moss . 
 Cycling Time Trials sanctioned hill climbs are regularly promoted on this course by local club Glossop Kinder Velo . The record for completing the course was set by <unk> <unk> in 2014 , at 11 minutes 51 seconds . 
 = = Media = = 
 Snake Pass has been referred to several times by music groups . The track " The Snake " by Sheffield band the Human League , from their 2001 album Secrets , is about the road . The Squarepusher album Selection Sixteen features a track entitled " Snake Pass " , described by Rolling Stone as a " monomaniacal thump " . 
 Comic character John Shuttleworth has performed a song called " Incident on Snake Pass " about the perils of Snake Pass , relating to an accident he claimed to have had , driving a Ford Anglia on the road . 
 = Dear Jessie = 
 " Dear Jessie " is a song by American singer Madonna from her fourth studio album Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) . It was released as the fifth single from the album on December 10 , 1989 by Sire Records . Written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard , the song was inspired by Leonard 's daughter Jessie . The release of " Dear Jessie " was limited to the United Kingdom , certain other European countries , Australia and Japan . The track is composed more like a children 's lullaby rather than a pop song , and features strings , synthesizer and strummed acoustics . A change in tempo occurs during the breakdown , where instrumentation from trumpets is included . Lyrically , the song evokes a psychedelic fantasy landscape , in which pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids . 
 Upon its release , " Dear Jessie " received mixed reviews from critics , who complained about the overdone fantasy imagery of the song , but complimented its composition . Other reviewers likened the composition and performance to the style of The Beatles . The track was a moderate success commercially , reaching the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the top 20 in Germany , Spain and Switzerland . The music video of " Dear Jessie " combines live action and animation , portraying a little girl waking up in bed and interacting with fantasy characters . Madonna appears in the video only as an animated , Tinker Bell @-@ type fairy . 
 = = Background = = 
 When Madonna started work on her fourth studio album , Like a Prayer , she was in an emotional state of mind following her divorce from Sean Penn , her 30th birthday and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors . She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album . As Madonna considered her alternatives , producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray experimented with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration . One day , while recording of the title track was going on at Jonny Yuma Studios , producer Patrick Leonard had to pick up his daughter Jessie from school and , since his wife was out of town , had to bring her back to the studio . Madonna , who was initially angry with Leonard for his late arrival , struck up a rapport with Jessie . She commented : " It was like as if I was my mother and [ she ] was me . We were playing in our backyard again . " Witnessing their connection , Leonard approached Madonna with a song he had written for his daughter , titled " Dear Jessie " . Madonna changed some of the lyrics and agreed to record the track for Like a Prayer ; it was finished within the next three days . 
 " Dear Jessie " was released as the fourth single from Like a Prayer in Europe , while it served as the fifth single from the album in Australia and Japan ; it was never released in the United States . The single cover used a photo from 1987 , taken by Herb Ritts . It showed Madonna in bed , clutching a bed sheet to her bosom and sporting a pair of Minnie Mouse ears . The photo was a reference to the early criticism of Madonna 's work , when reviewers had described her voice as " Minnie Mouse on helium " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 According to Rikky Rooksby , author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , " Dear Jessie " sounds more like a children 's lullaby than a pop song . A baroque and psychedelic pop song , it begins with the sound of strings , ushering a joyous melody , with Madonna singing in a full voice . The verses are sung without any background vocals to accompany Madonna 's voice . However , in the chorus , when she sings the lines , " Pink elephants and <unk> , Dear Jessie hear the laughter raining on your love @-@ parade " , a different set of vocals are interwoven with hers , continuously chanting the words " La @-@ la " . Synthesizer and strummed acoustics are added during the second verse , followed by the repetition of the chorus , when a change in tempo and time signature occurs , followed by the sound of a child 's laughter . 
 As Madonna finishes singing the intermediate lines , " Close your eyes , sleepy @-@ head , It is time for your bed , Never forget what I said , Hang on ... " , a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm . The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music , with the glissando evoking the string arrangements . This is followed by the bridge and the chorus being repeated twice . " Dear Jessie " ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out , except the orchestra , which is equalized to make it sound very thin and <unk> , as if coming out from a distorted radio . The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination . It summons up a psychedelic landscape , where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids . It references fairy @-@ tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other . 
 According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing Co . Inc . , " Dear Jessie " is written in the time signature of common time , with a tempo of 120 beats per minute . Normally written in 4 ⁄ 4 , the song has a change in time signature after the second chorus , changing it to 3 ⁄ 4 . It is composed in the key of D major , with Madonna 's voice ranging from C3 to D5 . The song 's chord progression follows a sequence of Bm – A – Bm – D – A in the verses and changes to D – Bm – G – A – D in the chorus . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Author Santiago Fouz @-@ Hernández commented in his book Madonna 's Drowned Worlds that to him the song felt like a <unk> of Madonna 's thoughts about what might be termed " girlhood " and on a <unk> , on " feminity " . Christopher P. Andersen , author of Madonna : Unauthorized , described " Dear Jessie " as " a wistfully psychedelic confection of carousels and pink elephants " , adding that " the song harkens back to the lullabies your mother must have sang to you " . Robin Anne Reid , author of Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy : Overviews , complimented the fact that " although the sort of fantasies that [ Madonna ] conjures might trend towards the kinky and sexual , she can also delve into a world of mermaids , fountains of youth , leprechauns and magic lanterns as is evident by ' Dear Jessie ' .

 Lucy O 'Brien , author of Madonna : Like an Icon , characterized the song as " harkening back to a childlike innocence " , but felt that Madonna overdid the elaborate fantasy imagery . O 'Brien preferred Madonna 's later attempts to sing lullaby @-@ like songs on her 1994 and 2003 albums , Bedtime Stories and American Life . Edna Gunderson from USA Today called the song a " sugary lullaby " , while opining that it would not go down as one of Madonna 's well @-@ remembered songs . The Chicago Tribune 's Ian Blair described the track as " bouncy " and praised the soothing quality of the music 's composition . Richard Harrington from The Washington Post deduced that with the song , Madonna was harkening back to her own maternal emotions , the feelings she could not receive from her own mother , due to her untimely death . Reviewing the Like a Prayer album , Mike Mentos from Los Angeles Daily News was not impressed with " Dear Jessie " and commented that " Madonna 's voice possesses neither the control , power nor emotion to carry neo @-@ baroque experiments like ' Dear Jessie ' and ' Oh Father ' . " 
 A number of reviewers have compared " Dear Jessie " to the work of The Beatles . Allen Metz , one of the authors of The Madonna Companion : Two Decades of Commentary , described the composition of the song as " pastel @-@ pretty , [ and ] richly orchestrated " . He felt that the song would have fit better on The Beatles ' 1969 soundtrack album , Yellow Submarine . The Beatles influence was also noted by Stephen Holden from The New York Times , who labeled " Dear Jessie " a " stylish swatch of late Beatles @-@ style psychedelia " . Joey Levy from Spin characterized " Dear Jessie " as " amazing " , describing his reaction to the song as " Wow ! This is neat ! " He added that the song sounded like Prince singing for The Beatles ' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . Kevin Phinney from the Austin American @-@ Statesman compared the song to the solo work that Beatles ' member John Lennon did later in his career . Phinney wondered how Madonna was able to come up with the song , since most of the tracks from Like a Prayer are full of innuendo and double meanings .

 The music video was produced by Animation City , an animation company in London , England , and was directed by Derek Hayes . The video is mainly animated and does not feature Madonna , except as the cartoon fairy Tinker Bell . Along with Hayes , there were six animators who worked on creating the fantasy imagery . It was included on the 1990 promotional @-@ only video compilation She 's Breathless . 
 The video opens with a shot of a little girl sleeping in her bed . As the music starts , rays of light emanate from the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music . The sun rises inside a picture on the wall and the girl wakes and starts playing with her doll . A fairy goes around tapping all her toys on the floor and a large , golden teapot comes alive and shoots a rainbow from its spout . A cartoon version of the girl then slides along the rainbow and , interpreting the lyrics of the song , catches a falling star and rides over the moon . 
 By the second verse , pink elephants float over the girl 's bed and an animated fairy version of Madonna emerges from the picture and winks . She takes the little girl through another picture , displaying mythological and fairytale beings such as dragons , princes and unicorns as well as a castle where Madonna dances with the moon . An underwater scene with mermaids and fish follows , then a parade of all the girl 's toys around her room . As the song wraps , the fairy taps on the girl and causes her to yawn . She falls asleep again and her toys go back to being as they were . The violins and the instruments gradually fade inside the radio and the song ends .

 = Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women 's individual road race = 
 The women 's road race was one of the cycling events at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China . It took place on 10 August 2008 , featuring 66 women from 33 countries . It was the seventh appearance of an Olympic women 's road race event and featured a longer course than any of the previous six races . The race was run on the Urban Road Cycling Course ( one of Beijing 's nine temporary venues ) , which is 102 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 63 @.@ 8 mi ) in its entirety . Including a second lap around the 23 @.@ 8 km ( 14 @.@ 8 mi ) final circuit , the total distance of the women 's race was 126 @.@ 4 km ( 78 @.@ 5 mi ) , less than half the length of the men 's race . 
 Heavy rain during most of the race made conditions difficult for the competitors . A group of five broke away during the final lap and worked together until the final sprint , where Nicole Cooke won the race . Cooke earned Great Britain 's first medal at these Games and 200th Olympic gold medal overall . Emma Johansson of Sweden and Tatiana Guderzo of Italy , finishing second and third place with the same time as Cooke , received silver and bronze medals respectively . 
 The race marked the first positive drug test of the 2008 Olympic Games , by María Isabel Moreno of Spain . She was scheduled to compete in this event and the time trial to follow , but left Beijing on 31 July , before the race . The International Olympic Committee said on 11 August that she had tested positive for EPO . This left 66 cyclists to compete , one fewer than in 2004 . 
 = = Qualification = = 
 The 2008 Summer Olympics marked the seventh appearance of an Olympic women 's road race event . Qualification for the race was restricted to three athletes per National Olympic Committee ( NOC ) for the 16 top @-@ ranked countries in overall Union Cycliste Internationale ( UCI ) standings at 1 June 2008 , and a maximum of two athletes each for the countries ranking 17 – 24 . An NOC with an athlete in the top 100 at 31 May 2008 received a place , which was taken from the countries ranked 17 – 24 in reversed order , provided that these athletes qualified through the UCI World Tour rankings . Additionally , three places were available at the B World Championship for NOCs that did not qualify through the UCI standing ; Gu Sun @-@ Geun , Hae Ok @-@ Jeong and <unk> <unk> secured Olympic qualification for their NOCs in this way , but only the first was chosen by her national committee to compete . The maximum quota of the event was set at 67 cyclists , and as of 5 June , 66 cyclists were qualified in this way . Although the Chinese and Austrian NOCs were allowed to enter three cyclists , they only entered two . This left three open positions : two were allotted to South Africa and New Zealand , based on their World Tour rankings , and the third was given to Mauritius by direct invitation . Only 66 of the 67 entrants began the race , as María Isabel Moreno of Spain left the country days earlier after failing a drug test .

 Judith Arndt , the German rider who finished second at the 2004 Summer Olympics , was a strong favourite . Arndt had recently finished first at the 2008 Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal , and her form in the months that preceded the race was excellent . Among other contenders were UCI Women 's Road standings leader , Marianne Vos of the Netherlands ; Briton Nicole Cooke , who said she had greater confidence in her team on this occasion than in 2004 , when she finished fifth ; and Noemi <unk> of Italy . The Australian team was considered strong : it included Sara Carrigan ( the defending champion ) , Oenone Wood ( winner of the 2008 Australian Road Race ) , and Katherine Bates , all of whom could work on each other 's behalf . Because the final leg of the course involved steep ramps , riders considered to be climbing experts ( including Cooke , Vos , and Susanne <unk> ) were favoured . Although not seen as a strong medal contender , one former champion participating in the race was 49 @-@ year @-@ old Jeannie Longo from France , who won the road race in 1996 and had competed in the inaugural event in 1984 , making this her seventh appearance . 
 Many cyclists expected tropical conditions during the race and adjusted their training to compensate . For example , Marianne Vos prepared in El Salvador . Cyclists had also anticipated a problem with high levels of pollution in Beijing , but these did not appear to affect the results of the men 's road race . Although the pollution levels in Beijing on 10 August far exceeded the World Health Organisation 's safety level , the rain during the women 's race decreased the smog level . 
 In the men 's race , conducted the previous day , humidity and heat had taken the greatest toll on the athletes . To compensate for the expected warm weather , some female cyclists chose not to wear undershirts . This proved to be a misjudgment , as conditions were cooler in the Great Wall section than on the previous day — 19 ° C ( 66 ° F ) compared to 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) . Thunderstorms , bringing persistently heavy rain and strong winds , resulted in actual race conditions far different from expected . Other riders , such as Katherine Bates ( who did not finish ) , prepared by wearing cooling vests before the race and stocked up on ice packs during it .

 The race was run on the Urban Road Cycling Course ( one of Beijing 's nine temporary venues ) , which was 102 @.@ 6 km ( 63 @.@ 8 mi ) in its entirety . Unlike the previous Olympic races , the start and finish were not at the same location . The early section of the race took place within central Beijing ; the gradient of this part of the race was relatively flat . After approximately 78 @.@ 8 km ( 49 @.@ 0 mi ) , the riders reached the Badaling section of the Great Wall and began two loops of 23 @.@ 8 km ( 14 @.@ 8 mi ) between the Badaling and Juyong Passes . The gradient increased at this point , as the Badaling Pass gained 338 @.@ 2 m ( 1 @,@ 110 ft ) in elevation 12 @.@ 4 km ( 7 @.@ 7 mi ) from the start of the circuit to the highest point , including ramps as steep as a 10 percent gradient . From there the cyclists rode over a false flat before descending a highway towards the Juyong Pass . The final 350 @.@ 0 m ( 1 @,@ 148 @.@ 3 ft ) were a moderately steep climb , designed to ensure an exciting finale should several riders be grouped together at the end of the race . In total , the distance of the women 's race was 126 @.@ 4 km ( 78 @.@ 5 mi ) , less than half the length of the men 's race . 
 The race 's starting line was at the Yongdingmen Gate , a remnant of Beijing 's old city wall , which is a part of the Chongwen District of northern Beijing . The route passed through eight districts : Chongwen , Xuanwu , Dongcheng , Xicheng , Chaoyang , Haidian , Changping , and Yanqing . Landmarks such as the Temple of Heaven , the Great Hall of the People , Tiananmen Square , the <unk> Temple , and sections of the Great Wall of China were passed as the course journeyed from urban Beijing into the countryside . It passed the architectural features of the 2008 Olympics , including the Beijing National Stadium and Beijing National Aquatics Center ( known colloquially as the Bird 's Nest and the Water Cube ) . The course ended at the Juyong Pass in the Changping District . The course 's scenery was described by The Guardian as " visually sumptuous " . 
 Due to security regulations put in place by the Olympic organisers , spectators were not permitted to stand roadside along the course . Several prominent figures in cycling protested against this decision , including UCI president Pat McQuaid and two Australian riders , Stuart O 'Grady and Cadel Evans , who competed in the men 's race . McQuaid and O 'Grady felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events , and said that it failed to take supporters ' wishes into consideration . Cycling Australia 's reaction to the cyclists ' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the time trial to follow , but this plea was ignored .

 The race started at 14 : 00 China Standard Time ( UTC + 8 ) , and was scheduled to last until 17 : 30 . The weather was unseasonably cool . It was cloudy and the roads were dry at the start of the race . The clouds brought steady rainfall midway through the race , making conditions challenging . 
 The race saw some incidents which caused riders to lose valuable time . Gu Sun @-@ Geun ( South Korea ) lost control of her bike , bringing others down with her . She eventually fell into a concrete ditch on the side of the highway . Natalia Boyarskaya ( Russia ) , who had built a lead of 59 seconds over the top of Badaling , had to stop to see which way to choose at a poorly marked intersection . 
 The chase for Boyarskaya was led by Christine Thorburn ( United States ) , who brought the lead down to 34 seconds prior to the final loop of 23 @.@ 8 km ( 14 @.@ 8 mi ) . Emma Pooley ( Great Britain ) and Tatiana Guderzo ( Italy ) rode away from the bunch on the climb and caught Boyarskaya with 22 km ( 14 mi ) to go , forming a three rider breakaway . The German team , with a steady pace , caught them soon after . Guderzo attacked with about 13 km ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) to go over the final summit . She was soon joined by Christiane <unk> ( Austria ) , Emma Johansson ( Sweden ) , Nicole Cooke ( Great Britain ) and Linda <unk> ( Denmark ) . With 7 km ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) remaining , the group had gained 16 seconds on the main peloton . Marianne Vos ( Netherlands ) , one of the pre @-@ race favourites who was not in the leading group , hesitated before leading the chase together with other pre @-@ race favourite Judith Arndt . Cooke looked out of contention as the five came round the final bend , but she came around the other riders with 200 metres ( 660 ft ) to go , claiming the gold medal with a clear margin . Johansson came in second and Guderzo won the bronze . Vos eventually led the bunch over the finish line , 21 seconds after the winner . 
 It was later revealed that Cooke had held back intentionally , as she was using lightweight tyres not suited to rainy conditions . The British women 's road team manager Julian Winn said " We were afraid someone might come down in front of her , so we told her to keep to the left . We knew she would chew them up after that . " Cooke 's victory was the result of meticulous planning , as the team had ridden the course before the race and formulated the winning plan .

 The day after the race , an International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) spokesperson announced that Spanish rider María Isabel Moreno had become the first athlete of the 2008 Olympics to test positive for a banned substance . Moreno had provided a urine sample the day she arrived in Beijing ( 31 July ) , but flew back to Madrid on the same day , after suffering a panic attack , and did not return to take part in the race . The urine sample tested positive for erythropoietin ( EPO ) . The IOC stripped Moreno of her Games accreditation , later referring the matter to the UCI which confirmed the positive result . A statement on Moreno 's website read that " she does not feel ready to justify or explain her reasons for leaving the [ Olympic ] village " . 
 = = Final classification = = 
 A total of 66 cyclists have been qualified in the event at these Games . Most of them are not expected to finish one @-@ day races , having worked in support for their teams ( in this case , nations ) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins . Additionally , any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit would be forced to stop , although this situation did not occur . The notation " <unk> " indicates that the rider crossed the finish line in the same group as the cyclist before her , and was therefore credited with the same finishing time .

 = French destroyer Volta = 
 Volta was a Mogador @-@ class destroyer ( French : contre @-@ torpilleur ) of the French Navy . Named for the West African river , she was built before the outbreak of World War II and was the penultimate contre @-@ torpilleur built by the French Navy . Along with her sister ship Mogador , Volta was designed in an effort to build a ship capable of out @-@ fighting every other ship below her tonnage . Arguably the design was less than successful , as it possessed the armament of a light cruiser on the hull of a destroyer . The two ships of the class have been described as having pushed the contre @-@ torpilleur concept beyond " the limits of its capabilities " . 
 During Volta 's service with the French Navy , she saw only limited action . Following the outbreak of the war , she took part in convoy escort duties initially before being withdrawn to Brest for refit . On 3 July 1940 , when the British attacked the French fleet at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir , Volta managed to escape without damage and sought refuge in Toulon . When the Germans tried to seize her along with the rest of the fleet on 27 November 1942 , however , she was scuttled in Toulon Harbour by her crew to prevent her from being captured . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Volta had an overall length of 137 @.@ 5 meters ( 451 ft 1 in ) , a beam of 12 @.@ 57 meters ( 41 ft 3 in ) , and a maximum draft of 4 @.@ 74 meters ( 15 ft 7 in ) . She displaced 2 @,@ 997 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 950 long tons ) at standard load and 4 @,@ 018 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 955 long tons ) at deep load . The Rateau @-@ Bretagne geared steam turbines were designed to produce 92 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 68 @,@ 604 kW ) , which would propel the ship at 39 knots ( 72 km / h ; 45 mph ) . However , during sea trials in February 1938 , Volta 's turbines provided 108 @,@ 424 shp ( 80 @,@ 852 kW ) and she reached 41 @.@ 67 knots ( 77 @.@ 17 km / h ; 47 @.@ 95 mph ) at a deep displacement of 3 @,@ 731 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 672 long tons ) . The ship carried 360 metric tons ( 354 long tons ) of fuel oil at normal load and an additional 350 metric tons ( 340 long tons ) at deep load . 
 Volta carried eight Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1929 guns in four twin electrically powered gun turrets , two each superimposed fore and aft . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Mle 1933 guns in a single mount positioned on the rear deck house forward of the rear turrets . She also mounted four 13 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) Mle 1929 heavy machine guns in two twin mounts located between the forward superstructure and the forward guns . Volta carried 10 above @-@ water 550 @-@ millimeter ( 22 in ) tubes : a pair of triple mounts between the funnels and a pair of double mounts aft of the rear funnel . A pair of depth charge chutes were built into Volta 's stern ; these housed a total of 16 Guirard depth charges . Mine rails were fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 40 mines . 
 The ship 's greatest weakness was her " inability to generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent . Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered , particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings ( which were slow to train and elevate ) and for the rudder ( which contributed to the ship 's poor maneuverability . " 
 = = Service history = = 
 Volta , with her sister Mogador , comprised the 6th Large Destroyer Division ( French : 6e Division de contre @-@ torpilleurs ) and was assigned to the Force de Raide based at Brest when the war began . This group 's purpose was to hunt German blockade runners and raiders and to escort convoys that might be in danger from the same . From 21 – 30 October 1939 the Force de Raide escorted the KJ.4 convoy to protect it against the German cruiser Deutschland which had sortied into the North Atlantic before the war began . A sortie by the Gneisenau and Scharnhorst into the North Atlantic on 21 November prompted the Force de Raide to sail from Brest to rendezvous with the British battlecruiser HMS Hood and patrol the area south of Iceland , but the German ships were able to return safely under the cover of heavy weather without being engaged . 
 Volta was refitted at Brest between January and May 1940 and a number of minor changes were made . The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during her sea trials a year earlier were finally implemented , the canvas cover for the back of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door , new radios were installed , and shields were fitted to the anti @-@ aircraft machine guns and the searchlights . A SS @-@ 6 sonar was fitted in June 1940 , but proved to be ineffectual . 
 On 3 July 1940 , following the Fall of France , Volta was at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir when the British attacked the French fleet in an effort to destroy the French fleet in order to prevent it from being captured by the Germans . Despite the attack , Volta fired 88 shells at a British destroyer — a performance rated by her gunnery officer as her best up to that point — before managing to escape to Toulon in the company of the battleship Strasbourg and a number of other destroyers . 
 After the Armistice with Germany in June 1940 , the French Navy decided to increase the anti @-@ aircraft strength of the Mogador @-@ class destroyers and installed two 13 @.@ 2 mm Browning machine guns on platforms attached to the sides of the No. 3 gun mount in December 1940 – January 1941 . This was a version of the American .50 caliber M2 Browning re @-@ chambered to use the standard French 13 @.@ 2 mm ammunition and with its rate of fire increased to 1000 rounds per minute . It was fed from 1000 @-@ round flexible belts , but had no greater range than the older Hotchkiss machine guns already fitted on Volta . Plans were made at the same time to replace the Hotchkiss machine guns with another twin 37 mm Mle 1933 mount and another pair of Brownings , but a shortage of weapons prevented this plan from being fulfilled . However eight 7 @.@ 5 mm Darne machine guns were fitted , more for the crew 's morale benefit than any real usefulness , and more OPL 1 meter ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) rangefinders were fitted at the aft end of the centre deck house to improve coverage of the rear sky arcs and to increase the number of aerial targets that could be engaged . 
 In the autumn of 1941 the <unk> de 25 mm contre @-@ <unk> Modèle 1940 , a naval adaptation of an Army anti @-@ aircraft gun , became available . So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25 mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted . Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added on each side of the platform . The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the after deck house . A degaussing cable was added during this same refit . Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British ASDIC , but it was still sitting on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies . She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians , but no effort was made to repair her . Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948 . 
 = A500 road = 
 D road can also apply as a road designation under the Great Britain road numbering scheme 
 The A500 is a major primary A road in Staffordshire and Cheshire , England . It is dual carriageway for most of its length and connects Nantwich , junctions 16 and 15 of the M6 motorway with the city of Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent . It is known locally as the D @-@ Road ( D is also the Roman numeral representing the number 500 ) . In 2004 the road was stated as carrying 60 @,@ 000 vehicles a day through Stoke . 
 It was built to provide links between Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent and the M6 , before being extended to Nantwich . Construction has taken place over several stages , beginning in 1962 , with the final section of the original route being completed similar to the original plans in 2006 . As a trunk road it is maintained by the Highways Agency . 
 = = History = = 
 By the 1960s , traffic congestion was a major problem in Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent , and journeys across the area sometimes took hours . There was no connection from the newly constructed M6 to the city . Businesses in the area wanted an easier route to get their goods out of the area . 
 The A500 was initially built from the M6 at junction 16 to the A34 road at Talke as part of the motorway construction , opening in 1962 . At the southern end , a dual carriageway was constructed from junction 15 of the M6 to the A34 near Trentham , given the number <unk> , and opened at the same time . The northern section of the road was then subsequently extended from Talke to the A53 road . The final section from the A34 in the south to the A53 junction was built between 1974 and 1977 . The two middle junctions were to be grade separated , but due to financial constraints they were built as roundabouts . Construction involved the destruction of streets and businesses within Stoke 's town centre , as well as the excavation of a mass grave of the victims of a 17th @-@ century cholera epidemic . This final section was named Queensway , and on its completion the whole route became the A500 . 
 The route remained unchanged until the 1980s when the Hanford Roundabout junction had a flyover built , as this was a major bottleneck for both the A500 and A34 . The 1977 section east of this junction had been built with provision for the bridge , but the section built as the <unk> required realignment for the new interchange . In the late 1980s the road was extended from Junction 16 close to Weston with connections provided to existing roads to Keele and Crewe . The A52 , which at that time ran to Nantwich , was renumbered from Newcastle to Weston as a B road and the section from Weston to Nantwich was incorporated into the A500 . In 1989 a bypass to the east of Nantwich was opened , extending the A500 from the south of Nantwich to its current northerly terminus with the <unk> . 
 In 1993 a proposal was made to add the missing flyover and underpass close to Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent railway station , after an alternative plan had been rejected because of its cost . A full review of the national roads programme resulted in the suspension of that scheme however . In 1997 the A50 was rerouted through Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent to meet the A500 at <unk> , where a new grade separated roundabout was constructed . 
 On the approach to Hough was a narrow single lane bridge which was added to with a Bailey bridge in 1993 . In September 2003 , the Shavington bypass opened to reroute the road away from three villages on the former A52 section . This was built to dual carriageway standards with provision for further junctions to new development sites . 
 Traffic continued to rise to the point where major congestion was experienced on the central section . Work began on 16 February 2004 on the A500 Pathfinder Project to replace the final two roundabouts in Stoke with underpasses . The Highways Agency defined the pathfinder project as involving " a new form of contract and co @-@ operative working methods to deliver a better value project , faster . " The project involved alterations to the path of the Trent and Mersey Canal and River Trent , along with new provisions for pedestrians . The work was carried out by Edmund Nuttall Limited and was planned to be completed in spring 2006 . Following a number of delays for which it was rumoured the construction company was being fined up to £ 100 @,@ 000 a day for not keeping to schedule , the road opened on Tuesday 26 September 2006 , with the southbound traffic in the morning and northbound traffic in the afternoon . Several months of additional work was needed to finalise traffic light operations , gardens , and other miscellaneous tasks . 
 In February 2009 , it was announced that the single carriageway Nantwich bypass would be re @-@ numbered as the <unk> in a bid to relieve the town centre of traffic . 
 In 2015 , the final 500m of the eastbound single carriageway between Weston and Junction 16 of the M6 was upgraded . This included resignalling works on the roundabout in order to relieve congestion at the roundabout .

 The road is the primary access route for traffic to and from almost all areas of Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent . Starting to the east of Nantwich on the Nantwich bypass the dual carriageway Shavington bypass running north of Hough and Shavington . Returning to the 1980s single carriageway extension route it continues east through a cutting to the M6 at Junction 16 where it becomes a dual carriageway . Continuing through open countryside it passes under the A34 at Talke Pits , turns south before meeting the Tunstall Western Bypass and enters the north of Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent . Now continuing in an urban setting it runs between Newcastle and Burslem , passing through the middle of the former Wolstanton Colliery before running east of Stoke 's town centre . Passing through the newest section in a cutting it emerges south of Stoke alongside the site of the Victoria Ground . Turning west it passes the Britannia Stadium before leaving the urban area at Hanford , south of Trent Vale . It then runs through a cutting before meeting the M6 at junction 15 .

 = Leif Tronstad = 
 Leif Hans Larsen Tronstad DSO , OBE ( 27 March 1903 – 11 March 1945 ) was a Norwegian scientist , intelligence officer and military organizer . He graduated from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in 1927 and was a prolific researcher and writer of academic publications . A professor of chemistry at the Norwegian Institute of Technology from 1936 , he was also among the pioneers of heavy water research , and was instrumental when a heavy water plant was built at Vemork . 
 During World War II Norway was invaded by Germany and Tronstad conducted domestic resistance for one year before fleeing the country for England . Here , he gathered valuable intelligence from Norwegian sources , both on the development of the V @-@ 2 rocket and the growing German interest in heavy water . In 1943 Tronstad planned Operation Gunnerside , in which the German access to heavy water processing at Vemork was severely impeded . His information about the V @-@ 2 rocket contributed to the massive Allied bombing of Peenemünde . 
 For a long time Tronstad had wanted to return to Norway to organize resistance work , however he was prevented by the Norwegian military authorities in Britain . In 1944 , however , he did travel to Norway , to organize Operation Sunshine , for the defence of Norwegian infrastructure . After five months in the country , he was killed in action after his team had taken the local bailiff hostage . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Tronstad was born in Bærum ; the son of Hans Larsen and Josefine Amalie Tronstad , Hans died three months before Leif was born . Leif thus grew up in Sandvika with his mother and four siblings . He graduated from middle school in 1918 , with top grades in mathematics . He then embarked on thirty months of professional practice in two local electricity companies , which was a requirement to enrol at Kristiania Technical School , a predecessor of the Faculty of Engineering at Oslo University College . When he enrolled in 1920 he chose technical chemistry instead of electronic engineering . He graduated in 1922 , the best chemistry student ; a fellow student recalled that he " did not have to read anything more than once " in order to remember it . In the spring of 1923 , he also took the examen artium after attending the <unk> School for one year . He was ready to enroll at the Norwegian Institute of Technology , but waited one year , possibly wanting to strengthen his personal finances . In the meantime , he started on his compulsory military service . 
 He was an accomplished athlete and helped his hometown club <unk> SK to two Norwegian 4 × 1500 metres relay records . The records were set in 1921 and 1923 , but broken by the team IL i <unk> in 1926 . His brother John , a bronze medalist in 1500 metres at the 1917 Norwegian championships , was on the relay team as well . Both brothers used their father 's name Larsen at the time ; Leif took up his mother 's name Tronstad later . 
 In 1924 Tronstad moved to Trondheim to study at the Norwegian Institute of Technology , graduating in 1927 . His graduation paper was deemed exceptional and as such was reported to King Haakon of Norway . Regarded as a fully @-@ fledged academic work , it was published scientifically in 1928 . Tronstad had taken various stray jobs while studying , and also finished his military service , reaching the rank of Second Lieutenant in the Norwegian Army Corps of Weaponry in 1927 . From 1927 to 1928 Tronstad worked briefly as an assistant at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as well as in a private company in Kristiansand . In 1928 he returned to the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a research fellow . In the same year , Tronstad married <unk> Obel , who was nine years his junior , in Trondheim . The couple had two children . 
 = = Academic career = = 
 Tronstad spent the first year of a research period as an assistant to Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem , Berlin . He studied the passivity of metal surfaces , and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings , thus solving a problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday . He continued to Stockholm to study <unk> under Carl <unk> , and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin . The work was completed in 1931 and his thesis , spanning 250 pages , was published in German as <unk> Untersuchungen zur Frage der <unk> des <unk> und <unk> . For it , he received the doctorate degree . He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931 , although he spent the first year at the University of Cambridge , conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen . The research at Cambridge was a continuation of his thesis work , but this time he tested his method on mercury . 
 Following the death in 1934 of a professor of technical inorganic chemistry at the Norwegian Institute of Technology , Tronstad was appointed his successor on 17 April 1936 , effective from 1 May . At the time , he was one of the youngest professors in Norway . He was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters , and in early 1940 he became vice president of the Norwegian Chemical Society . During his short scientific career , Tronstad penned about eighty scientific publications , including fourteen on heavy water @-@ related topics . 
 The properties of heavy water had been discovered in 1932 by Harold Urey . In 1933 , Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun , the head of Norsk Hydro Rjukan , created a plan for industrial production of heavy water in Norway . As Norsk Hydro were already producing ammonia for nitrogen fertilizer , Tronstad and Brun had realized that large amounts of electrolyzed water were available . Tronstad was paid by Norsk Hydro as a consultant . Already in 1934 , Norsk Hydro had opened a plant near the power station at Vemork . This was the world 's first plant for industrial mass production of heavy water . Both French and German scientists expressed interest in the project .

 = = = German invasion of Norway = = = 
 Tronstad , holding a military rank , had a standing order to report to the Norwegian military headquarters in Oslo in the face of a military peril . When Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940 , he first informed his students of the situation , and then drove towards Oslo . He brought his wife and children with him , but having no intention of taking them to a possible theatre of war , he left them in the <unk> valley . He continued alone but shortly after , upon learning that Oslo was the first city to fall to the invaders , he stopped at Dovre . The family had a cabin in the vicinity . Here , he helped organize volunteers from local rifle associations to form a line of defence meant to repel any advancing German forces . German Fallschirmjäger paratroops did land at nearby Dombås , but were surprised by a contingent of regular Norwegian forces already in the area , who ensured a tactical victory for Norway in the ensuing Battle of Dombås . 
 = = = Resistance = = = 
 When the Norwegian Campaign ended and the German occupation of Norway was a reality , Tronstad became involved in resistance work , largely based around the Norwegian Institute of Technology . He was associated with the radio agent group Skylark B , which had regular contact with London from January 1941 . Among other things , he sent reports on the interest shown by German authorities in the heavy water plant at Vemork . One source of this information was Tronstad 's old companion , Jomar Brun , still in charge of the plant , who also helped people to flee the country by sea , via the Møre coast . After exposure of the group in September 1941 , Tronstad himself had to flee the country . Another resistance member , who had already been jailed , managed to warn Tronstad , who travelled from Trondheim to Oslo by train . The following day , the Gestapo visited his house to arrest him . After a few days in hiding , Tronstad was driven by car to Østfold , and then travelled on foot to <unk> via <unk> . From there he continued by plane to England , rejecting an offer of a civilian job in Sweden . 
 He reached England in October 1941 . He already had a broad network of contacts there , stemming both from his academic career as well as from his radio operations . He also maintained several contacts abroad , including scientists whom he knew from the Norwegian Institute of Technology : Harald Wergeland and <unk> Hole . The opportunity to work directly for the British was presented to Tronstad , but instead he chose to aim his efforts towards disrupting the German occupation of Norway and improving the Norwegian resistance work . He even wanted to enrol in active duty , but was stopped by the Norwegian military command , who considered him " too valuable " for the war theatre . Tronstad 's foremost skill was that of organization , which he owed to his experience in science . Thus , Tronstad became a part of the staff of the Ministry of Defence , and later of the Norwegian High Command . From 1943 , he headed a section in department 4 ( FO IV ) . This had been established in December 1942 under the leadership of Colonel Bjarne Øen , and Tronstad was brought in as a reinforcement as the work burden increased . Also , he had recently been promoted from Captain to Major . Tronstad 's section was responsible for the special operation towards industry and shipping ; training of the Norwegian Independent Company 1 ( Kompani Linge ) ; technical advice on sabotage , and towards the end of the war also the protection of Norwegian industry . He established the Norwegian High Command Technical Committee , which included other Norwegian scientists @-@ in @-@ exile such as Svein Rosseland , Helmer Dahl and Gunnar Randers . The Technical Committee is considered as the precursor to the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment , established in 1946 . 
 = = = Heavy water sabotage = = = 
 Already in 1941 , Tronstad was aware that heavy water production at Vemork had greatly increased . In the beginning , Tronstad had not been aware of the connection between heavy water and atomic weaponry , but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project , especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941 . Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was being discussed . Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue , hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin , in January 1942 . Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland , a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan . In October 1942 , Brun was summoned to England , reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill . Instead , a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence , under the codename Operation Grouse . 
 The idea of subjecting the heavy water facility at Vemork to heavy air bombing surfaced , but Tronstad was a staunch opponent of such an idea , which he saw as too hazardous . He warned of the presence of civil housing , and argued that bombing was not even guaranteed to succeed , given that the heavy water facility was located in the armoured basement of the <unk> plant . The first attempt to take out the facility , in November 1942 , had consisted of British personnel using gliders to land near Vemork . The operation , codenamed Freshman , was a catastrophe , as all units except for one towing aircraft perished , either due to crash landings or in German captivity . 
 Tronstad then organized the next attempt . He had wanted to take an active part in the sabotage mission , but again he was stopped by his commanders , who regarded him as <unk> . Tronstad and Brun supplied the would @-@ be saboteurs with extensive knowledge of the facility , and organized the training . The operation , codenamed Gunnerside and led by Joachim <unk> , was carried out successfully between 27 and 28 February 1943 . However , after three months , Germany managed to resume production . Against the will of Tronstad , in July 1943 , an American @-@ led raid by 161 aircraft bombed Vemork as well as the shipment yard at Herøya . The two bombings claimed the lives of 76 people , many of whom were civilian . The heavy water plant was not directly affected by the bombing , nevertheless production was halted due to a damaged generator . The Germans then tried to disassemble the production facility , followed by a retreat from Vemork with the remaining stock of heavy water . This resulted in the sinking of SF Hydro by Norwegian saboteurs , halting the heavy water transport , but again claiming many civilian lives . Tronstad had given his consent to the latter operation , reportedly with a " heavy heart " . 
 Concealed listening posts at Rjukan and Notodden also revealed high @-@ level German discussions of long @-@ range weaponry . The place name Peenemünde was frequently mentioned . As this intelligence reaching Tronstad 's ear via his contacts in Norway , he forwarded it to the British . As a result , the Royal Air Force bombed the Army Research Center of Peenemünde in August 1943 . Further raids were made by the US Army Air Force in July and August 1944 . The bombing halted the weapons program there , which centered around development of the V @-@ 1 flying bomb and the V @-@ 2 rocket . Fellow scientists <unk> and Evans later wrote that Tronstad " contributed directly to the speedy victory of the Allied Nations , besides saving the region which came to be known as ' Southern England ' from an even longer and more severe ordeal than it actually endured " . 
 = = = Operation Sunshine = = = 
 In 1944 , when the tide of war was turning against Germany , the German forces started to retreat from Northern Norway . However , they used the scorched earth tactic as they retreated . Consequently , Tronstad started to plan how to organize a defence of industrial sites in Southern Norway . The first plan pertained to Øvre Telemark , and was codenamed Operation Sunshine . Its basic principle was to build a defence force from the existing Milorg pockets in the district . Tronstad , who earlier had been stopped from travelling to Norway himself , did so this time . He felt that it was time to deal a decisive blow to a dwindling German war power , and called for the " full effort ... from all who would be called men " . 
 Tronstad was parachuted into Hardangervidda on 4 October 1944 , together with eight Norwegian Independent Company 1 members . The group included Gunnar Syverstad , Jens @-@ Anton Poulsson and Claus Helberg . They lived in a small cabin built by Einar Skinnarland . 
 However , after a few months a situation arose that could compromise the operation . It was feared that Torgeir Lognvik , the bailiff installed by the Nazis in <unk> municipality , had become suspicious . Thus , the people behind Operation Sunshine created a plan to lure him to the mountains , and capture and interrogate him there . On 11 March 1945 , resistance member Jon Landsverk managed to travel with Torgeir Lognvik towards the mountains on the pretext of showing him some stolen goods . The two were soon met by Gunnar Syverstad and Einar Skinnarland , who captured the bailiff . He was taken to a lodge in the hills of Syrebekkstølen , where he was to be interrogated by Landsverk , Syverstad and Tronstad . However , on the same day , Torgeir 's brother Johans became suspicious and decided to follow the ski trails , which led him to Syrebekkstølen . Armed , he entered the lodge , firing several shots , taking the Resistance fighters by surprise . Gunnar Syverstad was killed in the initial attack . Torgeir , who was not bound , grabbed a rifle . In the struggle , Tronstad charged at Johans , but was killed . The two brothers then escaped . Jon Landsverk survived , and together with Einar Skinnarland he disposed of the two bodies in a lake . However , the next day the bodies were found and burned by German forces . After the war , Jon Landsverk testified against the Lognvik brothers as a part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II . While Landsverk claimed that the wounded Tronstad had been killed by a blow from the butt of a rifle held by Torgeir , the court found Johans guilty of both murders , and Torgeir of attempted murder . Johans was sentenced to a ten @-@ year prison term , and Torgeir to a five @-@ year term .

 Tronstad 's coded diaries from 1941 to 1945 are preserved , and the 13 original books are kept by the National Archival Services of Norway . They have been transcribed and made available to historians , and are regarded as an important source of information from the " outer front " . 
 = = Awards and legacy = = 
 Tronstad had a military funeral on 30 May 1945 , being buried at Vestre gravlund in Oslo . He was awarded Norway 's highest decoration for military gallantry , the War Cross with sword , as well as the Norwegian War Medal and the Defence Medal 1940 – 1945 . In addition to his Norwegian decorations , Tronstad received the Order of the British Empire , Chevalier of the French Légion d 'honneur and Croix de guerre and the US Medal of Freedom with bronze palm as well as the British Distinguished Service Order . 
 A memorial stone was raised at Syrebekkstølen , commemorating the death of Tronstad and Gunnar Syverstad . Also , several streets in Norway have been named after him . A statue of Tronstad today stands at the square Leif <unk> plass in Sandvika , the administrative centre of Bærum . It was commissioned in 1965 by the local Rotary club , and erected in 1973 . Abstract , it was sculpted by Fritz <unk> . 
 = Terry Fox = 
 Terrance Stanley " Terry " Fox CC OD ( July 28 , 1958 – June 28 , 1981 ) was a Canadian athlete , humanitarian , and cancer research activist . In 1980 , with one leg having been amputated , he embarked on a cross @-@ Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research . Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and 5 @,@ 373 kilometres ( 3 @,@ 339 mi ) , and ultimately cost him his life , his efforts resulted in a lasting , worldwide legacy . The annual Terry Fox Run , first held in 1981 , has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world 's largest one @-@ day fundraiser for cancer research ; over C $ 650 million has been raised in his name . 
 Fox was a distance runner and basketball player for his Port Coquitlam , British Columbia , high school and Simon Fraser University . His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma , though he continued to run using an artificial leg . He also played wheelchair basketball in Vancouver , winning three national championships . 
 In 1980 , he began the Marathon of Hope , a cross @-@ country run to raise money for cancer research . He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada 's 24 million people . He began with little fanfare from St. John 's , Newfoundland , in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day . Fox had become a national star by the time he reached Ontario ; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen , athletes , and politicians in his efforts to raise money . He was forced to end his run outside Thunder Bay when the cancer spread to his lungs . His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later . 
 He was the youngest person ever named a Companion of the Order of Canada . He won the 1980 Lou Marsh Award as the nation 's top sportsman and was named Canada 's Newsmaker of the Year in both 1980 and 1981 . Considered a national hero , he has had many buildings , roads and parks named in his honour across the country . 
 = = Early life and cancer = = 
 Terry Fox was born on July 28 , 1958 , in Winnipeg , Manitoba , to Roland and Betty Fox . Rolland was a <unk> for the Canadian National Railway . Terry had an elder brother , Fred , a younger brother , Darrell and a younger sister , Judith . 
 His family moved to Surrey , British Columbia in 1966 , then settled in Port Coquitlam in 1968 . His parents were dedicated to their family , and his mother was especially protective of her children ; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to whatever task he committed to do . His father recalled that he was extremely competitive , noting that Terry hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded . 
 He was an enthusiastic athlete , playing soccer , rugby and baseball as a child . His passion was for basketball and though he stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time , Fox sought to make his school team in grade eight . Bob McGill , Terry 's physical education teacher and basketball coach at Mary Hill Junior High School felt he was better suited to be a distance runner and encouraged him to take up the sport . Fox had no desire for cross @-@ country running , but took it up because he respected and wanted to please his coach . He was determined to continue playing basketball , even if he was the last substitute on the team . Fox played only one minute in his grade eight season but dedicated his summers to improving his play . He became a regular player in grade nine and earned a starting position in grade ten . In grade 12 , he won his high school 's athlete of the year award jointly with his best friend Doug Alward . 
 Though he was initially unsure if he wanted to go to university , Fox 's mother convinced him to enrol at Simon Fraser University , where he studied kinesiology as a stepping stone to becoming a physical education teacher . He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team , earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination . 
 On November 12 , 1976 , as Fox was driving to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam , he became distracted by nearby bridge construction , and crashed into the back of a pickup truck . While his car was left undriveable , Fox emerged with only a sore right knee . He again felt pain in December , but chose to ignore it until the end of basketball season . By March 1977 , the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital , where he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma , a form of cancer that often starts near the knees . Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease , though his doctors argued there was no connection . He was told that his leg had to be amputated , he would require chemotherapy treatment , and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50 percent chance of survival . Fox learned that two years before the figure would have been only 15 percent ; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research . 
 With the help of an artificial leg , Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation . He then progressed to playing golf with his father . Doctors were impressed with Fox 's positive outlook , stating it contributed to his rapid recovery . He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease . Fox ended his treatment with new purpose : he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life in a way that would help others find courage . 
 In the summer of 1977 , Rick Hansen , working with the Canadian Wheelchair Sports Association , invited Fox to try out for his wheelchair basketball team . Although he was undergoing chemotherapy treatments at the time , Fox 's energy impressed Hansen . Less than two months after learning how to play the sport , Fox was named a member of the team for the national championship in Edmonton . He won three national titles with the team , and was named an all @-@ star by the North American Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1980 . 
 = = Marathon of Hope = = 
 The night before his cancer surgery , Fox had been given an article about Dick Traum , the first amputee to complete the New York City Marathon . The article inspired him ; he embarked on a 14 @-@ month training program , telling his family he planned to compete in a marathon himself . In private , he devised a more extensive plan . His hospital experiences had made Fox angry at how little money was dedicated to cancer research . He intended to run the length of Canada in the hope of increasing cancer awareness , a goal he initially only divulged to his friend Douglas Alward . 
 Fox ran with an unusual gait , as he was required to hop @-@ step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step . He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises , blisters and intense pain . Fox found that after about 20 minutes of each run , he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier . 
 In August 1979 , Fox competed in a marathon in Prince George , British Columbia . He finished in last place , ten minutes behind his closest competitor , but his effort was met with tears and applause from the other participants . Following the marathon , he revealed his full plan to his family . His mother discouraged him , angering Fox , though she later came to support the project . She recalled , " He said , ' I thought you 'd be one of the first persons to believe in me . ' And I wasn 't . I was the first person who let him down " . Fox initially hoped to raise $ 1 million , then $ 10 million , but later sought to raise $ 1 for each of Canada 's 24 million people . 
 = = = Preparation = = = 
 On October 15 , 1979 , Fox sent a letter to the Canadian Cancer Society in which he announced his goal and appealed for funding . He stated that he would " conquer " his disability , and promised to complete his run , even if he had to " crawl every last mile " . Explaining why he wanted to raise money for research , Fox described his personal experience of cancer treatment : 
 I soon realized that that would only be half my quest , for as I went through the 16 months of the physically and emotionally draining ordeal of chemotherapy , I was rudely awakened by the feelings that surrounded and coursed through the cancer clinic . There were faces with the brave smiles , and the ones who had given up smiling . There were feelings of hopeful denial , and the feelings of despair . My quest would not be a selfish one . I could not leave knowing these faces and feelings would still exist , even though I would be set free from mine . Somewhere the hurting must stop .... and I was determined to take myself to the limit for this cause . 
 Fox made no promises that his efforts would lead to a cure for cancer , but he closed his letter with the statement : " We need your help . The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles . I am not a dreamer , and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer . I believe in miracles . I have to . " The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication , but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run . Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy – an enlarged heart – a condition commonly associated with athletes . Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced , though they did not consider his condition a significant concern . They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems . 
 A second letter was sent to several corporations seeking donations for a vehicle , running shoes and to cover the other costs of the run . Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg . He observed that while he was grateful to be alive following his cancer treatment , " I remember promising myself that , should I live , I would rise up to meet this new challenge [ of fundraising for cancer research ] face to face and prove myself worthy of life , something too many people take for granted . " The Ford Motor Company donated a camper van , while Imperial Oil contributed fuel , and Adidas his running shoes . Fox turned away any company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions as he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run . 
 = = = Trek across Canada = = = 
 The Marathon began on April 12 , 1980 , when Fox dipped his right leg in the Atlantic Ocean near St. John 's , Newfoundland , and filled two large bottles with ocean water . He intended to keep one as a souvenir and pour the other into the Pacific Ocean upon completing his journey at Victoria , British Columbia . Fox was supported on his run by Doug Alward , who drove the van and cooked meals . 
 Fox was met with gale force winds , heavy rain and a snowstorm in the first days of his run . He was initially disappointed with the reception he received , but was heartened upon arriving in Port aux Basques , Newfoundland , where the town 's 10 @,@ 000 residents presented him with a donation of over $ 10 @,@ 000 . Throughout the trip , Fox frequently expressed his anger and frustration to those he saw as impeding the run , and he fought regularly with Alward . By the time they reached Nova Scotia , they were barely on speaking terms , and it was arranged for Fox 's brother Darrell , then 17 , to join them as a buffer . Fox left the Maritimes on June 10 and faced new challenges entering Quebec due to his group 's inability to speak French and drivers who continually forced him off the road . Fox arrived in Montreal on June 22 , one @-@ third of the way through his 8 @,@ 000 @-@ kilometre ( 5 @,@ 000 mi ) journey , having collected over $ 200 @,@ 000 in donations . Around this time , Terry Fox 's run caught the attention of Isadore Sharp who was the founder and CEO of Four Seasons Hotel and Resorts – and who had lost a son to melanoma in 1978 just a year after Terry 's diagnosis . Sharp was intrigued by the story of a one @-@ legged kid " trying to do the impossible " and run across the country ; so he offered food and accommodation at his hotels en route . When Terry was discouraged because so few people were making donations , Sharp pledged $ 2 a mile [ to the run ] and persuaded close to 1 @,@ 000 other corporations to do the same . Sharp 's encouragement persuaded Terry to continue with the Marathon of Hope . Convinced by the Canadian Cancer Society that arriving in Ottawa for Canada Day would aid fundraising efforts , he remained in Montreal for a few extra days . 
 Fox crossed into Ontario at the town of Hawkesbury on the last Saturday in June . He was met by a brass band and thousands of residents who lined the streets to cheer him on , while the Ontario Provincial Police gave him an escort throughout the province . Despite the sweltering heat of summer , he continued to run 26 miles ( 42 km ) per day . On his arrival in Ottawa , Fox met Governor General Ed Schreyer and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and was the guest of honour at numerous sporting events in the city . In front of 16 @,@ 000 fans , he performed a ceremonial kickoff at a Canadian Football League game and was given a standing ovation . Fox 's journal reflected his growing excitement at the reception he had received as he began to understand how deeply moved Canadians were by his efforts . 
 On July 11 , a crowd of 10 @,@ 000 people met Fox in Toronto , where he was honoured in Nathan Phillips Square . As he ran to the square , he was joined on the road by many people , including National Hockey League star Darryl Sittler , who presented Fox with his 1980 All @-@ Star Game jersey . The Cancer Society estimated it collected $ 100 @,@ 000 in donations that day alone . As he continued through southern Ontario , he was met by Hockey Hall of Famer Bobby Orr who presented him with a cheque for $ 25 @,@ 000 . Fox considered meeting Orr the highlight of his journey . 
 As Fox 's fame grew , the Cancer Society scheduled him to attend more functions and give more speeches . Fox attempted to accommodate any request that he believed would raise money , no matter how far out of his way it took him . He bristled , however , at what he felt were media intrusions into his personal life , for example when the Toronto Star reported that he had gone on a date . Fox was left unsure whom he could trust in the media after negative articles began to emerge , including one by the Globe and Mail that characterized him as a " tyrannical brother " who verbally abused Darrell and claimed he was running because he held a grudge against a doctor who had misdiagnosed his condition , allegations he referred to as " trash " . 
 The physical demands of running a marathon every day took its toll on Fox 's body . Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken at the request of the Cancer Society , he refused to take a day off , even on his 22nd birthday . He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee . He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells . At one point , he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away . Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture , he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention , and was then relieved to learn it was tendonitis and could be treated with painkillers . Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups , and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health . 
 In spite of his immense recuperative capacity , Fox found that by late August he was exhausted before he began his day 's run . On September 1 , outside Thunder Bay , he was forced to stop briefly after he suffered an intense coughing fit and experienced pains in his chest . Unsure what to do , he resumed running as the crowds along the highway shouted out their encouragement . A few miles later , short of breath and with continued chest pain , he asked Alward to drive him to a hospital . He feared immediately that he had run his last kilometer . The next day , Fox held a tearful press conference during which he announced that his cancer had returned and spread to his lungs . He was forced to end his run after 143 days and 5 @,@ 373 kilometres ( 3 @,@ 339 mi ) . Fox refused offers to complete the run in his stead , stating that he wanted to complete his marathon himself . 
 = = = National response = = = 
 Fox had raised $ 1 @.@ 7 million by the time he was forced to abandon the Marathon . He realized that the nation was about to see the consequences of the disease , and hoped that this might lead to greater generosity . A week after his run ended , the CTV Television Network organized a nationwide telethon in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society . Supported by Canadian and international celebrities , the five @-@ hour event raised $ 10 @.@ 5 million . Among the donations were $ 1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario , the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox 's name , and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation . Donations continued throughout the winter , and by the following April , over $ 23 million had been raised . 
 Supporters and well wishers from around the world inundated Fox with letters and tokens of support . At one point , he was receiving more mail than the rest of Port Coquitlam combined . Such was his fame that one letter addressed simply to " Terry Fox , Canada " was successfully delivered . 
 In September 1980 , he was invested in a special ceremony as a Companion of the Order of Canada ; he was the youngest person to be so honoured . The Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia named him to the Order of the Dogwood , the province 's highest award . Canada 's Sports Hall of Fame commissioned a permanent exhibit , and Fox was named the winner of the Lou Marsh Award for 1980 as the nation 's top athlete . He was named Canada 's 1980 Newsmaker of the Year . The Ottawa Citizen described the national response to his marathon as " one of the most powerful outpourings of emotion and generosity in Canada 's history " .

 In the following months , Fox received multiple chemotherapy treatments ; however , the disease continued to spread . As his condition worsened , Canadians hoped for a miracle and Pope John Paul II sent a telegram saying that he was praying for Fox . Doctors turned to experimental interferon treatments , though their effectiveness against <unk> sarcoma was unknown . He suffered an adverse reaction to his first treatment , but continued the program after a period of rest . 
 Fox was re @-@ admitted to the Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster on June 19 , 1981 , with chest congestion and developed pneumonia . He fell into a coma and died at 4 : 35 a.m. PDT on June 28 , 1981 , with his family by his side . The Government of Canada ordered flags across the country lowered to half mast , an unprecedented honour that was usually reserved for statesmen . Addressing the House of Commons , Trudeau said , " It occurs very rarely in the life of a nation that the courageous spirit of one person unites all people in the celebration of his life and in the mourning of his death ... We do not think of him as one who was defeated by misfortune but as one who inspired us with the example of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity " . 
 His funeral in Port Coquitlam was attended by 40 relatives and 200 guests , and broadcast on national television ; hundreds of communities across Canada also held memorial services , a public memorial service was held on Parliament Hill in Ottawa , and Canadians again overwhelmed Cancer Society offices with donations . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Fox remains a prominent figure in Canadian folklore . His determination united the nation ; people from all walks of life lent their support to his run and his memory inspires pride in all regions of the country . A 1999 national survey named him as Canada 's greatest hero , and he finished second to Tommy Douglas in the 2004 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program The Greatest Canadian . Fox 's heroic status has been attributed to his image as an ordinary person attempting a remarkable and inspirational feat . Others have argued that Fox 's greatness derives from his audacious vision , his determined pursuit of his goal , his ability to overcome challenges such as his lack of experience and the very loneliness of his venture . As Fox 's advocate on The Greatest Canadian , media personality Sook @-@ Yin Lee compared him to a classic hero , <unk> , the runner who delivered the news of the Battle of Marathon before dying , and asserted that Fox " embodies the most cherished Canadian values : compassion , commitment , perseverance " . She highlighted the juxtaposition between his celebrity , brought about by the unforgettable image he created , and his rejection of the trappings of that celebrity . Typically amongst Canadian icons , Fox is an unconventional hero , admired but not without flaws . An obituary in the Canadian Family Physician emphasized his humanity and noted that his anger – at his diagnosis , at press misrepresentations and at those he saw as encroaching on his independence – spoke against ascribing sainthood for Fox , and thus placed his achievements within the reach of all . 
 In September 2013 , Dr. Jay Wunder , a sarcoma specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital , Toronto , noted that survival rates for osteosarcoma have increased dramatically since Fox 's death . Most patient " get limb @-@ sparing or limb @-@ reconstructive surgery . Now the cure rate 's almost up to 80 per cent in younger patients . In older patients it 's more like 70 per cent . ... So that 's a pretty big turnaround in a couple of decades . " These advances in treatment might be partly attributable to the $ 650 million raised since Terry Fox started his Marathon of Hope . 
 = = = Attitudes to disability = = = 
 Fox expressed a robust attitude to his situation : he refused to regard himself as disabled , and would not allow anyone to pity him , telling a Toronto radio station that he found life more " rewarding and challenging " since he had lost his leg . His feat helped redefine Canadian views of disability and the inclusion of the disabled in society . Fox 's actions increased the visibility of people with disabilities , and in addition influenced the attitudes of those with disabilities , by showing them disability portrayed in a positive light . Rick Hansen commented that the run challenged society to focus on ability rather than disability . " What was perceived as a limitation became a great opportunity . People with disabilities started looking at things differently . They came away with huge pride " , he wrote . 
 In contrast , the narrative surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media 's focus on stereotyped portrayals of the heroic and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities , rather than more mundane accomplishments . Actor Alan Toy noted " Sure , it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement . But a lot of disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven 't done something extraordinary . They may be bankers or factory workers – proof enough of their usefulness to society . Do we have to be ' <unk> ' in order to be valid ? And if we 're not super , are we invalid ? " The media 's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability , in which the body is a machine to be mastered , rather than the social model of disability , where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled . 
 = = = Terry Fox Run = = = 
 One of Fox 's earliest supporters was Isadore Sharp , founder of the Four Seasons Hotels . Sharp had lost his own son to cancer and offered Fox and his companions free accommodation at his hotels . He donated $ 10 @,@ 000 and challenged 999 other businesses to do the same . Sharp also proposed an annual fundraising run in Fox 's name . Fox agreed , but insisted that the runs be non @-@ competitive . There were to be no winners or losers , and anyone who participated could run , walk or ride . Sharp faced opposition to the project . The Cancer Society feared that a fall run would detract from its traditional April campaigns , while other charities believed that an additional fundraiser would leave less money for their causes . Sharp persisted , and he , the Four Seasons Hotels and the Fox family organized the first Terry Fox Run on September 13 , 1981 . 
 Over 300 @,@ 000 people took part and raised $ 3 @.@ 5 million in the first Terry Fox Run . Schools across Canada were urged to join the second run , held on September 19 , 1982 . School participation has continued since , evolving into the National School Run Day . The runs , which raised over $ 20 million in its first six years , grew into an international event as over one million people in 60 countries took part in 1999 , raising $ 15 million that year alone . By the Terry Fox Run 's 25th anniversary , more than three million people were taking part annually . Grants from the Terry Fox Foundation , which organizes the runs , have helped Canadian scientists make numerous advances in cancer research . The Terry Fox Run is the world 's largest one @-@ day fundraiser for cancer research , and over $ 600 million has been raised in his name . The 30th Terry Fox Run was held September 19 , 2010 .

 The physical memorials in Canada named after Fox include : 
 Approximately 32 roads and streets , including the Terry Fox Courage Highway near Thunder Bay , near where Fox ended his run and where a statue of him was erected as a monument ; 
 14 schools , including a new school in a suburb of Montreal that was renamed Terry Fox Elementary School shortly after he died , and the Port Coquitlam high school , from which he had graduated , which was renamed Terry Fox Secondary School on January 18 , 1986 ; 
 14 other buildings , including many athletic centres and the Terry Fox Research Institute in Vancouver ; 
 Seven statues , including the Terry Fox Monument in Ottawa , which was the genesis of The Path of Heroes , a federal government initiative that seeks to honour the people that shaped the nation ; 
 nine fitness trails ; 
 A previously unnamed mountain in the Canadian Rockies in the Selwyn range , which was named Mount Terry Fox by the government of British Columbia ; the area around it is now known as Mount Terry Fox Provincial Park ; 
 The Terry Fox Fountain of Hope was in 1982 installed on the grounds of Rideau Hall ; 
 The Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker CCGS Terry Fox , which was commissioned in 1983 ; and 
 In 2011 , a series of bronze sculptures of Fox in motion , designed by author Douglas Coupland and depicting Fox running toward the Pacific Ocean , was unveiled outside BC Place in downtown Vancouver . 
 In 2012 , Fox was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame in the Builder category in recognition of his public service in the name of research fundraising . 
 Shortly after his death , Fox was named the Newsmaker of the Year for 1981 , and Canada Post announced the production of a commemorative stamp in 1981 , bypassing its traditionally held position that stamps honouring people should not be created until ten years after their deaths . British rock star Rod Stewart was so moved by the Marathon of Hope that he was inspired to write and dedicate the song " Never Give Up on a Dream " – found on his 1981 album Tonight I 'm Yours – to Fox . Stewart also called his 1981 – 1982 tour of Canada the " Terry Fox Tour " . 
 The Terry Fox Hall of Fame was established in 1994 to recognize individuals that have made contributions that improved the quality of life of disabled people . The Terry Fox Laboratory research centre was established in Vancouver to conduct leading edge research into the causes and potential cures for cancer . 
 The Royal Canadian Mint produced a special dollar coin in 2005 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marathon of Hope . It was their first regular circulation coin to feature a Canadian . 
 In 2008 , Terry Fox was named a National Historic Person of Canada , a recognition given by the Canadian government to those persons who are considered to have played a nationally significant role in the history of the country . Fox 's designation was due to his status as an " enduring icon " , his personal qualities , and for the manner in which the Marathon of Hope had captivated the country and resonated deeply with Canadians . 
 Fox 's mother , Betty Fox , was one of eight people to carry the Olympic Flag into BC Place Stadium at the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . The games saw the Terry Fox Award bestowed on Olympic athletes who embodied Fox 's characteristics of determination and humility in the face of adversity . 
 Beginning in 2015 Manitoba designated the first Monday in August , formerly known as Civic Holiday , as Terry Fox Day . 
 = = = Films = = = 
 Fox 's story was dramatized in the 1983 biopic The Terry Fox Story . Produced by Home Box Office , the film aired as a television movie in the United States and had a theatrical run in Canada . The film starred amputee actor Eric Fryer and Robert Duvall , and was the first film made exclusively for pay television . The movie received mixed but generally positive reviews . However , it was criticized by Fox 's family over how it portrayed his temper . The Terry Fox Story was nominated for eight Genie Awards , and won five , including Best Picture and Best Actor . 
 A second movie , titled Terry , focused on the Marathon of Hope , was produced by the CTV Television Network in 2005 . Fox was portrayed by Shawn Ashmore . He is not an amputee ; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg . The film was endorsed by Fox 's family , and portrayed his attitude more positively than the first movie . Canadian National Basketball Association star Steve Nash , who himself was inspired by Fox when he was a child , directed a 2010 documentary Into the Wind , which aired on ESPN as part of its 30 for 30 series . 
 = = = Steve Fonyo and Rick Hansen = = = 
 Terry Fox was not the first person to attempt to run across Canada . Mark Kent crossed the country in 1974 as he raised money for the Canadian team at the 1976 Summer Olympics . While he lived , Fox refused to let anyone else complete the Marathon of Hope , having promised to finish it himself once he recovered . Steve Fonyo , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old who suffered from the same form of cancer and who also had a leg amputated , sought in 1984 to duplicate Fox 's run , calling his effort the " Journey for Lives " . After leaving St. John 's on March 31 , Fonyo reached the point where Fox was forced to end his marathon at the end of November , and completed the transcontinental run on May 29 , 1985 . The Journey for Lives raised over $ 13 million for cancer research . 
 Canadian Paralympic athlete Rick Hansen , who had recruited Fox to play on his wheelchair basketball team in 1977 , was similarly inspired by the Marathon of Hope . Hansen , who first considered circumnavigating the globe in his wheelchair in 1974 , began the Man in Motion World Tour in 1985 with the goal of raising $ 10 million towards research into spinal cord injuries . As Fonyo had , Hansen paused at the spot Fox 's run ended to honour the late runner . Hansen completed his world tour in May 1987 after 792 days and 40 @,@ 073 kilometres ( 24 @,@ 900 mi ) ; he travelled through 34 countries and raised over $ 26 million . 
 = Council of Reims ( 1148 ) = 
 In 1148 , a Council of Reims was called by Pope Eugene III to consider a number of regulations , or canons , for the Church , as well as to debate some other issues . Originally the summons for the council went out in October 1147 and it was supposed to be held in Trier , which is now in Germany , but conditions in Trier were such that it was moved to Reims , in France , for February 1148 . A number of the summoned bishops and other church officials did not attend and Eugene suspended many of the non @-@ attendees , excepting the Italian ecclesiastics , who were excused . The council lasted 11 days , and convened on 21 March 1148 . From 400 to 1100 ecclesiastics are considered to have attended , although this number does not include the various servants and officials of the attendees , who would have swelled the numbers . 
 After the conclusion of the council , Eugene held a consistory trial of Gilbert of Poitiers , the Bishop of Poitiers , who was accused of heretical teachings . In the end , Gilbert was allowed to return to his bishopric . 
 = = Preliminaries and attendees = = 
 The council was first called on 11 October 1147 by Eugene , who ordered the bishops and others summoned to the council to assemble at Trier on 21 March 1148 . This is from a letter sent to Henry <unk> , the Bishop of <unk> by the pope . However , a letter sent by the pope on the next day , 12 October 1147 , to Eberhard , the Archbishop of Salzburg , named Troyes as the location for the council . It is likely that Troyes , however , was a scribal error , as a further letter of Eugene 's , to Suger , Abbot of St Denis , dated 6 October 1147 , named Trier as the location also , thus confirming the location given in the letter of 11 October . 
 The papal entourage arrived in Trier on 30 November 1147 , but shortly after arrival the pope decided to move the proceedings because of complaints from the residents of Trier , and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims , but still on the date given before . A feature of the council was that the pope ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials . Although some requested attendees were excused , it was mostly due to ill health , not to the need to see to the business of their offices . Those who did not attend were suspended from office . The Italian bishops , however , were mostly excused from attendance , as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced . 
 Although the number of Spanish bishops who attended is unknown , the Archbishop of Toledo , Raymund , did attend . King Alfonso VII of León and Castile interceded with the pope to lift the sentences against those bishops who did not attend . King Stephen of England refused permission for any of the English bishops to attend , except for the bishops of Hereford , Norwich and Chichester . It was the papal summons which caused the Archbishop of Canterbury , Theobald of Bec , to quarrel with his king , after Stephen refused the archbishop permission to go to the council . Theobald instead managed to evade the guards placed on him and hired a fishing boat to take him across the English Channel to attend the council . 
 The precise number of bishops , archbishops , and abbots who attended is unknown . Estimates range from 1 @,@ 100 to 400 , with the lower number being much more likely . The attendees were from what were later the countries of France , Germany , England , and Spain , and in keeping with the times , would have included not just the prelates who were summoned , but also their servants and officials , making the true number of people in Reims impossible to know . 
 = = Council = = 
 The opening of the council took place on 21 March 1148 at Reims Cathedral on a Sunday . Eugene and his attendants had arrived in Reims by 9 March . The main business of the council was the debate on a number of canons , or rules , for the church that would be announced . Most of these were not new decrees , having been promulgated by Eugene 's predecessor at the councils of Reims in 1131 and at the Lateran council of 1139 . All of the proposed canons were approved , except for one on clerical attire which was opposed by Rainald of Dassel and other German ecclesiastics . This canon had prohibited cloaks made of fur . Another canon condemning clerical marriage was greeted with amusement , as the council members felt that all clergy should already know that marriage was forbidden to them . 
 The Reims council also condemned and ordered the arrest of <unk> de l 'Étoile , a Breton heretic . He was eventually tortured into confession and imprisoned until his death in 1150 . Further decrees condemned the <unk> , supporters of an earlier antipope , who had previously been condemned in 1136 . Further side business was the settling of a dispute between two Norman abbots – <unk> of Jumieges Abbey and Robert of the Abbey of St. Vincent , Le Mans , which was handed to two cardinals to decide . The two prelates reached a decision on 5 April . Other disputes , including ones between abbots , were also handled at the council , although not necessarily during the council deliberations . Also included in the council 's business was the confirmation of the excommunication of the Bishop of Dol and the Bishop of <unk> . Although it was reported that the Bishop of Orleans and the Bishop of Troyes were deposed by the council , this is erroneous , and probably stemmed from the number of ecclesiastics who were suspended for non @-@ attendance . 
 A number of ecclesiastics died at or shortly after the council , including Robert de Bethune , the Bishop of Hereford , who fell ill on the third day of the council and died on either 14 or 16 April 1148 . The Bishop of <unk> died in June , after attending the council . The Archbishop of Trier , Albero de Montreuil , was so ill he was carried to the council on a horse litter . 
 The council is said to have lasted 11 days in total , but it is likely that it was shorter , given the large increase in the population of Reims , which would have strained the resources of the town . This gives an end date of the council of 1 April 1148 . 
 = = Consistory = = 
 Although the council probably ended on 1 April , Eugene asked a number of attendees to stay after the formal close of the council to consider the case of Gilbert of Poitiers , who was under investigation for heresy , connected with his teachings . The main concern against Gilbert seems to have been his convoluted vocabulary and style of writing , which led to his writings being easily misunderstood . The specific problem came when Gilbert 's writings attempted to explicate the relationship between God and his " divinity " , which led to his opponents claiming that Gilbert was attempting to create two Gods , rather than just one . His opponents claimed that this occurred in Gilbert 's treatise on Boethius ' theological work De Trinitate . 
 Gilbert had previously been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147 , but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons . One was that Gilbert 's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert 's teachings . The second reason was that no one had a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute . Prior to the second hearing at Reims , Bernard of Clairvaux , who was opposed to Gilbert 's teachings , held a private meeting with a number of the attendees , where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert . This offended the various cardinals in attendance , who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case . 
 Although connected with the council , Gilbert was tried after the council closed , at a consistory held in the Archbishop of Reims ' chambers . A consistory was a specialized form of trial held to investigate questionable theological teachings , and was beginning to be used for this purpose in this period . The consistory lasted two days , and included John of Salisbury , who had previously been a student of Gilbert 's , but was now in Eugene 's service . The trial likely took place on 2 – 3 April 1148 , as it lasted took two days , and most accounts state that it took place during the week before Palm Sunday , which was 4 April that year . As the consistory took place after the closing of the council on 1 April , that only allows 2 and 3 April for the trial . However , if the council closed earlier than 1 April , then the trial could have taken place on 29 – 30 March 1148 . In the end , no verdict of heresy was placed against Gilbert , who remained Bishop of Poitiers until his death in 1154 . 
 Besides Bernard , other ecclesiastics in opposition to Gilbert were Robert of Melun and Peter the Lombard . Robert was a teacher at both Paris and Melun , and later became Bishop of Hereford . Another opponent was Otto of Freising , who was unable to attend the trial . 
 No official records of the trial were kept , which led to considerable confusion in the future . 
 = Hurricane Helene ( 2006 ) = 
 Hurricane Helene was the ninth tropical storm , fourth hurricane , and strongest hurricane of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season . 
 Helene was a long @-@ lived Cape Verde @-@ type hurricane that formed in the extreme southeastern part of the North Atlantic Ocean , peaking as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale as it traversed the central Atlantic . It never affected land until the very end of its lifespan as a weak extratropical system , which had minor impact in the northern British Isles . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In the second week of September , a strong tropical wave began to emerge off the coast of Africa . It was well @-@ organized from the start , and on September 11 , even before it emerged off the coast , the National Hurricane Center believed that it could quickly develop into a tropical depression . That is indeed what happened , and it became Tropical Depression Eight on the morning of September 12 . The enormous size of the depression made it fairly slow to develop , combined with some easterly wind shear in the eastern Atlantic and influence of the Saharan Air Layer to the north as it tracked south of the Cape Verde islands . Convection was also slow to build in , with little banding at first . The initial strengthening was delayed as a result . However , on September 13 , the organization improved as banding became better defined , and that evening , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Helene . 
 The storm slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the eastern Atlantic thereafter as it tracked west @-@ northwest . Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer continued to slow development on September 14 as Helene remained a low @-@ end tropical storm . However , a bout of intensification took place on September 15 as shear diminished . The storm became much better organized with well @-@ defined banding , and leveled off that evening at just under hurricane intensity . On the morning of September 16 , the storm began to develop a ragged eye , and the storm strengthened to hurricane status . The intensity leveled off for a while as a marginal Category 1 hurricane , as the intensification was slowed by the presence of moderate wind shear despite the absence of significant dry air . Late that evening , the storm began to slowly intensify once again . 
 On September 17 , the intensification became more rapid and Helene quickly became a Category 2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deep convection . Helene also turned more northward and slowed down in the central Atlantic , which was in response to a weakness in the subtropical ridge farther north created by Gordon to the north . The northward turn shifted the course away from any land areas . The intensification continued through the afternoon , and that evening , Helene strengthened into a major hurricane with 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 962 mbar . As shear remained low and the oceans remained warm , Helene intensified slightly more , peaking as a solid Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) winds early on September 18 . At that time , Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same longitude in the open ocean . Operationally , Helene was estimated to have had 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) winds , but the post @-@ storm analysis downgraded it slightly . As Gordon moved eastward on the afternoon of 18th , a narrow ridge built in , forcing Helene westward . The eyewall collapsed somewhat , and Helene weakened slightly to a Category 2 hurricane , where it leveled off for about 48 hours until September 20 due to a lengthy eyewall replacement cycle and an elongated cloud pattern . On the 20th , Helene turned back to the northwest and weakened slightly due to a slight increase in wind shear . That afternoon , it was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane , which Helene remained until becoming extratropical . 
 Early on September 21 , the motion shifted to the north as it moved along the northwest periphery of the subtropical ridge . That general motion continued throughout the day , however , Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening along the edge of the subtropical ridge , east of Bermuda . A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81 ° F ( 27 ° C ) kept the intensity mostly stationary , keeping Helene as a Category 1 hurricane . The intensity held around 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) before strengthening slightly late on September 22 , despite losing some tropical characteristics ( it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period ) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic . A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high @-@ end Category 1 hurricane with 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) winds . 
 Helene transitioned into a " hybrid " storm with both tropical and extratropical characteristics that afternoon , with both a deep warm core and an asymmetric , frontal @-@ like appearance . After that , increased shear weakened Helene once again , although it remained a hurricane @-@ strength storm until it was fully extratropical on the morning of September 24 . After becoming extratropical , the storm weakened as it tracked eastward , becoming a gale center west of Ireland early on September 27 . It eventually merged with a larger extratropical low near the northern end of the British Isles late on the 27th . 
 = = Impact = = 
 While a tropical system , Helene never approached land . Three ships were caught in the outer bands of Helene ; the strongest of which reported 56 mph ( 91 km / h ) sustained winds early on September 23 in the north Atlantic . Though it remained far away from the island , the hurricane produced rough waves in Bermuda . As a weakened extratropical system , strong wind gusts were reported in Ireland and northern Scotland . The strongest reported wind gust in Ireland was at the Valentia Observatory , where 56 mph ( 91 km / h ) gusts were reported . In Scotland , the strongest gust was on South Uist Island in the Outer Hebrides , where 74 mph ( 118 km / h ) gusts were reported . No damage or fatalities were reported as a result of Helene .

 Leroy Arthur Petry ( born 29 July 1979 ) is a career United States Army soldier , now retired . He received the U.S. military 's highest decoration , the Medal of Honor , for his actions in Afghanistan in 2008 during Operation Enduring Freedom . 
 Born in Santa Fe , New Mexico , Petry had an active youth , and joined the Army after high school . Completing the Ranger Indoctrination Program , he was deployed several times to both Iraq and Afghanistan as a member of the 2nd Battalion , 75th Ranger Regiment . On 26 May 2008 during his seventh deployment , Petry was a member of a team on a mission to capture a Taliban target in Paktia Province . Despite being wounded in both legs by gunfire , Petry continued to fight and give orders . When a grenade landed between him and two other soldiers , Petry grabbed it and attempted to throw it away from them . He saved the soldiers ' lives but the grenade exploded , severing his right hand . 
 Petry became the second recent living recipient of the medal for the war in Afghanistan in 2011 when he received the award from U.S. President Barack Obama . Opting to reenlist in spite of his injury , Petry remained on active duty in the U.S. Army until his retirement on 29 July 2014 . As part of paying tribute to Missing in Action / Prisoners of War ( MIA / POW ) , Leroy completed a 10 @-@ day cross country Run For The Wall ( <unk> ) in May 2015 . That month he was also part of a four @-@ man ceremonial team to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery .

 Leroy Petry was born on 29 July 1979 , in Santa Fe , New Mexico , to Larry and Lorella ( Tapia ) Petry . He is the third of five sons , with older brothers Larry Armando and Lloyd , and younger brothers Lyndon and Lincoln . In his youth , he was described as very active and likable by his friends and family . Petry attended Santa Fe High School but was a poor student ; he repeated his freshman year . As a sophomore , he transferred to St. Catherine Indian School , a private school in Santa Fe , where his academic performance substantially improved . Growing up , Petry played football and basketball , and he also enjoyed fixing cars and cooking in his spare time . He graduated in 1998 ; his was the last class to graduate from St. Catherine before it closed . 
 He spent the next year studying at New Mexico Highlands University in Las Vegas , New Mexico . He also worked at the vehicle maintenance department of Pecos Public Transportation with his father and grandfather , and made signs at a local business , Al 's Signs .

 Influenced by a cousin who joined the U.S. Army Rangers , Petry enlisted in the Army in Santa Fe in September 1999 . He also became a Ranger . He attended Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training at Fort Benning , Georgia . At the time of the September 11th attacks , he was training to become a Ranger . 
 Upon completion of his training , Petry was assigned to 2nd Battalion , 75th Ranger Regiment based at Joint Base Lewis @-@ McChord , in Washington state . Petry had a total of eight deployments : two supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom and six supporting Operation Enduring Freedom . In all , Petry spent a total of 28 months deployed . During his time in Iraq and Afghanistan , Petry served in a number of positions , including as a grenadier , squad automatic rifleman , <unk> leader , squad leader , operations sergeant , and a weapons squad leader .

 On 26 May 2008 , Staff Sergeant Petry and his unit were on a mission in Paktia Province , Afghanistan . He was assigned to D Company , 2nd Battalion , 75th Ranger Regiment , which was on a daylight raid to capture a high @-@ value target from the Taliban . Petry was to locate with the platoon headquarters in the target building once it was secured . Once there , he was to serve as the senior non @-@ commissioned officer at the site for the remainder of the operation . The team of 70 Rangers encountered about 40 Taliban , 12 of them armed . Almost immediately after getting out of the helicopters that delivered the unit to the attack site , the Rangers came under strong fire . Petry provided additional supervision to an assaulting squad during the clearance of a building , and afterward he took Private First Class Lucas Robinson to clear an outer courtyard . 
 Three Taliban fighters were in the courtyard , which had a chicken coop within it . The Taliban fired on Petry and Robinson ; Petry was wounded by one round that went through both his legs , and Robinson was wounded , being hit on the armor plate protecting his side . Petry led Robinson to the cover of the chicken coop , and reported the contact and their wounded condition . Petry threw a thermobaric grenade from cover . At the chicken coop , the two men were joined by Sergeant Daniel Higgins , who assessed the wounds of the two soldiers . 
 A Taliban fighter threw a grenade at their position which landed 10 meters from them ; it detonated , and the blast knocked the three soldiers to the ground , wounding Higgins , and further wounding Robinson . Shortly thereafter the three were joined by Staff Sergeant James Roberts and Specialist Christopher Gathercole . A Taliban fighter threw another grenade , which landed a few feet from Higgins and <unk> the risk , Petry picked up and attempted to throw the grenade in the direction of the Taliban . Petry later recalled his immediate reaction was 
 " get it out of here , get it away from the guys and myself . And I reached over , leaned over to the right , grabbed it with my hand , and I threw it as hard as I could , what I thought was at the time . And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go , it just exploded instantly . And I came back , and the hand was completely severed off . " 
 The detonation amputated his right hand , and sprayed his body with shrapnel . Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death . 
 Petry placed a tourniquet on his right arm . Roberts began to fire at the Taliban fighters , suppressing them in the courtyard . An additional fighter on the east end of the courtyard fired , fatally wounding Gathercole . Higgins and Robinson returned fire , killing that fighter . They were joined by Sergeant First Class <unk> <unk> , the platoon sergeant , and Specialist Gary <unk> , a medic .
