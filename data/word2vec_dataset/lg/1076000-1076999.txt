 = HMS Illustrious ( 87 ) = 
 HMS Illustrious was the lead ship of her class of aircraft carriers built for the Royal Navy before World War II . Her first assignment after completion and working up was with the Mediterranean Fleet , in which her aircraft 's most notable achievement was sinking one Italian battleship and badly damaging two others during the Battle of Taranto in late 1940 . Two months later the carrier was crippled by German dive bombers and was repaired in the United States . After sustaining damage on the voyage home in late 1941 by a collision with her sister ship Formidable , Illustrious was sent to the Indian Ocean in early 1942 to support the invasion of Vichy French Madagascar ( Operation Ironclad ) . After returning home in early 1943 , the ship was given a lengthy refit and briefly assigned to the Home Fleet . She was transferred to Force H for the Battle of Salerno in mid @-@ 1943 and then rejoined the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean at the beginning of 1944 . Her aircraft attacked several targets in the Japanese @-@ occupied Dutch East Indies over the following year before Illustrious was transferred to the newly formed British Pacific Fleet ( BPF ) . The carrier participated in the early stages of the Battle of Okinawa until mechanical defects arising from accumulated battle damage became so severe that she was ordered home early for repairs in May 1945 . 
 The war ended while she was in the dockyard and the Admiralty decided to modify her for use as the Home Fleet 's trials and training carrier . In this role she conducted the deck @-@ landing trials for most of the British post @-@ war naval aircraft in the early 1950s . She was occasionally used to ferry troops and aircraft to and from foreign deployments as well as participating in exercises . In 1951 , she helped to transport troops to quell rioting in Cyprus after the collapse of the Anglo @-@ Egyptian treaty of 1936 . She was paid off in early 1955 and sold for scrap in late 1956 . 
 = = Background and description = = 
 The Royal Navy 's 1936 Naval Programme authorised the construction of two aircraft carriers . Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson , Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy , was determined not to simply modify the previous unarmoured Ark Royal design . He believed that carriers could not be successfully defended by their own aircraft without some form of early @-@ warning system . Lacking that , there was nothing to prevent land @-@ based aircraft from attacking them , especially in confined waters like the North Sea and Mediterranean . This meant that the ship had to be capable of remaining in action after sustaining damage and that her fragile aircraft had to be protected entirely from damage . The only way to do this was to completely armour the hangar in which the aircraft would shelter , but putting so much weight high in the ship allowed only a single @-@ storey hangar due to stability concerns . This halved the aircraft capacity compared with the older unarmoured carriers , exchanging offensive potential for defensive survivability . 
 Illustrious was 740 feet ( 225 @.@ 6 m ) in length overall and 710 feet ( 216 @.@ 4 m ) at the waterline . Her beam was 95 feet 9 inches ( 29 @.@ 2 m ) at the waterline and she had a draught of 28 feet 10 inches ( 8 @.@ 8 m ) at deep load . She displaced 23 @,@ 000 long tons ( 23 @,@ 369 t ) at standard load as completed . Her complement was approximately 1 @,@ 299 officers and enlisted men upon completion in 1940 . By 1944 , she was severely overcrowded with a total crew of 1 @,@ 997 . After post @-@ war modifications to convert her into a trials carrier , her complement was reduced to 1 @,@ 090 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship had three Parsons geared steam turbines , each driving one shaft , using steam supplied by six Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 111 @,@ 000 shp ( 83 @,@ 000 kW ) , enough to give a maximum speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) at deep load . On 24 May 1940 Illustrious ran her sea trials and her engines reached 113 @,@ 700 shp ( 84 @,@ 800 kW ) . Her exact speeds were not recorded as she had her paravanes streamed , but it was estimated that she could have made about 31 knots ( 57 km / h ; 36 mph ) under full power . She carried a maximum of 4 @,@ 850 long tons ( 4 @,@ 930 t ) of fuel oil which gave her a range of 10 @,@ 700 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 800 km ; 12 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) or 10 @,@ 400 nmi ( 19 @,@ 300 km ; 12 @,@ 000 mi ) at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) or 6 @,@ 300 nmi ( 11 @,@ 700 km ; 7 @,@ 200 mi ) at 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . 
 The 753 @-@ foot ( 229 @.@ 5 m ) armoured flight deck had a usable length of 620 feet ( 189 @.@ 0 m ) , due to prominent " round @-@ downs " at each end to reduce air turbulence , and a maximum width of 95 feet ( 29 @.@ 0 m ) . A single hydraulic aircraft catapult was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck . The ship was equipped with two unarmoured lifts on the centreline , each of which measured 45 by 22 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 by 6 @.@ 7 m ) . The hangar was 456 feet ( 139 @.@ 0 m ) long and had a maximum width of 62 feet ( 18 @.@ 9 m ) . It had a height of 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) which allowed storage of Lend @-@ Lease Vought F4U Corsair fighters once their wingtips were clipped . The hangar was designed to accommodate 36 aircraft , for which 50 @,@ 650 imperial gallons ( 230 @,@ 300 l ; 60 @,@ 830 US gal ) of aviation gasoline was provided . 
 = = = Armament , electronics and protection = = = 
 The main armament of the Illustrious class consisted of sixteen quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) dual @-@ purpose guns in eight twin @-@ gun turrets , four in sponsons on each side of the hull . The roofs of the gun turrets protruded above the level of the flight deck to allow them to fire across the deck at high elevations . The gun had a maximum range of 20 @,@ 760 yards ( 18 @,@ 980 m ) . Her light anti @-@ aircraft defences included six octuple mounts for QF 2 @-@ pounder ( " pom @-@ pom " ) anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns , two each fore and aft of the island and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull . The 2 @-@ pounder gun had a maximum range of 6 @,@ 800 yards ( 6 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 The completion of Illustrious was delayed two months to fit her with a Type <unk> early @-@ warning radar ; she was the first aircraft carrier in the world to be fitted with radar before completion . This version of the radar had separate transmitting and receiving antennas which required a new mainmast to be added to the aft end of the island to mount the transmitter . 
 The Illustrious @-@ class ships had a flight deck protected by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armour and the internal sides and ends of the hangars were 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick . The hangar deck itself was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick and extended the full width of the ship to meet the top of the 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch waterline armour belt . The belt was closed by 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads fore and aft . The underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid- and air @-@ filled compartments backed by a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 38 mm ) splinter bulkhead . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 While under repair in 1941 , Illustrious 's rear " round @-@ down " was flattened to increase the usable length of the flight deck to 670 feet ( 204 @.@ 2 m ) . This increased her aircraft complement to 41 aircraft by use of a permanent deck park . Her light AA armament was also augmented by the addition of 10 Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon in single mounts with a maximum range of 4 @,@ 800 yards ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) . In addition the two steel fire curtains in the hangar were replaced by asbestos ones . After her return to the UK later that year , her Type <unk> radar was replaced by a Type 281 system and a Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted on one of the main fire @-@ control directors . The additional crewmen , maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft , weapons and sensors increased her complement to 1 @,@ 326 . 
 During her 1943 refits , the flight deck was modified to extend its usable length to 740 feet ( 225 @.@ 6 m ) , and " outriggers " were probably added at this time . These were ' U ' -shaped beams that extended from the side of the flight deck into which aircraft <unk> were placed . The aircraft were pushed back until the main wheels were near the edge of the flight deck to allow more aircraft to be stored on the deck . Twin Oerlikon mounts replaced most of the single mounts . Other twin mounts were added so that by May she had a total of eighteen twin and two single mounts . The Type 281 radar was replaced by an upgraded Type <unk> , and a single @-@ antenna Type <unk> was added . Type 282 gunnery radars were added for each of the " pom @-@ pom " directors , and the rest of the main directors were fitted with Type 285 radars . A Type 272 target @-@ indicator radar was mounted above her bridge . These changes increased her aircraft capacity to 57 and caused her crew to grow to 1 @,@ 831 . 
 A year later , in preparation for her service against the Japanese in the Pacific , one starboard octuple " pom @-@ pom " mount , directly abaft the island , was replaced by two 40 mm Bofors AA guns ; which had a maximum range of 10 @,@ 750 yards ( 9 @,@ 830 m ) . Two more twin Oerlikon mounts were added , and her boilers were retubed . At this time her complement was 1 @,@ 997 officers and enlisted men . By 1945 , accumulated wear @-@ and @-@ tear as well as undiagnosed shock damage to Illustrious 's machinery caused severe vibrations in her centre propeller shaft at high speeds . In an effort to cure the problem , the propeller was removed , and the shaft was locked in place in February ; these radical measures succeeded in reducing , but not eliminating , the vibrations and reduced the ship 's speed to about 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . 
 = = = Post @-@ war modifications = = = 
 She was badly damaged underwater by a bomb in April 1945 , and was ordered home for repairs the following month . She began permanent repairs in June that were scheduled to last four months . The RN planned to fit her out as a flagship , remove her aft 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns in exchange for increased accommodation , and replace some of her Oerlikons with single two @-@ pounder AA guns , but the end of the war in August caused the RN to reassess its needs . In September , it decided that Illustrious would become the trials and training carrier for the Home Fleet and her repairs were changed into a lengthy refit that lasted until June 1946 . Her complement was sharply reduced by her change in role and she retained her aft 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns . Her light AA armament now consisted of six octuple " pom @-@ pom " mountings , eighteen single Oerlikons , and seventeen single and two twin Bofors mounts . The flight deck was extended forward , which increased her overall length to 748 feet 6 inches ( 228 @.@ 1 m ) . The high @-@ angle director atop the island was replaced with an American SM @-@ 1 fighter @-@ direction radar , a Type <unk> target @-@ indication system was added , and the Type <unk> was replaced with a prototype Type 960 early @-@ warning radar . The sum total of the changes since her commissioning increased her full @-@ load displacement by 2 @,@ 520 long tons ( 2 @,@ 560 t ) . In 1947 she carried five 8 @-@ barrel pom @-@ poms , 17 Bofors and 16 Oerlikons . A five @-@ bladed propeller was installed on her centre shaft although the increasing wear on her outer shafts later partially negated the reduction in vibration . While running trials in 1948 , after another refit , she reached a maximum speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) from 110 @,@ 680 shp ( 82 @,@ 530 kW ) . Two years later , she made 29 @.@ 2 knots from 111 @,@ 450 shp ( 83 @,@ 110 kW ) . At some point after 1948 , the ship 's light AA armament was reduced to two twin and nineteen single 40 mm guns and six Oerlikons . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Illustrious , the fourth ship of her name , was ordered as part of the 1936 Naval Programme from Vickers @-@ Armstrongs on 13 April 1937 . Construction was delayed by slow deliveries of her armour plates because the industry had been crippled by a lack of orders over the last 15 years as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty . As a consequence , her flight @-@ deck armour had to be ordered from Vítkovice Mining and Iron Corporation in Czechoslovakia . She was laid down at their Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness shipyard two weeks later as yard number 732 and launched on 5 April 1939 . She was christened by Lady Henderson , wife of the recently retired Third Sea Lord . Illustrious was then towed to Buccleuch Dock for fitting out and Captain Denis Boyd was appointed to command her on 29 January 1940 . She was commissioned on 16 April 1940 and , excluding her armament , she cost £ 2 @,@ 295 @,@ 000 to build . 
 While Illustrious was being moved in preparation for her acceptance trials on 24 April , the tugboat <unk> capsized with the loss of three crewmen . The carrier conducted preliminary flying trials in the Firth of Clyde with six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers that had been craned aboard earlier . In early June , she loaded the personnel from 806 , 815 , and 819 Squadrons at Devonport Royal Dockyard ; 806 Squadron was equipped with Blackburn Skua and Fairey Fulmar fighters , and the latter two squadrons were equipped with Swordfish . She began working up off Plymouth , but the German conquest of France made this too risky , and Illustrious sailed for Bermuda later in the month to continue working up . This was complete by 23 July , when she arrived in the Clyde and flew off her aircraft . The ship was docked in Clydeside for a minor refit the following day ; she arrived in Scapa Flow on 15 August , and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Lumley Lyster . Her squadrons flew back aboard , and she sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 August with 15 Fulmars and 18 Swordfish aboard . 
 After refuelling in Gibraltar , Illustrious and the battleship Valiant were escorted into the Mediterranean by Force H as part of Operation Hats , during which her Fulmars shot down five Italian bombers and her AA guns shot down two more . Now escorted by the bulk of the Mediterranean Fleet , eight of her Swordfish , together with some from the carrier Eagle , attacked the Italian seaplane base at Rhodes on the morning of 3 September . A few days after the Italian invasion of Egypt , Illustrious flew off 15 Swordfish during the moonlit night of 16 / 17 September to attack the port of Benghazi . Aircraft from 819 Squadron laid six mines in the harbour entrance while those from 815 Squadron sank the destroyer Borea and two freighters totalling 10 @,@ 192 gross register tons ( GRT ) . The destroyer <unk> later struck one of the mines and sank . During the return voyage to Alexandria , the Italian submarine Corallo made an unsuccessful attack on the British ships . While escorting a convoy to Malta on 29 September , the carrier 's Fulmars broke up attacks by Italian high @-@ level and torpedo bombers , shooting down one for the loss of one fighter . While returning from another convoy escort mission , the Swordfish of Illustrious and Eagle attacked the Italian airfield on the island of Leros on the evening of 13 / 14 October . 
 = = = Battle of Taranto = = = 
 Upon his arrival in the Mediterranean , Lyster proposed a carrier airstrike on the Italian fleet at its base in Taranto , as the Royal Navy had been planning since the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935 , and Admiral Andrew Cunningham , commander of the Mediterranean Fleet , approved the idea by 22 September . The attack , with both available carriers , was originally planned for 21 October , the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar , but a hangar fire aboard Illustrious on 18 October forced its postponement until 11 November when the next favourable phase of the moon occurred . The fire destroyed three Swordfish and heavily damaged two others , but they were replaced by aircraft from Eagle , whose contaminated fuel tanks prevented her from participating in the attack . 
 Repairs were completed before the end of the month , and she escorted a convoy to Greece , during which her Fulmars shot down one shadowing CANT <unk> floatplane . She sailed from Alexandria on 6 November , escorted by the battleships Warspite , Malaya , and Valiant , two light cruisers , and 13 destroyers , to provide air cover for another convoy to Malta . At this time her air group was reinforced by several of Eagles 's Gloster Sea Gladiators supplementing the fighters of 806 Squadron as well as torpedo bombers from 813 and 824 Squadrons . The former aircraft were carried " ... as a permanent deck park ... " and they shot down a CANT <unk> seaplane two days later . Later that day seven Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 medium bombers were intercepted by three Fulmars , which claimed to have shot down one bomber and damaged another . In reality , they heavily damaged three of the Italian aircraft . A <unk> searching for the fleet was shot down on 10 November by a Fulmar and another on the 11th . A flight of nine SM.79s was intercepted later that day and the Fulmars claimed to have damaged one of the bombers , although it actually failed to return to base . Three additional Fulmars had been flown aboard from Ark Royal a few days earlier , when both carriers were near Malta ; that brought its strength up to 15 Fulmars , 24 Swordfish , and two to four Sea Gladiators . Three Swordfish crashed shortly after take @-@ off on 10 and 11 November , probably due to fuel contamination , and the maintenance crewmen spent all day laboriously draining all of the fuel tanks and refilling them with clean petrol . This left only 21 aircraft available for the attack . 
 Now augmented by reinforcements from the UK , the Mediterranean Fleet detached Illustrious , four cruisers , and four destroyers to a point 170 miles ( 270 km ) south @-@ east of Taranto . The first wave of a dozen aircraft , all that the ship could launch at one time , flew off by 20 : 40 and the second wave of nine by 21 : 34 . Six aircraft in each airstrike were armed with torpedoes and the remainder with bombs or flares or both to supplement the three @-@ quarter moon . The Royal Air Force ( RAF ) had positioned a Short Sunderland flying boat off the harbour to search for any movement to or from the port and this was detected at 17 : 55 by acoustic locators and again at 20 : 40 , alerting the defenders . The noise of the on @-@ coming first airstrike was heard at 22 : 25 and the anti @-@ aircraft guns defending the port opened fire shortly afterward , as did those on the ships in the harbour . The torpedo @-@ carrying aircraft of the first wave scored one hit on the battleship Conte di Cavour and two on the recently completed battleship Littorio while the two flare droppers bombed the oil storage depot with little effect . The four aircraft loaded with bombs set one hangar in the seaplane base on fire and hit the destroyer <unk> with one bomb that failed to detonate . The destroyer Fulmine , or Conte di Cavour , shot down the aircraft that put a torpedo into the latter ship , but the remaining aircraft returned to Illustrious . 
 One torpedo @-@ carrying aircraft of the second wave was forced to return when its long @-@ range external fuel tank fell off , but the others hit Littorio once more and Caio Duilio was hit once when they attacked beginning at 23 : 55 . The two flare droppers also bombed the oil storage depot with minimal effect and one bomb penetrated through the hull of the heavy cruiser Trento without detonating . One torpedo bomber was shot down , but the other aircraft returned . A follow @-@ up airstrike was planned for the next night based on the pessimistic assessments of the aircrews , but it was cancelled due to bad weather . Reconnaissance photos taken by the RAF showed three battleships with their decks awash and surrounded by pools of oil . The two airstrikes had changed the balance of power in the Mediterranean by sinking Conte di Cavour and badly damaging Littorio and Caio Duilio . 
 = = = Subsequent operations in the Mediterranean = = = 
 While en route to Alexandria the ship 's Fulmars engaged four <unk> , claiming three shot down and the fourth damaged , although Italian records only indicate the loss of two aircraft on 12 November . Two weeks later , 15 Swordfish attacked Italian positions on Leros , losing one Swordfish . While off Malta two days later , six of the carrier 's fighters engaged an equal number of Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters , shooting down one and damaging two others . One Fulmar was lightly damaged during the battle . On the night of 16 / 17 December , 11 Swordfish bombed Rhodes and the island of Stampalia with little effect . Four days later Illustrious 's aircraft attacked two convoys near the <unk> Islands and sank two merchant ships totalling 7 @,@ 437 GRT . On the morning of 22 December , 13 Swordfish attacked Tripoli harbour , starting fires and hitting warehouses multiple times . The ship arrived back at Alexandria two days later . 
 On 7 January 1941 , Illustrious set sail to provide air cover for convoys to Piraeus , Greece and Malta as part of Operation Excess . For this operation , her fighters were reinforced by a detachment of three Fulmars from 805 Squadron . During the morning of 10 January , her Swordfish attacked an Italian convoy without significant effect . Later that morning three of the five Fulmars on Combat Air Patrol ( CAP ) engaged three SM.79s at low altitude , claiming one shot down . One Fulmar was damaged and forced to return to the carrier , while the other two exhausted their ammunition and fuel during the combat and landed at Hal Far airfield on Malta . The remaining pair engaged a pair of torpedo @-@ carrying SM.79s , damaging one badly enough that it crashed upon landing . They were low on ammunition and out of position , as they chased the Italian aircraft over 50 miles ( 80 km ) from Illustrious . The carrier launched four replacements at 12 : 35 , just when 24 – 36 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of the First Group / Dive Bomber Wing 1 ( I. Gruppe / Sturzkampfgeschwader ( StG ) 1 ) and the Second Group / Dive Bomber Wing 2 ( II . Gruppe / StG 2 ) began their attack , led by Paul @-@ Werner <unk> . Another pair were attempting to take off when the first 250 @-@ or @-@ 500 @-@ kilogram ( 550 or 1 @,@ 100 lb ) bomb struck just forward of the aft lift , destroying the Fulmar whose engine had failed to start and detonating high in the lift well ; the other aircraft took off and engaged the Stukas as they pulled out of their dive . 
 The ship was hit five more times in this attack , one of which penetrated the unarmoured aft lift and detonated beneath it , destroying it and the surrounding structure . One bomb struck and destroyed the starboard forward " pom @-@ pom " mount closest to the island , while another passed through the forwardmost port " pom @-@ pom " mount and failed to detonate , although it did start a fire . One bomb penetrated the outer edge of the forward port flight deck and detonated about 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the water , riddling the adjacent hull structure with holes which caused flooding in some compartments and starting a fire . The most damaging hit was a large bomb that penetrated through the deck armour forward of the aft lift and detonated 10 feet above the hangar deck . The explosion started a severe fire , destroyed the rear fire sprinkler system , bent the forward lift like a hoop and shredded the fire curtains into lethal splinters . It also blew a hole in the hangar deck , damaging areas three decks below . The Stukas also near @-@ missed Illustrious with two bombs , which caused minor damage and flooding . The multiple hits at the aft end of the carrier knocked out her steering gear , although it was soon repaired . 
 Another attack by 13 Stukas at 13 : 20 hit the ship once more in the aft lift well , which again knocked out her steering and reduced her speed to 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . This attack was intercepted by six of the ship 's Fulmars which had rearmed and refuelled ashore after they had dropped their bombs , but only two of the dive bombers were damaged before the Fulmars ran out of ammunition . The carrier , steering only by using her engines , was attacked several more times before she entered Grand Harbour 's breakwater at 21 : 04 , still on fire . The attacks killed 126 officers and enlisted men and wounded 91 . Nine Swordfish and five Fulmars were destroyed during the attack . One additional Swordfish , piloted by Lieutenant Charles Lamb , was attempting to land when the bombs began to strike and was forced to ditch when it ran out of fuel ; the crew was rescued by the destroyer Juno . The British fighters claimed to have shot down five Ju 87s , with the fleet 's anti @-@ aircraft fire claiming three others . Germans records show the loss of three Stukas , with another forced to make an emergency landing . 
 While her steering was being repaired in Malta , Illustrious was bombed again on 16 January by 17 Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers and 44 Stukas . The pilots of 806 Squadron claimed to have shot down two of the former and possibly damaged another pair , but a 500 kg bomb penetrated her flight deck aft of the rear lift and detonated in the captain 's day cabin ; several other bombs nearly hit the ship but only caused minor damage . Two days later , one of three Fulmars that intercepted an Axis air raid on the Maltese airfields was shot down with no survivors . Only one Fulmar was serviceable on 19 January , when the carrier was attacked several times and it was shot down . Illustrious was not struck during these attacks but was near @-@ missed several times and the resulting shock waves from their detonations dislodged enough hull plating to cause an immediate 5 @-@ degree list , cracked the cast @-@ iron foundations of her port turbine , and damaged other machinery . The naval historian J. D. Brown noted that " There is no doubt that the armoured deck saved her from destruction ; no other carrier took anything like this level of punishment and survived . " 
 Without aircraft aboard , she sailed to Alexandria on 23 January escorted by four destroyers , for temporary repairs that lasted until 10 March . Boyd was promoted to Rear Admiral on 18 February and relieved Lyster as Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers . He transferred his flag to Formidable when she arrived at Alexandria on 10 March , just before Illustrious sailed for Port Said to begin her transit of the Suez Canal . The Germans had laid mines in the canal earlier . Clearing the mines and the ships sunk by them was a slow process and Illustrious did not reach Suez Bay until 20 March . The ship then sailed for Durban , South Africa , to have the extent of her underwater damage assessed in the drydock there . She reached Durban on 4 April and remained there for two weeks . The ship ultimately arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard in the United States on 12 May for permanent repairs . 
 Some important modifications were made to her flight deck arrangements , including the installation of a new aft lift and modification of the catapult for use by American @-@ built aircraft . Her light anti @-@ aircraft armament was also augmented during the refit . Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten relieved her acting captain on 12 August , although he did not arrive aboard her until 28 August . He was almost immediately sent on a speaking tour to influence American public opinion , until he was recalled home in October and relieved by Captain A. G. Talbot on 1 October . The work was completed in November and Illustrious departed on 25 October , for trials off Jamaica and to load the dozen Swordfish of 810 and 829 Squadrons . She returned to Norfolk on 9 December , to rendezvous with Formidable , which had also been repaired there , and the carriers sailed for home three days later . On the night of 15 / 16 December , Illustrious collided with Formidable in a moderate storm . Neither ship was seriously damaged , but Illustrious had to reduce speed to shore up sprung bulkheads in the bow and conduct temporary repairs to the forward flight deck . She arrived at Greenock on 21 December and permanent repairs were made from 30 December to late February 1942 at <unk> Laird 's shipyard in Birkenhead . While working up her air group in March , reinforced by the Grumman Martlet fighters ( the British name of the F4F Wildcat ) of 881 and 882 Squadrons , she conducted trials of a " hooked " Supermarine Spitfire fighter , the prototype of the Seafire . 
 = = = In the Indian Ocean = = = 
 The conquest of British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies in early 1942 opened the door for Japanese advances into the Indian Ocean . The Vichy French @-@ controlled island of Madagascar stood astride the line of communication between India and the UK and the British were worried that the French would accede to occupation of the island as they had to the Japanese occupation of French Indochina in 1940 . Preventing this required a preemptive invasion of Diego Suarez scheduled for May 1942 . Illustrious had her work up cut short on 19 March to prepare to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and participate in the attack . She sailed four days later , escorting a troop convoy carrying some of the men allocated for the assault . A hangar fire broke out on 2 April that destroyed 11 aircraft and killed one crewman , but failed to cause any serious damage to the ship . Repairs were made in Freetown , Sierra Leone , and the convoy reached Durban on 22 April where her destroyed aircraft were replaced . 
 Illustrious 's aircraft were tasked to attack French naval units and shipping and to defend the invasion fleet , while her half @-@ sister Indomitable provided air support for the ground forces . For the operation the carrier 's air group numbered 20 Martlets , 1 night @-@ fighting Fulmar and 20 Swordfish . Before dawn on 5 May , she launched 18 Swordfish in three flights together with 8 Martlets . The first flight of six Swordfish , carrying torpedoes , unsuccessfully attacked the aviso D 'Entrecasteaux , but sank the armed merchant cruiser MS Bougainville . The second flight , carrying depth charges , sank the submarine Bévéziers while the third flight dropped leaflets over the defenders before attacking an artillery battery and D 'Entrecasteaux . One aircraft of the third flight was forced to make an emergency landing and its crew was captured by the French . Later in the day , D 'Entrecasteaux attempted to put to sea , but she was successfully bombed by a 829 Squadron Swordfish and deliberately run aground to avoid sinking . Three other Swordfish completed her destruction . The next morning , Martlets from 881 Squadron intercepted three Potez 63 @.@ 11 reconnaissance bombers , shooting down two and forcing the other to retreat , while Swordfish dropped dummy parachutists as a diversion . One patrolling Swordfish sank the submarine Le Héros and another spotted for ships bombarding French defences . On the morning of 7 May , Martlets from 881 Squadron intercepted three Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406 fighters on a reconnaissance mission . All three were shot down for the loss of one Martlet . In addition to the other losses enumerated , 882 Squadron 's Fulmar was shot down while providing ground support . 
 She was then formally assigned to the Eastern Fleet and , after a short refit in Durban , sailed to Colombo , Ceylon , and became the flagship of the Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers , Eastern Fleet , Denis Boyd , her former captain . At the beginning of August , the ship participated in Operation Stab , a decoy invasion of the Andaman Islands to distract the Japanese when the Americans were invading the island of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific . Captain Robert Cunliffe relieved Talbott on 22 August . On 10 September the carrier covered the amphibious landing that opened Operation Streamline Jane , the occupation of the remainder of Madagascar , and the landing at Tamatave eight days later , but no significant resistance was encountered and her aircraft were not needed . For this operation she had aboard 6 Fulmars of 806 Squadron , 12 Martlets of 881 Squadron and 18 Swordfish of 810 and 829 Squadrons .

 After a farewell visit from the Eastern Fleet commander , Admiral Sir James Somerville on 12 January 1943 , Illustrious sailed for home the next day . She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January and continued on to the Clyde where she arrived five days later . She conducted deck @-@ landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters , as well as the Fairey Barracuda dive / torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February . On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended , new radars were installed , her light anti @-@ aircraft armament was augmented , and two new arrestor wires were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area . While conducting her post @-@ refit trials , she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas . Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July , by which time Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet . 
 On 26 July , she sortied for the Norwegian Sea as part of Operation Governor , together with the battleship Anson , the American battleship Alabama , and the light carrier Unicorn , an attempt to fool the Germans into thinking that Sicily was not the only objective for an Allied invasion . 810 Squadron was the only unit retained from her previous air group and it had been re @-@ equipped with Barracudas during her refit . Her fighter complement was augmented by 878 and 890 Squadrons , each with 10 Martlet Vs , and 894 Squadron with 10 Seafire IICs . These latter aircraft lacked folding wings and could not fit on the lifts . The British ships were spotted by Blohm & Voss BV 138 flying boats and 890 Squadron shot down two of them before the fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 29 July . She transferred to Greenock at the end of the month and sailed on 5 August to provide air cover for the ocean liner RMS Queen Mary as she conveyed Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Quebec Conference . Once the convoy was out of range of German aircraft , Illustrious left the convoy and arrived back at Greenock on 8 August . 
 Together with Unicorn , she sailed for the Mediterranean on 13 August to prepare for the landings at Salerno ( Operation Avalanche ) , reaching Malta a week later . Her air group was reinforced at this time by four more Martlets each for 878 and 890 Squadrons . She was assigned to Force H for the operation which was tasked to protect the amphibious force from attack by the Italian Fleet and provide air cover for the carriers supporting the assault force . The Italians made no effort to attack the Allied forces and the most noteworthy thing that any of her aircraft did was when one of 890 Squadron 's Martlets escorted a surrendering Italian aircraft to Sicily . Before Illustrious sailed for Malta she transferred six Seafires to Unicorn to replace some of her aircraft wrecked in deck @-@ landing accidents . Four of these then flew ashore to conduct operations until they rejoined Illustrious on 14 September at Malta . 
 She then returned to Britain on 18 October for a quick refit at Birkenhead that included further improvements to the flight deck and the reinforcement of her light anti @-@ aircraft armament . She embarked the Barracudas of 810 and 847 Squadrons of No. 21 Naval Torpedo @-@ Bomber Reconnaissance Wing on 27 November before beginning her work up three days later . No. 15 Naval Fighter Wing with the Vought F4U Corsairs of 1830 and 1833 Squadrons were still training ashore and flew aboard before the work up was finished on 27 December . 
 = = = Return to the Indian Ocean = = = 
 Illustrious departed Britain on 30 December and arrived in Trincomalee , Ceylon , on 28 January 1944 . She spent most of the next several months training although she participated in several sorties with the Eastern Fleet searching for Japanese warships in the Bay of Bengal and near the coast of Sumatra . The fleet departed Trincomalee on 21 March to rendezvous with the American carrier Saratoga in preparation for combined operations against the Japanese facilities in the Dutch East Indies and the Andaman Islands . The first operation carried out by both carriers was an airstrike on the small naval base at Sabang at the northern tip of Sumatra ( Operation Cockpit ) . The carrier 's air group consisted of 21 Barracudas and 28 Corsairs for the operation ; Illustrious launched 17 of the former escorted by 13 of the latter on the morning of 19 April . The American bombers attacked the shipping in the harbour while the British aircraft attacked the shore installations . The oil storage tanks were destroyed and the port facilities badly damaged by the Barracudas . There was no aerial opposition and the fighters claimed to have destroyed 24 aircraft on the ground . All British aircraft returned safely although one American fighter was forced to ditch during the return home . 
 Saratoga was ordered to depart for home for a refit by 19 May and Somerville wanted to mount one more attack as she was leaving the Indian Ocean . He chose the naval base and oil refinery at Surabaya , Java ( Operation Transom ) , and the distance from the newly renamed East Indies Fleet 's base at Ceylon required refuelling at Exmouth Gulf on the western coast of Australia before the attack . The necessity to attack from the south , across the full width of Java , meant that the target was outside the Barracuda 's range and 810 and 847 Squadrons were replaced by the 18 Grumman TBF Avengers of 832 and 845 Squadrons for the mission . Early on the morning of 17 May , the ship launched all 18 Avengers , escorted by 16 Corsairs . One Avenger crashed on take @-@ off and an American Avenger was shot down over the target ; only one small ship was sunk , and little damage was done to the refinery . Saratoga and her escorts separated after refuelling again in Exmouth Gulf and the East Indies Fleet was back in Trincomalee on 27 May where No. 21 Wing re @-@ embarked . 
 On 10 June , Illustrious and the escort carrier Atheling put to sea to simulate another airstrike on Sabang as a means of distracting the Japanese while the Americans were attacking airfields in the Mariana Islands and preparing to invade the island of Saipan . For the planned attack on Port Blair in the Andaman Islands in mid @-@ June her air group was reinforced by the 14 Corsairs of 1837 Squadron ; 6 Barracudas from No. 21 <unk> Wing were landed to make room for the additional fighters . On 21 June , the ship launched 15 Barracudas and 23 Corsairs against the airfield and harbour of Port Blair . Two of the Barracudas were forced to return with engine trouble before the attack began and another was shot down over the target . In addition , one Corsair was forced to ditch ; the pilot was rescued by a destroyer . Bad weather degraded the accuracy of the Barracudas and little damage was inflicted aside from a few aircraft destroyed on the ground and a few small craft sunk in the harbour . With over 50 aircraft airborne at one point , the British realised that a single deck accident might result in the loss of every aircraft in the air because there was no other carrier available to land aboard . The carrier and her escorts arrived back at Trincomalee on 23 June where 847 Squadron was merged into 810 Squadron a week later . 
 Her sisters Indomitable and Victorious arrived at the end of June although only the latter 's pilots were combat @-@ ready . Captain Charles Lambe was appointed as the new captain of Illustrious on 21 May , but he could not join his new ship until 9 July . Somerville decided to attack Sabang again ( Operation Crimson ) , although the ships of the East Indies Fleet would bombard the port while the fighters from Illustrious and Victorious spotted for them and protected the fleet . As the Barracudas were only needed for anti @-@ submarine patrols , the former only embarked nine while the latter ship flew off all of her Barracudas . On the early morning of 25 July , Illustrious launched 22 Corsairs for CAP and to observe the naval gunfire and take photos for post @-@ attack damage assessments . The bombardment was very effective , sinking two small freighters , and severely damaging the oil storage and port facilities . One Corsair was shot down by Japanese flak although the pilot was rescued after ditching . As the fleet was withdrawing , Illustrious 's CAP intercepted and shot down a Nakajima Ki @-@ 43 ( codenamed " Oscar " ) fighter and a Mitsubishi Ki @-@ 21 " Sally " medium bomber on reconnaissance missions . Later in the day her Corsairs intercepted 10 Ki @-@ 43s and shot down two of them while driving off the remainder . After arriving in Trincomalee , 1837 Squadron was transferred to Victorious . 
 On 30 July , she sailed for Durban to begin a refit that lasted from 15 August to 10 October and arrived back at Trincomalee on 1 November . 810 Squadron and its Barracudas were transferred off the ship the next day and were later replaced by the Avengers of 854 Squadron . For the next six weeks she carried out an intensive flying regime in preparation for the next operations against the Japanese together with the other carriers of the fleet . On 22 November she was assigned to the newly formed British Pacific Fleet , commanded by Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser . She was assigned to the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron ( 1st ACS ) , commanded by Rear Admiral Sir Philip Vian when he arrived at Colombo aboard the carrier Indefatigable . A week later , Illustrious and Indomitable sortied to attack an oil refinery at <unk> Brandan , Sumatra ( Operation <unk> ) ; the former 's <unk> now consisted of 36 Corsairs of 1830 and 1833 Squadrons and 21 Avengers of 857 Squadron . When the aircraft approached the target on the morning of 20 December , it was obscured by clouds so they diverted to the secondary target of the port at <unk> Deli . It was partially obscured by clouds and heavy squalls so the attacking aircraft only had moderate success , setting some structures on fire and destroying several aircraft on the ground . 
 On 16 January 1945 the BPF sailed for its primary base in the Pacific Ocean , Sydney , Australia . En route , the carriers of the 1st ACS attacked Palembang on 24 January and 29 January ( Operation Meridian ) . Illustrious 's air group consisted of 32 Corsairs and 21 Avengers by now and she contributed 12 of her Avengers and 16 Corsairs to the first attack , which destroyed most of the oil storage tanks and cut the refinery 's output by half for three months . Five days later , the BPF attacked a different refinery and the ship launched 12 Avengers and 12 Corsairs . The attack was very successful at heavy cost ; between the two missions , her squadrons lost five Corsairs to enemy flak or fighters and one due to a mechanical problem on take @-@ off as well as three Avengers to enemy action . Her Corsairs claimed four enemy aircraft shot down as did one Avenger pilot who claimed victory over a Nakajima Ki @-@ 44 " Tojo " fighter . The fleet 's fire discipline was poor when it was attacked by seven Japanese bombers shortly after the strike aircraft began landing . The attackers were all shot down , but two shells fired by either Indomitable or the battleship King George V struck Illustrious , killing 12 and wounding 21 men .

 She arrived on 10 February and repairs began when she entered the Captain Cook Dock in the Garden Island Dockyard the next day , well before it was officially opened by the Duke of Gloucester , the Governor @-@ General of Australia on 24 March . By this time the vibration problems with her centre propeller shaft , which had never been properly repaired after she was bombed at Malta , were so bad that the propeller was removed and the shaft locked in place , reducing her maximum speed to 24 knots . On 6 March she sailed to the BPF 's advance base at Manus Island and , after her arrival a week later , Illustrious and her sisters Indomitable and Victorious , as well as the carrier Indefatigable , exercised together before sailing for Ulithi on 18 March . The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet there two days later , under the designation Task Force 57 ( TF 57 ) , to participate in the preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa ( Operation Iceberg ) . The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands , between Okinawa and Formosa , beginning on 26 March . Her air group now consisted of 36 Corsairs , 16 Avengers and two Supermarine Walrus flying boats for rescue work . 
 From 26 March to 9 April , the BPF attacked the airfields with each two @-@ day period of flying operations followed by two or three days required to replenish fuel , ammunition and other supplies . While the precise details on activities of the carrier 's squadrons are not readily available , it is known that the commanding officer of 854 Squadron was forced to ditch his Avenger on the morning of 27 March with the loss of both his crewmen ; he was ultimately rescued that evening by an American submarine . On the afternoon of 6 April , four kamikaze aircraft evaded detection and interception by the CAP , and one , a Yokosuka <unk> " Judy " dive bomber , attacked Illustrious in a steep dive . The light AA guns managed to sever its port wing so that it missed the ship , although its starboard wingtip shattered the Type 272 's radome mounted on the front of the bridge . When the 1 @,@ 000 @-@ kilogram ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) bomb that it was carrying detonated in the water only 50 feet ( 15 @.@ 2 m ) from the side of the ship , the resulting shock wave badly damaged two Corsairs parked on the deck and severely shook the ship . The initial damage assessment was that little harm had been done , although vibrations had worsened , but this was incorrect as the damage to the hull structure and plating proved to be extensive . Vice Admiral Sir Bernard Rawlings , commander of Task Force 57 , ordered the recently arrived Formidable to join the task force to replace Illustrious on 8 April . In the meantime , she continued to conduct operations with the rest of the fleet . On 12 and 13 April , the BPF switched targets to airfields in northern Formosa and her sister joined the task force on 14 April . Since the beginning of the operation , her aircraft had flown 234 offensive and 209 defensive sorties , claiming at least two aircraft shot down . Her own losses were two Avengers and three Corsairs lost in action and one Avenger and six Corsairs due to non @-@ combat causes . 
 Formidable 's arrival allowed Rawlings to order Illustrious to the advance base in San Pedro Bay , in the Philippines , for a more thorough inspection . She arrived on 16 April and the examination by divers revealed that some of her outer plating was split and that some transverse frames were cracked . The facilities there could only provide emergency repairs , enough to allow her to reach the bigger dockyard in Sydney . Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April for a more thorough replenishment period and Illustrious transferred aircraft , spares , stores , and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May . She arrived on 14 May and departed 10 days later , bound for Rosyth for permanent repairs . 854 Squadron was disembarked while at Sydney , but the carrier kept her two Corsair squadrons until after arriving in the UK on 27 June .

 On 31 July Captain W. D. Stephens relieved Lambe . The end of the war several weeks later meant that there was no longer any urgency in refitting Illustrious in time to participate in the invasion of the Japanese Home Islands and the Admiralty decided that she would become the Home Fleet training and trials carrier . Her catapult was upgraded to handle heavier aircraft , her flight deck was further improved , and her radar suite was modernized . She began her post @-@ refit trials on 24 June 1946 and flying trials the following month . She relieved Triumph as the trials carrier in August and conducted trials on Firefly <unk> , Firebrand <unk> , de Havilland Sea Mosquitoes and de Havilland Sea Vampires over the next several months . Captain Ralph Edwards relieved Stephens on 7 January 1947 . 
 On 1 February , she joined the other ships of the Home Fleet as they rendezvoused with the battleship Vanguard , which was serving as the royal yacht to escort King George VI as he set out for the first royal tour of South Africa . Over the next several months she conducted deck @-@ landing practice for Avenger and Seafire pilots before starting a short refit on 2 April . After the tour 's conclusion on 12 May , she sailed for Scottish waters for more deck @-@ landing practice with the destroyer Rocket as her <unk> . On 18 July she rendezvoused with the Home Fleet to participate in manoeuvres before George VI reviewed the fleet on 22 – 23 July . The King and Queen inspected Illustrious and her crew , as did Prime Minister Clement Attlee and his wife . Afterwards , she was opened for visits by the public before returning to Portsmouth . En route she served as the centrepiece of a convoy @-@ defence exercise as the RAF successfully " attacked " the convoy . After summer leave for her crew , she resumed deck @-@ landing trials in September and October , including the initial trials of the prototype Supermarine Attacker jet @-@ powered fighter in the latter month . In November the government accelerated the demobilisation of some National Servicemen and almost 2 @,@ 000 men serving in the Mediterranean became eligible for release . They had to be replaced by men from the UK so Illustrious ferried the replacements to Malta , sailing on 21 November and returning on 11 December to Portsmouth . 
 She was refitted and modernised from January to August 1948 . Captain John Hughes @-@ Hallett relieved Edwards on 14 June . The ship was recommissioned in early September . While at anchor in Portland Harbour on 17 October , one of her boats foundered 50 yards ( 46 m ) short of the ship in heavy weather ; 29 men lost their lives . Illustrious resumed her duties in early 1949 and conducted trials and training for Avengers , Fireflies , Gloster Meteors , de Havilland Sea Hornets , Vampires and Seafires . On 10 June Hughes @-@ Hallet was relieved by Captain Eric Clifford . During a severe gale in late October , the ship aided the small coastal steamer SS <unk> that had lost power . The weather was too bad for Illustrious to rescue the steamer 's crew , but she pumped oil overboard to flatten the seas until a tug arrived to rescue the ship on 27 October . On 2 May 1950 , she arrived at Birkenhead to commemorate the launch of the new carrier Ark Royal the following day with the First Lord of the Admiralty , George Henry Hall , 1st Viscount Hall , aboard . A Hawker Sea Fury crashed while landing on 15 May , killing the pilot and two members of the deck crew . The prototype of the turboprop @-@ powered Fairey Gannet anti @-@ submarine aircraft made its first carrier landing aboard on 16 June . This event was also the first ever landing of a turboprop aircraft aboard an aircraft carrier . 
 Captain S. H. <unk> assumed command on 24 June and Illustrious resumed deck @-@ landing training . On 8 and 9 November the Supermarine 510 research aircraft made the first ever landings by a swept @-@ wing aircraft aboard a carrier . This aircraft was one of the ancestors of the Supermarine Swift fighter . A month later the ship began a four @-@ month refit and hosted the first carrier landing of the de Havilland Sea Venom on 9 July 1951 . Later in the month she hosted the Sea Furies of 802 and the Fireflies of 814 Squadrons for Exercise Winged Fleet . Captain S. T. Jellicoe relieved <unk> on 27 August and the ship ferried 10 Fireflies of 814 Squadron to Malta beginning on 1 October . She exchanged them for Firebrands for the return voyage . On 3 November she began loading the 39th Infantry Brigade ( United Kingdom ) of the 3rd Infantry Division in response to the riots in Cyprus that broke out when Egypt abrogated the Anglo @-@ Egyptian treaty of 1936 . She set sail two days later and arrived at Famagusta on 11 November . She returned to Portsmouth on 19 November and began loading the 45th Field Regiment , Royal Artillery , the 1st Battalion , Coldstream Guards , and the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment two days later . Illustrious set sail on 23 November and reached Famagusta on 29 November . She returned to Portsmouth on 7 December and she did not leave harbour until 30 January 1952 when she resumed her customary role as a training ship . 
 After a brief refit in early 1952 , she participated in Exercise <unk> off the Scottish coast in June and hosted 22 @,@ 000 visitors during Navy Days at Devonport Royal Dockyard in August . On 1 September she hosted No. 4 Squadron and No. 860 Squadrons , Royal Netherlands Naval Aviation Service ( RNNAS ) for training , as well as 824 Squadron . Between the three squadrons they had 20 Fireflies and 8 Sea Furies when they participated in the major NATO exercise Main Brace later in the month . Jellicoe was relieved by Captain R. D. Watson on 26 September and Illustrious resumed training until 9 December when her crew was granted leave and the ship began a refit . She next put to sea on 24 April 1953 for trials and did not resume training pilots until the following month . She was reunited with the four other carriers that served with the BPF for the first time since the war for the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June at Spithead . The following day , the Fireflies of No. 4 Squadron , RNNAS and 824 Squadron landed aboard for more deck @-@ landing training . During September she participated in Exercise Mariner with three British squadrons of Fireflies and Sea Furies and a Dutch Squadron of Avengers . The ship resumed flying training off the north coast of Scotland in October for two weeks , but she spent most of the rest of the year on trials of the new mirror @-@ landing system that automated the process of landing aircraft aboard . Illustrious began her final maintenance period at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 10 December . Captain K. A. Short relieved Watson on 28 December . The refit was completed by the end of January 1954 and she resumed her normal role . The ship completed 1 @,@ 051 deck landings and steamed 4 @,@ 037 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 477 km ; 4 @,@ 646 mi ) by April . She made her first foreign port visit in many years at Le Havre , France , on 20 – 22 March , where 13 @,@ 000 people came aboard . After another round of flying operations , she visited Trondheim , Norway , on 19 June . During 12 days of training in September , she completed 950 daytime and nighttime arrested landings and 210 helicopter landings . She conducted her last landings on 3 December and arrived at Devonport four days later to begin decommissioning . Illustrious was paid off at the end of February 1955 and she was towed to Gareloch and placed in reserve . She was sold on 3 November 1956 and broken up in early 1957 .

 Bruce was born on September 14 , 1894 in St. Louis , Missouri to John Logan Bruce and Martha Washington Smith . His family moved to Texas when he was a child . After finishing high school Bruce attended the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas , now known as Texas A & M University , where he was required to be a member of the Corps of Cadets and undergo military training . In 1916 , Bruce earned a doctorate of laws from Texas A & M.

 Shortly after his graduation , the United States entered World War I. In June 1917 Bruce joined the United States Army as a second lieutenant . He served in the First Officers Training Camp at Leon Springs , Texas . After completing his training he was sent to combat in France as part of the 2nd Infantry Division 's 5th Machine Gun Battalion . He saw action in France in the <unk> Sector near Verdun , in the Aisne Defensive operation near Chateau Thierry , the Aisne @-@ Marne offensive at Soissons , the fighting at St. Mihiel , and the Meuse @-@ Argonne offensive at Blanc Mont . Following the fighting in France , he hiked with his division into Germany to be part of the occupation force . At the relatively young age of 24 he achieved the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel . The government of France awarded him the Legion of Honor , three Croix de guerre medals , and the <unk> . 
 He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1919 . The citation read , 
 The Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Andrew D. Bruce , Major , U.S. Army , for extraordinary heroism in action near <unk> , France , July 17 – 18 , 1918 , and near Blanc Mont October 3 – 4 , 1918 . On the night of July 17 – 18 , Major Bruce made a personal reconnaissance ahead of his troops through heavy flanking machine @-@ gun fire . He pushed forward to the outpost lines through heavy artillery and machine @-@ gun fire to keep in touch with all his company . On October 3 – 4 he made a personal reconnaissance on the left flank of his division through heavy shell fire and continual sniping and gained information which enabled him to well place his battalion and cover an exposed flank .

 In 1920 , Bruce married Roberta Linnell Kennedy . The couple made their home in Bryan , Texas , near Texas A & M , and Bruce taught military science and tactics at Allen Academy . They had three children . For the next two decades Bruce continued to serve in the Army . He served with the 33rd Infantry in Panama , participated in historical work at the Army War College and served on the War Department general staff revising textbooks on military doctrine . He also furthered his own knowledge of military tactics , attending the Infantry School , the Field Artillery School , the Command and General Staff College , the Army War College , and the Naval War College .

 Following the outbreak of World War II , Bruce was assigned to organize a new tank destroyer center . He chose Killeen , Texas for the new camp , and named it Fort Hood for General John Bell Hood . On September 9 , 1942 , he was promoted to major general . The following year he became commander of the 77th Infantry Division . Under his leadership the group participated in campaigns in Guam , Leyte , and Ryukyu . At Leyte , in the Philippines , the division was responsible for taking <unk> , the last main port the Japanese held on the island . During the ten @-@ day battle for that area of the island , from December 21 through December 31 , 1944 , the division estimated that they had killed 5 @,@ 779 Japanese soldiers and taken 29 prisoners , with only 17 Americans killed , 116 wounded , and 6 missing in action . For his service the government of the Philippines later awarded him the Philippine Legion of Honor , the Philippine Liberation Medal , and the Presidential Unit Citation . 
 In April 1945 , the 77th Division was ordered to seize the island of Ie Shima in the Ryukyu islands so that the US Army could use the island 's airfields to support assaults on Okinawa and other islands in Japan . During the six @-@ day battle to secure the island , 4 @,@ 706 Japanese soldiers and civilians were killed , while 172 Americans were killed , 902 were wounded , and 46 were missing . During the battle , famed war correspondent Ernie Pyle was killed by a sniper . Bruce and his men buried Pyle on the island , later erecting a monument to him . Despite the fact that the Japanese had tried to destroy the airfields , army engineers were able to have all taxiways and runways fully operational by mid @-@ May .

 After Japan surrendered , Bruce served as the military governor of Hokkaidō . In 1946 , he was transferred to be commander of the 7th Infantry Division which was occupying Korea . He returned to the U.S. in October 1947 , becoming deputy army commander of the Fourth Army stationed at Fort Sam Houston in Texas . His primary responsibilities were to assist with the training activities of the ROTC , National Guard and Organized Reserve Corps of five states . 
 Bruce became commandant of the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk , Virginia in early July 1951 and was promoted to lieutenant general on July 30 , 1951 . He retired from the army on July 31 , 1954 . Bruce 's decorations included the Distinguished Service Cross , Army Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster , Navy Distinguished Service Medal , Legion of Merit , the Bronze Star , an Air Medal and the Purple Heart . 
 = = University of Houston = = 
 Bruce became the third president of the University of Houston in Houston , Texas on September 1 , 1954 , one month after retiring from military service . He succeeded interim president C. F. McElhinney . Shortly after arriving , Bruce noted that the university was missing something which he considered fundamental — a chapel for student use located on campus . He remarked to the Director of Religious Activities that if you " [ e ] <unk> religion entirely from education ... you have no foundation upon which to build moral character . " 
 A year after he took office , Bruce began investigating whether there would be interest in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school . After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus , Bruce engineered a consensus that the university would build a center based on the model of the Armed Forces Base Chapel . The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all of the groups , and office space for each group . The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce . 
 In 1956 , Bruce was appointed the first chancellor of the university , in addition to his duties as president . The following year he organized a Board of Governors , consisting of the Board of Regents and other prominent Houstonians . In November 1959 this governing board sought state support for the university , which had grown rapidly under Bruce 's leadership . During Bruce 's tenure , the " University 's curriculum standards and faculty both improved and the University became better @-@ known . " He retired from chancellorship in 1961 .

In 1972 , the state of Texas erected a historical marker in his memory in Killeen at Fort Hood . In addition , Interstate 35 through Temple was named " General Bruce Drive " . 
 = 2001 – 02 South Pacific cyclone season = 
 The 2001 – 02 South Pacific cyclone season was a below @-@ average year in which only five named storms formed or entered the South Pacific basin . It began on November 1 , 2001 and ended on April 30 , 2002 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the southern Pacific Ocean east of 160 ° E. Additionally , the regional tropical cyclone operational plan defines a tropical cyclone year separately from a tropical cyclone season , and the " tropical cyclone year " runs from July 1 , 2001 to June 30 , 2002 . The season 's sixteen tropical depressions existed within these dates with the first developing on November 29 and the last dissipating on April 22 . 
 The South Pacific Basin , as defined by the World Meteorological Organization , is split into two sub @-@ areas , monitored by separate agencies . The first area is between 160 ° E and 120 ° W and north of 25 ° S are monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service ( FMS ) in Nadi . Those that move south of 25 ° S are monitored by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington , New Zealand . At the start of the season , a new naming policy was introduced by the Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South Pacific and South- East Indian Ocean . The policy stated that a storm attaining gale @-@ force winds in only one quadrant near its center would be named by the Fiji Meteorological Service . This is in contrast to the previous policy in which gale @-@ force winds had to completely surround the center to be named . 
 Throughout the season , a shift in the Hadley Circulation towards the Tasman Sea resulted in more frequent episodes of strong wind shear and regular pulses of dry air into the deep tropics , significantly hindering tropical cyclogenesis . The below @-@ average activity was also reflected in an unusually low number of damaging storms . Only two systems , Trina and Waka , had significant effects on land . The former caused extensive flooding on Mangaia while the latter was regarded as one of the most damaging storms in the history of Tonga . Approximately $ 51 @.@ 3 million in damage was attributed to Waka as well as an indirect fatality , the only tropical cyclone @-@ related death of the year , due to cardiac arrest . 
 = = Seasonal summary = = 
 During the 2001 – 02 South Pacific cyclone season , only five tropical cyclones and two severe tropical cyclones formed or entered the region . These numbers are substantially below the seasonal average of nine tropical cyclones and four to five severe tropical cyclones . This continued an inactive trend seen by several years prior ; however , it was slightly more active than the previous year . Throughout the season , an eastward shift in the Hadley Circulation led to an eastward displacement of the subtropical jet maximum , placing it near the Tasman Sea , similar to what takes place during an El Niño ( ENSO ) event . However , ENSO indexes were neutral during the season . This displacement of the subtropical jet resulted in the regular formation of strong mid @-@ level troughs across Australia and the South Pacific , leading to an abundance of moderate to strong wind shear . Additionally , these systems brought pulses of dry mid @-@ level air that moved as far north as 10 ° S. This was reflected by the below @-@ average monthly relative humidity values across the basin . Sea surface temperatures were also generally slightly below @-@ average through January 2002 and only slight warming took place during the remainder of the season . The development of cyclones during the season was mainly , aside from Trina , tied into Madden – Julian oscillation ( MJO ) phases . Trina developed prior to the arrival of the first MJO pulse which reached the basin in early December . This first pulse led to the development of several equatorial Rossby waves – the formations of Cyclones Vicky and Waka were related to these waves . The second pulse arrived in mid @-@ February and was associated with the development of Cyclones Claudia and Des .

 = = = Tropical Cyclone Trina = = = 
 The first tropical cyclone of the season , Trina formed upper @-@ level low pressure system on November 29 near the island of Rarotonga . Remaining nearly stationary , the storm meandered in the same general area for over a week . Due to unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis , the storm struggled to develop significant convection , preventing it from intensifying beyond 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . After finally succumbing to wind shear on December 2 , the system weakened to a tropical depression near Mangaia and dissipated several days later . 
 Due to the slow movement of the storm , it produced substantial rainfall over the island of Mangaia , resulting in some of the worst flooding in 50 years . Although no people were killed , nearly 60 % of the islands ' livestock died and 90 % of the staple crop was lost . Estimates from the Cook Islands National Disaster Management Council placed damage at $ 52 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Cyclone Waka = = = 
 Waka originated in a near @-@ equatorial trough of low pressure in mid @-@ December 2001 , although the system remained disorganized for more than a week . The storm gradually matured and attained tropical cyclone status on December 29 . Subsequently , Waka underwent rapid intensification in which it attained its peak intensity as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on December 31 , with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Shortly thereafter , it passed directly over Vava 'u , resulting in widespread damage . By January 1 , 2002 , the cyclone began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition . The remnants of Waka persisted for several more days and were last observed near the Southern Ocean on January 6 . 
 Throughout Waka 's path , several countries were impacted by the storm ; however , the most significant losses took place in Tonga . There , one person was killed and 104 @.@ 2 million paʻanga ( $ 51 @.@ 3 million USD ) was wrought in damage . Hundreds of structures were destroyed and much of the nation 's agriculture was destroyed . Winds in excess of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) battered Vava 'u , destroying 200 homes in the island 's largest city . In addition to infrastructural and public losses , the environment was also severely affected ; a native species of bats lost roughly 80 % of its population due to the lack of fruit . Following the storm , Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Vicky = = = 
 Forming out of the same initial disturbance as Cyclone Waka , Tropical Cyclone Vicky formed within a region of moderate wind shear , inhibiting substantial development . The storm was first classified by the FMS on December 22 over open waters . Situated to the south of an upper @-@ level ridge , the system tracked slowly towards the northeast and intensified , despite unfavorable conditions . Over the following two days , convection managed to persist along the northern edge of the system 's center of circulation and on December 24 , the FMS classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Vicky . At this time , Vicky was situated roughly 900 km ( 560 mi ) north @-@ northeast of Rarotonga . Shortly thereafter , wind shear increased in relation to an approaching trough , resulting in Vicky weakening to a tropical depression . Over the following several days , the depression drifted southward before entering the mid @-@ latitude westerlies and re @-@ intensifying into a strong extratropical cyclone well to the south of French Polynesia . 
 = = = Tropical Depression 05F = = = 
 On December 31 , the FMS began monitoring a new tropical depression , classified as 05F , roughly 600 km ( 375 mi ) east @-@ northeast of the Solomon Islands . A large system , similar to a monsoonal depression , 05F drifted southeastward for several days before turning towards the southwest . On January 1 , the system attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) and a pressure of 998 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 47 inHg ) . Despite having gale @-@ force winds , the system was not classified as a tropical cyclone since the winds were significantly displaced from the center of circulation . The JTWC determined the system had a good chance of developing into a tropical cyclone and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) ; however , this was later canceled as the depression failed to strengthen . By January 6 , the system crossed 160 ° E and entered the Australian Bureau of Meteorology 's area of responsibility . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Cyclone Claudia = = = 
 During the second phase of the MJO , a new low pressure system developed over the Coral Sea , on February 9 . Situated between two troughs over eastern Australia and the Tasman Sea , the system tracked towards the southeast and rapidly organized . The system was classified as Tropical Cyclone Claudia on February 11 and upgraded to a severe tropical cyclone less than 24 hours later . Later on February 12 , the system crossed 160 ° E , entering the South Pacific basin at peak intensity . Maximum winds were estimated at 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) and its minimum pressure was 965 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 49 inHg ) . A ragged eye was briefly seen on satellite imagery before Claudia moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures . The combined effects of its rapid forward speed and increased wind shear quickly weakened the system . By February 13 , Claudia had weakened to a non @-@ convective tropical depression . The remnants of the storm persisted for another day before being absorbed by a frontal system well to the south of Tonga . 
 = = = Tropical Depression 10F ( 16P ) = = = 
 On February 19 , a tropical disturbance developed to the north @-@ northeast of Fiji . Situated within a monsoon trough and on the edge of an anticyclone , convection associated with the disturbance was limited to the north and eastern sides . Over the following four days , a weak low @-@ level circulation gradually formed within a broad trough . By February 23 , deep convection began consolidating around the newly formed center in response to weak diffluence aloft and moderate wind shear . Later that day , the FMS began monitoring the low as Tropical Depression 10F . Still embedded within the monsoon trough , the JTWC issued a TCFA early on February 24 and their first advisory on Tropical Depression 16P roughly 12 hours later . Early on February 25 , the JTWC estimated the system to have become a tropical storm , with one @-@ minute sustained winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Although the FMS assessed the system to have had gale @-@ force winds , they did not upgrade the depression to a tropical cyclone since the strongest winds were well removed from the center . Shortly after reaching this intensity , wind shear displaced convection to the east of the cyclone and the storm weakened . Continued shearing of the system left the low @-@ level center fully exposed by February 26 and prompted the JTWC to issue their final warning on the depression . The weakening system was last noted later that day moving southward over open waters . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Des = = = 
 Following a pattern similar to the formation of Cyclone Claudia , Des formed out of an area of disturbed weather east of Australia in late February . The precursor system formed at the same time as the initial disturbance which developed into Typhoon Mitag in the northwestern Pacific . By March 4 , sufficient development had taken place to classify the system as a tropical depression and a tropical cyclone early the next day . During March 5 , Des underwent a brief period of rapid intensification , attaining its peak strength of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) with a minimum pressure of 985 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 09 inHg ) . Initially , the storm was forecast to impact New Caledonia ; however , a mid @-@ level ridge to the northeast forced the system to the southeast , sparing the island of a direct hit . Due to the storm 's proximity to the mountains of New Caledonia and less favorable environmental conditions , Des began to weaken on March 6 . The following day , the storm was devoid of convection , marking its degeneration into a remnant low pressure system . The remnants of Des were monitored for a few more days before they dissipated south of Fiji . 
 Since Des remained off the coast of New Caledonia , the storm 's strongest winds did not impact land ; however , weather stations along the coast measured winds of 75 to 95 km / h ( 47 to 59 mph ) . No damage was reported in relation to Cyclone Des . 
 = = = Tropical Depression 13F ( 19P ) = = = 
 Early on March 13 , a persistent area of convection , accompanied by a weak low @-@ level circulation , was noted roughly 520 km ( 325 mi ) west of Vanuatu . Situated underneath an upper @-@ level ridge , the system experienced weak to moderate shear and had a favorable outflow . Later that day , the FMS began monitoring the system as Tropical Depression 13F . Early on March 14 , the JTWC issued a TCFA and later their first advisory on Tropical Storm 19P as deep convection increased in coverage and organization around the low . The system tracked generally southeastward throughout its life in response to a low to mid @-@ level ridge to its north @-@ northeast . Both the FMS and JTWC estimated peak winds at 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) as passed close to New Caledonia . Although the system passed close to the island , there were no reports of damage . After brushing New Caledonia , the system passed south of the ridge and experienced stronger shear , displacing convection to the southeast . By March 16 , the system quickly weakened due to the combined effects of shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures . The system dissipated later that day well to the south of Fiji . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 In addition to the storms listed above , the FMS monitored several weak tropical depressions and a tropical disturbance throughout the season . On December 8 , Tropical Depression <unk> developed near Fiji . Tracking westward , the system attained a peak intensity of 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) with a minimum pressure of 1000 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 53 inHg ) before weakening took place . By December 10 , the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . Over the following several days , the remnants of the depression drifted southeastward and were last noted on December 15 to the southeast of Fiji . On January 15 , Tropical Depression 06F formed about 835 km ( 520 mi ) west @-@ northwest of Noumea , New Caledonia . Embedded within a monsoon trough , the system tracked generally eastward and attained peak winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . The strongest winds were located well to the south of the system in a peripheral band . By January 16 , the system began weakening as it interacted with a frontal system near New Caledonia before completely losing its identity later that day . On January 20 , a large tropical depression , designated <unk> , formed about 325 km ( 200 mi ) northwest of Fiji . A monsoonal system , the depression failed to organize a definite center and relocated several times throughout its existence . Between January 21 and 24 , gale warnings were issued in association with the cyclone due to a strong pressure gradient between it and an anticyclone to the south . Tracking generally southwestward , the system slowly deepened , attaining a minimum pressure of 997 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 44 inHg ) early on January 27 before the FMS discontinued advisories on the storm . 
 On February 17 , a tropical depression formed about 555 km ( 345 mi ) northeast of Fiji and tracked southward . A strong convergence east of the depression produced an area of 65 – 75 km / h ( 40 – 45 mph ) winds with gusts to 95 – 110 km / h ( 60 – 70 mph ) . The system was last noted on February 18 well to the southeast of Fiji . On February 26 , Tropical Disturbance 11F formed 695 km ( 430 mi ) north of Noumea , New Caledonia . A weak system , having winds no more than 30 km / h ( 15 mph ) , it remained nearly stationary for about a day before the FMS discontinued advisories on the disturbance . Tropical Depression 14F formed on March 20 about 120 km ( 75 mi ) southeast of Pago Pago , American Samoa . Initially the system was quasi @-@ stationary ; however , it was relocated the following day due to its broad size . The depression subsequently drifted west @-@ southwestward and was last noted on March 23 when it was located approximately 835 km ( 520 mi ) south @-@ southeast of Fiji . Throughout its existence , gale warnings were issued along the periphery of the system due to a pressure gradient between the cyclone and an area of high pressure northeast of New Zealand . On April 1 , Tropical Depression <unk> formed well to the northwest of New Caledonia . The depression drifted east @-@ southeast before dissipating the following day . The last cyclone of the season , Tropical Depression 16F , formed on April 17 about 595 km ( 370 mi ) north @-@ northeast of Port Vila , Vanuatu . After relocating substantially to the south , the depression moved slowly in the same general area for several days before dissipating on April 22 . For unknown reasons , the numbering for the 2001 – 02 season was used for the first system of the 2002 – 03 season , Tropical Depression 17F , which formed on July 3 . 
 In addition to the systems officially monitored by the FMS , a possible subtropical cyclone developed in late @-@ March . On March 21 , an area of low pressure developed approximately 465 km ( 290 mi ) northwest of French Polynesia . Aided by favorable diffluence aloft , deep convection developed over the center of the system , prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA on March 22 . However , several hours later , increasing wind shear displaced the convection from the center of circulation and redevelopment was deemed unlikely as the cyclone moved over cooler waters . 
 In Gary <unk> 's April 2002 monthly tropical cyclone summary , he noted a possible tropical cyclone over the southeast Pacific that displayed features of a tropical or subtropical cyclone . Operationally , the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington , New Zealand only issued gale warnings on the system as it was not assessed to have been tropical or subtropical . The system was later studied by Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy @-@ Pontoise University in France and is believed to have been a tropical storm . At the end of March , an upper @-@ level trough associated with a cold front developed over the southeast Pacific Ocean . By March 31 , a low @-@ level circulation had developed roughly 600 km ( 375 mi ) east of the Pitcairn Islands . Despite moderate wind shear , the system intensified and became a tropical depression early on April 1 . Owing to a subtropical ridge to the north , the depression tracked west @-@ southwestward into an area of decreased shear . Subsequently , the system was able to intensify into a tropical storm by the evening of April 2 . Though the storm remained shear , it quickly intensified throughout April 3 with convection remaining within half a degree of the center of circulation . During the evening hours , an eye @-@ like feature appeared on satellite imagery , and the system simultaneously was estimated to have reached its peak intensity as a strong tropical storm with one @-@ minute winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Hours later , dry air became entrained in the storm 's circulation and caused it to rapidly weaken to a tropical depression . By the afternoon of April 4 , the low had become fully exposed and the system was no longer classified a tropical cyclone .

 = Swiftsure @-@ class battleship = 
 The Swiftsure class was a group of two British pre @-@ dreadnought battleships . Originally ordered by Chile during a period of high tension with Argentina , they were intended to defeat a pair of armoured cruisers ordered by the latter country and were optimized for this role . This meant that they were smaller and more lightly armed than most battleships of the time . They were purchased by the United Kingdom in 1903 prior to their completion to prevent their purchase by the Russian Empire as tensions were rising between them and the Japanese Empire , a British ally . Completed the following year , Swiftsure and Triumph had roughly similar careers for the first decade of their service careers . They were initially assigned to the Home Fleet and Channel Fleets before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1909 . Both ships rejoined Home Fleet in 1912 and were transferred abroad in 1913 , Swiftsure to the East Indies Station as its flagship , and Triumph to the China Station . 
 After the beginning of World War I in August 1914 , Swiftsure escorted troop convoys in the Indian Ocean until she was transferred to the Suez Canal Patrol in December . After defending the Canal in early 1915 from Ottoman attacks , the ship was then transferred to the Dardanelles in February and saw action in the Dardanelles Campaign bombarding Ottoman fortifications . Triumph participated in the hunt for the German East Asia Squadron of Maximilian Graf von Spee and in the campaign against the German colony at Tsingtao , China . The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean in early 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign . She was torpedoed and sunk off Gaba Tepe by the German submarine U @-@ 21 on 25 May 1915 . 
 Swiftsure was assigned to convoy escort duties in the Atlantic from early 1916 until she was paid off in April 1917 to provide crews for anti @-@ submarine vessels . In mid @-@ 1918 , the ship was disarmed and stripped in order to be used as a blockship during a proposed second raid on Ostend . Swiftsure was sold for scrap in 1920 .

 In late 1901 , Chile and Argentina were on the brink of war , and Chile was concerned about its navy 's ability to counter the armoured cruisers Rivadavia and Moreno , which Argentina had ordered from Italy earlier that year . Sir Edward Reed , chief designer for Armstrong Whitworth , was in Chile for health reasons at the time , and met with Chilean Navy officials to discuss the idea of purchasing or building two battleships with high speed and a powerful armament on a low displacement . Purchase of existing ships was not a practical option , so the Chileans asked Reed to design the ships for construction in the United Kingdom . Chile ordered the ships , to be named Constitución and Libertad , in 1901 , Constitución from Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick and Libertad from Vickers at Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness . 
 The ships were considered second @-@ class battleships , lightly constructed , armed , and armoured by British standards ; Swiftsure , in fact , suffered from structural weakness while in service and required hull strengthening , although Triumph did not have such problems . Chile had required the ships to fit into the graving dock at Talcahuano , so they had to be longer and narrower for their displacement than ships built to British standards . Details in mast and anchor arrangements as well as the arrangement of magazines and shell @-@ handling rooms also were different from British standards . 
 As part of the Pacts of May , which ended the near @-@ war tensions between Argentina and Chile , Argentina sold its two armored cruisers , Rivadavia and Moreno , that were under construction in Italy to Japan . Constitución and Libertad were put up for sale in early 1903 . While the United Kingdom was not entirely interested in the ships , international politics took precedence : when the Russian Empire made an offer for the ships , the British grew concerned that the Swiftsure class could be used against their new ally Japan . To prevent this , the British purchased both Chilean battleships on 3 December 1903 for £ 2 @,@ 432 @,@ 000 . 
 Their purchase by the Admiralty was organised by the London firm of Antony Gibbs & Sons , a partnership run by Alban Gibbs and his younger brother Vicary Gibbs . Both were Members of Parliament ( MPs ) , and their role in the transaction meant that they were disqualified from the House of Commons , under an old law which debarred MPs from accepting contracts from the Crown . This triggered two by @-@ elections , in which Alban was re @-@ elected unopposed , but Vicary lost his seat . 
 Although they were designed to Chilean rather than British requirements and required some modifications during construction after their purchase , no major changes were needed to the design to render them suitable for British service . Both were completed in June 1904 and entered service with the Royal Navy , Constitución as Swiftsure and Libertad as HMS Triumph . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Swiftsure @-@ class ships had an overall length of 475 feet 3 inches ( 144 @.@ 9 m ) , a beam of 71 feet 1 inch ( 21 @.@ 7 m ) , and a draught of 28 feet 6 inches ( 8 @.@ 7 m ) at deep load . They displaced 12 @,@ 175 long tons ( 12 @,@ 370 t ) at normal load and 13 @,@ 840 long tons ( 14 @,@ 060 t ) at deep load . The ships were some 375 long tons ( 381 t ) overweight compared to their designed displacement which increased their draught and reduced their freeboard . 
 In 1914 , the crew numbered 803 officers and enlisted men . The Swiftsures were quite manoeuvrable as a result of their balanced rudder and a hull form optimized to make the rudder more effective . They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ships were powered by two four @-@ cylinder inverted vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller . A dozen Yarrow boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of 280 psi ( 1 @,@ 931 kPa ; 20 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines produced a total of 12 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 9 @,@ 300 kW ) which was intended to allow the ships to reach a speed of 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ; 22 @.@ 4 mph ) . The engines proved to be more powerful than anticipated and both ships exceeded 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) during sea trials . This made them the fastest battleships in the Royal Navy at the time of their completion , although their sustained speed in service was slightly slower than that of the older Duncan class . They carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 048 long tons ( 2 @,@ 081 t ) of coal , enough to steam 6 @,@ 210 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 500 km ; 7 @,@ 150 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . In service they proved to be more economical than first thought with an estimated range of 12 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 22 @,@ 000 km ; 14 @,@ 000 mi ) at 10 knots . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Neither ship 's armament was of a standard Royal Navy type — they had been designed to meet the requirements of the Chilean Navy and each ship was armed by its respective builder , although performance was identical . They were the first British battleships since the Renown to mount a main battery of 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns and the last to do so . The ships mounted slightly different types of 45 @-@ calibre 10 @-@ inch guns , each ship using guns designed by its builder . They followed the standard British practice of the time of mounting the main battery in two twin turrets , one forward and one aft . The Royal Navy believed that the 10 @-@ inch guns were too light to be effective against modern battleships ; they could penetrate the armour of the latest German and Russian battleships , but not that of the better @-@ armoured French battleships . The guns had minor differences in construction , but they both fired 500 @-@ pound ( 227 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 656 ft / s ( 810 m / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of 14 @,@ 800 yards ( 13 @,@ 500 m ) at the gun 's maximum elevation of 13 @.@ 5 ° . The firing cycle of the Mk VI guns used on Swiftsure was claimed to be 15 seconds while that of the Mk VII guns on Triumph was 20 – 25 seconds . Each gun was provided with 90 shells per gun . 
 They had a powerful secondary battery , being the only British battleships to mount 50 @-@ calibre 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns ; these were of a different type than the 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns mounted on later British cruisers . Ten of the guns were mounted in a central battery on the main deck , where they were criticized for taking up too much deck space ; the other four were in casemates abreast the fore- and mainmasts on the upper deck . A more serious problem was that they were mounted low in the ship — only about 10 feet ( 3 m ) above water at deep load — and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather as they dipped their muzzles in the sea when rolling more than 14 ° . The two types of guns differed slightly in construction , but had identical performance . They fired 200 @-@ pound ( 91 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 781 ft / s ( 848 m / s ) at a rate of four rounds per minutes . At their maximum elevation of 15 ° they had a maximum range of about 14 @,@ 000 yards ( 13 @,@ 000 m ) . The ships carried 150 rounds per gun . 
 Defence against torpedo boats was provided by fourteen QF ( quick @-@ firing ) 14 @-@ pounder Mk I or Mk II guns firing 14 @-@ pound ( 6 @.@ 4 kg ) shells , but the guns were modified to use the standard 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shell used by the QF 12 pounder 18 cwt gun in British service . They fired 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) , 12 @.@ 5 @-@ lb projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 548 ft / s ( 777 m / s ) . Their maximum range and rate of fire is unknown . 200 rounds per gun were carried by each ship . 
 The ships were also equipped with a pair of 18 @-@ inch ( 450 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes , one on each broadside . They were provided with nine torpedoes . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The Swiftsures ' armour scheme was roughly comparable to that of the Duncan class . The waterline main belt was composed of Krupp cemented armour ( KCA ) 7 inches ( 178 mm ) thick . It was 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) high of which 5 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) was below the waterline at normal load . Fore and aft of the 2 – 6 @-@ inch ( 51 – 152 mm ) oblique bulkheads that connected the belt armour to the barbettes , the belt continued , but was reduced in thickness . It was six inches thick abreast the barbettes , but was reduced to two inches fore and aft of the barbettes . It continued forward to the bow and supported the ship 's spur @-@ type ram . It continued aft to the steering gear compartment and terminated in 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) transverse bulkhead . The upper strake of 7 @-@ inch armour covered the ship 's side between the rear of the barbettes up to the level of the upper deck . The upper deck casemates were also protected by 7 @-@ inch faces and sides , but were enclosed by rear 3 @-@ inch plates . The 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns on the main deck were separated by 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) screens with .5 inches ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) plating protecting the funnel uptakes to their rear . A longitudinal 1 @-@ inch bulkhead divided the battery down its centreline . 
 The turret faces were 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick and their sides and rear were 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick . Their roofs were two inches thick and the sighting hood protecting the gunners was 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . Above the upper deck the barbettes were 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick on their faces and eight inches on the rear . Below this level they thinned to three and two inches respectively . The conning tower was protected by 11 inches ( 279 mm ) of armour on its face and eight inches on its rear . The deck armour inside the central citadel ranged from 1 to 1 @.@ 5 inches in thickness . Outside the citadel , the lower deck was three inches thick and sloped to meet the lower side of the belt armour . Naval historian R. A. Burt assessed the greatest weakness of their armour scheme as the reduction in the thickness of the barbette armour below the upper deck . He believed that this made the ships ' magazines vulnerable to oblique hits near the barbettes .

 Swiftsure was commissioned on 21 June 1904 for service in the Home Fleet and the Channel Fleet until 1908 . She collided with Triumph 3 June 1905 and suffered damage to her propellers , sternwalk and aft hull . The ship was refitted at Chatham Dockyard in June – July 1906 . Swiftsure was briefly placed in reserve from 7 October 1908 to 6 April 1909 when she was recommissioned for service with the Mediterranean Fleet . The ship was reassigned to Home Fleet on 8 May 1912 until she was given a lengthy refit from September 1912 to March 1913 . Swiftsure was recommissioned on 26 March and assigned as the flagship of the East Indies Station . 
 During World War I , the ship escorted Indian troops from Bombay to Aden from September – November 1914 . She was then transferred to the Suez Canal Patrol on 1 December to help defend the Canal . From 27 January to 4 February 1915 , the ship helped to defend the Canal during the First Suez Offensive by Ottoman forces . Swiftsure was then transferred to the Dardanelles on 28 February and saw action in the Dardanelles Campaign bombarding Ottoman fortifications . She was assigned to the 9th Cruiser Squadron for escort duties in the Atlantic in February 1916 . On 11 April 1917 , the ship arrived at Chatham where she was paid off and placed in reserve to provide crews for anti @-@ submarine vessels . Swiftsure was refitted in mid @-@ 1917 and was used as an accommodation ship from February 1918 . Later that year , the ship was disarmed and stripped in order to be used as a blockship during a proposed second raid on Ostend . The war ended , however , before this was carried out and she was briefly used as a target ship before she was listed for sale in March 1920 . Swiftsure was sold for scrap on 18 June 1920 to the Stanlee Shipbreaking Company . 
 Much like Swiftsure , Triumph was commissioned on 21 June 1904 and was initially assigned to the Home Fleet , later the Channel Fleet , until 1909 . On 17 September 1904 the ship was struck by SS Siren off Pembroke Dock and was only slightly damaged . The following year , she accidentally struck her sister ship and sustained damage to her bow . Triumph received a brief refit at Chatham Dockyard in October 1908 and was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet on 26 April 1909 . The ship returned to the Home Fleet in May 1912 . She was transferred to the China Station on 28 August 1913 and was placed in reserve at Hong Kong until mobilized in August 1914 at the beginning of World War I. 
 Triumph participated in the hunt for the East Asia Squadron and in the campaign against the German colony at Tsingtao , China until November when she began a refit at Hong Kong . The ship departed on 12 January 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign . She was torpedoed and sunk off Gaba Tepe by the German submarine U @-@ 21 while bombarding Ottoman fortifications in the Dardanelles on 25 May 1915 .

 The Northern Illinois University shooting was a school shooting that took place on February 14 , 2008 . Steven Kazmierczak shot multiple people on the campus of Northern Illinois University in DeKalb , Illinois , killing five people and injuring another twenty @-@ one , before committing suicide . 
 The incident happened at the campus 's Cole Hall at approximately 3 : 05 p.m. local time . The school placed the campus on lockdown ; students and teachers were advised to head to a secure location , take cover , and avoid the scene and all buildings in the vicinity of the area . Six people died in the incident , including the perpetrator , tying it with the University of Iowa shooting as the fifth @-@ deadliest university shooting in United States history . 
 After the incident , the university administration cancelled classes for the rest of the week as well as the following week . 
 = = Shooting = = 
 At approximately 3 : 05 p.m. CST , Steven Kazmierczak entered a large auditorium @-@ style lecture hall in Cole Hall ( Auditorium 101 ) with approximately 120 students , where an oceanography class was in session . Kazmierczak was wearing dark brown boots with laces , jeans , a black T @-@ shirt with the word " Terrorist " written across the chest imposed over an image of an assault rifle ; a coat ; a black knit hat ; and a black utility belt with two magazine holsters , a holster for a handgun , three handguns ( a 9 × 19mm Glock 19 , a .380 ACP SIG Sauer <unk> , and a .380 ACP Hi @-@ Point <unk> ) , eight loaded magazines , and a knife . He also carried in a 12 gauge Remington Sportsman 48 shotgun concealed in a guitar case . Once he armed himself , he went to the auditorium , where he entered at the extreme southwest corner of the room . This led directly to the stage in front of the classroom ; Kazmierczak used that position to fire into the crowd of students . He opened the door with such extreme force that many witnesses described him as " kicking the door in " . 
 He next shot at the instructor , who was standing on the east side of the stage . The instructor tried to run out the exit at the southeast corner but that door was locked . The instructor ran toward the east end of the classroom out the main exits , in which the students were trying to exit . Some students who were not able to immediately escape hid under or in between the seats . When <unk> paused to reload after firing three rounds , some students shouted " He 's reloading " and began to escape . Others continued to hide or were too shocked to react . 
 After shooting all six shotgun rounds , Kazmierczak fired on the room 's remaining occupants with the 9mm Glock pistol , firing a total of approximately 50 rounds . He was reported to have walked up and down the west aisle and directly in front of or on the stage , firing at people as he went . He shot and killed himself before police reached the room . The police recovered 55 un @-@ expended rounds of ammunition from the scene , including two fully loaded magazines containing rounds for a .380 semi @-@ automatic pistol . 
 A total of 25 people were shot , six of whom died ( including the perpetrator , who shot himself before police arrived ) . One witness reported that the gunman shot at least 30 rounds ; police later collected 48 shell casings and 6 shotgun shells . 
 At the time of the shootings , Kazmierczak was a graduate student in the school of social work at the University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign . He was a former NIU Sociology graduate student . NIU Police Chief Donald Grady described him as " an outstanding student , " who reportedly had stopped taking psychiatric medication recently and became " somewhat erratic " . 
 = = = Emergency response = = = 
 The first 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 call of an active shooter was reported at 3 : 06 p.m. Seven seconds later , NIU police officers were notified by the dispatcher . At 3 : 06 : 33 p.m. , NIU police officers Ayala and <unk> responded and told dispatchers that they were in the area . Driving northbound on Normal Road near <unk> Parson Hall , they encountered students running east from the Martin Luther King Commons area . One student shouted , " He 's shooting over there " , pointing west towards the MLK Commons area . Officer Hodder was also driving in the area and encountered the same frenzy . 
 The officers proceeded in their vehicles , then on foot , joining Chief Grady , Lieutenant Mitchell , and Lieutenant <unk> , who had reached the west side of the Commons area after coming directly from the Police Station . Also racing to Cole Hall from the Police Station were Sergeant Ellington and Officer Wright . Sergeant Holland was on patrol just south of the area along Lincoln Highway when he heard the call come in , and approached the area . In the MLK Commons , Chief Grady advised the officers to immediately begin attending to victims and identify witnesses and direct them to a room in Holmes Student Center , where they could be interviewed . Some of the officers began attending to injured students who were running from the scene . 
 While <unk> established perimeters around Cole Hall , Mitchell and Grady entered the building , where they met with Holland , Ellington , and Wright . Ellington , the first officer to arrive on the scene , evacuated the adjacent auditorium , and met with the other officers in the front walkway . Holland was instructed to remain in the hallway to ensure no one came into the auditorium and that the shooter did not come out . Grady , Mitchell , Ellington , and Wright entered the south auditorium , discovering a body on the stage , surrounded by guns , with a pool of blood coming from the head . Victims with varying injuries lay on the floor or were propped up against the seats . Confirming there were no immediate threats , Grady and Mitchell began attending to victims , while Ellington and Wright confirmed that the shooter was dead . At 3 : 11 : 42 ( five minutes after the first 911 call ) , Ellington reported to the dispatcher , " Shooter 's down . Shotgun 's secure . We need an ambulance and the coroner at Cole Hall . " 
 At the same time that officers arrived at Cole Hall , Sergeant Rodman , who had left a meeting at the Holmes Student Center , arrived at the west entrance of that building to find a shooting victim who had been shot in the back and the head , along with another victim who had blood on the face , seeking help for his injured friend . Rodman attended to the most severely wounded victim . 
 By 3 : 11 p.m. , a DeKalb Fire Department ambulance was the first to arrive on the scene and was staged in a nearby parking lot . The parking lots near the Field House were used as a staging area for ambulances and fire trucks that arrived from throughout the region . At 3 : 13 p.m. , Sergeant Ellington advised that there were at least two deaths . Officers encountered several problems , including a piercing fire alarm that had been pulled , as well as very high radio traffic and static that made it hard to hear radio calls come in . In addition , due to conflicting reports ( including the presence of a shooter at Founders Memorial Library ) and the multitude of injured victims at various buildings around campus , officers needed to check multiple sites to rule out the possibility of multiple shooters and multiple shooting sites . Injured victims began appearing at Neptune Hall ( just north of Cole Hall ) and at DuSable Hall ( west of Cole ) . At 3 : 21 p.m. , as personnel arrived from the DeKalb Fire Department , DeKalb County Sheriff 's Office , DeKalb Police Department , and Sycamore Police Department , officers advised that the scene and perimeter of Cole Hall were secure , and that it was safe for emergency personnel to proceed to the shooting site and to the sites of the injured victims . 
 At 3 : 34 p.m. , after a sweep of Founders Library was conducted and officers determined that Neptune and DuSable were not shooting sites , they declared the area safe . Police officers established a reception area for law enforcement personnel at Wirtz Hall , and an investigative command center at Holmes Student Center . By 4 : 00 pm CST , school officials announced that there was no further danger . They said that counselors would be made available in all residence halls .

 A total of 21 people survived the incident with injuries . 17 sustained gunshot or buckshot wounds , while three injured their knee or back escaping the scene ; one injury was undetermined . Of the injured , three remained in Cole Hall , five had fled to Neptune Hall or its parking lots , one to DuSable Hall , two to the Holmes Student Center Bookstore , two to the Holmes Student Center 's Sandburg Auditorium , three to the Health Services Building , and five returned home to seek treatment . 
 16 of the injured victims were transported to DeKalb 's Kishwaukee Community Hospital . Of the 16 , one of the wounded was transferred by helicopter to Rockford 's Saint Anthony Medical Center , three to Downers Grove 's Good Samaritan Hospital , and one to Rockford Memorial Hospital . 
 On February 15 , 2008 , an additional victim sought treatment at Kishwaukee Hospital , bringing the total of hospitalized injured victims to 17 . On February 15 , 2008 , seven of the victims were in critical condition , one in good condition , one in stable , and eight discharged , according to Kishwaukee Community Hospital . 
 Like those killed , all who were injured were from Illinois . Some of the injured include :

 Steven Phillip Kazmierczak ( August 26 , 1980 – February 14 , 2008 ) was born in Elk Grove Village , Illinois . He was a student at the University of Illinois at the time of the shooting and was a former student at Northern Illinois University . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 He graduated from Elk Grove High School in 1998 , during which he was treated temporarily for mental illness at the Elk Grove Village <unk> @-@ Mary Hill House psychiatric center , for being " unruly " at home , according to his parents Gail and Robert Kazmierczak . He later went on to study sociology at Northern Illinois University ( NIU ) . Though his family moved to Florida in 2004 , Kazmierczak continued his education in Illinois . He enlisted in the United States Army in September 2001 , and was discharged before completing basic training in February 2002 for lying on his application about his mental illness . His mother died in Lakeland , Florida in September 2006 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( also known as Lou Gehrig ’ s disease ) . At the time of Steven 's death , his father was living in a retirement community in Lakeland . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Kazmierczak graduated from NIU in 2006 where he received the Dean 's award in 2006 and was considered a stand @-@ out , well @-@ regarded student . Campus police describe him as a " fairly normal " and " unstressed person . " Faculty , students , and staff " revered " him and there was no indication of any trouble . NIU President John G. Peters said that he had " a very good academic record , no record of trouble . " Kazmierczak was Vice @-@ President of the NIU chapter of the American Correctional Association ; he had also written about the U.S. correctional system , specifically prisons . 
 In 2006 , Kazmierczak , along with two other graduate students and under the lead authorship of a sociology professor , co @-@ authored an academic paper entitled , " Self @-@ injury in Correctional Settings : ' Pathology ' of Prisons or of Prisoners ? " ; it was published in the academic journal Criminology & Public Policy . 
 He was enrolled at NIU in the spring of 2007 , where he took two courses in Arabic and a course called Politics of the Middle East . His research paper was on the subject of Hamas and its social service projects . He left to begin graduate work in the School of Social Work at the University of Illinois , where he intended to study mental health issues . He was enrolled part @-@ time at the University of Illinois during the fall of 2007 and worked from September 24 through October 10 at the Rockville Correctional Facility for Women near the Illinois – Indiana border . His reasons for leaving were unclear ; he simply , " did not come back to work , " according to Doug Garrison of the Indiana Department of Correction . By early 2008 , at the time of the shooting , he was again enrolled full @-@ time at the University of Illinois . 
 = = = Possible motives = = = 
 He died of a self @-@ inflicted gunshot wound after the shooting ended . ABC News reports that his behavior seemed to become more erratic in the weeks leading up to the shooting , and that it is believed he stopped taking medication beforehand . His girlfriend , Jessica Baty , confirmed that Kazmierczak was taking Xanax ( anti @-@ anxiety ) , Ambien ( sleep aid ) , and Prozac ( antidepressant ) , all of which were prescribed to him by a psychiatrist . She said that he stopped taking Prozac about three weeks prior to the February 14 shooting . She also said that , during their two @-@ year courtship , she had never seen him display violent tendencies and she expressed bewilderment over the cause of the rampage . " He was anything but a monster , " Baty said . " He was probably the nicest , most caring person ever . " 
 After the shooting , authorities intercepted a number of packages he sent to her , which included such items as a gun holster and ammunition , a textbook on serial killers for her class , the book The Antichrist by Friedrich Nietzsche , and a final note written for her , signed with his given name and family name . The shooting was baffling to those who knew him , as he appeared outgoing and never appeared to have social problems . This has also confused investigators , who have not found a suicide note . Some of Kazmierczak 's former NIU roommates described him as a quiet man who usually stayed to himself . They stated that , while fairly normal , they did not see him spend much time with other students . 
 Kazmierczak described himself as a sensitive person in his personal statement for the University of Illinois graduate school . He also felt victimized during his adolescent years . He expressed interest in helping people with mental problems , and wanted to work with people " in need of direction . " Although initial reports said there were no signs , he was considered troubled . A story published by Esquire stated that he allegedly had a history of mental illness and attempted suicides , was bullied in high school , and had shown an interest in previous school shootings , particularly those that occurred at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech . 
 According to a report published by the United States Fire Administration , Kazmierczak is believed to have studied Virginia Tech perpetrator Seung @-@ Hui Cho 's actions and used a similar modus operandi . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The university 's official website reported the possibility of a gunman on campus at 3 : 20 p.m. , within 20 minutes of the shooting . The website then warned students , " There has been a report of a possible gunman on campus . Get to a safe area and take precautions until given the all clear . Avoid the King Commons and all buildings in that vicinity . " By 3 : 40 p.m. , all NIU classes were canceled for the remainder of the day and the campus was closed by NIU officials as part of a new security plan devised after the Virginia Tech shootings 10 months earlier . Students were asked to contact their parents as soon as possible . 
 All NIU <unk> sporting events , home and away , through Sunday were canceled . Most students left campus for the weekend . A spokesman for the ATF stated that agents were dispatched to the scene to assist and to help trace the weapons used . The FBI also sent agents to assist . According to police , Steven Kazmierczak removed the hard drive from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help explain why he chose a geology class on Valentine 's Day to open fire . Investigators were expected to spend at least three more weeks until releasing a report on the incident .

 Approximately 2 @,@ 000 gathered on campus on the evening of Friday , February 15 , for a candlelight vigil to commemorate the victims ; among other public figures , Jesse Jackson and Robert W.

Faculty and staff returned to work on Tuesday , February 19 , and for the remainder of that week received special information and training to help students upon their return to classes the following week . 
 On February 21 , exactly a week after the shooting happened , five minutes of silence were observed from 3 : 06 @-@ 3 : 11 p.m. CST , accompanied by the tolling of bells throughout the community , at a special ceremony attended by thousands in memory of the victims which was held at the MLK Commons . Moments of silence were also held elsewhere throughout the DeKalb community . There was a special memorial service held in the NIU Convocation Center on February 24 , the day before classes resumed , in honor of the victims that initiated a set of activities and services aimed at community recovery . Due to the loss of one week of instructional time in the middle of the semester , an extra week was added in May .

 United States President George W.

 The Chicago Blackhawks NHL franchise wore NIU Huskies decals on their helmets during their game on Sunday , February 17 , 2008 , versus the Colorado Avalanche . A moment of silence was also observed before the national anthem at the game , and the team wore the same decal during its next two games at the St. Louis Blues and at home against the Minnesota Wild . The Chicago Wolves of the AHL held an NIU night during which there was a moment of silence and NIU students were given the opportunity to participate during in game promotions . The Rockford <unk> , also of the AHL , wore their red jerseys on the following Friday and Saturday night during the team 's two home games at the Rockford MetroCentre , distributed red and black ribbons , had a 5 ' by 16 ' sign for people to sign , as well as encouraged fans to wear red to the game . 
 During spring training , Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén and general manager Ken Williams sported NIU caps in tribute to the victims . For their 2008 season , the Chicago Cubs flew an NIU flag over the grandstands in the out field . Virginia Tech had a tribute with students wearing shirts saying " Hokies for Huskies " . Students wore these shirts during their basketball game against Georgia Tech on February 23 , 2008 .

 After February 14 , 2008 , Cole Hall was closed to the public . Classes that were held in the building 's two large auditoriums were relocated . On February 25 , 2008 then @-@ Governor Rod Blagojevich and University President John G. Peters proposed the demolition of the current Cole Hall . The proposal came as a response to the " bad " memories of the students who have to attend classes in the building . The proposal would tear down Cole Hall , leave the Cole Hall site as a memorial site , and erect a new building called " Memorial Hall " nearby , at a cost of approximately $ 40 million . 
 However , due to mixed emotions on the decision , President Peters sent out a message to all NIU students via their student email accounts , soliciting comments from students and the extended NIU family . In addition , a committee was established to help reach a consensus on the future of Cole Hall . 
 On May 8 , 2008 it was announced that Cole Hall would be remodeled inside and out pending $ 7 @.@ 7 million in state funding . This decision was made based on conversations between Dr. Peters and members of the campus community as well as the results of an online survey taken by students and faculty . 
 On August 27 , 2009 , the NIU Board of Trustees approved a $ 9 @.@ 5 million budget on the Cole Hall renovation project , approximately $ 8 million of which will come from the aforementioned state funding , and the rest from student fees . The East auditorium , which was the scene of the incident , will no longer be used for classes , and a replacement lecture hall will be built elsewhere on campus . On January 27 , 2010 , Illinois Governor Pat Quinn came to the NIU campus to release the funds for the renovation of Cole Hall . 
 On January 14 , 2011 , the reconstruction at Cole Hall officially commenced . The building re @-@ opened on January 17 , 2012 . Cole Hall now houses the Anthropology Museum , which was housed in the Stevens Building previously .

The memorial area also features five red granite walls erected in a half @-@ circle pattern which read " Forward Together Forward Together Forward . " The phrase " Forward Together Forward " , borrowed from the university 's fight song , became a motto and theme used in the healing of the NIU community after the shooting .

 The campus was shut down on December 10 , 2007 , the first day during exam week , after graffiti was found on a restroom wall warning of a possible shooting . A university spokesman said that the warning , which was discovered December 10 , made reference to the Virginia Tech massacre , in which 32 people were killed , but it could not be immediately determined whether the threat was related to the shootings on February 14 , 2008 . The Chicago Sun @-@ Times reported at that time that an unknown person posted the graffiti in the Grant Towers D residence hall , which included a racial slur and the notation " What time ?

" However , NIU President John Peters stated that he did not believe that the December incident is connected to the February 14 shootings . 
 = The Boat Race 1862 = 
 The 19th Boat Race between crews from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge took place on the River Thames on 12 April 1862 . Oxford won by 10 lengths in a time of 24 minutes and 34 seconds , taking the overall record to 10 – 9 in Cambridge 's favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1861 race by sixteen lengths , with Cambridge leading overall with ten victories to Oxford 's eight . 
 Both University crews were <unk> from trials eights , with varied success . The Cambridge crew set a record time during practice , while Oxford " were in very rough condition " . Just one former Blues returned to the crew , instead of the four who had been expected . Morale was so low in the Dark Blue camp that it was suggested that they write to Cambridge claiming that they could not assemble a crew . The Oxford University Boat Club president and coach George Morrison refused this course of action and the race was set for 12 April 1862 . 
 The boats were built by J. and S. Salter of Oxford . The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in the March and December races ) and the 1852 race , while the starter was Edward Searle . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11 st 11 @.@ 375 lb ( 74 @.@ 8 kg ) , 12 @.@ 25 pounds ( 5 @.@ 6 kg ) per rower more than their Light Blue opposition . Poole and Hoare returned for the Oxford crew while Cambridge 's crew featured three returning Blues in Robert Fitzgerald , Henry Collings and George Richards . 
 = = Race = = 
 Weather conditions on the day of the race were described as " excessively cold " with " a smart breeze " although " the sun shone brilliantly . " Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge . The Light Blues took an early lead but Oxford were soon level with them by the time they passed the Star and Garter pub . With the steadier stroke , Oxford took the lead and were clear of Cambridge by Craven Cottage . They extended their lead further , to such an extent that even though the Light Blue cox Richards made a spurt at the Soap Works , his boat had been surrounded by the steamers , and overtaken by one . The disruption from steamers would become so severe that in the 1864 race , both boat club presidents threatened to postpone the race unless the steamers remained behind the two crews . 
 The Dark Blues held a three @-@ length advantage by the time they shot Hammersmith Bridge , and despite another spurt from Cambridge off Chiswick Eyot , the lead had extended to at least 100 yards ( 91 m ) by Barnes Bridge . Oxford won by 10 lengths in a time of 24 minutes 34 seconds . It was their third win in four years and secured Oxford 's ninth win in the event compared to Cambridge 's ten . Contemporary rower and author William MacMichael suggested : " Of these two crews it is scarcely necessary to say more than that if they did not reach the consummate excellence of some which we have been accustomed to look back upon as the highest standard of form and beauty , they were yet a good average specimen of University rowing .

 = Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen , BWV 11 = 
 Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen ( Laud to God in all his kingdoms ) , BWV 11 , known as the Ascension Oratorio ( <unk> ) , is an oratorio by Johann Sebastian Bach , marked by him as <unk> In Festo <unk> Xsti ( Oratorio for the feast of the Ascension of Christ ) , probably composed in 1735 for the service for Ascension and first performed on 19 May 1735 . 
 Bach had composed his Christmas Oratorio , based on the gospels of Luke and Matthew , in 1734 . He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725 . The text for the Ascension Oratorio , a compilation of several biblical sources , free poetry and chorales , was presumably written by Picander who had worked on the libretto for the Christmas Oratorio . It follows the story of the Ascension as told in Luke , Mark and the Acts of the Apostles . The oratorio is structured in eleven movements in two parts , taking about half an hour to perform . It is framed by extended choral movements , Part I is concluded by the fourth stanza of Johann Rist 's hymn " Du Lebensfürst , Herr Jesu Christ " in a four part setting . The closing chorale on the seventh stanza of Gottfried Wilhelm Sacer 's " Gott fähret auf gen Himmel " is set as a chorale fantasia . The work is richly scored for the feast day , exactly like the Christmas Oratorio for four vocal parts , three trumpets , timpani , two flauti traversi , two oboes , strings and continuo . While the recitatives and the first chorale were new compositions , Bach based the other choral movements and the two arias on parts of earlier cantatas . He used the model for the alto aria again much later for the Agnus Dei of his Mass in B minor . 
 = = History = = 
 Bach had composed his Christmas Oratorio , based on the gospels of Luke and Matthew , in 1734 , a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide . He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725 . The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio . The text for the Ascension Oratorio , a compilation of several biblical sources , free poetry and chorales , was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio , among others . It follows the story of the Ascension as told in Luke , Mark and the Acts of the Apostles . 
 The bible narration is compiled from multiple sources : the first recitative of the Evangelist ( movement 2 ) is from Luke 24 : 50 – 51 , the second ( 5 ) from Acts 1 : 9 and Mark 16 : 19 , the third ( 7 ) from Acts 1 : 10 – 11 , the last ( 9 ) from Luke 24 : <unk> , Acts 1 : 12 and Luke 24 : <unk> . The biblical words are narrated by the tenor as the Evangelist . In his third recitative two men are quoted , for this quotation tenor and bass both sing in an <unk> . 
 Part I , which tells of the Ascension , is concluded by the fourth stanza of Johann Rist 's hymn " Du Lebensfürst , Herr Jesu Christ " in a four part setting . Part II reflects the reaction of the disciples . The closing chorale on the seventh stanza of Gottfried Wilhelm Sacer 's " Gott fähret auf gen Himmel " is set as a chorale fantasia . While the music for the narration and the first chorale were new compositions in 1735 , Bach based the framing choral movements and the two arias on earlier compositions . He used the model for the alto aria again much later for the Agnus Dei of his Mass in B minor . 
 In the first complete edition of Bach 's works , the Bach @-@ Ausgabe of the Bach Gesellschaft , the work was included under the cantatas ( hence its low BWV number ) , and in the Bach Compendium it is numbered BC D 9 and included under oratorios . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 The oratorio spans eleven movements in two parts to be performed before and after the sermon , 1 – 6 before the sermon and 7 – 11 after the sermon . It takes about half an hour to perform . The title on the first page of the autograph reads : 
 " J.J. <unk> Festo <unk> <unk> à 4 Voci . 3 Trombe Tamburi 
 2 Travers . 2 Hautb . 2 Violini , Viola e <unk> di 
 Bach 
 " J.J. " is short for " Jesu <unk> " ( Jesus , help ) , a formula which Bach and others often wrote at the beginning of a sacred piece . The title in Latin translates to " Oratorio for the feast of the Ascension of Christ " , and the scoring in a mixture of French and Italian names the parts and instruments as four vocal parts , three trumpets ( Tr ) , timpani , two flauti traversi ( Ft ) , two oboes ( Ob ) , two violins ( Vn ) , viola ( Va ) and basso continuo ( Bc ) by Bach . The voices are soprano , alto , tenor and bass , forming a four @-@ part choir ( SATB ) . The work is festively scored , exactly like the Christmas Oratorio . 
 The structure shows symmetry around the central chorale . Expansive chorale movements using the complete orchestra frame the work . Both parts contain besides the bible narration ( rec . ) a reflective accompagnato recitative ( acc . ) and an aria with obbligato instruments . In the following table of the movements , the scoring is taken the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The timpani always play with the trumpets and are not mentioned . 
 = = Music = = 
 The Bach scholar Richard D. P. Jones compares the Christmas Oratorio and the Ascension Oratorio and arrives at similarities : 
 the festive opening chorus with trumpets and drums , the Evangelist 's secco recitatives , the intermediate four @-@ part chorale , the meditative <unk> , the semi @-@ dramatic treatment of biblical characters ( here the " two men in white " ) and the elaborate chorale @-@ finale . 
 The oratorio is similar especially to Part VI of the Christmas Oratorio which also begins with an extended opening chorus and a chorale fantasia as a conclusion .

 The festive opening chorus , Lobet Gott in seinen Reichen , is believed to be based on a movement from the lost secular cantata <unk> Tag , <unk> <unk> , BWV Anh . 18 . The movement has no fugue , but dance @-@ like elements and Lombard rhythm .

 Bach marks the first recitative of bible narration " <unk> nach dem ersten Chor " ( Recitative after the first chorus ) . It is sung by the Evangelista ( Evangelist ) , which Bach assigns to the tenor singing secco recitative . The action begins , Der Herr Jesus hub seine Hände auf ( The Lord Jesus lifted up His hands ) , with Jesus blessing the disciples and leaving them . 
 = = = 3 = = = 
 A reflecting recitative for bass , Ach , Jesu , ist dein Abschied ( Ah , Jesus , is Your departure ) , shows the situation of the disciples afraid that Jesus will leave them soon . Marked " Rec : col <unk> . " ( Recitative : with <unk> [ <unk> ] ) , it is accompanied by the flutes and continuo as a recitativo accompagnato .

 Deeper reflection is expressed in an aria , marked " Aria Violini <unk> e Alto " ( Aria Violins in unison and Alto ) . The singer requests Jesus to stay : Ach , bleibe doch , mein <unk> Leben ( Ah , just stay , my dearest Life ) . The music is based on a movement from the lost wedding cantata Auf , süß entzückende Gewalt , BWV Anh . 196 , written in 1725 on a libretto by Johann Christoph <unk> . 
 Bach used the model for the alto aria also for the Agnus Dei of his Mass in B minor .

 The first chorale , closing part 1 , is the fourth stanza of " Du Lebensfürst , Herr Jesu Christ " , written in 1641 by Johann Rist . The text Nun <unk> alles unter dir ( Now everything is subject to You ) imagines Jesus in heaven , with the angels and elements serving him . 
 It is composed as a four part setting , with the instruments playing colla parte : oboes and violin I enforce the chorale tune , the flutes an octave higher , violin II plays with the alto , viola with the tenor , and the continuo with the bass .

 The evangelist begins Part II , Und da sie ihm <unk> ( And as they watched ) , telling of two men in white gowns addressing the disciples . The two men are represented by tenor and bass in a duet .

 The evangelist ends the narration , Sie aber <unk> ihn an ( They however prayed to Him ) , telling of the disciples ' return from the mountain which is named the Mount of Olives .

 The soprano aria , Jesu , deine <unk> ( Jesus , Your merciful gaze ) , is also based on the wedding cantata Auf , süß entzückende Gewalt . It is one of the rare pieces in Bach 's music without basso continuo , with the two unison flutes , the oboe and the unison strings playing a trio , augmented to a quartet by the singer . The original words in the wedding cantata mentioned " <unk> " ( innocence ) . Brian Robins notes " the lightly translucent texture reflecting the text 's allusion to Christ leaving his body to ascend to Heaven " . Jones thinks that the setting without an earthly continuo represents the <unk> ( glances of Grace ) of the text . 
 = = = 11 = = = 
 The closing chorale , " Wenn soll es doch <unk> " ( When shall it happen " ) , is the seventh stanza of " Gott fähret auf gen Himmel " , written in 1697 by Gottfried Wilhelm Sacer . Set in the first person , it expresses the desire of the speaker for the " liebe Zeit " ( dear time ) when he sees the Saviour in his glory . Continuing saying " wir " ( we ) , he imagines to greet him and kiss him . 
 It is set as a chorale fantasia . The soprano sings the cantus firmus in long notes , on the melody of " Von Gott will ich nicht lassen " . Similar to the final chorale Nun <unk> ihr wohl <unk> of the Christmas Oratorio , the chorale tune in a church mode appears in the triumphant context of a different major key . The text expresses longing for the day of being united with Jesus in Heaven . The musicologist Julian Mincham interprets the mode of the tune as " the human state of waiting and hoping " , while the concerto represents the fulfillment . Mincham compares the writing to the opening chorale fantasias of the second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas , finding the composition for the lower voices " endlessly inventive , frequently related to the textual images " pointing out " the passionate and clinging representation of kissing the Saviour beneath the caressing flutes , in the penultimate phrase " .

 = University of Central Florida = 
 The University of Central Florida ( UCF ) is an American public research university in Orlando , Florida . It is the largest university in the United States by undergraduate enrollment , and the second largest by total enrollment . 
 Founded in 1963 , UCF opened to provide personnel to support the U.S. space program at the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida 's Space Coast . As its academic scope broadened , it was renamed from Florida Technological University to the University of Central Florida in 1978 . While initial enrollment was only 1 @,@ 948 students , enrollment today amounts to some 60 @,@ 821 students from 140 countries and all 50 states and Washington , D.C. The majority of the student population is located on the university 's main campus just 13 miles ( 21 km ) east @-@ northeast of downtown Orlando , and 55 miles ( 89 km ) southwest of Daytona Beach . 
 The university offers over 200 degrees through thirteen colleges and twelve satellite campuses in Central Florida . Since its founding , UCF has awarded almost 280 @,@ 000 degrees , including 50 @,@ 000 graduate and professional degrees , to over 240 @,@ 000 alumni worldwide . 
 UCF is a space @-@ grant university , and has made significant research contributions to engineering , optics , simulation , digital media , business administration , education , hospitality management , and the arts . Its official colors are black and gold , and the university logo is a Pegasus , which " symbolizes the university 's vision of limitless possibilities . " The university 's intercollegiate sports teams , commonly known as the " UCF Knights " and represented by mascot Knightro , compete in NCAA Division I and the American Athletic Conference . 
 As of 2016 , UCF ranks 91st among all public universities by U.S. News & World Report .

 = = = Founding = = = 
 Following President John F. Kennedy 's September 1962 speech , in which he described his goal of accomplishing a manned space flight to the moon by the end of the decade , the space program grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral . Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase access to higher education on the Space Coast . With the help of former State Senate President William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson , the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125 on June 10 , 1963 , which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida . The university was founded as a non @-@ segregated and coeducational university , with the mission of educating students for promising space @-@ age careers in engineering and other technological professions . 
 On January 24 , 1964 , the Board of Regents purchased 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 km2 ) of remote forest and pasture land along <unk> Trail ( SR 434 ) in northeast Orlando at the cost of $ 500 @,@ 000 as the site of the new university . Local residents donated another 227 acres ( 0 @.@ 92 km2 ) , and raised more than $ 1 million in funds to secure the land acquisition . In December 1965 , the Board of Regents appointed Charles Millican the first president of the new university . Millican with the consultation of a citizen advisory group , chose the name Florida Technological University , as well as co @-@ designed the school 's distinctive " Pegasus " seal . Millican is also responsible for the university 's slogan – " Reach for the Stars " – and for the two key principles of the school , " accent on excellence " and " accent on the individual . " Millican was also responsible for the university 's unique pedestrian oriented concentric circle campus layout , which was based on plans by Walt Disney and has become a model for other universities . Millican and then @-@ Governor Claude Kirk presided over FTU 's groundbreaking in March 1967 . Eighteen months after the groundbreaking , the inaugural classes were held in the school 's first academic building , the library on October 7 , 1968 . 1 @,@ 948 students were enrolled in fifty @-@ five degree programs within five colleges , and were led by 90 instructors , and aided 150 staff members during the university 's first year . FTU graduated its first class of 423 seniors on June 14 , 1970 , with astronaut and Orlando native John Young giving the commencement address . 
 Millican was also responsible for selecting the official colors of the university , and had a role in selecting its first mascot , the <unk> , a mix between an orange and an astronaut . The <unk> temporarily proved unpopular , so in 1969 the student newspaper – The Central Florida Future – encouraged mascot suggestions from students and faculty . The search for a replacement proved unsuccessful until 1970 , when Judy Hines , a night nurse , proposed " Vincent the Vulture . " He served as the university 's unofficial mascot for more than a year . In late 1971 , students voted and selected the " Knight of Pegasus " as the school 's official athletic mascot . After retiring as president in 1978 , Millican would identify his proudest moment leading the school as when President Richard Nixon delivered the university 's spring 1973 commencement address . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 Entering office in 1978 , the university 's second president , Dr. Trevor Colbourn , recognized the diversification and growth of UCF 's academic programs away from its strictly technological and scientific beginnings . As the university developed strong business , education , and liberal arts programs , Colbourn recognized the university 's name no longer recognized its mission . From its establishment the university was known as Florida Technological University , nicknamed Florida Tech , until December 1978 when Governor Reubin Askew signed legislation changing the school 's name to the University of Central Florida . 
 Colbourn established the university 's honors program , and started the university 's first satellite branch campus . In addition , Colbourn was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park , located adjacent to the UCF campus and founded in 1978 . The park serves as a major focus of simulation for space and defense @-@ related research . The park was one part of Colbourn 's plan to make UCF a world @-@ class partnership university . Among the university 's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy , and Colbourn led the push to found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986 . During his tenure , enrollment increased from 11 @,@ 000 in 1978 to over 18 @,@ 000 in 1989 . However , Colbourn 's most notable accomplishments as president were supporting the young university 's athletic programs . He was responsible for establishing the school 's football program in 1979 , which began an era of growth for the university . In April 1979 , UCF awarded its 15,000th degree . 
 = = = Hitt presidency = = = 
 In March 1992 , John C. Hitt became UCF 's fourth president , ushering in an era of unprecedented growth and prominence for the university . Once known mainly as a small commuter and technology school , in recent years UCF has undertaken an effort to increase its academic and research standings while also evolving into a more traditional research university . When Hitt took office , UCF 's enrollment was 20 @,@ 302 , and as of 2014 enrollment consists of 60 @,@ 821 students attending classes on twelve campuses spread across Central Florida . The university consists of thirteen colleges and employs more than 10 @,@ 150 faculty and staff . Under the direction of Hitt , UCF has raised admissions standards , increased research funding , built new facilities , and established notable partnerships with major research institutions . 
 Hitt 's efforts have resulted in not only an increase in the university 's academic profile , but also an on @-@ campus football stadium , new arena , more on @-@ campus housing , and the development of the UCF College of Medicine at Lake Nona . Until 1999 , the Knights were represented by a jouster from the Medieval Times dinner show located in nearby Kissimmee , Florida . That same year , Knightro was introduced at the staple homecoming event , " Spirit Splash . " 
 The past decade has seen enrollment increase by over forty percent at UCF , the acceptance rate for first time in college students falling from over 60 % to near 40 % in 2008 , and the doubling of expected annual expenses . Since 2000 , the university has awarded over 100 @,@ 000 degrees . UCF is currently the largest university in the nation by terms of undergraduate enrollment , the largest university in Florida , and in 2003 held the distinction of being the fastest @-@ growing university in the United States . During its Spring 2010 graduation ceremonies , The University of Central Florida awarded its <unk> degree , less than five years after awarding its <unk> diploma . 
 During its brief history , UCF has hosted numerous notable speakers . Among these are U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton , then Senator and current Vice President Joe Biden , Senators Bill Nelson , Marco Rubio , Mel Martinez , John Edwards , Florida Governors Jeb Bush , Charlie Crist , and First Lady Michelle Obama .

 = = = Main campus = = = 
 The University of Central Florida has a unique campus layout that has become a model for other universities , reminiscent of the plans by Walt Disney for his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow , or EPCOT . The campus was designed to be a pedestrian oriented campus , with a series of concentric circles . The outermost circle is Gemini Blvd , which is also the main road for vehicular traffic on campus . Inside of Gemini , there is Apollo Circle , Mercury Circle , and finally Pegasus Circle as the innermost circle . Pegasus Circle contains the student union , which is the center of the campus , with the John C. Hitt Library located directly to the south of it . All academic buildings are located inside of Gemini , with the circle divided up into pie @-@ shaped sections for each college . As there are very few roads inside of Gemini , many buildings ' loading docks are accessible only by sidewalks and thus receive most deliveries at night . The University of Central Florida campus is one of only two in the nation with a concentric circle design , the other being the University of California , Irvine . Newsweek has ranked UCF as having the 20th most beautiful university campus in the country . 
 Student housing is provided along the perimeter of the campus . Outside of Gemini , the campus is divided up into different themed sections . The northwest side of campus includes Greek communities , the north side contains Knights Plaza , an uptown style athletic village , the east side contains the Arboretum of the University of Central Florida , and the south side contains student recreation and wellness facilities . 
 Located directly south of the main campus is Central Florida Research Park , which is the seventh largest research park in the nation and the largest in Florida , housing over 116 corporations . The park provides more than 10 @,@ 000 jobs to over 500 students and thousands of alumni .

 Spirit Splash is a homecoming tradition at UCF , and is traditionally the only time during the year that students are allowed into the Reflecting Pond . It has been named the best college tradition in Florida by Florida Leader magazine , and among " The 20 Best College Traditions " by Business Insider . 
 Spirit Splash occurs the Friday before the Homecoming game , and serves as a pep rally where students descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit . Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then @-@ Student Body President Miguel <unk> was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit . Along with the thousands of students who attend , there are members of the community , local dignitaries , alumni , children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities . Knightro , the Marching Knights , cheerleaders , student athletes , and dancers all participate in the pep rally , usually followed by a concert . Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon 's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement . It was determined that the best way to protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself , after being drained , so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings . 
 One of the newest traditions on the UCF campus pertains to the Pegasus seal in the center of the main floor of the Student Union . From their first day on campus for orientation , new students are told to never walk on the Pegasus . As the tradition is told , those who step on the seal will never graduate from UCF .

 " Not Like the Movies " is a song by American singer Katy Perry . The song was written by Perry for her third studio album , Teenage Dream ( 2010 ) , while production and additional writing was done by Greg Wells . It was released on August 3 , 2010 , by Capitol Records as the album 's first promotional single . The song is a power ballad from the point of view of a teenage girl . Lyrically , the girl contemplates her first time and how " it wasn 't right " . She realizes through that experience that her " prince " is still " out there " waiting for her . It was written when Perry first started dating her then @-@ husband , Russell Brand . 
 " Not Like the Movies " received positive reviews from music critics , some of whom called it a powerful and lovely song , as well a contemplative ballad , but noticed that the song 's lyrics make only minimal reference to Perry 's then @-@ husband , Russell Brand . " Not Like the Movies " achieved moderate success , peaking at number 53 on US Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number 41 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart . Perry performed the song on her California Dreams Tour ( 2011 ) . She also did a performance of the song along with " Teenage Dream " at the 53rd Grammy Awards on February 13 , 2011 .

 In an interview with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010 , Perry revealed that " Not Like the Movies " was the first song she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour ( 2009 ) . Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells , who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album , One of the Boys ( 2008 ) . Perry considers it to be like that of a two @-@ part song because she had started working on " Not Like the Movies " before she met Brand , and completed it after they began dating . She stated it is a " really special " song to her because , at the first part of the track , it is a story that she needed to let out , which was claiming to know something that you do not actually know . Perry later expressed relief at being able to put all of her feelings into " Not Like the Movies " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Not Like the Movies " is a power ballad that lasts for four minutes and one second . The song is composed in the key of A ♭ major and is set in time signature of common time , with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute . Perry 's vocal range spans over an octave , from F3 to E ♭ 5 . The song has a basic sequence of A ♭ 5 – Fm7 – Cm – E ♭ as its chord progression . Lyrically , " Not Like the Movies " is a song about a love relationship where a woman does not feel in love and still waits for the man of her dreams , or " charming prince " , as a Terra reviewer put it . 
 Chris Ryan from MTV News interpreted the song as largely being about how being in love does not meet your expectations and never really captures " the cinematic magic of big @-@ screen love stories . " 
 Steve Leftridge from PopMatters considered the track to have a " ho @-@ hum " melody . Its melody was compared to Britney Spears ' " Everytime " ( 2003 ) and Evanescence 's " My Immortal " ( 2003 ) . During the chorus , Perry sings about holding out for a love that is " cinematic and dramatic / With the perfect ending " and later asks if she is a " stupid girl " , according to Elysa Gardner from USA Today and an anonymous reviewer for Portrait Magazine . A reviewer for Portrait Magazine , considering it to be the slowest @-@ paced song on Teenage Dream , said it juxtaposed well with the other tracks . " It takes all the energy from the rest of the album , all the fast beating hearts and overwhelming feelings of love , and slows it all down to a song about looking for love instead , " they wrote .

 " Not Like the Movies " garnered critical acclaim . Chris Ryan of MTV said the song is " rather lovely " , but noted that its lyrics refer " very little " to Perry 's then @-@ husband , Russell Brand . Elysa Gardner of USA Today called " Not Like the Movies " an " irresistible power ballad " and recommended readers to purchase the song . A staff writer for Portrait Magazine stated that " Not Like the Movies " was a great way to end Teenage Dream and that it showcases the singer 's voice quite well , as she has " lyrics to work for instead of ones to just play around with . " The reviewer concluded that it was a " really good song . " 
 Although " Not Like the Movies " was distributed as a promotional single , it still managed to enter music charts based on legally paid digital download sales . For the week ending August 11 , 2010 , " Not Like the Movies " debuted at number 53 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , and stayed on the chart for only one week .

 = Japanese angelshark = 
 The Japanese angelshark ( Squatina japonica ) is a species of angel shark , family Squatinidae , found in the northwestern Pacific Ocean off China , Japan , and Korea . It is a bottom @-@ dwelling shark found in sandy habitats down to 300 m ( 980 ft ) deep . This species has the flattened shape with wing @-@ like pectoral and pelvic fins typical of its family , and grows to 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) or more in length . Its two dorsal fins are placed behind the pelvic fins , and a row of large thorns occurs along its dorsal midline . Its upper surface is cryptically patterned , with numerous squarish dark spots on a brown background . 
 Feeding on fishes , cephalopods , and crustaceans , the Japanese angelshark is a nocturnal ambush predator that spends most of the day lying still on the sea floor . This species gives birth to live young , which are sustained during gestation by yolk . The litter size varies from two to 10 . The Japanese angelshark is not dangerous to humans unless provoked . It is fished in large numbers and used for meat and shagreen , a type of leather . The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under Vulnerable , citing the intense bottom trawling activity within its range and the low resilience of angel sharks to fishing pressure . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The Japanese angelshark was described by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in an 1858 volume of the scientific journal Acta Societatis Scientiarum Indo @-@ <unk> . The type specimen is a male 53 cm ( 21 in ) long , collected off Nagasaki , Japan , hence the specific epithet japonica . Other common names for this species include change angel shark , change canopy shark , Japanese angelfish , and Japanese monkfish . 
 Using mitochondrial DNA , a 2010 phylogenetic analysis reported that the Japanese angelshark forms a clade with the other Asian angelsharks included in the study : the ocellated angelshark ( S. <unk> ) and the sister species pair of the Taiwan angelshark ( S. formosa ) and the Indonesian angelshark ( S. <unk> ) . These Asian species are , in turn , allied with European and North African angel shark species . Molecular clock estimation suggested the Japanese angelshark lineage diverged from the rest of the Asian angelsharks some 100 million years ago during the Cretaceous .

 The Japanese angelshark is fairly narrow @-@ bodied and has greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins . The skin folds along the sides of the head lack distinct lobes . The eyes are oval and widely spaced ; closely behind are crescent @-@ shaped spiracles with large , boxy projections inside their anterior rims . Each nostril is large and preceded by a small flap of skin bearing two barbels ; the outer barbel is thin , while the inner barbel has a spoon @-@ like tip and a smooth to slightly fringed flange at the base . The wide mouth is terminally placed and has furrows at the corners . There are 10 tooth rows on either side of both jaws , separated by a gap in the middle ; the teeth are small , narrow , and pointed . There are five pairs of gill slits located on the sides of the head . 
 The frontmost portion of each pectoral fin forms a triangular lobe separate from the head . The outer corners of the pectoral fins are angular , and their rear tips are rounded . The pelvic fins have convex margins . The two angular dorsal fins are similar in shape and size , and are located behind the pelvic fins . The caudal peduncle is flattened with a keel running along either side , and supports a roughly triangular caudal fin with rounded corners . The lower lobe of the caudal fin is larger than the upper . The dorsal surface is covered by medium @-@ sized dermal denticles , and a distinctive row of large thorns is present along the midline of the back and tail . This species is light to dark brown above with a dense covering of squarish dark spots , which become finer on the fins . The underside is white with darker mottling . Various sources give differing maximum lengths , ranging from 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 to 8 @.@ 2 ft ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Japanese angelshark is native to the cooler waters of the northwestern Pacific ; its range extends from the eastern coast of Honshu , Japan , to Taiwan , and includes the southern Sea of Japan , the Yellow Sea , the East China Sea , and the Taiwan Strait . Some older sources reported it may occur in the Philippines , but recent research suggests the only angel shark species in that area is S. <unk> . The Japanese angelshark inhabits the continental shelf , usually in the shallows , but also to as deep as 300 m ( 980 ft ) . It is a bottom @-@ dweller found over sandy bottoms , often close to rocky reefs . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 During the day , the Japanese angelshark mostly lies partly buried on the bottom ; its complex color pattern provides camouflage as it ambushes nearby prey . At night , this species becomes more active . Its diet consists of demersal fishes , cephalopods , and crustaceans . It may be found alone or in proximity to others of its species . Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworms <unk> marginatum and Tylocephalum <unk> , the copepods Eudactylina <unk> and Trebius <unk> , and the praniza larvae of the isopod Gnathia trimaculata . The Japanese angelshark is viviparous , and as in other members of its family the developing embryos are nourished by yolk . Litters of two to ten pups are birthed in spring and summer , with the newborns measuring 22 cm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) long . Females mature sexually at 80 cm ( 31 in ) long , while male maturation size is unknown . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The Japanese angelshark is typically inoffensive towards humans , but if disturbed , can inflict a severe bite . Across much of its range , it is a frequent catch ( intentional or not ) in bottom trawls and probably also set nets and demersal gillnets ; the meat is eaten and the rough skin is made into a type of leather called shagreen for use in wood finishing . 
 Angel sharks in general are highly threatened by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction , and angel shark species elsewhere are known to have declined markedly under fishing pressure . Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea and other parts of the northwestern Pacific is intense and , coupled with pollution , has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem . The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have declined by up to 50 % or more under these conditions , leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government , though enforcement is inconsistent . 
 = Erzherzog Karl @-@ class battleship = 
 The Erzherzog Karl class was a class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy built before World War I. All of the battleships of the Erzherzog Karl @-@ class were built in the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyards in Trieste . The first battleship , Erzherzog Karl was laid down in 1902 . Construction on the remaining two battleships , Erzherzog Ferdinand Max and Erzherzog Friedrich continued up to 1905 . Erzherzog Karl was commissioned in 1906 , while Erzherzog Ferdinand Max and Erzherzog Friedrich were commissioned in 1907 . The three Erzherzog Karl @-@ class battleships were considered relatively modern by the time they were commissioned . However , small docking space and budget restraints resulted in the class being fairly compact . Nevertheless , they were well designed and properly protected . The Erzherzog Karl class were the last and largest pre @-@ dreadnoughts built by the Austrian Navy . They were named after members of the Austrian Royal family . 
 Despite these qualities , the Erzherzog Karl @-@ class battleships were inferior to the more modern Dreadnought type battleships – with their " all big gun " armament and turbine propulsion . As a result , they only played a limited role during World War I. At the beginning of the war , the members of the Erzherzog Karl class formed the III division of the Austrian @-@ Hungarian battle @-@ fleet . Despite their largely inactive involvement in the conflict , the battleships of the Erzherzog Karl class did participate in the flight of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau during the opening days of the war , as well as the bombardment of Ancona on 23 May 1915 . The ships also took part in suppressing a major mutiny among the crew members of several armored cruisers stationed in Cattaro between 1 – 3 February 1918 . Following Austria @-@ Hungary 's defeat in World War I , Erzherzog Karl and Erzherzog Friedrich were handed over to France . The remaining battleship , Erzherzog Ferdinand Max , was given to Great Britain . Erzherzog Karl ran aground at Bizerte and was broken up there in 1921 . The remaining two battleships were scrapped in 1921 in Italy .

 The Erzherzog Karl class displaced 10 @,@ 472 long tons ( 10 @,@ 640 t ) . They were 414 feet 2 inches ( 126 @.@ 2 m ) long , had a beam of 71 feet 5 inches ( 21 @.@ 8 m ) and a draft of 24 feet 7 inches ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) . They were manned by 700 men .

 The ships were propelled by two two @-@ shaft , four cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines .

On trials , Erzherzog Karl 's engines managed to produce a knot more speed than was originally planned . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 As with the Ersatz Monarch @-@ class battleship that was planned to be built 13 years later , the Erzherzog Karl class carried a primary armament made by Škoda Works . On each ship , there were four 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) / 40 caliber guns in two twin turrets on the centerline . These guns were an Austro @-@ Hungarian replica of the 24 cm / 40 ( 9 @.@ 4 " ) Krupp C / 94 , which was used on the Habsburgs . The guns could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to 30 ° . The arc of fire of the guns was 300 ° , or 150 ° in each direction . Each gun required a crew of twenty men . At maximum elevation , the gun could fire a 140 @-@ kilogram ( 310 lb ) shell 16 @,@ 900 metres ( 18 @,@ 500 yd ) . They could fire three to four armor @-@ piercing shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of 690 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ) . Each of the guns weighed at least 24 @,@ 040 kilograms ( 53 @,@ 000 lb ) . 
 Their secondary armament consisted of twelve 19 @-@ centimeter ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) / 42 caliber guns , also made by Škoda , mounted in eight single casemates on either wing of the ship and two single midships turrets on the either wing of the ship . They could be depressed to − 3 ° and elevated to 20 ° . They could fire a 97 kilograms ( 214 lb ) armor @-@ piercing shell 20 @,@ 000 metres ( 22 @,@ 000 yd ) at maximum elevation with a muzzle velocity of 800 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . The gun weighed 12 @.@ 1 tons and could fire three rounds per minute . 
 The ships had a tertiary armament for protection against torpedo boats in the form of the 6 @.@ 6 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) / 45 caliber gun , too manufactured by Škoda . They could be depressed to − 10 ° and elevated to 20 , and had an arc of fire of 360 ° , meaning that they could fire at any target within their range of fire . The guns could fire about ten to fifteen rounds per minute . At their maximum elevation , the guns could fire a 4 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 9 @.@ 9 lb ) high @-@ explosive charge 9 @,@ 140 metres ( 10 @,@ 000 yd ) at a muzzle velocity of 880 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 900 ft / s ) . 
 Anti @-@ aircraft and airship protection was covered by the four 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Vickers anti @-@ aircraft guns on the ship . They could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to 80 ° . They had an arc of fire of 360 ° , which meant that they also could engage any target within their range . Manually operated by only one crewman , they could fire a 0 @.@ 7 kilograms ( 1 @.@ 5 lb ) shell 1 @,@ 830 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 yd ) at maximum elevation with a muzzle velocity of 640 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 100 ft / s ) . Designed in 1910 , each of the guns weighed 57 kilograms ( 126 lb ) . The Erzherzog Karl class was also fitted with two above water 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes , although they were rarely used . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The armor plating of the battleships around the waterline belt , one of the more vulnerable areas of a ship , was 210 mm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) , while their deck armor was 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) . The turrets and casemates had 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) and 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) armor respectively . This was done in order to protect the battleships against a possible shell landing on the turrets and the imminent explosion resulting from such a hit . The conning tower of the ships had 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) of armor plating , while the bulkheads inside the battleship that separated different compartments were 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick .

 The Erzherzog Karl class , like the Habsburg class before them and the Radetzky class after them were named after <unk> of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Royal Family , specifically Archduke Charles , Duke of Teschen , Maximilian I of Mexico and Archduke Friedrich , Duke of Teschen . The ships were all laid down at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino in Trieste . The first ship of the class , SMS Erzherzog Karl was laid down on 24 July 1902 . Following 15 months of construction she was launched on 4 October 1903 and finally commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 17 June 1906 . The next ship of the class was SMS Erzherzog Friedrich . She was laid down on 4 October 1902 and launched on 30 April 1904 . Erzherzog Friedrich was finally commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 31 January 1907 . The third and final ship of the Erzherzog Karl class was SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max . She was laid down on 9 March 1904 and later launched on 21 May 1905 . She was commissioned into the navy on 21 December 1907 . 
 = = Service history = = 
 At the outbreak of World War I the three ships formed the III division of the Austrian @-@ Hungarian battle @-@ fleet and spent most of the war based at Pola . The members of the Erzherzog Karl class were mobilized on the eve of the war to support the flight of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau . The two German ships were attempting to break out of Messina , which was surrounded by British troops , and make their way to Turkey . The breakout succeeded . When the flotilla had advanced as far south as Brindisi in south eastern Italy , the Austro @-@ Hungarian ships were recalled . In company with other units of the Austro Hungarian Navy the class took part in the bombardment of Ancona on May 24 , 1915 . There they expended 24 rounds of 240 mm armor @-@ piercing shells at signal and semaphore stations as well as 74 rounds of 190 mm shells aimed at Italian gun @-@ batteries and other port installations . 
 A major mutiny among crews of the armored cruisers stationed in Cattaro , including SMS Sankt Georg and SMS Kaiser Karl VI , began on 1 February 1918 . Two days later , the three Erzherzog Karl @-@ class ships arrived in the port and assisted with the suppression of the mutiny . Following the restoration of order in the naval base , the armored cruisers Sankt Georg and Kaiser Karl VI were decommissioned and the three Erzherzog Karl @-@ class battleships were stationed in Cattaro in their place . For the morning of 11 June , Admiral Miklos Horthy planned a major assault on the Otranto Barrage ; the three Erzherzog Karls and the four Tegetthoff @-@ class battleships were to provide support for the Novara @-@ class cruisers . The plan was intended to replicate the success of the raid conducted one year earlier . Horthy 's plan was to destroy the blockading fleet by luring Allied ships to the cruisers and lighter ships , which were protected from the heavier guns of the battleships , including the Erzherzog Karl class . However , on the morning of 10 June , the dreadnought Szent István was torpedoed and sunk by an Italian torpedo boat . Horthy felt surprise had been lost and therefore called off the operation . This was to be the last military action the Erzherzog Karl @-@ class ships were to take part in and they spent the rest of their career at port in Pola . 
 Following the end of World War I in November 1918 , the members of the Erzherzog Karl class were first taken over by Yugoslavia in 1919 , but Erzherzog Karl and Erzherzog Friedrich were then ceded as war reparations to France . The remaining battleship , Erzherzog Ferdinand Max , was ceded to the United Kingdom . However , Erzherzog Karl ran aground at Bizerte on her voyage to Toulon and was eventually broken up in situ . The remaining two battleships were scrapped in 1921 . 
 = Battle of Pusan Perimeter logistics = 
 Logistics in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter ( August 4 – September 15 , 1950 ) during the Korean War played a decisive role in the battle . Efficient logistics , the management of personnel and materiel , supported United Nations ( UN ) supply lines while the North Koreans ' routes of supply were steadily reduced and cut off . UN logistics improved throughout the Battle of Inchon and the defeat of the North Korean army at Pusan . 
 UN forces , consisting primarily of troops from the Republic of Korea ( ROK ) , the United States ( US ) , and United Kingdom ( UK ) , enjoyed overwhelming air and sea superiority during the battle . The UN efficiently procured and transported supplies from a large stockpile of materiel in nearby Japan . 
 In contrast , North Korean logistics were hampered by UN interdiction campaigns which slowed the flow of supplies from North Korea to the battle . Though supported logistically by the Soviet Union and China during the battle , North Koreans often had difficulties getting their supplies from depots to the front lines , leaving North Korean troops unsupported during several crucial engagements .

 Main Article : Korean War 
 On the night of June 25 , 1950 , ten divisions of North Koreas Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) launched a full @-@ scale invasion on the nation 's neighbor to the south , the Republic of Korea . The force of 89 @,@ 000 men moved in six columns , catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise , resulting in a complete rout . The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment , and it was unprepared for war . Numerically superior , North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38 @,@ 000 South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south . Most of South Korea 's forces retreated in the face of the invasion . By June 28 , the North Koreans had captured South Korea 's capital of Seoul , forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south . 
 To prevent South Korea 's complete collapse , the United Nations Security Council voted to send military forces . The United States ' Seventh Fleet dispatched Task Force 77 , led by the fleet carrier USS Valley Forge ; the British Far East Fleet also dispatched several ships , including HMS Triumph , to provide air and naval support . Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces , these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance . To supplement the air support , US President Harry S. Truman ordered ground troops into the country . Although the Eighth United States Army 's US 24th Infantry Division was in Japan and was available to respond to the situation , cuts in military spending after the end of World War II meant that the overall strength of the US military in the Far East was limited and the division itself was understrength and operating outmoded equipment . Nevertheless , the division was ordered into Korea . 
 The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances alongside the South Korean army , delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow UN reinforcements to arrive . The division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans while the 7th Infantry Division , 25th Infantry Division , 1st Cavalry Division , and other Eighth Army supporting units moved into position . On July 5 , during the first battle between American and North Korean forces , advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated at Osan . Over the course of the following month , the 24th Infantry Division was repeatedly defeated and forced south by the stronger and more heavily equipped North Koreans . During this time heavy fighting occurred around Chochiwon , Chonan , and Pyongtaek before the 24th Infantry Division made a final stand at Taejon . Although they were almost completely destroyed in the fighting , the US troops were able to delay North Korean advance until July 20 , by which time the Pusan Perimeter had been established . With UN units arriving every day , the Eighth Army was able to build up a force of combat troops that were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region . 
 = = = North Korean advance = = = 
 With Taejon captured , North Korean forces began the effort of surrounding the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt to envelop it . The North Korean 4th Infantry Division and the North Korean 6th Infantry Division advanced south in a wide coordinated maneuver that was aimed at the UN 's left flank . Advancing on UN positions , they repeatedly forced US and South Korean forces to withdraw . Although they were steadily pushed back , South Korean forces increased their resistance further south in an effort to delay North Korean units as much as possible . North and South Korean units sparred for control of several cities , inflicting heavy casualties on one another . The Republic of Korea Army forces defended Yongdok fiercely before being forced back . They also performed well in the Battle of Andong , where they were successful in repelling North Korean advances . 
 In the west , US forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance . Forces from the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment , newly arrived in the country , were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27 , leaving open a pass to the Pusan area . Soon after , Chinju to the west was taken , pushing the 19th Infantry Regiment back and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces . US units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2 . Suffering mounting losses , the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re @-@ equip and receive reinforcements . This granted both sides several days of reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter . 
 = = United Nations logistics = = 
 On July 1 , the US Far East Command directed the Eighth United States Army to assume responsibility for all logistical support of the United Nations Command ( UNC ) in Korea . This included the ROK Army , US Army and British Army forces operating in Korea . It also included support for the ships of Australia , Canada , New Zealand and the Netherlands which were also contributing to the effort . When the Eighth Army became operational in Korea , this logistical function was assumed by Eighth Army Rear which remained behind in Yokohama , Japan . This dual role of the Eighth Army — that of combat in Korea and of logistical support for all troops fighting there — led to the designation of that part of the army in Korea as Eighth United States Army in Korea . This situation existed until August 25 . On that date the Far East Command activated the Japan Logistical Command with Major General Walter L. <unk> in command . It took over the logistical duties previously held by Eighth Army Rear . It also assumed responsibility of the movement of refugees and prisoners of war . 
 The supplies needed to support the American and South Korean armies came through the United States and Japan . Whatever could be obtained from stocks in Japan or procured from Japanese manufacturers was obtained there . In early July 1950 , Japanese manufacturers began making antitank mines and on July 18 a shipment of 3 @,@ 000 of them arrived by boat at Pusan . The equipment and ordnance supplies that was available to the United States forces in Korea in the first months of the war was largely due to the " roll @-@ up " plan of the Far East Command which had been in effect for some time before the outbreak of hostilities . It called for the reclamation of ordnance items from World War II in the US Pacific island outposts and their repair or reconstruction in Japan . This plan had been conceived and started in 1948 by Brigadier General Urban <unk> , the senior Ordnance Officer of the Far East Command . During July and August 1950 an average of 4 @,@ 000 automotive vehicles cleared through the ordnance repair shops each month ; in the year after the outbreak of the Korean War more than 46 @,@ 000 automotive vehicles were repaired or rebuilt in Japan . 
 = = = Challenges = = = 
 The re @-@ equipping of the ROK Army presented the UN forces with a large logistical problem in July . To meet part of the requirements , the US command contracted Japanese manufacturers in August to produce 68 @,@ 000 vehicles for the ROK Army , mostly cargo and dump trucks , with first deliveries to be made in September . However , the largest challenge faced by UN forces was a shortage of ammunition . At the outbreak of the war and up until the Pusan Perimeter engagements , the UNC 's forces had to rely mainly upon stock of World War II surplus ammunition . Much of this malfunctioned or no longer worked , indeed in some cases up to 60 percent did not work , and as a result ammunition , particularly for crew @-@ served weapons , was frequently in short supply . From the outset , High Explosive Anti Tank ammunition was particularly scarce , but this changed as US and Japanese manufacturers increased production to meet wartime needs , as a part of the Far East Command 's " Operation Rebuild " . By August 1950 this operation had assumed gigantic proportions and before the end of 1950 it had expanded to employ 19 @,@ 908 people in eight Japanese shops . Through these efforts , UNC logistics situations improved over time , but nevertheless ammunition remained in short supply for much of the war . 
 Another issue that strained the UN logistics system was the lack of a previously drafted resupply plan . Consumption rates differed among the various units and as a result of a lack of coordination , some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed . In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose . 
 The lack of armor available was also a serious issue of the UNC . In order to meet the demand , a variety of armored old platforms were hastily rebuilt and modified for movement into the Pusan Perimeter . M4A3 Sherman medium tanks ( preferably the most advanced model , the <unk> ( 76 ) W <unk> Sherman ) from World War II were pulled from stocks and rebuilt for use in Korea . <unk> Half @-@ tracks were also rebuilt and modified for use in Korea . During early engagements , the M24 Chaffee light tank was the primary armored vehicle used by the Americans because it was most readily available and most combat @-@ ready ; nevertheless , it performed poorly against heavier North Korean armor . All of these weapons had been used in World War II and were considered in poor condition . The appearance of the North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks forced the US to move large numbers of heavier , more powerful tanks into the battle . During August , six tank battalions , with around 69 tanks each , arrived at Pusan . By the end of the month there were more than 500 UN tanks assembled there . Most were <unk> Shermans , and the bigger M26 Pershing heavy tanks , although a limited number of the new M46 Patton tanks were also moved into the perimeter . 
 On July 9 , the US 2nd Infantry Division , with several armor and antiaircraft artillery units , was ordered to proceed to the Far East . The next day , MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength , if possible , without delaying its departure . He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength . He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions , 12 heavy tank companies , 11 infantry battalions , 11 field artillery battalions , and four antiaircraft automatic weapons battalions per division . By August 7 , the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea , and had been sent to the Naktong Bulge area . However it would be the end of the month before the rest of the 2nd Infantry Division arrived in Korea . 
 After World War II , the Army developed the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital ( MASH ) concept from experiences in the European Theater . The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be as close to the fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties . These 60 @-@ bed , 124 @-@ man units would act as mobile hospitals for the treatment of wounded . By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea , all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport , making it very difficult for the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle . The <unk> MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea , being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9 . Two more hospitals , the <unk> and <unk> , would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting . The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport , often receiving between 150 and 200 per day , although sometimes the number was high as 400 . The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported . Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries . 
 Sustenance for the UN troops in Korea was among the other logistical challenges confronting the UN in the early days of the war . There were no C rations in Korea and only a small reserve in Japan at the outbreak of the war . The Quartermaster General of the United States Army immediately began moving all available C rations and 5 @-@ in @-@ 1 B rations from the United States to the Far East . Field rations at first were largely World War II K rations . The UN had to rely on much of the US stock of World War II @-@ era material for much of this phase of the war . <unk> of the ROK troops was an equally important and difficult problem . The regular issue ration to ROK troops was rice or barley and fish . It consisted of about 29 ounces ( 820 g ) of rice or barley , one half pound of biscuit , and one half pound of canned fish with spices . Often the cooked rice , made into balls and wrapped in cabbage leaves , was sour when it reached the combat troops on the line , and frequently it did not arrive at all . Occasionally , local purchase of foods on a basis of 200 Won ( $ 0 @.@ 05 USD ) per day per man supplemented the issued ration . An improved ROK ration consisting of three menus , one for each daily meal , was ready in September 1950 . It provided 3 @,@ 210 calories , weighed 2 @.@ 3 pounds ( 1 @.@ 0 kg ) , and consisted of rice starch , biscuits , rice cake , peas , kelp , fish , chewing gum , and condiments , and was packed in a waterproofed bag . With slight changes , this ration was found acceptable to the ROK troops and quickly put into production . It became the standard ration for them during the first year of the war . 
 = = = Air resupply = = = 
 An emergency airlift of critically needed items began almost immediately from the United States to the Far East . The Military Air Transport Service ( MATS ) , Pacific Division , expanded rapidly after the outbreak of the war . The Pacific airlift was further expanded by the charter of civil airlines planes . The Canadian Government lent the United Nations a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron of six transports , while the Belgian Government added several DC @-@ 4s to the effort . Altogether , the fleet of about 60 four @-@ engine transport planes operating across the Pacific before June 25 , 1950 , was quickly expanded to approximately 250 . In addition to these , there were MATS C @-@ 74 Globemaster and C @-@ 97 Stratofreighter planes operating between the United States and Hawaii . 
 The Pacific airlift to Korea operated from the United States over three routes . These were commonly known as the " Great Circle " by pilots . One route left from McChord Air Force Base in Tacoma , Washington , and transited through Anchorage , Alaska , and Shemya in the Aleutians before finishing at Tokyo . This represented a distance of 5 @,@ 688 miles ( 9 @,@ 154 km ) and a flying time of between 30 and 33 hours . A second route was the Mid @-@ Pacific . This departed from Travis Air Force Base near San Francisco , California , and passed through Honolulu and Wake Island before arriving in Tokyo ; the trip was 6 @,@ 718 miles ( 10 @,@ 812 km ) and took 34 hours to complete . A third route was from California through Honolulu , and Johnston , Kwajalein , and Guam Islands to Tokyo : a distance of about 8 @,@ 000 miles ( 13 @,@ 000 km ) and a flying time of 40 hours . The airlift moved about 106 tonnes ( 104 long tons ; 117 short tons ) a day in July 1950 . From Japan most of the air shipments to Korea were staged at Ashiya or at the nearby secondary airfields of Itazuke Air Base and Brady Air Base . 
 The consumption of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations was so great in the early phase of the war , taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East , that it became one of the more serious logistical problems facing UN planners . Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption . Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations , on several occasion the situation became quite dire , and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan . On a number of occasions throughout the war , the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public . 
 The airlift of critically needed items from the United States tapered off at the end of July as surface transportation began to meet requirements . Some items such as the new 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch rocket were still being carried largely by airlift , 900 of them being scheduled daily for air delivery to Korea during August . The new 5 @-@ inch " shaped charge " rockets for Navy fighter planes , developed at the Navy 's Inyokern , California , Ordnance Test Station , were at first delivered to Korea entirely by air . On July 29 , a special Air Force plane picked up the first 200 warheads from Inyokern for delivery to the Far East . 
 After the first weeks of the war , steps were taken to reduce the necessity for the large number of airlifts to Korea from Japan . By July 15 , Eighth Army was provided a daily ferry service from the Hakata @-@ Moji area to Pusan , along with fast express trains from the Tokyo – Yokohama area . Accordingly , a Red Ball Express @-@ type system was organized . It had a daily capacity of 300 tonnes ( 300 long tons ; 330 short tons ) of items and supplies that were critically needed in Korea . The Red Ball made the run from Yokohama to Sasebo in a little more than 30 hours , and to Pusan in a total of about 53 hours . The first Red Ball Express train with high priority cargo left Yokohama at 1330 on July 23 . Regular daily runs became effective two days later . The schedule called for the Red Ball to depart Yokohama at 2330 nightly and arrive at Sasebo at <unk> the next morning . From there , the cargo would be transferred directly from train to ship . Ship departure was scheduled for 1330 daily and arrival at Pusan at 0400 the next morning . 
 The daily rail and water Red Ball Express from Yokohama to Sasebo to Pusan began on July 23 . By August it was operating with increased efficiency , demonstrating that it could promptly deliver any supplies available in Japan to Korea . On August 5 , for example , it delivered 308 tonnes ( 303 long tons ; 340 short tons ) ; on August 9 , 403 tonnes ( 397 long tons ; 444 short tons ) ; on August 22 , 574 tonnes ( 565 long tons ; 633 short tons ) ; and on August 25 , 949 tonnes ( 934 long tons ; 1 @,@ 046 short tons ) . The success of the Red Ball Express cut down the amount of airlift tonnage . This fell from 85 tonnes ( 84 long tons ; 94 short tons ) on July 31 to 49 tonnes ( 48 long tons ; 54 short tons ) on August 6 . The express eliminated the need for nearly all airlift of supplies to Korea from Japan . It delivered supplies to Korea in an average time of 60 – 70 hours , while the airlift delivery varied from 12 hours to 5 days . The Red Ball delivery was not only more cost effective , it was more consistent and reliable . 
 The drop in air delivery to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge , commanding the Far East Air Forces , to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift 's 200 tonnes ( 200 long tons ; 220 short tons ) daily capacity . That day , Eighth Army ordered curtailment of delivery by the Red Ball Express and increased use of the airlift to its maximum capacity . The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of water @-@ borne supplies in a timely manner . The next day , upon Partridge 's suggestion , two 2 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 2 @.@ 5 long tons ; 2 @.@ 8 short tons ) trucks were airlifted in a C @-@ 119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu . The Air Force planned to airlift two trucks daily in this manner . As a result , on August 12 , Eighth Army ordered the Red Ball Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo that was considered too difficult for the planes to handle . Under this arrangement airlift tonnage greatly increased . On August 16 , transport planes carried 324 tonnes ( 319 long tons ; 357 short tons ) of cargo and 595 passengers ; on August 19 , 160 tonnes ( 160 long tons ; 180 short tons ) of cargo and 381 passengers ; on 28 August , 398 tonnes ( 392 long tons ; 439 short tons ) of cargo and 343 passengers ; and , on August 29 , 326 tonnes ( 321 long tons ; 359 short tons ) of cargo and 347 passengers . 
 = = = Sea resupply = = = 
 The majority of resupply by sea was conducted by cargo ships of the US Army and US Navy . The massive demand for ships forced the UN Command to charter private ships and bring ships out of the reserve fleet to augment the military vessels in service . The UN had a major advantage in its sealift operations in that the most developed port in Korea was Pusan which was at the southeastern tip of the peninsula . Pusan was the only port in South Korea that had dock facilities large enough to handle a sizable amount of cargo . Its four piers and intervening quays could berth 24 or more deepwater ships , and its beaches provided space for the unloading of 14 Landing Ship Tank ( LST ) vessels , giving the port a potential capacity of 45 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 44 @,@ 000 long tons ; 50 @,@ 000 short tons ) daily . Seldom , however , did the daily discharge of cargo exceed 14 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 14 @,@ 000 long tons ; 15 @,@ 000 short tons ) because of a lack of skilled labor , large cranes , rail cars , and trucks . 
 The distance in nautical miles from the principal Japanese ports to Pusan varied depending on which Japanese port ships embarked from . It was 110 nautical miles ( 200 km ; 130 mi ) from Fukuoka , 123 nautical miles ( 228 km ; 142 mi ) from Moji , 130 nautical miles ( 240 km ; 150 mi ) from Sasebo , 361 nautical miles ( 669 km ; 415 mi ) from Kobe , and 900 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 700 km ; 1 @,@ 000 mi ) from Yokohama via the Bungo @-@ Suido strait . The sea trip from the west coast of the United States to Pusan for personnel movement required about 16 days ; the trip for heavy equipment and supplies on slower shipping schedules took longer . 
 During the month of July 1950 , a total of 309 @,@ 314 tonnes ( 304 @,@ 429 long tons ; 340 @,@ 960 short tons ) of supplies and equipment were off @-@ loaded at Pusan , at a rate of about 10 @,@ 666 tonnes ( 10 @,@ 498 long tons ; 11 @,@ 757 short tons ) per day . The first heavy lift cranes arrived on July 23 . A 60 tonnes ( 59 long tons ; 66 short tons ) crane and two crawler cranes , towed 900 miles ( 1 @,@ 400 km ) from Yokohama . Not until the first week of August did a 100 tonnes ( 98 long tons ; 110 short tons ) crane reach Pusan . In the last half of July , 230 ships arrived and 214 departed Pusan harbor . During this period , 42 @,@ 581 troops , 9 @,@ 454 vehicles , and 88 @,@ 888 long tons ( 90 @,@ 314 t ) of supplies came ashore there . Subordinate ports of Ulsan and <unk> unloaded ammunition and petroleum products over the beaches from barges , tankers , and LCMs . 
 = = = Movement to the front lines = = = 
 From Pusan a good railroad system built by the Japanese and well ballasted with crushed rock and river gravel extended northward . Subordinate rail lines ran westward along the south coast through Masan and Chinju and northeast near the east coast to P 'ohang @-@ dong . There the eastern line turned inland through the east @-@ central Taebaek Mountains area . The railroads were the backbone of the UN transportation system in Korea . 
 The 20 @,@ 000 miles ( 32 @,@ 000 km ) of Korean vehicular roads were all of a secondary nature as measured by American or European standards . Even the best of them were narrow , poorly drained , and surfaced only with gravel or rocks broken laboriously by hand , and worked into the dirt roadbed by the traffic passing over . The highest classification placed on any appreciable length of road in Korea by Eighth Army engineers was for a gravel or crushed rock road with gentle grades and curves and one and a half to two lanes wide . According to engineer specifications there were no two @-@ lane roads , 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) wide , in Korea . The average width of the best roads was 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) with numerous bottlenecks at narrow bridges and bypasses where the width narrowed to 11 – 13 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 – 4 @.@ 0 m ) . Often even on these roads there were short stretches having sharp curves and grades up to 15 percent . The Korean road traffic was predominately by oxcart . The road net , like the rail net , was principally north – south , with a few lateral east – west connecting roads . 
 US Army logistics units worked continuously during July to organize the train movements from Pusan toward the rail @-@ heads at the front . By July 18 they had established a regular daily schedule of supply trains over two routes , the main Pusan – Taegu – Kumch 'on line with a branch line from Kumch 'on to Hamch 'ang ; and the Pusan – Kyongju – Andong single track line up the east coast with a branch line from Kyongju to P 'ohang @-@ dong . As the battle front moved swiftly southward , trains after the end of July did not run beyond Taegu and P 'ohang @-@ dong . After the North Korean threat developed in the Masan region , a supply train ran daily from Pusan to that city . On July 1 the UN Command controlled 1 @,@ 404 miles ( 2 @,@ 260 km ) of rail track in South Korea . By August this had shrunk to 431 miles ( 694 km ) of track . 
 In July , 350 mixed trains moved from Pusan toward the front . These included 2 @,@ 313 freight cars loaded with 69 @,@ 390 short tons ( 62 @,@ 950 t ) of supplies . Also leaving Pusan for the front were 71 personnel trains carrying military units and replacements . Among the trains returning to Pusan from the forward area were 38 hospital trains carrying 2 @,@ 581 patients , and 158 freight cars loaded largely with personal belongings taken by unit commanders from their men in trying to strip them down to only combat needs . Since the Korean railroads had been built by Japan , repair and replacement items could be borrowed from the Japanese National Railways and airlifted to Korea within a very short time after the need for them became known . One of the largest and most important of rail purchases in Japan for use in Korea was 25 standard @-@ gauge locomotives . By August 1 the ROK National Police was responsible for protecting all rail bridges and tunnels . Armed guards , their number varying with the importance of the structures , were stationed at each of them . 
 Occasionally , guerrillas would attack trains in rear areas of the Pusan Perimeter , usually in the Yongch 'on – Kyongju area in the east or along the lower Naktong in the Samnangjin area . These attacks generally resulted in small numbers of UN casualties and minor damage to rail equipment . The most successful guerrilla attack behind the lines of the Pusan Perimeter occurred on August 11 against a VHF radio relay station on Hill 915 , 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of Taegu . A guerrilla force , estimated at 100 men attacked at 05 : 15 , drove off the ROK police and set fire to the buildings . American casualties were two killed , two wounded , and three missing . When a ROK police force reoccupied the area later in the day the guerrillas had pulled back . 
 In August the UN also began using Korean civilians with A @-@ frames as cargo carriers to move supplies up through the mountains to the front lines . This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals . American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army . Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work , at an average of about 500 laborers and carriers to a division . 
 = = North Korean logistics = = 
 The responsibility of the North Korean logistics was divided between the Ministry of National Defense ( MND ) , led by Marshal Choe Yong Gun , and the NKPA Rear Service Department , commanded by General Choe Hong Kup . The MND was mainly responsible for railroad transportation and supply procurement , while the Rear Service Department was responsible for road transportation . The North Koreans relied on a logistical system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations ' system . This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies , and this caused considerable difficulty for front line troops . Based on the efficient Soviet model , this ground @-@ based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies to the front lines while troops transported those items onto the individual units on foot , trucks , or carts . This second effort , though more versatile , was also a substantial disadvantage because it was less efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front @-@ line units . 
 = = = Challenges = = = 
 In mid @-@ July , the UN Far East Air Force ( FEAF ) Bomber Command began a steady and increasing attack on strategic North Korean logistics targets behind the front lines . The first of these targets was Wonsan on the east coast . Wonsan was important as a communications center that linked Vladivostok , Siberia with North Korea by rail and sea . From it , rail lines ran to all the North Korean build @-@ up centers . The great bulk of Soviet supplies for North Korea in the early part of the war came in at Wonsan , and from the beginning it was considered a major military target . In the first heavy strategic bombing of the war , the FEAF hit the port city on July 13 with 400 tonnes ( 390 long tons ; 440 short tons ) of demolition bombs . Three days later , 30 B @-@ 29 bombers struck the railroad marshaling yards at Seoul , another major staging area for North Korean supplies . 
 UN bombers immediately targeted the pontoon bridge across the Han River at Seoul which was a main line of supply to the Pusan battlefield , and to destroy the repaired railroad bridge there . Several attempts in July by B @-@ 29s to destroy the rail bridge failed , but on July 29 , 12 bombers succeeded in hitting the pontoon bridge and reported it as having been destroyed . The next day , 47 B @-@ 29s bombed the Chosen Nitrogen Plant at Hungnam on the northeast coast . In the meantime , carrier @-@ based planes from the USS Valley Forge , which was operating in the Yellow Sea , destroyed six locomotives , exploded 18 cars of a 33 @-@ car train , and damaged a combination highway and rail bridge at <unk> on July 22 . 
 By July 27 , the FEAF Bomber Command had a comprehensive rail interdiction plan ready . This plan sought to cut the flow of North Korean troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area . Two cut points , the P 'yong @-@ yang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards would almost completely sever North Korea 's rail logistics network . Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area . On July 28 the Far East Air Forces gave a list of targets in the rail interdiction program to the Bomber Command , and two days later a similar plan was ready for interdiction of highways . On August 3 , the FEAF issued lists of targets for coordinated interdiction attacks south of the 38th Parallel to the Fifth Air Force and to the Navy . In general , the Han River divided the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomber Command zones . 
 On August 4 , the FEAF began B @-@ 29 interdiction attacks against all key bridges north of the 37th Parallel in Korea , and on August 15 some light bombers and fighter @-@ bombers joined in the interdiction campaign . This campaign sought the destruction of 32 rail and highway bridges on the three main transportation routes across Korea : the line from Sinanju south to P 'yongyang and northeast to Wonsan on the east coast ; the line just below the 38th Parallel from Munsan @-@ ni through Seoul to Ch <unk> 'on to Chumunjin @-@ up on the east coast ; and the line from Seoul south to <unk> <unk> and east to Wonju to <unk> 'ok on the east coast . The interdiction campaign marked nine rail yards , including those at Seoul , P 'yongyang , and Wonsan , for attack , and the ports of Inch 'on and Wonsan to be mined . This interdiction program , if effectively executed , would slow and perhaps critically disrupt the movement of North Korean supplies along the main routes south to the battlefront . 
 The US Air Force B @-@ 29s bombed and largely destroyed the P 'yongyang Army Arsenal and the P 'yongyang railroad yards on August 7 . They bombed and completely destroyed the large Chosen petroleum refinery at Wonsan on August 7 , 9 , and 10 . This plant , with its estimated capacity of 250 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 250 @,@ 000 long tons ; 280 @,@ 000 short tons ) , annually produced approximately 93 percent of the North Korean petroleum products . Throughout the month the US Air Force bombed the chemical complex in the Hungnam area , the largest in Asia , dropping 1 @,@ 761 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 733 long tons ; 1 @,@ 941 short tons ) of bombs there in the period between July 30 and September 19 . It bombed the <unk> docks only 17 miles ( 27 km ) south of the Siberian border and 10 miles ( 16 km ) from Vladivostok . <unk> was an important port of entry for vessels carrying supplies from Vladivostok and it was also a rail center . The bombers struck the metal @-@ working industry at Songjin with 326 tonnes ( 321 long tons ; 359 short tons ) of bombs on August 28 , and three days later they heavily damaged the aluminum and magnesium plants at <unk> 'o with 284 tonnes ( 280 long tons ; 313 short tons ) of bombs . 
 = = = Land resupply = = = 
 North Korea 's lack of large airstrips and aircraft meant it conducted only minimal air resupply , mostly critical items being imported from China . Other than this , however , aircraft played almost no role in North Korean logistics . The North Koreans were also not able to effectively use sea transport to their advantage . Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam could be used for the transport of some troops and supplies , but they remained far too underdeveloped to support any large @-@ scale logistical movements , and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate with large numbers of ships . The interior of Korea also lacked navigable waterways , as the shallow streams and rivers did not provide for the movement of large ships . These rivers would only be of local importance to battles . The North Koreans tried on several occasions to resupply their units by sea or conduct amphibious operations at the outbreak of the war but each time were decisively defeated . At engagements such as the Battle of Pusan and the Battle of <unk> Chan the UN naval blockade was effective in halting almost all North Korean naval activity . 
 This meant the railroads and highways in Korea took central prominence to North Korean resupply . The North Koreans were given supplies by both China and the Soviet Union , neither of whom were committed to the war at this point , and did not commit combat troops directly . They fed supplies into North Korea through six rail lines , five from Manchuria and one from Siberia . China in particular had an extensive rail network and thousands of locomotives . The railroads had the capacity to send up to 17 @,@ 500 tonnes ( 17 @,@ 200 long tons ; 19 @,@ 300 short tons ) of supplies into North Korea per day . The full amount of supplies that were actually sent to North Korea at this phase of the war is unclear , but historians suggest that even at the height of the war and Chinese involvement the supplies did not increase beyond 13 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 13 @,@ 000 long tons ; 14 @,@ 000 short tons ) per day . However the railroads were primarily oriented on north – south routes , making resupply from east to west difficult . 
 North Korean logistics held much more substantial facilities for their railroad system , which were based in Seoul . However , they also did not have the benefit of buying replacement and repair parts from Japan , and consequently their railroads were in much worse condition than those held by the UN . They controlled the bulk of Korea 's 3 @,@ 000 miles ( 4 @,@ 800 km ) of railroad . They also controlled most of the 1 @,@ 500 locomotives and 9 @,@ 000 rail cars on the peninsula , though the majority of these were not serviceable during the fight . 
 Seoul was also the focal point of Korea 's highway network . It also had several crucial connection points to the Soviet Union and China , but it was not designed for military traffic and the weather conditions made travel on the roads difficult . Overall the roads into Korea provided only 48 percent of the capacity of the railroads . 
 = = = Movement to the front lines = = = 
 The supremacy of the Fifth Air Force in the skies over Korea forced the North Koreans in the first month of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area . They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front , however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units , forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals . 
 Since capturing Seoul , the North Koreans had built two pontoon bridges over the Han , one north and one south of the main rail and highway bridges . They had also started a new railroad bridge north of the old triple bridge group . The steel cantilever railroad bridge on the west still stood despite Far East Air Forces attempts to destroy it . For almost four weeks the Air Force bombed this bridge daily using bombs with fuze settings that were intended to damage both the superstructure and the abutments . On August 19 , nine B @-@ 29s of the 19th Bombardment Group dropped 54 tonnes ( 53 long tons ; 60 short tons ) of bombs on the bridge , but it still stood . The same day , Navy carrier @-@ based planes attacked the bridge , scoring eight direct hits , and brought it down . 
 Attacks against the Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul do not seem to have been successful until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27 , set to detonate at night . This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort . These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year . 
 The North Korean People 's Army was able to maintain transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks . The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport . Ammunition and motor fuel , which took precedence over all other types of supply , continued to arrive at the front , though in smaller amounts than before . There was still a considerable resupply of heavy weapons , such as tanks , artillery , and mortars , at the front in early September , although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August . There was a sufficient supply of small arms ammunition , but a shortage of small arms themselves became apparent by mid @-@ August and continued to worsen with each passing week . Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for small arms in mid @-@ August and resupply ceased entirely about the middle of September . New trucks were almost impossible to obtain . There was no resupply of clothing . At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day . Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace , scavenging for food and supplies at night . By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness . At the same time , seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services , and many died while stranded on the front line . 
 The inefficiency of North Korean logistics remained a fatal weakness of the North Korean Army , costing it crucial defeats after an initial success with combat forces . The North Koreans ' communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points . 
 Several units lost crucially needed supply lines in the middle of their offensives , particularly when crossing the Naktong River which had few stable bridges remaining . The NK 3rd Division stopped receiving food and ammunition supply as it pushed on Taegu in mid @-@ August , forcing one of its regiments to withdraw from the captured Triangulation Hill . At Naktong Bulge , the NK 4th Division was able to establish a raft system for moving supplies across the river , but it still suffered serious food , ammunition , weapon , and equipment shortages after its August 5 crossing . It was also eventually turned back due to supply problems . The situation was most dire for units in the east , where rugged and mountainous terrain already posed a logistical challenge . The NK 5th Division and NK 12th Division attacking P 'ohang @-@ dong stopped receiving all food and ammunition supply between August 12 and August 20 , a key factor in their defeat there . In some instances , desperate North Korean units forced South Korean populations to carry their supplies for them . North Korean units had advanced too far too quickly , and their logistical system , stretched beyond its limit , collapsed at a key point in the war . Morale remained high for many units despite the lack of supplies . North Korean units instead turned to foraging for what they could find in the countryside or raiding UN supplies . Small guerrilla units , such as the NK 766th Infantry Regiment , could do this effectively . 
 = = Conclusions = = 
 Historians contend that for the UN and North Korea , locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand , logistics was among the most important determining factors in how the war would progress . As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces , the well @-@ supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter , while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as <unk> became increasingly unreliable . This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul , the key logistics center of the battle , and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA . 
 As the battle for Pusan Perimeter wore on , logistics took an increasingly important toll on the outcome of individual engagements . UN units faced the challenge of re @-@ equipping the ROK Army and supporting a massive force of troops in a large @-@ scale war that it had not anticipated or planned for . Still , historians have praised US Army logistics planners for the way that they were able to organize a working logistics system for the UN forces in the battle . Upon the outbreak of the war , the United States had an overwhelming advantage in materiel which had been left behind from World War II , and it relied on this to supply units in the first crucial days while new materiel was produced and shipped into the theater . Air superiority was another critical advantage in the favor of the UN . A number of UN contributing nations provided large air forces so that materiel could be transported quickly . At the same time , US Army planners established Pusan port as the main port for supply delivery . The UN also had a great advantage in the port of Pusan itself as it was the most developed port in Korea and as a consequence had the capacity for large numbers of ships to offload supplies . With a large transcontinental navy and strong economic base in Japan , the UN forces were able to utilize the port effectively . These advantages ensured that UN forces had mostly stable lines of supply for the entirety of the battle . 
 North Korean troops had the advantage of planning the invasion in advance and organizing a pre @-@ set logistics network , but they were not able to keep this logistics network running efficiently . Their largest disadvantage was the successful large @-@ scale UN interdiction effort , as North Korean supplies and supply lines were subjected to UN bombing raids . This effort was not successful in stopping the North Korean supplies , and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for the way in which they were able to maintain a supply network in the face of a massive bombing campaign . However , the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this , and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads ' advantage . North Korean forces , though initially successful , were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense , and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own . This meant their supply network limited the combat actions that they could undertake ; logistics could not keep up with units on the offensive , and North Korean units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements , reducing their ability to fight effectively . North Korean logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon . This landing , coming behind North Korean lines , had the effect of collapsing the North Korean front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September . 
 = Pawn Hearts = 
 Pawn Hearts is the fourth album by English progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator , released in October 1971 on Charisma Records . The original album features just three tracks , including the side @-@ long suite " A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers " . The album was not commercially successful in the UK , but reached number one in Italy . It has since seen retrospective critical praise and was reissued on CD in 2005 with extra material . 
 The songs for the album were worked out while on tour in 1971 , with further development and arranging at manager Tony Stratton @-@ Smith 's house in Crowborough , Sussex over a two @-@ month period . The original plan had been to release more material , making up a double album , but Charisma vetoed the idea . A non @-@ album single , " Theme One " was included on some releases in the US and Canada . The album 's strong commercial showing in Italy resulted in a number of lucrative promotional tours there , but the resulting pressure led to the band 's split in August 1972 . 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1971 , Van der Graaf Generator 's line @-@ up had stabilised as frontman and songwriter Peter Hammill , saxophonist David Jackson , organist and bassist Hugh Banton and drummer Guy Evans . The group had been gigging extensively and became close friends after a particularly gruelling tour of Germany . Hammill wrote " A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers " during the tour , and the group began performing " Man @-@ Erg " towards its end . To alleviate the tedium of touring , the group invented games including " Crowborough Tennis " which involved bouncing a ball off a table , a photograph of which was eventually used as the inner sleeve for the album . 
 Following the tour and in preparation for the album , Hammill invited producer John Anthony to his home , where Hammill played songs intended for the album unaccompanied on acoustic guitar and piano , allowing Anthony to take recording notes . " Man Erg " was written about the conflict between good and evil , represented as " angels " and " killers " in the song . " A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers " was inspired by Hammill 's fascination with the sea , and the narrative is about a lighthouse keeper who keeps seeing people die offshore . He feels guilty about not being able to help , and the song 's ending is left open , leaving the listener to decide if the keeper has committed suicide or rationalised events to live in peace . Banton was against putting " A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers " on the album , wanting more commercial material such as the previous album H to He , Who Am the Only One 's " Killer " , but after a band meeting he agreed to rehearse the song and worked out an arrangement . The group moved to manager Tony Stratton @-@ Smith 's house , Luxford House , Crowborough , Sussex for two months in summer 1971 to rehearse material . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Recording ran from July to September 1971 in Trident Studios . In addition to the band and Anthony , Robin Cable , David Hentschel and Ken Scott helped with engineering . The first tracks to be recorded were " Theme One " , a cover of the George Martin composition used as the original closing theme to BBC Radio 1 , and " W " , which was ultimately left off the album . The music , particularly " A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers " was recorded in short sections between two and five minutes , which were later edited together . In addition to Hammill 's original suite , Banton contributed the " Pictures / Lighthouse " section , an Olivier Messiaen @-@ influenced organ piece , Evans wrote " Kosmos Tours " around a short piano riff , and Jackson wrote the music to the closing theme , " We Go Now " . The piece was edited together by Banton and Anthony towards the end of the session . Banton used an effect called a " psychedelic razor " , a customised tape recorder that could rewind and record simultaneously . The device appealed to the band 's sense of humour . At one stage , every tape machine in the studio had to be used for mixing . 
 The album was originally conceived as a double album similar to Pink Floyd 's Ummagumma . The first half was made up of the album as released , while the second was to be divided between personal projects and live @-@ in @-@ studio versions of older Van der Graaf Generator songs such as " Killer " and " Octopus " . Evans contributed an avant @-@ garde piece , " Angle of Incidents " which featured drums being recorded backwards and the sound of a fluorescent lighting tube being dropped down the studio 's stairs . Jackson recorded " <unk> 's Theme ' " , a short jazz piece , and a longer piece , " Archimedes Agnostic " , with Latin lyrics written by Hammill . Charisma ultimately felt that the group should simply release a single album , and vetoed the live and solo recordings . 
 The album 's title came from a spoonerism by Jackson , who once said , " I 'll go down to the studio and dub on some more porn harts " , meaning " horn parts " . The cover was designed by regular Charisma album artist Paul Whitehead , who was told by Hammill , " no matter if you 're a king , a pauper or whatever – you 're a pawn " which led to a design containing the earth and a curtain . The inner gatefold picture was taken by Keith Morris and featured the band playing Crowborough Tennis while appearing to give Nazi salutes to each other , though Banton later said this was simply the band attempting to look ridiculous in the vein of Monty Python .

 The album was originally released in October 1971 on Charisma Records . In the US and Canada , the album was distributed via Buddah Records and contained " Theme One " as an extra track between " Lemmings " and " Man @-@ Erg " , which was done without the band 's approval . In Europe , where Pawn Hearts only contained the three tracks , " Theme One " was released as a single in February 1972 , with " W " as its B @-@ side . 
 When the Van der Graaf Generator catalogue was remastered for reissue in 2005 , several of the tracks from the missing half of the album were found and added as bonus tracks . A live , in @-@ studio version of " Squid / Octopus " was added to the H to He , Who Am the Only One reissue , while the Pawn Hearts reissue added " Angle of Incidents " , " <unk> 's Theme " , and " <unk> " . The CD also contained the original mix of " Theme One " , which is different to the one released as a single , and an earlier take of " W " . " Theme One " was also released on the 2003 compilation CD The Best Prog Rock Album in the World ... Ever .

 The album was not commercially successful in the UK . A Record Mirror review said " I have to confess complete ignorance of precisely what Van der Graaf Generator are trying to achieve " , though Melody Maker were more enthusiastic , saying " A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers " is one of the most fascinating and dramatic items I 've ever heard " . However , the album reached number one on the Italian album charts . The group toured Italy to promote the album , where they were treated like superstars and surrounded by army vehicles and riot police . They followed this with a short European tour , during which they filmed a live version of " A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers " for Belgian television . The production took two hours to film as the band had not intended to perform the song live and had forgotten it . The resulting film shows Hammill singing the song while reading a lyric sheet . Regular tours of Europe followed over the next four months , but the strain of the workload became too much for the band , and they split up in August 1972 . 
 Retrospective reviews have been favourable . Q magazine called the album a " misunderstood masterpiece " while Mojo said it was " one of the most extraordinary albums of its era " . Singer @-@ songwriter Fish is a fan of the album , particularly of " A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers " . Julian Cope has called the album " a masterpiece " . Hammill has said , " although a fairly extreme musical statement , [ the album ] contains some of our most cohesive work " . 
 Though " Theme One " did not chart as a single in the UK , John Peel replaced Martin 's original orchestral version with the group 's before closing down Radio 1 each night . The BBC subsequently carried on using Van der Graaf Generator 's version . Martin enjoyed the group 's cover , calling it " a powerful recording that respected the original " .

 Angela 's ( Angela Kinsey ) husband , state Senator Robert Lipton ( Jack Coleman ) , throws a silent auction fundraiser for local animal rights activists and Robert ( James Spader ) buys two tables to seat everyone in the office . Newly fired Andy ( Ed Helms ) arrives and tries to get into an argument with Robert , telling him about a rock opera he has written with the villain being a character named Thomas Oregon . Andy runs into David Wallace , former CFO of Dunder Mifflin , and begins plotting his return to Dunder Mifflin , which later revealed in " Free Family Portrait Studio " , was to convince David to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre , and get the manager position back . Andy interrupts Robert 's speech introducing the senator by volunteering to adopt the twelve dogs brought by the local animal society . Afterwards , members of the office ask if he is having a breakdown , and Andy sadly agrees that he is . 
 Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) attends without understanding the concept of a silent auction , believing the purpose of the function is to guess correctly the market price of the objects . By the end of the night , Dwight has put exorbitant amounts on the items and ends up accidentally donating over $ 34 @,@ 000 . He flees when he discovers his mistake . Meanwhile , Nellie ( Catherine Tate ) tries to talk with Darryl ( Craig Robinson ) by complaining about the food . She suggests they get a taco at her expense , offering thirty dollars to Darryl to go out and buy some . Darryl realizes she has no idea what a taco is , but appreciates that " she 's trying " to socialize with her employees . 
 Oscar ( Oscar Nunez ) talks briefly to Sen. Lipton about animal rights , and Lipton ( who Oscar suspects is gay ) gives Oscar his private cell phone number , asking Oscar to call him in the evening to discuss issues further . Oscar tells Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) and Jim ( John Krasinski ) that the Senator was hitting on him . Jim says Lipton was likely just <unk> a voter , talks to Lipton himself , and also gets his number . Meredith ( Kate Flannery ) later gets Lipton 's number as well , resulting in Oscar thinking that the senator may not have been hitting on him . When Oscar is leaving , Lipton shakes his hand and caresses Oscar 's arm for long enough that Oscar once again believes Lipton was pursuing him .

 The cold opening references several notable bands and musicians : the scene consists of Ryan complaining because he recently heard – erroneously – that notable musician Smokey Robinson died . Initially , Ryan refers to him as only " Smokey " , which causes Pam to believe he is talking about Smokey the Bear . However , Ryan , on the bequest of Pam , is only able to name one song that Robinson sung , " The Tracks of My Tears " . Pam , however , is later able to remember that he sang " Tears of a Clown " , and Jim references " I Second That Emotion " . After Jim proves that Robinson is both still alive and playing at a local venue , Ryan tells him that he will be unable to attend because the opening band is Paul Anka , and that is " not what Smokey would have … does want ! " During his pontificating rant , Ryan mentions that popular music is not all about " Jason Mraz and The Beatles " , which shocks Dwight . Dwight lists of " Eleanor Rigby " and " Paperback Writer " and asks Ryan if he truly does not like those songs .

 The episode received mixed reviews from critics , with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative . Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a slightly positive review and gave it a B- rating . He wrote , " The Office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior , but there ’ s a certain charm to it . " McNutt noted that , despite feeling that the episode 's description of " Darryl teaches Nellie how to eat a taco " was a poor move on NBC 's part , he thought they " could have spent more time with Nellie learning how to eat a taco . " Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode , noting , " For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that actually has a lot going on . Whether the stuff that ’ s happening is actually meaningful or significant in any way is up for debate , but I actually enjoyed most of this episode . " 
 Not all reviews were positive . Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . Forcella noted " It has been four episodes now since the super team returned from Florida , and The Office still hasn 't found its footing back in Scranton " , and he called the outing " another lackluster effort " . A review from CliqueClack was largely critical of the episode , calling it " worse than usual " and noting that the show had finally hit " rock bottom " . WhatCulture ! Reviewer Joseph Kratzer felt that the episode 's setting – outside of the office building – was detrimental to the episode . He wrote , " The thing is , I in no way felt like any of what occurred in ' Fundraiser ' needed to take place outside the Scranton branch and that ’ s really why a sitcom should move locations for an episode – because the story couldn 't function without it . But this time it just felt like a cheap way to liven up a clearly very boring , uninspired , weak episode of television . " Screen Crave wrote , " Those viewers of The Office that have scolded the show throughout the season for its varying degrees of sucking , are not likely to be changing their thinking after watching the latest episode . " 
 However , many reviews were extremely happy about the return of Andy Buckley , who portrayed David Wallace . A review from TV Equals noted that " I ’ m not totally convinced that David Wallace ’ s story is as simple as the one he tells , but maybe that ’ s just because I ’ d love any excuse for him to work his way back into the story lines for The Office . " Michael Tedder from Vulture called Wallace 's character " always @-@ welcome " .

 " Lisa the Skeptic " is the eighth episode of The Simpsons ' ninth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 23 , 1997 . On an archaeological dig with her class , Lisa discovers a skeleton that resembles an angel . All of the townspeople believe that the skeleton actually came from an angel , but skeptical Lisa attempts to persuade them that there must be a rational scientific explanation . The episode 's writer , David X. Cohen , developed the idea after visiting the American Museum of Natural History , and decided to loosely parallel themes from the Scopes Monkey Trial . The episode received generally positive reviews . 
 It has been discussed in the context of virtual reality , ontology , existentialism , and skepticism ; it has also been used in Christian religious education classes to initiate discussion about angels , skepticism , science , and faith . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer attempts to claim a motorboat from a " police raffle " that turns out to be a sting operation . While returning home , the family passes a new mall in Springfield that is being built on an area where a large number of fossils were found . Lisa protests strongly , which prompts the school to conduct an archaeological dig . During the excavations , Lisa finds a human skeleton with wings . Springfield 's residents are convinced it is an angel , and Homer cashes in by moving the skeleton into the family 's garage . Lisa remains skeptical , and asks Stephen Jay Gould to test a sample . When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house the next day to tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive , Lisa goes on television to compare the belief in angels to the belief in unicorns and leprechauns . In response , Springfield 's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions . Appalled with the violence , Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton , but finds that it has disappeared . The mob soon converges on the Simpson household , and Lisa is promptly arrested and put on trial for destroying the skeleton . 
 Before the trial begins , the courtroom 's attention is diverted when the skeleton appears outside , carrying a foreboding message that " The End " will come at sundown . Sundown approaches , and Springfield 's citizens are frightened , but nothing catastrophic occurs . As Lisa starts to reprimand them , the skeleton suddenly silences her and is hoisted over to the entrance of the new Heavenly Hills Mall . Lisa realizes that whole saga was a publicity stunt for the mall . The bargain @-@ loving public ignores Lisa and goes shopping . Marge says that , for a few seconds while it was rising , Lisa believed the angel was real . Lisa denies this , but admits she was frightened and thanks her mother for her support . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Lisa the Skeptic " was written by David X. Cohen , and directed by Neil Affleck . Cohen was inspired to write the episode after a trip to Manhattan 's American Museum of Natural History , where he decided to turn the visit into a " business trip " , and think of a possible episode connection to the museum . He initially wanted Lisa to find a " missing link " skeleton , and do an episode reminiscent of the Scopes Monkey Trial . Writer George Meyer convinced him instead to have the focus be on an angel skeleton , while keeping an emphasis on the conflict between religion and science . Both Cohen and Meyer acknowledged how silly the " angel skeleton " idea was owing to simple questions raised such as why an angel died and why bones were left behind , but they went forward with the idea anyway . 
 In an early draft of the script , the skeleton was made of pastry dough baked by the mall 's window dresser . Cohen had initially written the Stephen Jay Gould role as a generic scientist or paleontologist , not knowing that they would eventually get Gould . He had taken Gould 's Introduction to Paleontology class at Harvard University . The only phrase Gould had objected to in the script was a line that introduced him as the " world 's most brilliant paleontologist " . His original final line was " I didn 't do the test . I had more important work to do " but was cut because the writers felt it would be funnier to give him a short final line . In an earlier version of the episode , Marge would have ended up apologizing to Lisa for not supporting her , letting the ending be more of a nod to Lisa 's correct assumptions all along . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Author <unk> Wood compared " Lisa the Skeptic " to an alternate reality game , in analyzing the effects of watching the television program Lost on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality . Dan O 'Brien cited the episode in a discussion of ontology , skepticism , and religious faith , in his book An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge . O 'Brien leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not Lisa was justified in her skepticism . In The Simpsons and Philosophy : The D 'oh ! of Homer , " Lisa the Skeptic " is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a nerd . The book also cited the episode in noting that Lisa is not infallible , for when the Angel appeared to speak at the end of the episode she became as frightened as everyone else . Lisa 's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by Turner 's Planet Simpson : How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented Defined a Generation as yet another example of her conflict with corporations throughout the series . Like O 'Brien , Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa 's questions about existentialism , self @-@ absorption , and consumption . In The Psychology of the Simpsons : D 'oh ! , the authors discuss Lisa 's level of anger displayed in the episode , noting that in this particular case her anger gave her the wherewithal both to confront social injustice , and keep her mind clear for critical thinking . Mark <unk> of Allmovie noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason , while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode . 
 In their 2010 book The Simpsons in the Classroom , Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay note that the episode is one of the best for teachers and professors to use in religion or cultural studies courses , noting the irony that though Lisa is the only skeptic through most of the episode , she is the only one who is offended at the publicity stunt . Parvin 's The Gospel According to the Simpsons : Leader 's Guide for Group Study is a group study guide companion to Pinsky 's The Gospel According to the Simpsons . In the section pertaining to " Lisa the Skeptic " , a skeptic is defined as : " a person who doubts , questions , or suspends judgment on ideas generally accepted by others " . The study group is asked to debate the episode in the context of skepticism as related to other unexplained phenomena , including UFOs , the Loch Ness Monster , the Abominable Snowman , the Bermuda Triangle , Atlantis , near @-@ death experiences , reincarnation , mediumship , psychics , and fortune @-@ telling . In Pinsky 's book itself , he noted that Lisa faced the difficult task of confronting religious hysteria and blind faith , and also attempted to reconcile science within her own belief system . He also wrote that when Lisa asks Stephen Jay Gould to estimate the age of the skeleton , the issue is never raised of why angels or other spiritual entities would even leave skeletons behind in the first place . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The scene in the courtroom where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton is seen as a reference to the 1920s Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton , Tennessee , which dealt with issues of separation of church and state and the debate between creationism and evolution . The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific hoaxes such as the Cardiff Giant and the Piltdown Man . When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt , Chief Wiggum is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a Pottery Barn in the new Heavenly Hills mall . A shot of the diggers in silhouette against the sunset is modeled after Raiders of the Lost Ark ( 1981 ) .

 In its original broadcast , " Lisa the Skeptic " finished 37th in ratings for the week of November 17 – 23 , 1997 , with a Nielsen rating of 9 @.@ 5 , equivalent to approximately 9 @.@ 3 million viewing households . It was the third highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The X @-@ Files and King of the Hill . 
 Donald Liebenson wrote for the Amazon.com movie review that " Bart Sells His Soul " and " Lisa the Skeptic " were among the best episodes of The Simpsons . He also noted , " Without being preachy ( or particularly funny ) , this episode is pretty potent stuff " , citing the theme of <unk> towards the end of the episode . In the July 26 , 2007 issue of Nature , the scientific journal 's editorial staff listed the episode among " The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons " . " Lisa the Skeptic " was utilized in a Salt Lake City Episcopal Church Sunday School class in 2003 , to stimulate a discussion among fourteen @-@ year @-@ olds about belief in angels , and the juxtaposition of science and faith . The episode was compared and contrasted with Proverbs 14 : 15 . 
 The episode is used by the Farmington Trust ( UK ) for Christian religious education , to teach children about skepticism . The episode is used as a tool , to involve the students in a debate about religion and science , as well as to discuss Lisa 's own skepticism , and her respect towards others . A group of The Simpsons enthusiasts at Calvin College have also analyzed the religious and philosophical aspects of the episode , including the issue of faith versus science . The episode has been compared with Gabriel García Márquez 's short story " A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings " and utilized as a teaching tool in a Saugerties , New York grade school class . In an exam on the subject , students were asked to use details from both " A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings " and " Lisa the Skeptic " , in order to analyze the quotation " Appearances can be deceiving " . 
 = Yoga = 
 Yoga ( / <unk> / ; Sanskrit , <unk> Listen ) is a physical , mental , and spiritual practice or discipline which originated in ancient India . There is a broad variety of Yoga schools , practices , and goals in Hinduism , Buddhism , and Jainism . Among the most well @-@ known types of yoga are Hatha yoga and <unk> yoga . 
 The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre @-@ Vedic Indian traditions , it is mentioned in the Rigveda , but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE , in ancient India 's ascetic and śramaṇa movements . The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga @-@ practices is unclear , varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads and Buddhist Pāli Canon , probably of third century BCE or later . The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE , but only gained prominence in the West in the 20th century . Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra . 
 Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the west , following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century . In the 1980s , yoga became popular as a system of physical exercise across the Western world . Yoga in Indian traditions , however , is more than physical exercise , it has a meditative and spiritual core . One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called Yoga , which has its own epistemology and metaphysics , and is closely related to Hindu Samkhya philosophy . 
 Many studies have tried to determine the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer , schizophrenia , asthma , and heart disease . The results of these studies have been mixed and inconclusive , with cancer studies suggesting none to unclear effectiveness , and others suggesting yoga may reduce risk factors and aid in a patient 's psychological healing process .
