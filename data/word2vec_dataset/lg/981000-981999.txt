 The novel 's language is viewed as rife with labeling and product placements . Postmodern theorist Fredric Jameson calls it " a kind of hyped @-@ up name @-@ dropping ... [ where ] an encyclopaedic familiarity with the fashions ... [ creates ] class status as a matter of knowing the score rather than of having money and power " . He also calls it " postmodern nominalism " in that the names express the new and fashionable . This name @-@ dropping demonstrates how commercialism has created and named new objects and experiences and renamed ( or re @-@ created ) some that already existed . This naming includes nationalities ; there are eight references to nationality ( or locality ) in the first three pages . Zeidner wrote that the novel 's " new century is unsettlingly transitional making it difficult to maintain an individual identity " . One character argues that " there will soon be no national identity left … [ as ] all experience [ will be ] reduced , by the spectral hand of marketing , to price @-@ point variations on the same thing . " This is juxtaposed against the footage that contains no hints of time period or location . Globalization is represented by characters of varying nationalities , ease of international travel , portable instant communication , and commercial monoculture recognizable across international markets . As an example , Gibson writes how one ‘ yes or no ' decision by Cayce on the logo will impact the lives of the people in remote places who will manufacture the logos and how it will infect their dreams .

 While some reviewers regard the novel as a thriller , others see it as an example of post @-@ millennial science fiction with stories set in the " <unk> future @-@ present " . Some reviewers note that the novel furthers the post @-@ millennial trend in science fiction of illustrating society 's inability to imagine a definitive future and the use of technologies once considered advanced or academic now commonplace within society and its vernacular . Gibson said that the only science fiction elements are " [ t ] he Footage and Cayce 's special talents " but that he " never bought that conceit that science fiction is about the future " . Dennis Danvers explained the use of science fiction as a narrative strategy : 
 [ s ] <unk> fiction , in effect , has become a narrative strategy , a way of approaching story , in which not only characters must be invented , but the world and its ways as well , without resorting to magic or the supernatural , where the fantasy folks work . A realist wrestling with the woes of the middle class can leave the world out of it by and large except for an occasional swipe at the shallowness of suburbia . A science fiction writer must invent the world where the story takes place , often from the ground up , a process usually called world @-@ building . In other words , in a science fiction novel , the world itself is a distinctive and crucial character in the plot , without whom the story could not take place , whether it 's the world of Dune or Neuromancer or 1984 . The world is the story as much as the story is in the world . Part of Gibson 's point ... is that we live in a time of such accelerated change and layered realities , that we 're all in that boat , like it or not . A novel set in the " real world " now has to answer the question , " Which one ? " 
 These elements , and the use of the September 11 , 2001 attacks as a breaking point from the past , led academics to label it a postmodern novel . The attacks mark the point where the ' modern ' , that is the 20th @-@ century certainty in society 's advancement towards a better future , changed to the ' postmodern ' , that is the 21st @-@ century uncertainty in which future will develop . Fredric Jameson finds Gibson using culture as the determinant of change for the first time with this novel , rather than technology . Jameson focuses on the novel 's " postmodern nominalism " that uses brand names to refresh old objects and experiences . 
 In post @-@ structural literary theory Cayce is compared with the main character , <unk> Maas , of Thomas Pynchon 's The Crying of Lot 49 as detectives interpreting clues but with neither the character nor the reader knowing if there actually is a pattern to be found and , if there is one , whether it is real or conspiracy . Gibson 's use of name @-@ dropping brands to create a sense of " in @-@ group style … of those in the know " is traced back to Thomas Pynchon 's 1963 novel V. . Gibson 's writing style is said to be similar to Raymond Chandler 's detective stories and Alfred Hitchcock 's thrillers that used MacGuffins ( the identity of the maker of the footage , in this case ) to drive the story . Gibson 's social observations are influenced by the works of Naomi Klein and Malcolm Gladwell . 
 While markedly different from his previous writing , in that it is not set in an imaginary future with imaginary technologies , Pattern Recognition includes many of his previous elements , including impacts of technology shifts on society , Japanese computer experts and Russian mafia figures . In common with Gibson 's previous work , Paul Di Filippo found the following in Pattern Recognition : " the close observation of the culture 's bleeding edge ; an analysis of the ways technology molds our every moment ; the contrasting of boardroom with street ; the impossibility and dire necessity of making art in the face of instant co @-@ optation ; the damaged loner facing the powers @-@ that @-@ be , for both principle and profit " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Pattern Recognition was released on February 3 , 2003 as Gibson launched a 15 @-@ city tour . The novel was featured on the January 19 cover of The New York Times Book Review . In the American market it peaked at number four on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction on February 23 and spent nine weeks on USA Today 's Top 150 Best @-@ Selling Books peaking at number 34 . In the Canadian market , the novel peaked at number three on The Globe and Mail 's best seller list on February 15 in the hardcover fiction category . The novel was shortlisted for the 2004 Arthur C. Clarke Award and the British Science Fiction Association Award . 
 Gibson 's writing was positively received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers , <unk> Jane Dorsey , and Rudy Rucker . Rucker has written : " [ w ] ith a poet 's touch , he tiles words into wonderful mosaics " and Danvers wrote that " no sentence has a subject if it can do without one " . One critic found the prose to be as " hard and compact as glacier ice " and another that it " gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity " . Gibson 's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo , Russia and London were singled out as impressive , and The Village Voice 's review remarked that " Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board : the coffee @-@ shop intimacy , the fishbowl paranoia , the splintering factions , the inevitable flame war " . Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated : 
 As usual , Gibson 's prose is ... corpuscular , crenelated . His sentences slide from silk to steel , and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest . But he never gets lost in the language , as he sometimes has in the past . Structurally , this may be his most confident novel . The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed , right down to their personal e @-@ mail styles . Without any metafictional grandstanding , Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture : how it feels to be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room , or to fret about someone spying on your browser 's list of sites visited . 
 Filled with name @-@ dropping of businesses and products , such as <unk> , Hotmail , iBook , Netscape , and G4 , the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be " awkward in its effort to appear " cool " " while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel . The Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette review commented that the " constant , unadulterated " hipster @-@ technocrat , cyber @-@ MTV " lingo [ is ] overdone and inappropriate " On the technology , Cory Doctorow found Gibson 's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that " Gibson is no technologist , he 's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor . But ... Gibson 's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book " . 
 Some critics found the plot to be a conventional " unravel @-@ the @-@ secret " and " woman on a quest " thriller . Toby Litt wrote that " [ j ] <unk> just as a thriller , Pattern Recognition takes too long to kickstart , gives its big secrets away before it should and never puts the heroine in believable peril " . The conclusion , called " unnecessarily pat " by one critic , was compared by Litt with the " ultimate fantasy ending of 1980s movies – the heroine has lucked out without selling out , has kept her integrity but still ended up filthy rich . " The review in the Library Journal called the novel a " melodrama of beset <unk> " that " may well reveal the emptiness at the core of Gibson 's other fiction " , but recommended it for all libraries due to the author 's popularity .

 = Reverberation ( album ) = 
 Reverberation is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen . The album was released amidst a line @-@ up change for the group , due to the departure of vocalist Ian McCulloch and the death of drummer Pete de Freitas . The remaining members , guitarist Will Sergeant and bassist Les Pattinson , were joined by ex @-@ St. Vitus Dance singer Noel Burke , keyboard player Jake Brockman and drummer Damon Reece . The album was produced by former engineer for The Beatles Geoff Emerick at Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey , England , and had a more pronounced psychedelic sound than the group 's previous releases . 
 Following the album 's December 1990 release , critical reviews were not favourable ; critics noted Burke to be a poor replacement for McCulloch , who they believed was an indispensable aspect of the band . After Reverberation failed to chart , the band were dropped by WEA Records and , after two independently released singles , disbanded in 1993 . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 During August and September 1987 , Echo & the Bunnymen co @-@ headlined a tour of the United States with popular electronic group New Order . Despite the tour passing without incident , the performances were deemed to be of poor quality . Although American audiences were apparently satisfied by the shows , when the group returned to the United Kingdom for an autumn tour the British music press and audiences were not as equally enthusiastic . Shortly thereafter the band announced plans to record a self @-@ produced album of " savage rock " when there was more free time . The group toured the UK and the US again in early 1988 . These concerts were more positively received than their tour the previous year , with guitarist Will Sergeant being singled out for praise – BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel said , " Will Sergeant was superb , moving in a <unk> from squalls of angry sound to playing with such care and subtlety that there were whispered asides from his guitar that I would have sworn only he and I had heard . " In March 1988 , the band released a cover version of The Doors ' song " People Are Strange " . However , this failed to impress critics ; music paper Melody Maker called it a " rancid effort " and Q said the band had " thrown in the towel " . 
 Following a Japanese tour in April 1988 , Echo & the Bunnymen 's lead singer , Ian McCulloch , announced that the band were going to split up . Following the announcement , McCulloch returned to the United Kingdom to visit his father who had just suffered two heart attacks but was too late as he died shortly before arriving . After five months of speculation as to whether the split up was genuine , McCulloch met with the other members of the band in September 1988 and , despite the group 's attempts to change his mind , told them he was leaving the band . McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview , " The last days of The Bunnymen consisted of a bunch of people who were more interested in changing oil in their cars than rock ' n ' roll . That pissed me off . I was doing every sodding interview , writing sodding every song . " Having been persuaded by Rob Dickins at WEA that the band could still be a success in the United States , Sergeant told McCulloch that he and the other two band members , bassist Les Pattinson and drummer Pete de Freitas , planned to continue . After a failed attempt to record with The B @-@ 52 's singers Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson , the band advertised for a full @-@ time replacement . 
 While McCulloch was recording his debut solo album , <unk> ( 1989 ) , Echo & the Bunnymen promoted long @-@ time touring keyboard player Jake Brockman to a full @-@ time band member position . In April 1989 , after listening to an album by the defunct band St. Vitus Dance which had been recommended by Geoff Davies of Probe Records in Liverpool , Sergeant felt that the band 's singer Noel Burke would work well within the context of the band 's sound . After a meeting with the band and being reassured that they did not want a McCulloch clone , Burke agreed to join . However , tragedy struck when on 14 June 1989 de Freitas died in a motorcycle accident on his way to the band 's first rehearsal . The band recruited Damon Reece , a friend of Brockman , as drummer in de Freitas 's place and began rehearsals . The new line @-@ up played their first string of performances in mid @-@ March 1990 with a mixture of old and new material . McCulloch allegedly described this incarnation of the band as " Echo & the <unk> " but later attributed the comment to the former The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr . Sergeant later said that keeping the name was " down to wanting to take a bitter swipe at [ McCulloch ] " . 
 The new line @-@ up entered Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey , England in mid @-@ May 1990 to record the new album with producer Geoff Emerick , who had previously been the engineer for several albums by The Beatles . While recording the album Emerick would sit on the stairs outside the studio so that he could " listen to the mix properly " . Emerick employed the use of instruments such as sitars and tabla as well as backwards guitar loops . The album contained many of Sergeant 's favoured psychedelic influences . 
 = = Release , reception and aftermath = = 
 " Enlighten Me " , released in October 1990 , was the only single to be released from Reverberation . The single fared badly on the UK Singles Chart only reaching number ninety @-@ six , although it reached number eight on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States . The album 's release followed in December 1990 , and Echo & the Bunnymen immediately went on a seventeen @-@ date tour that focused on the United Kingdom and Ireland . The tour received good reviews , with Melody Maker describing the band as " an object lesson in how to survive and prosper " . However , the reviews of the album were not as good . Awarding the album two and a half stars out of five , Tim DiGravina , who reviewed the album for Allmusic , said , " Echo & the Bunnymen doesn 't exist without the distinctive voice of Ian McCulloch " . Although he added that the album would have been a " great debut " had the band decided to record under a different name . Bob Mack , reviewing the album for Entertainment Weekly was more forceful in putting the album down . He described the sound of the album as " hopelessly in thrall to the brand of pale pseudo @-@ psychedelia [ the band ] helped popularise during the past decade " . He went on to describe Burke and most of the songs as " nondescript " . He finished his review by saying " this is a turkey best left to be gobbled up by the band 's relatives , close friends , and diehard fans " . 
 Failing to make the UK Albums Chart , Reverberation was the poorest performing Echo & the Bunnymen album at that time . Echo & the Bunnymen were dropped by WEA Records in early 1991 . After touring East Asia , the band launched their own label , Euphoric Records , in October 1991 with the release of their self @-@ produced single " Prove Me Wrong " . The release of another single , " Inside Me , Inside You " , followed in March 1992 . With neither of the singles released on Euphoric reaching the UK Singles Chart , the band undertook an extensive tour of the United States before finally disbanding in early 1993 .

 = South African general election , 2014 = 
 The 2014 South African general election was held on 7 May 2014 , to elect a new National Assembly and new provincial legislatures in each province . It was the fifth election held in South Africa under conditions of universal adult suffrage since the end of the apartheid era in 1994 , and also the first held since the death of Nelson Mandela . It was also the first time that South African expatriates were allowed to vote in a South African national election . 
 The National Assembly election was won by the African National Congress ( ANC ) , but with a reduced majority of 62 @.@ 1 % , down from 65 @.@ 9 % in the 2009 election . The official opposition Democratic Alliance ( DA ) increased its share of the vote from 16 @.@ 7 % to 22 @.@ 2 % , while the newly formed Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) obtained 6 @.@ 4 % of the vote . 
 Eight of the nine provincial legislatures were won by the ANC . The EFF obtained over 10 % of the vote in Gauteng , Limpopo and North West , and beat the DA to second place in the last two . In the other six provinces won by the ANC , the DA obtained second place . This included KwaZulu @-@ Natal , where the DA for the first time beat the Inkatha Freedom Party to second place . In the Western Cape , the only province not won by the ANC , the DA increased its majority from 51 @.@ 5 % to 59 @.@ 4 % .

 South Africa has a parliamentary system of government ; the National Assembly consists of 400 members elected by proportional representation with a closed list approach . Two hundred members are elected from national party lists ; the other 200 are elected from provincial party lists in each of the nine provinces . The President of South Africa was chosen by the National Assembly after the election . 
 The provincial legislatures , which vary in size from 30 to 80 members , are also elected by proportional representation with closed lists . The premiers of each province will be chosen by the winning majority in each provincial legislature . 
 The National Council of Provinces ( NCOP ) consists of 90 members , ten elected by each provincial legislature . The NCOP members will be elected by the provincial legislatures in proportion to the party makeup of the legislatures .

Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as Deputy President of the ANC , succeeding <unk> who had declined a second term after losing to Zuma . 
 The official opposition Democratic Alliance ( DA ) received 16 @.@ 7 % of the vote in 2009 , up from 12 @.@ 4 % in 2004 . The DA is led by Helen Zille , who was re @-@ elected unopposed as Leader of the Democratic Alliance at the party 's Federal Congress in Gauteng in 2012 , while <unk> <unk> continued as Leader of the Opposition in Parliament . At provincial level , the DA has been in power in the Western Cape province since 2009 , and came to power in several Western Cape municipalities in the 2011 municipal election . Traditionally , the DA was seen as a party rallying against apartheid laws , especially in the 1980 's . However , one of its larger following bases are the whites in the south , especially after it absorbed the New National Party in 2001 ( although <unk> was disbanded in 2004 ) . 
 Congress of the People ( COPE ) , is led by <unk> <unk> , although the leadership is disputed by <unk> <unk> who continues to battle for recognition in the High Court . The party has been riven by infighting , causing it to lose much of its support and resulting in the formation of a splinter group , the United Congress .

The parties in the coalition , named the Collective for Democracy ( CD ) and chaired by COPE leader <unk> <unk> , will retain their own identity and contest the election individually . The IFP denied being part of the coalition , saying they were wary of forming such alliances given the confusion it had caused for their supporters in previous elections . Three days later , the 20th , COSATU 's largest affiliate National Union of <unk> of South Africa ( NUMSA ) announced that they would not endorse the ANC or any other political party in 2014 . NUMSA planned to establish a new working class collective along the lines of the defunct United Democratic Front , with the ultimate goal of forming a socialist party that will contest the 2019 general election . An opposing COSATU faction has obtained a legal opinion on removing NUMSA from COSATU , with significant implications for the country 's labour and political landscape . 
 On 28 January 2014 , the DA announced that Mamphela Ramphele had accepted an invitation to stand as its presidential candidate in the 2014 general election , and the DA and Agang South Africa were set to merge . On the 31st , Ramphele stated that she would not take up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa , resulting in confusion . On 2 February , Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA 's presidential candidate .

 According to an internal poll conducted by the DA with American pollster Stan Greenberg in March – April 2014 , the ANC would get 59 % of the vote , the DA 26 % and the EFF 8 % . 
 In an Ipsos survey of 1 @,@ 000 registered ANC members conducted for the Sunday Times in December 2013 , 55 % of respondents said they will vote for the ANC again , 5 % said they will vote for the DA , 6 % said they will vote for other parties , and the remaining 34 % said they did not know or preferred not to answer . 
 According to the results of an Ipsos Pulse of the People survey published in February 2014 , the DA is the most multi @-@ racial party while the ANC has 96 % black supporters and the EFF has 99 % black supporters , relative to 76 % black survey respondents . The age profile of ANC supporters closely resembles the age profile of voters , while DA supporters are slightly older overall and EFF supporters are significantly younger overall .

 The Ipsos Pulse of the People survey undertaken in October and November 2013 showed that a number of provinces would be closely contested . The ANC will continue to dominate in the Eastern Cape , Limpopo , North West , Mpumalanga , KwaZulu @-@ Natal and Free State . The DA will keep the Western Cape while control of the Northern Cape and Gauteng will be contested between the ANC and DA , with other parties holding the balance of power , so coalitions may be decisive . In Limpopo and North West the EFF could become the official opposition . 
 The Ipsos / Sunday Times survey undertaken in February and March 2014 showed that the ANC enjoyed majority support in all provinces except the Western Cape , where the DA retains majority support . DA support followed that of the ANC in all other provinces except for the North West , where the EFF came in second place .

 The South African Broadcasting Corporation ( SABC ) broadcast weekly election debates from February to May 2014 . They were broadcast between 6pm and 7pm on SABC 1 and streamed live on the SABC 's YouTube channel . 
 The following debates took place : 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 In January 2014 , Helen Zille announced that the DA would be marching to Luthuli House , the ANC 's headquarters , saying , “ We are taking the fight to Luthuli House to highlight the failure of ( President ) Jacob Zuma 's ANC to cut corruption and create jobs . ” Zille said that 6000 people would be marching , each one representing 1000 South Africans who would benefit from the 6 million jobs that the DA promised to create if it came to power . The planned date of the march was 4 February 2014 , but this was later changed to the 12th due to logistical problems . The Johannesburg Metro Police Department ( JMPD ) initially denied the DA 's application to march but the decision was overturned on 3 February 2014 when the DA took the matter to the Johannesburg High Court . On the 11th , it was reported that the JMPD had set the march perimeters to prevent the DA from marching to Luthuli House . JMPD spokesperson , Chief Superintendent Wayne <unk> said , " The protest march by the DA ... has been prohibited on the grounds that there would be a security risk to protesters . " The DA announced that the march would now end at Beyers Naude Square . On the day of the march , an application to stop the DA march filed by the ANC to the South Gauteng High Court was dismissed . 
 The march ended early after the DA was confronted by ANC supporters 40 minutes into the march . Stones and petrol bombs were thrown by ANC supporters at police trying to calm the situation . 
 On 13 March , violence erupted in the Bekkersdal township in Gauteng , the scene of violent service delivery protests in 2013 . Residents staged a protest over a planned ANC campaign in the area , barricading the streets with rocks and burning tyres and pelting ANC officials and police vehicles with stones . Police responded to the volatile situation by firing rubber bullets at residents . 
 Shortly after Public Protector <unk> Madonsela 's final report on security upgrades to President Jacob Zuma 's private residence at Nkandla was published on 19 March , the DA sent a bulk text message to Gauteng voters which reads : " The Nkandla report shows how Zuma stole your money to build his <unk> home . Vote DA on 7 May to beat corruption . Together for change . " The ANC submitted an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court to stop distribution of the text message on the grounds that it violated the Electoral Act . On 4 April , the court ruled that the wording of the message was fair comment and dismissed the ANC 's application with costs . The ANC was granted leave to appeal the decision . On 6 May , the Electoral Court ruled that the DA must retract the text message , finding that it wrongly targeted Zuma personally instead of the systematic failures highlighted in Madonsela 's report . The court case was ultimately won by the DA when the Constitutional Court set aside the Electoral Court ruling on 19 January 2015 . 
 On 5 April , a marquee , a stage , a sound system and chairs set up for an EFF rally in <unk> were petrol bombed in the early hours of the morning . EFF spokesperson , <unk> <unk> said that the EFF suspected ANC members were responsible for the sabotage . ANC spokesperson Jackson <unk> denied the allegations , saying " We don 't do such things . " 
 The following day , the DA accused the ANC of abusing state resources after the South African Social Security Agency ( <unk> ) was seen giving out blankets and toiletries at an ANC rally in Parys . ANC spokesperson <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> denied the accusation , saying that the ANC did not know <unk> would be at the rally . 
 Four days later , the DA submitted a complaint to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa ( ICASA ) about censorship by the public broadcaster after the SABC informed the DA it would not continue broadcasting a DA television advert titled " ANC <unk> " , meaning " the ANC 's not the same " , and five DA radio adverts aired on 8 and 9 April 2014 . According to the DA 's <unk> Maimane , who appears in the television advert , the SABC banned all DA adverts from 11 public radio stations as well as the television advert . ICASA announced that it would hold public hearings on the matter on Thursday the 17th , 6 days after the DA lodged their complaint . Following the DA 's announcement that it would submit an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court requesting a ruling on the adverts before the long Easter weekend commencing Good Friday , the day after ICASA 's proposed public hearing date , the ICASA hearings commenced 2 days earlier than originally scheduled . On the day after the hearing , the ban was lifted temporarily as the SABC had failed to provide reasons for the ban during the ICASA hearings and requested more time to prepare a response . The DA also objected to the SABC not allowing the national official opposition party to participate in a televised election debate on land reform on <unk> the first 2 weeks of April . On 25 April , ICASA upheld the SABC 's ban on the television advert finding that it contravened ICASA 's regulations on party election broadcasts . ICASA ordered that a photograph taken by The Citizen photographer <unk> Russell of a police officer firing rubber bullets at unarmed residents during the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest be removed from the advert as " the police should not be seen as a threat to the community " . In the advert , Maimane says " We 've seen a police force killing our own people " while the photograph is shown on the screen . The South African Police Service had earlier submitted a complaint to ICASA that this footage would incite violence against police officers . 
 On 15 April 2014 , a protest campaign against corruption with the slogan " <unk> ! <unk> ! ( Wake up ! We are Fed up ! ) Vote No " , supported by over 100 ANC veterans , was launched by former government ministers Ronnie <unk> and <unk> <unk> @-@ Routledge . The IEC has requested a legal opinion on whether the campaign contravenes the Electoral Act . The campaign urges ANC supporters to either spoil their votes or vote for a smaller party . Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu welcomed the campaign , and human rights activist and cleric Barney <unk> describes it as " a campaign to bring rationality , order , morality and decency back into our electoral system " in a Mail & Guardian opinion piece . 
 On the same day , United Democratic Movement leader Bantu <unk> announced that lawyers acting on behalf of several opposition parties concerned about the credibility of the general election would approach the Electoral Court following the IEC chairperson Pansy Tlakula 's refusal to agree to their call for her resignation . Public Protector <unk> Madonsela found Tlakula had been involved in building procurement irregularities in a report published in August 2013 , and a subsequent National Treasury review published in March 2014 supported her findings . Five days before the election , the Electoral Court postponed the inquiry into her conduct until 2 June 2014 , as it would not be able to rule on the matter before the 7 May election date . On 18 June , the Electoral Court recommended Tlakula 's removal from office due to financial misconduct . Tlakula resigned as IEC chairperson on 1 September after an unsuccessful application to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal the Electoral Court ruling . 
 On 22 April , the EFF also lodged a complaint with ICASA after the SABC banned an EFF election campaign television advert titled " Now is the time for economic freedom " that was due to be aired on 2 occasions , 2 days before the complaint was lodged and on the day the complaint was lodged . Four days after the complaint was lodged , ICASA upheld the SABC 's ban on the advert . ICASA found that wording in the advert about physically destroying contentious e @-@ tolls in Gauteng could incite violence and therefore contravened ICASA 's regulations on party election broadcasts . The EFF advert had also highlighted police brutality , using interviews and photographs related to the <unk> massacre and the same photograph of the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest that ICASA ordered removed from the DA advert . 
 Nine days before the election , a Parliamentary committee set up to consider Zuma 's response to Madonsela 's final Nkandla report was referred to the next Parliament to be formed after the election , citing insufficient time available before the 7 May election date . 
 Two days before the election , Zuma spoke about the Nkandla scandal at a media briefing , saying it was only an issue with the media and the opposition , " the bright people ... very clever people " , and not an issue with ANC voters . 
 On the day before the election , it was reported that the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( NSPCA ) had ambushed election campaign posters by attaching matching NSPCA posters to the bottom of them . NSPCA spokesperson , Christine Kuch said that the NSPCA campaign hoped to get more political parties to include animal rights in their manifestos .

 = Analytical Review = 
 The Analytical Review was an English periodical that was published from 1788 to 1798 , having been established in London by the publisher Joseph Johnson and the writer Thomas Christie . Part of the Republic of Letters , it was a gadfly publication , which offered readers summaries and analyses of the many new publications issued at the end of the eighteenth century . 
 Perhaps most important , the Analytical Review provided a forum for radical political and religious ideas . Although it aimed at impartiality , its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries . While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day , it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger . In late 1797 , the Anti @-@ Jacobin Review , the self @-@ styled nemesis of the Analytical Review , was founded by supporters of the government and other reactionary interests ; it criticized the radical politics of the Analytical and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments . 
 Organized into separate departments , each with its own chief reviewer , the Analytical Review focused on politics , philosophy , natural history , and literature . To promote a disinterested air , its reviewers were anonymous , signing their work with pseudonymous initials . Nevertheless , the journal recruited several prominent writers , such as the poet William Cowper , the moralist William Enfield , the physician John Aikin and the polemicist Mary Wollstonecraft . 
 The Analytical Review suspended publication in December 1798 after the deaths of Christie ( 1796 ) and Wollstonecraft ( 1797 ) , the conviction of Johnson for seditious libel ( 1798 ) and the retirement of other contributing editors .

 The Whig Monthly Review , founded in 1749 by Ralph Griffiths , and the Tory Critical Review , founded in 1756 by Tobias Smollett , were the first journals dedicated to reviewing books in Britain . Although they were joined by smaller publications such as the Analytical Review , these two journals dominated reviewing in the second half of the eighteenth century . They focused on poetry , novels , drama , belles @-@ lettres , travel literature , biographies , science writing and other forms of popular literature . They did not review many complex theological or scholarly works , particularly those in foreign languages . 
 Just prior to the founding of the Analytical Review , two periodicals with similar aims had collapsed . The first was the Theological Repository ( 1770 – 73 ; 1784 – 88 ) , whose driving force was Dissenting theologian , clergyman , and scientist Joseph Priestley . Its articles were intended to be rigorously analytical and attempted to " settl [ e ] the [ Biblical ] text by a comparison of various readings ; by accurate translation , division , and punctuation ; by a concise , well @-@ digested commentary ; by notes philosophical and explanatory ; and finally by adding doctrinal and moral conclusions " . Sold by Joseph Johnson at a low price to encourage a wide readership , the Repository was open to all opinions , provided that they were expressed courteously : " In this Repository not only will room be given to the freest objections to natural or revealed religion , but they are sincerely requested ; and nothing that is new will be rejected , if it be expressed in decent terms " . Although the Theological Repository was a financial liability for Johnson by 1771 , he continued to publish it until 1773 and helped Priestley renew its publication in 1784 . 
 A second forerunner of the Analytical Review was Paul Henry <unk> 's periodical A New Review ( published 1782 – 86 ) , which was likewise devoted to reviewing books and offering a summary of their contents . Like its successor , the New Review paid special attention to foreign literature and took a leading role in introducing German literature to the British public . 
 = = = Founding and ideals = = = 
 The demises of the Theological Repository and the New Review left a publishing vacuum ; the arrival in London of the author Thomas Christie , who was dedicated to starting a new periodical that would replace and perhaps even improve upon these precursors , was the primary impetus in the creation of the Analytical Review . Johnson and Christie were mutual friends of Priestley and others , and their combined interest in beginning such a journal resulted in the foundation of the Analytical Review . 
 Johnson and Christie 's prospectus describes its reviewers as " the <unk> of the Republic of Letters " [ emphasis in original ] . Literary scholar Paul Keen has described the Republic of Letters as a vision of society in which " all rational individuals could have their say , and in which an increasingly enlightened reading public would be able to judge the merit of different arguments for themselves " . The practical goal of the Analytical Review was to facilitate this society by summarizing serious new and foreign publications in great depth so that intelligent readers might form their own opinions . This aim was embodied in its initial title : The Analytical Review ; or , History of Literature , domestic and foreign , on an enlarged plan . Containing Scientific Abstracts of important and interesting Works , published in English ; a general account of such as are of less consequence , with short characters ; Notices , or Reviews of valuable foreign Books ; Criticism on New pieces of Music and Works of Art ; and the Literary Intelligence of Europe , etc . The periodical sought to avoid ephemeral works and to review only " standard works which add to the stock of human knowledge and will live beyond a day " . Johnson and Christie also intended to eschew editorializing and to avoid shaping the tastes of the public . <unk> attention to this point was meant to bring the reviewed work into the foreground and not the reviewer ( a goal shared by many eighteenth @-@ century journals ) . An early review , for example , criticized historian Edward Gibbon for " so frequently and unnecessarily <unk> his particular prejudices on the eye of his readers " . All editors signed their reviews with initials ( sometimes not their own ) rather than with their names . This practice was meant to prevent the appearance of collusion between the reviewers and the authors reviewed , although this did not succeed in practice . It was also intended to prevent any unethical puffing , or false advertising , of friends ' or one 's own books ; nevertheless , both Henry Fuseli and Mary Wollstonecraft reviewed their own books for the journal . 
 In repackaging other publications for its readers , the Analytical Review participated in the encyclopedic movement of the eighteenth century , a movement largely begun by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d 'Alembert 's Encyclopédie . Excited and yet overwhelmed by what they viewed as a dramatic increase in human knowledge , <unk> of the era aimed to organize and classify all of this new knowledge using a new reference system : the encyclopedia . The Analytical Review was part of this project and its editors believed that they were preserving the knowledge of the past and the present for the future . The journal was , according to scholar Nathaniel Teich , " the most important radical review adopting the encyclopedic format for the attempted universal coverage of published works " . Yet , the editors also recognized the ultimate futility of such a project . 
 The Analytical Review was meant to enlighten the public as well as to simplify communication between authors separated by great distances ; most importantly , the debates between those authors could be read by the public . In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate , periodicals such as the Analytical helped to define authorship — they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists . 
 Unusual for its time , the Analytical Review brought current foreign @-@ language publications , particularly those with a scientific , philosophical , or aesthetic bent , to its readers ' attention . For example , it approvingly reviewed Friedrich Schiller 's <unk> ( published by Johnson ) and argued that more of the author 's works should be translated . The Analytical also emphasized the emerging middle @-@ class Protestant work ethic , specifically tying it to scientific knowledge . One issue celebrated successful British merchants , calling them " the most liberal and enlightened men that have appeared in Europe " because of their " love of science " and their " patronage of learned men " . 
 = = Organization and reviewers = = 
 Johnson and Christie set up separate departments for practical sciences , such as mathematics , natural history , agriculture , and medicine ; literature , such as poetry , drama , and romance ; and finally , politics and religion , which encompassed government , theology , philosophy , morality , law , and trade . For each department , there was a chief reviewer , although he or she might engage others . Although the reviewers ' names were not known to the public , Johnson and Christie managed to acquire several luminaries : the poet William Cowper ; the popular moralist William Enfield ; the writer and physician John Aikin ; the poet , essayist , and children 's author Anna Laetitia Barbauld ; the Unitarian minister William Turner ; the physician and literary critic James Currie ; the artist Henry Fuseli ; the writer Mary Hays ; the scholar Alexander Geddes ; and the theologian Joshua Toulmin . The reviewers were all paid , however scholars have been unable to discover their rates . Christie was often absent after the founding of the Analytical Review , leaving the day @-@ to @-@ day operations of the journal up to Johnson . In 1790 he went to Paris for six months , during which he met with revolutionary leaders and started a business ; in 1792 he returned to help the French translate their constitution and to dissolve his business . He left for Surinam in 1796 to collect money owed to him , and died there . 
 The first issue of the Analytical Review was dated May 1788 and the last issue was dated December 1798 . The issues were published monthly and averaged 128 pages . They were also collected into volumes , which consisted of four monthly issues and an appendix ( volumes 21 – 28 switched to a semi @-@ annual publication run without appendices ) . Each issue contained an extensive table of contents , several major reviews of 10 to 20 pages ( sometimes extending to a second issue ) , many minor reviews , and a " catalogue of books and pamphlets published " during the previous six months . 
 Compared with other major periodicals of its day , the Analytical Review had a low circulation . While both the Tory Critical Review and the British Critic had a circulation of 3 @,@ 500 by 1797 and the Monthly Review realized 5 @,@ 000 , Johnson and Christie 's journal only ever achieved about 1 @,@ 500 . However , it was common practice during the eighteenth century for an individual copy of each publication to be read by many different people . Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper , for example , was read by thirty people ; coffeehouses and taverns were well @-@ stocked with copies of newspapers and journals , as were circulating libraries . Hence , circulation numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people actually read such publications . 
 Beginning with the Analytical Review 's third issue , Mary Wollstonecraft became the key editor for dramas , romances , and novels . Scholars have speculated that her reviews are signed by the letters " M " , " W " , or " T " , corresponding roughly to her initials , in large part because they have identified her writing style in these pieces . Her reviews , which number over 200 , are generally characterized by their concern for women 's issues . Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers concludes that Wollstonecraft " is not only a pioneer feminist , but also a pioneer feminist critic , whose analysis of the mesh between gender and genre inaugurates the feminist critical project " . Wollstonecraft wrote excoriating reviews , criticizing the passive novelistic heroines of the time and praising , for example , the " wise and resilient " Mrs Stafford of Charlotte Smith 's autobiographical novel Emmeline ( 1788 ) . In highlighting this character , she " singles out ... the knowledgeable mother figure who has felt and thought deeply " , one who resembles the women she described in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) as having " power ... over themselves " . She derides the " derivative , prescriptive , imitative , and affected " and celebrates the " natural , innovative , [ and ] imaginative " . <unk> a particular regard for the works of Thomas Holcroft , such as Anna St. Ives ( 1792 ) , Wollstonecraft celebrated their championing of innate nobility and virtue over aristocratic titles . Romanticist Anne Chandler argues that Wollstonecraft 's reviews demonstrate " an earlier Augustan politics of knowledge , variously outlined by Dryden , Pope , and , to a lesser extent , Swift " which " may be seen in her insistence on a continuum between aesthetic integrity and civic virtue ; her belief in a metaphysical dialogue between human wit and divine Nature ; and her perception of belletristic criticism as the proper tribunal for a new onslaught of scholarly and scientific research " . While writing her last novel , Maria : or , The Wrongs of Woman ( 1798 ) , Wollstonecraft took advantage of her position with Johnson and reviewed almost nothing but novels , exposing herself to the wide variety of novelistic forms . 
 The other reviewers have been the focus of far less scholarship . According to Eudo Mason , " Fuseli 's peculiar style , his favourite phrases and quotations , themes and ideas make it possible to determine his authorship beyond reasonable doubt in most cases " . He signed reviews " <unk> " and " R.R. " ( of which there are about 40 ) , initials which appear throughout the run of the journal . He also occasionally signed reviews " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " V.V. " , and " L.L. " ( although this last was used by another reviewer as well ) . In total , Mason counts 66 reviews , 56 of which he is certain . Fuseli made it a practice to review texts which mentioned him , works written by friends he wanted to assist with flattering reviews , artistic works , and German literature ( in particular those written by Johann Gottfried Herder ) . 
 Geddes , who contributed from the first issue , wrote forty @-@ six articles , almost all on topics of biblical criticism or ecclesiastical history . However , he left the Analytical in September 1793 to edit for the Monthly Review . Cowper , who probably submitted articles under the initials P.P. and G.G. , predominantly reviewed poetry . 
 = = Content and political leanings = = 
 The Analytical Review offered its readers access to a wide variety of works . In July 1789 , when the Bastille fell , the Analytical reviewed The Rural Economy of Gloucestershire , Life of Thomas Chatterton , Transactions in Bengal , Military Operations on the Coromandel Coast , Poetry and Music of the Italian Opera , and Histoire Politique de la Revolution en France . The journal also laid provocative facts before the public to prompt them to think and , if necessary , to take action , although it claimed not to advocate one viewpoint over another . For example , when philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke issued his politically controversial Reflections on the Revolution in France ( 1790 ) , the Analytical Review reviewed it extensively , as well as the many responses to it , such as Wollstonecraft 's Vindication of the Rights of Men ( 1790 ) , <unk> <unk> ( 1791 ) by James Mackintosh , and Rights of Man ( 1791 ) by Thomas Paine . However , the majority of the excerpts that the reviewers chose to publish came from the rebuttals to Burke 's work . 
 Consistent with Joseph Johnson 's attitudes , the Analytical Review tended towards a " moderate radicalism " , meaning that it opposed the Pitt administration and celebrated the general values of Paine 's Rights of Man . It advocated a moderate reform of Parliament , emphasized the benefits of representative government , and outlined the protections afforded by a separation of powers . While the journal supported the ideals of the French Revolution and opposed Britain 's war against France , it did not endorse the violent methods of some of the revolutionaries . Johnson continued his attempts to remain even @-@ handed in political debates , arguing that factionalism in government was detrimental . 
 Helen Braithwaite , in her book on Johnson , argues that " by July 1798 ... the Analytical had become a deep thorn in the side of the government " ; at Johnson 's trial for seditious libel , an issue of the periodical was entered as evidence against him , demonstrating that the government did not view the journal as non @-@ partisan . Derek Roper , in his survey of late @-@ eighteenth @-@ century periodicals , describes the Analytical as " more radical both in politics and in religion than any other journal " . As he explains , however , " these sentiments were not always fully explicit , and might be conveyed through the tone and manner of a summary rather than paragraphs of criticism " . 
 Many of the founding members of the Analytical Review were Unitarian and quite a few of its contributors were Dissenters , so contemporaries believed there to be a bias in the journal ( most eighteenth @-@ century journals were overtly partisan ) . Christie attempted to assuage these fears in his advertisement : 
 It has been insinuated that the Analytical review originated from a party [ the Unitarians ] , and is meant to serve their purposes . We give ourselves little trouble about such reports . The public will soon judge from the execution of our work , whether we are sincere or not in our professions of impartiality , and to them we appeal . 
 This sincere attitude seems to have largely prevailed in practice . Theophilus Lindsey , who had helped establish Unitarianism in Britain , wrote to the Reverend Newcome Cappe to express his displeasure at a review in the first issue of the Analytical , demonstrating that Unitarian theology was not being promulgated by the journal . Furthermore , Johnson chose as his theological reviewer , not a Dissenter as his friend Joseph Priestley urged , but Alexander Geddes , a talented Scot who had been ordained in Paris as a Roman Catholic priest . However , modern scholars have suggested that he did so not for religious reasons , but because Geddes lived in London and had close connections both to Wollstonecraft and Johnson 's friend , Henry Fuseli . 
 = = Anti @-@ Jacobin Review = = 
 The self @-@ styled nemesis of the Analytical Review was The Anti @-@ Jacobin ; or , Weekly Examiner ( later retitled The Anti @-@ Jacobin Review and Magazine ) , a loyalist periodical begun in November 1797 by the writer William Gifford at the suggestion of the politician George Canning , and with the tacit encouragement of the administration of William Pitt . The chief editor and writer was John Richards Green ( writing under the pseudonym " John Gifford " ) together with Andrew Bisset . In its prospectus , the Anti @-@ Jacobin Review announced : 
 that the channels of criticism have long been corrupted ; that many of the Reviews , sinking the critic in the partisan , have insidiously contributed to favour the designs of those writers who labour to undermine our civil and religious establishments , and , by a shameless dereliction of duty , to cast an odium on their opponents . 
 The editors therefore decided to " counteract the pernicious effects of this dangerous <unk> " [ emphasis in original ] and to " restore criticism to its original standard " — they would " frequently review the Monthly , criticise the Critical , and analyse the Analytical Reviews [ sic ] " [ emphasis in original ] . The Anti @-@ Jacobin Review published a regular feature , " The Reviewers Reviewed " , which analyzed the " Jacobin " reviews for politically unacceptable statements and images . The Anti @-@ Jacobin Review also attacked the Analytical Review for its perceived atheism and for what they deemed its lack of patriotism . 
 During Johnson 's 1798 trial for seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by Gilbert Wakefield , they wrote : 
 Does he [ Johnson ] imagine that we do not know that the proprietor of the Analytical Review is himself under prosecution for selling this same pamphlet of Mr. Wakefield 's ? It is not the prosecution of Mr. <unk> , then , but the prosecution of Mr. <unk> , that excites the indignation of these venal and contemptible critics , as well as that of the whole party [ the Unitarians ] , who are bursting with spite , and thirsting for revenge . It is by his orders to men whom he pays for scribbling in his miserable Review , that every writer who exposes the defects , as they are delicately termed , of Mr. Wakefield 's pamphlet , is abused in the most scurrilous and indiscriminate manner . We advise , therefore , these critics , in future , to throw off a mask which will no longer conceal their object , and boldly , if they dare , pronounce a eulogy on the loyalty of this favorite publisher and friend of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and other unprejudiced authors , who have kindly taken upon themselves , for the last twenty years , the important task of enlightening the public mind . [ emphasis in original ] 
 The Anti @-@ Jacobin also published parodies of the works of liberal poets ; most famously , " Loves of the Triangles " mocked Erasmus Darwin 's Loves of the Plants ( 1791 ) . 
 = = Dissolution and brief resurrection = = 
 After Johnson was convicted on 17 July 1798 , and before he was sentenced on 12 February 1799 , he tried to prove that he had " uniformly recommended the circulation of such publications as had a tendency to promote good morals instead of such as were calculated to mislead and inflame the Common people " . Periodical scholar Stuart Andrews therefore argues that the last issues of the Analytical Review " must be read in the light of Johnson 's impending sentence " . The June 1798 issue focused on travel literature and female fashions , and although it reviewed Mary Hays 's Appeal to the Men of Great Britain on Behalf of Women , it did not do so with any " political bite " . In the same months that the Anti @-@ Jacobin Review launched its first critiques of the Analytical and other journals , the Analytical published extensive articles on the picturesque and other aesthetic theories . 
 The editors of the Anti @-@ Jacobin Review took credit for the " dissolution " of the Analytical Review in the preface to their bound 1798 volume , writing : " The other object of our immediate attacks , the Analytical Review , has received its death @-@ blow , and we have more reason to congratulate ourselves upon the share which we have had in producing its dissolution , than it would be expedient here to unfold . " They also published a cartoon by Thomas Rowlandson entitled " A Charm for a Democracy , Reviewed , <unk> , & Destroyed " . However , scholars attribute the end of Johnson and Christie 's journal to Johnson 's trial for seditious libel and the ensuing negative publicity , in addition to the deaths of Christie and Wollstonecraft in 1796 and 1797 respectively . 
 After its suspension with the December 1798 issue , the Analytical Review lay dormant until it was briefly revived as The Analytical Review ( New Series ) during the first six months of 1799 . It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of Paternoster Row , apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers . Unlike its predecessor , the new series was cautious ; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have initialled signatures . This series lasted only from January until June 1799 . 
 Butler writes that " one marker of the end of the bourgeois republic of letters was the jailing in 1798 of the doyen of publisher @-@ booksellers , Joseph Johnson " . Moreover , she explains that the seeming ideological " coherence " of the Republic of Letters , as it was represented in late @-@ eighteenth @-@ century British journals , was eliminated with the founding of the Anglican British Critic in 1792 and the establishment of the Edinburgh Review in 1802 . The Edinburgh , according to Butler , " plainly set out to break the mould of existing journal culture " . Rather than attempting to cover a wide variety of texts , as had the Analytical Review and its cohorts , it focused on only a few texts and restricted itself to subject areas that the editors deemed worthwhile . For example , it emphasized academic fields for which Scottish universities were well @-@ known , such as the natural sciences , moral philosophy , and political economy . Radical political writings , classical studies , clerical writings , and popular literature were either excluded or ridiculed . 
 = Wolf Point , Chicago = 
 Wolf Point is the location at the confluence of the North , South and Main Branches of the Chicago River in the present day Near North Side , Loop , and Near West Side community areas of Chicago . This fork in the river is historically important in the development of early Chicago . This was the location of Chicago 's first three taverns , its first hotel , Sauganash Hotel , its first ferry , its first drug store , its first church , and the first bridges across the Chicago River . The name is said to possibly derive from a Native American Chief whose name translated to wolf , but alternate theories exist . 
 Historically , the west bank of the river at the fork was called " Wolf Point , " but in the 1820s and 1830s it came to denote the entire area and the settlement that grew up around the fork . Wolf Point is now often used more specifically to refer to a plot of land on the north side of the fork in the Near North Side community area that is owned by the Kennedy family as part of the larger Merchandise Mart Center complex . Today the north bank at the fork , formerly a parking lot , is a construction site , the west bank includes a condominium high rise and railroad tracks , and the south bank serves as the transition point of Wacker Drive from an east @-@ west street to a north @-@ south street . 
 = = Background = = 
 The origin of the name , Wolf Point , is unknown . In her 1856 memoir Wau @-@ Bun , Juliette Kinzie states that ' the place was then called Wolf Point , from its having been the residence of an Indian named " Moa @-@ way , " or " the Wolf . " ' Other alternate explanations are that it was so @-@ named after the landlord of what would later be called the Wolf Point Tavern killed a ferocious wolf and hung a painted sign of a wolf outside his tavern to commemorate the event , or that it was named by a soldier at Fort Dearborn because it was a place where wolves would gather at night . Originally the term Wolf Point referred to the west bank of the Chicago River at the fork junction of its branches , but it gradually came to refer to the whole region around the forks and in modern usage is often more specifically used to mean the plot of land on the north side of the forks . The confluence of the three branches of the river near Wolf Point provided inspiration for Chicago 's Municipal Device , a Y @-@ shaped , city identification symbol that can be seen on many buildings in Chicago , and on city owned vehicles . 
 = = Early settlement = = 
 The first non @-@ indigenous settler at Wolf Point may have been a trader named Guarie . Writing in 1880 Gurdon Hubbard , who first arrived in Chicago on October 1 , 1818 , stated that he had been told of Guarie by Antoine De Champs and Antoine <unk> , who had been traversing the Chicago Portage annually since about 1778 . Hubbard wrote that De Champs had shown him evidence of a trading house and the remains of a cornfield supposed to have belonged to Guarie . The cornfield was located on the west bank of the North Branch of the Chicago River , a short distance from the forks at what is now Fulton Street ; early settlers named the North Branch of the Chicago River the Guarie River , or Gary 's River . 
 James Kinzie , the son of early settler John Kinzie , built a tavern on the west bank of the river at Wolf Point in 1828 . By 1829 this tavern was operated for Kinzie by Archibald Caldwell who was granted a liquor license on December 8 of that year . Caldwell left Chicago early in 1830 and Elijah Wentworth became the landlord of the tavern . He was in turn succeeded by Charles Taylor ( 1831 – 1833 ) and William Walters ( 1833 – 1836 ) . The tavern became known as the ' Wolf Point Tavern ' or ' Wolf Tavern ' and a painted sign of a wolf was hung outside the tavern by approximately 1833 . 
 In about 1829 , Samuel Miller and his brother John opened a store on the north bank of the river at the forks . In 1830 , they enlarged their store and began to operate it as a tavern in competition with the Wolf Point Tavern . On June 2 , 1829 Samuel Miller and Archibald Clybourn had been authorized to operate the first ferry across the Chicago River . Clybourn was the ferry man , crossing the North Branch of the river between Miller 's tavern and the Wolf Point Tavern . In 1831 John Miller built a log house near his brother 's tavern that he used as a tannery ; Chicago 's first recorded factory . Samuel Miller sold the tavern and moved away following the death of his wife in 1832 . 
 Mark Beaubien opened the Eagle Exchange Tavern in a log cabin on the south bank in 1829 . In 1831 Beaubien added a frame addition and opened the Sauganash Hotel , Chicago 's first hotel . Immediately adjacent to the hotel 's public bar was Chicago 's first drug store . Beaubien left the Sauganash Hotel in 1834 , but the hotel continued in operation until it was destroyed by a fire in 1851 . The site of the Sauganash Hotel was redeveloped as the Wigwam in 1860 ; the site today is at 191 North Wacker and is designated as a Chicago Landmark . 
 James Kinzie built the Green Tree Tavern at the northeastern corner of Canal and Lake Streets in 1833 . The tavern went through a succession of owners and name changes before being moved in 1880 to 33 , 35 , and 37 Milwaukee Avenue . In 1902 plans were made to preserve the building and move it to Garfield Park , however the hotel collapsed before work could start on this project . 
 Rev. Jesse Walker started the first church on June 14 , 1831 , with ten members in a log cabin . In 1838 , the congregation floated their log cabin across the Chicago River and rolled it on logs to the corner of Washington and Clark Streets , where it is now the First United Methodist Church Chicago Temple . 
 Archibald Clybourn 's ferry across the North Branch of the river was replaced by a bridge in the winter of 1831 and 1832 , and a bridge across the South Branch of the river located between Lake and Randolph Streets was added in the winter of 1832 and 1833 . Early settlers J. D. Caton , John Bates , Charles Cleaver , and John Noble wrote in a letter in the fall of 1883 that both of these bridges were constructed of logs ; they were about 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) wide , and cleared the river by about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . 
 = = Development = = 
 When the Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848 , the landmass at Wolf Point was decreased by dredging to accommodate a turning basin for ships . In the autumn of the same year the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad opened Chicago 's first railroad depot at Wolf Point , on the southwestern corner of Kinzie and Canal Streets . By 1857 the site of Wolf Point Tavern was being used as a lumber yard ; the Fulton Elevator , one of Chicago 's earliest grain elevators , was built just to the north of the former tavern in 1852 . Several blocks to the west of Wolf Point were destroyed in a large fire on September 15 , 1859 . The Fulton Elevator survived this , and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 , but was burned down on September 7 , 1873 . It was rebuilt in the same year , and another grain elevator , the St Paul Elevator , was added immediately to the south of the original in 1879 . The Chicago , Milwaukee and St. Paul railway company purchased both elevators in 1889 for $ 400 @,@ 000 ( $ 10 @.@ 5 million today ) , but demolished them in 1906 . Currently , the site is occupied by the Riverbend Condominiums at 333 North Canal Street . 
 The property on the north bank of the river at Wolf Point was owned by businessman Marshall Field until it was sold to Democratic Party figure and Kennedy family patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy in 1945 or 1946 , depending on the source . Although the Kennedy family sold much of the complex center property to Vornado Realty Trust in 1998 as part of a larger $ 625 million ( $ 907 @.@ 4 million ) transaction , the family retained their interest in the 4 acres ( 16 @,@ 000 m2 ) of Wolf Point land . The area still owned by the Kennedy family is bounded by the Chicago River to the east , west , south and 350 West Mart Center to the north . The Merchandise Mart is located diagonally to the northeast . The location is currently used as a parking lot . There have been numerous plans to develop the property dating back to the late 1980s . In 2007 , the Kennedys planned to develop the property with three high @-@ rises and skyscrapers to designs by Argentine @-@ American architect César Pelli . In 2012 , updated plans were proposed with several target completion dates over the next decade . The property is a coveted real estate location that has had several serious redevelopment plans in the past . In 2014 , construction began on the first phase of the planned Wolf Point Towers 
 The south bank is being redeveloped as part of Mayor Rahm Emanuel 's plans to extend the Chicago Riverwalk , which is located on the south bank of the Chicago River and will extend from Lake Michigan to the intersection of North Wacker Drive and Lake Street . Design plans are being finalized as of Spring 2015 with completion targeted by the end of 2016 pending funding . Currently , the plan will include a three story retail space , a large park , and an iconic bridge linking Wacker to the Riverwalk path . 
 = Mississippi Highway 602 = 
 Mississippi Highway 602 ( MS 602 ) was a highway in southern Mississippi . Its southern terminus was at MS 43 , which is now inside the John C. Stennis Space Center . The road traveled a slightly curved route to its northern terminus at U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) and MS 43 in Picayune . MS 602 was designated in 1958 , only in Pearl River County . The route was extended south into Hancock County two years later . MS 602 was then removed from the state highway system in 1967 , less than a decade after it was designated .

 As of 1965 , the route was located in northwestern Hancock and southern Pearl River counties . MS 602 started at MS 43 , where which is now part of the Stennis Space Center . The road , known as Flat Top Road , traveled northeast through the dense forest . About two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of the southern terminus , MS 602 intersected Texas Flat Road . The road then crossed over Dead Tiger Creek , and shifted back slightly to the west . MS 602 crossed Stall and Everett Branches before turning northwest . It intersected Lott McCarty Road before entering Pearl River County . The route turned west shortly inside the county , traveling toward Picayune . A short section of the former route is now part of MS 43 . As MS 602 entered Picayune , it became East Canal Street . The route ended at US 11 , next to a railroad track . The road continued as West Canal Street . The road was maintained by the Mississippi State Highway Commission and Hancock County , as part of the state highway system .

 MS 602 first appeared in maps in 1958 , connecting from MS 43 and US 11 in Picayune , to the Pearl River – Hancock county line . The route was fully paved at that time . Two years later , MS 602 was extended into Hancock County , connecting back to MS 43 . The section was maintained by the county . The Stennis Space Center was built on a section of the route in 1965 , and by 1967 , the route was removed from the state highway system . MS 43 was rerouted onto a part of MS 602 , bypassing the space center .

 New York State Route 134 ( NY 134 ) is a 6 @.@ 35 @-@ mile ( 10 @.@ 22 km ) state highway in the western part of Westchester County , New York , in the United States . It begins at an intersection with NY 133 in the village of Ossining and heads northeast to the hamlet of Kitchawan , located adjacent to the New Croton Reservoir in the town of Yorktown . From here , the route turns southeast to reach its east end at a junction with NY 100 . The highway passes the Thomas J. Watson Research Center , one of the main research headquarters for IBM , just east of an interchange with the Taconic State Parkway . 
 Taken over by the state of New York between 1908 and 1926 , NY 134 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . In 1960 , in conjunction with construction of the Watson Research Center , an interchange was added to NY 134 for the Taconic . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 134 begins at an intersection with NY 133 ( Croton Avenue ) in the village of Ossining , just east of the latter 's west end at U.S. Route 9 ( North Highland Avenue ) . The route proceeds northeast as the two @-@ lane Dale Avenue , passing through a residential section of the village and passing Dale Cemetery . Just past the cemetery , the highway changes names to Hawkes Avenue as it leaves the village for other parts of the town of Ossining . The route continues generally northeastward past homes to the vicinity of NY 9A ( the Briarcliff – Peekskill Parkway ) , where NY 134 forks from Hawkes Avenue and begins to parallel NY 9A on Kitchawan State Road , a short connector to nearby Croton Dam Road . Upon intersecting Croton Dam Road , NY 134 turns northward and immediately intersects NY 9A at an at @-@ grade intersection . 
 Past NY 9A , NY 134 heads northeast across the northern fringe of Ossining , climbing uphill as it passes Purdy Pond and crossing into the town of New Castle . Here , the homes gradually diminish in number , with dense woods taking their place . This trend continues into the adjacent town of Yorktown , where NY 134 becomes Kitchawan Road . About 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the town line , the highway entering an interchange with the Taconic State Parkway . For a short distance after the interchange , NY 134 becomes four lanes as the road serves IBM 's Thomas J. Watson Research Center . It narrows to two lanes past the facility , from where the highway takes a slightly more easterly track across Yorktown to reach the Kitchawan Preserve on the southern edge of the New Croton Reservoir . 
 At this point , the road makes a turn to the southeast to enter the small hamlet of Kitchawan , located at NY 134 's junction with Pines Bridge Road ( unsigned County Route 1323 or CR 1323 ) . Pines Bridge Road was once NY 135 , and its junction with NY 134 in Kitchawan was NY 135 's eastern terminus . From Pines Bridge Road , NY 134 bends southward to run alongside a reservoir inlet connecting to Cornell Brook . After about 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) , the route makes a final turn to the east to cross Cornell Brook and reach its east end at an intersection with NY 100 ( Saw Mill River Road ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of NY 134 date back to the late 1900s when the state of New York improved the portion of the route outside of the Ossining village limits to state highway standards . A contract for the $ 59 @,@ 973 project ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 52 million in 2016 ) was awarded on June 30 , 1908 , and the rebuilt road was added to the state highway system on August 1 , 1910 , as unsigned State Highway 768 ( SH 768 ) . Its continuation into the village limits was taken over by the state by 1926 . Neither state highway had a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , when hundreds of state @-@ maintained roads were given signed designations for the first time . The two state highways were combined to create NY 134 . 
 In 1960 , a new interchange was built between NY 134 and the Taconic State Parkway as part of the construction of IBM 's Thomas J. Watson Research Center . During the excavation process for the junction , a bone from a woolly mammoth ( colloquially known as Jefferson 's mammoth ) was found buried in the earth below . The bones were moved to the New York State Museum in Albany . The construction also required the relocation of the Kitchawan Tavern from the site of the exit to the junction of Kitchawan and <unk> roads a half @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) to the east .

 M @-@ 104 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan in the Western Michigan region of the state . It runs from Ferrysburg to Nunica in Ottawa County , passing through Spring Lake . The highway serves as a connector between Interstate 96 ( I @-@ 96 ) and US Highway 31 ( US 31 ) , helping connect Grand Haven with the Grand Rapids metro area . A related Connector 104 runs between the M @-@ 104 and US 31 in Ferrysburg . During the 1920s and 1930s , a different highway bore the M @-@ 104 designation . The current highway was previously a section of US 16 until 1940 when that designation was shifted to a road going from Nunica to Muskegon ; the orphaned highway was redesignated M @-@ 104 at the same time . Since then , two routing changes have caused short segments to be transferred to local control and removed from the highway .

 The western terminus of M @-@ 104 is at US 31 in Ferrysburg at the north end of the drawbridge spanning the Grand River north of Grand Haven . The highway runs along Savidge Street and crosses a bridge over the channel that connect the river with Spring Lake . On the opposite shore , the trunkline continues along Savidge Street , running between the river to its south and the lake to its north . M @-@ 104 crosses the central business area of the village of Spring Lake . East of downtown , the highway transitions to follow Cleveland Street which continues due east to Nunica . The landscape becomes more rural east of Spring Lake where the highway crosses terrain with a mix of open fields and woods . There are various businesses and homes that line the roadway . The eastern terminus of M @-@ 104 is located at the exit 9 interchange along I @-@ 96 just west of Nunica .

The two men had known each other for years and Ramey had recently been on Kenney 's staff when Kenney was commander of the Fourth Air Force . " I had a lot of confidence in him , " Kenney later wrote , " and believed he would do a real job for me . Arnold replied the next day that I could have him . " Ramey assumed command of V Bomber Command in January 1943 . After the arguments over bombing tactics with Walker , Kenney was pleased that Ramey liked the skip bombing tactics the Fifth Air Force was developing . These tactics were put in practice with devastating effect at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943 .

 = Cyclone Cilla = 
 Cyclone Cilla ( RSMC Nadi designation : 10F , JTWC designation : 13P ) was a tropical cyclone that brought minor damage several islands in the South Pacific in January 2003 . The fifth cyclone of the 2002 @-@ 03 South Pacific cyclone season , Cyclone Cilla developed from a monsoon trough on January 26 northwest of Fiji . Initially , Cilla moved east , and due to decreased wind shear , Cilla was able to intensify . On January 28 , Cilla reached its peak intensity of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . After slightly weakening , Cilla briefly re @-@ intensified the next day . However , Cilla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January 30 . Along its path , Cilla dropped heavy rainfall over islands it passed . During its formative stages , the low dropped heavy rain over Fiji , which had already been effected by Cyclone Ami two weeks prior . Damage in Tonga was mostly limited to vegetation and fruit trees ; infrastructural damage was also relatively minor . Cilla also brought moderate rain to American Samoa .

 On January 25 , 2003 , a low @-@ pressure area formed within a monsoon trough about 300 mi ( 485 km ) northwest of Fiji and moved to the east @-@ southeast . That morning , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began to issue warnings on the system , designating it as <unk> . Shortly thereafter , Cilla turned southeast hours later in the general direction of Tonga Early on January 26 , RSMC Nadi designated the low as Tropical Depression <unk> , after attaining 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . At the time , the slow moving system had a poorly defined center of circulation that was hard to identify via radar and satellite imagery . In addition , most of the deep thunderstorm activity was displaced to the north and southeast of the center . Later that morning , the JTWC reported winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) ; however , the depression did not become any better organized throughout the day . Early the next day , RSMC Nadi upgraded the tropical depression to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian intensity scale and named it Cilla . By 0600 UTC January 27 , the JTWC reported that Cilla had attained 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , which according to JTWC data , was its peak intensity . Subsequently , Cilla turned east @-@ southeast . 
 Throughout the day , wind shear conditions lessened further ; however , shower activity separated from the center , prompting the JTWC to issue its last warning on Tropical Cyclone Cilla later that day . At 2100 UTC January 27 , RMSC Nadi remarked that the cyclone had become better organized . Upon attaining peak intensity , the storm passed fairly closed to Tonga . At 0600 UTC January 28 , Cilla reached its peak intensity , with 10 – minute sustained winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) per RMSC Nadi . At this time , the tropical cyclone was located about 400 mi ( 645 km ) south @-@ southeast of Pago Pago . Rapidly moving , Cilla showed baroclinic characteristics , hinting that the system was a hybrid low , sustaining characteristics of both tropical and nontropical cyclones . According to RMSC Nadi , Cilla weakened slightly as the storm lost organization due to increased wind shear . 
 On January 29 , thunderstorm activity once again increased in converge around the center , though at first , the convection was sheared at times . On 0000 UTC , Dvorak satellite intensity estimates yielded a 3 @.@ 0 , suggesting a tropical cyclone with 10 – minute winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) , Cilla 's secondary peak intensity . Satellite images indicated a banding pattern associated with the cyclone . The JTWC briefly watched this system for regeneration , noting it had a " fair " chance . However , continued wind shear began to weaken Cilla , and by 1200 UTC on January 29 , Cilla was reduced to a tropical depression just before the system turned south @-@ southeast . With the center exposed from the deep convection , Tropical Depression Cilla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 1100 UTC the next day , on January 30 . The extratropical cyclone completely dissipated two days later . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 As a tropical depression , Cilla passed over Vanua Levu . Even though the region had been severely affected by Cyclone Ami two weeks earlier , flood waters that resulted from rains associated with the cyclone quickly receded due to the storm 's rapid motion . 
 When Cilla first posed a threat to Tonga , the Fiji Meteorological Service ( FMS ) issued a tropical cyclone alert for the entire island chain . Damage in Tonga was mostly limited to vegetation and coconut and banana trees ; damage to infrastructure was minor . Peak winds of 32 mph ( 51 km / h ) and peak gusts of 67 mph ( 108 km / h ) were recorded in Ha 'apai . Power was lost on <unk> for about three hours during the night of January 27 . Communications services were also affected but restored on January 28 . 
 Cilla also affected the American Samoa , providing moderate rainfall over the area , peaking at 2 @.@ 21 in ( 56 mm ) in <unk> . The name Cilla was retired by the World Meteorological Organization after the season . 
 = John Edward Brownlee sex scandal = 
 The John Brownlee sex scandal occurred in 1934 in Alberta , Canada , and forced the resignation of the provincial Premier , John Edward Brownlee . Brownlee was accused of seducing Vivian MacMillan , a family friend and a secretary for Brownlee 's attorney @-@ general in 1930 , when she was 18 years old , and continuing the affair for three years . MacMillan claimed that the married premier had told her that she must have sex with him for his own sake and that of his invalid wife . She had , she testified , relented after physical and emotional pressure . Brownlee called her story a fabrication , and suggested that it was the result of a conspiracy by MacMillan , her would @-@ be fiancé , and several of Brownlee 's political opponents in the Alberta Liberal Party . 
 MacMillan and her father sued Brownlee for seduction . After a sensational trial in June 1934 , the six @-@ man jury found in favour of the plaintiffs , awarding them $ 10 @,@ 000 and $ 5 @,@ 000 , respectively . In an unusual move , trial judge William Ives disregarded the jury 's finding and dismissed the case . The Supreme Court of Canada eventually overturned the decision and awarded MacMillan $ 10 @,@ 000 in damages . This award was affirmed by the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council , Canada 's highest court of appeal at the time . All of this was largely academic to Brownlee , who resigned after the jury 's finding . During the next election , his United Farmers of Alberta were wiped out of the legislature , losing every seat . 
 = = Background = = 
 John Brownlee became Premier of Alberta in 1925 as the leader of the parliamentary caucus of the United Farmers of Alberta ( UFA ) . Early in his premiership , he achieved a number of successes , including winning control of the province 's natural resources from the federal government , but by 1933 the Great Depression was taking its toll on his government 's popularity . Political forces were advocating radical overhauls of the financial system . The Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation and elements of the UFA 's grassroots favored socialism and government ownership of the means of production , while the Alberta Liberal Party , many within the UFA , and William Aberhart 's new provincial movement favored social credit , although in differing forms and with differing levels of enthusiasm . 
 In 1934 , Brownlee was embroiled in a sex scandal , with major consequences to his political career . Those involved with the scandal gave widely disparate accounts of the surrounding facts ; on only a minority of details did the parties agree . In 1930 , Brownlee visited Edson while campaigning in the 1930 provincial election . While there , Allan MacMillan — the mayor of Edson and a political ally of Brownlee 's — took him to a farmers ' picnic . On the way to the event , Brownlee chatted with MacMillan 's daughter , Vivian , then seventeen years old and unsure as to her future . The premier encouraged her to come to Edmonton and study business at Alberta College . She did so and , after graduating in June 1931 , started working in the office of the provincial Attorney @-@ General as a stenographer on July 3 . 
 While in Edmonton , she became close to the Brownlee family . On July 5 , 1933 , while the rest of his family was vacationing at Sylvan Lake , Brownlee was taking MacMillan for a car ride when he noticed they were being followed . In the pursuing vehicle were John Caldwell , a suitor of MacMillan 's and third @-@ year medical student at the University of Alberta , and Neil MacLean , a prominent Edmonton lawyer and Liberal Party supporter who had been opposing counsel in the acrimonious and high profile divorce proceeding of Brownlee 's Minister of Public Works , Oran McPherson . Brownlee made a series of sharp turns and reversals , in an effort to first ascertain whether he was indeed being followed and , once satisfied that he was , to evade the other car . Unable to do so , he dropped MacMillan off at her home and returned to his . 
 That August , Brownlee received a letter from MacLean reading in part " We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan . " Later that month , he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency , of which he was a member , to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson . He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan , who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave . She eventually relented and let him in ; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian 's future , to which she responded " what about you ? " Concluding that the meeting was pointless , Brownlee parted by announcing " I am not asking you to refrain from your action , but I want to tell you that the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its [ sic ] money you are after , I haven 't got it . " 
 On September 22 , MacLean filed a statement of claim before Judge John R. Boyle on behalf of Allan and Vivian MacMillan . The claim was made under the Alberta Seduction Act , and sought damages of $ 10 @,@ 000 for Vivian and $ 5 @,@ 000 for Allan . It alleged that Brownlee , after arranging for Vivian 's move from Edson to Edmonton , had seduced her in the fall of 1930 when she was eighteen , and had had regular sexual contact with her for a period of three years . Brownlee denied the allegations immediately ( and made a rejected offer to resign from the Royal Commission ) and on November 13 filed a counter @-@ claim against Vivian MacMillan and John Caldwell , alleging that they had conspired to obtain money through false allegations . 
 = = Vivian MacMillan 's story = = 
 According to Vivian MacMillan , when she met Brownlee in 1930 he told her that she would " grow up to be a beautiful woman " , urged her to move to Edmonton , and offered to arrange a government job for her . He further offered to act as guardian to her and allow her to live in his house until she found a place of her own . On his advice and assurances , she moved to Edmonton and , after graduating from Alberta College , received the stenographer 's position that she claimed had been arranged for her by the premier . 
 Immediately after her arrival in Edmonton , she said , Brownlee had telephoned her — commenting that " a little birdie " had told him that she was in town — and invited her to his home to meet his family ; she soon became a regular visitor there . She alleged that in October 1930 , while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit , the premier took her hand and asked her what she knew " about life " . On her response that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen , he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice . Instead , he drove her 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him . He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start , that he was lonely , that he and his wife had not lived together as man and wife in a long time , that his wife ( an invalid ) would be endangered by a pregnancy , and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him . He told her that if she refused him , he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife , and that this would likely kill her . MacMillan reacted fearfully , and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife ; he replied that there was not . 
 The next week on another ride home , a similar conversation ensued , this one culminating in Brownlee forcing a resisting MacMillan into the car 's back seat where he partially penetrated her against her will . Two weeks later , she alleged , they had complete consensual intercourse . After , when she expressed concern about becoming pregnant , he told her that " he knew of some pills that he would give me and if I took them at the end of each month before I <unk> that they would be very safe and there would not be any danger of me becoming pregnant . " MacMillan recounted that their relationship continued in this way , with sex occurring an average of three times per week . In September 1931 , she stayed in the Brownlee house for three days while Mrs. Brownlee was in Vancouver ; she alleged that during that time , Brownlee had his son , who usually slept in Brownlee 's room , transferred to a different room so that Brownlee and MacMillan could have sex . 
 Some of MacMillan 's most sensational allegations concerned a six @-@ week period in the spring of 1932 when she was filling in at the Brownlee household for an absent maid . She said that she slept in the maid 's room , one of three bedrooms on the second floor of Brownlee 's house ; a second room was occupied by Brownlee and his son Jack , and the third by Florence Brownlee and her son Alan . During this six @-@ week period , she claimed , she and Brownlee had had sex every night ; Brownlee would signal her to leave her room by turning on the tap in the second floor bathroom , and then flush the toilet and walk in lockstep with her to mask the sound of her movement . Once in the premier 's room , they would have sex next to his sleeping son , taking care to be quiet . She recounted how on one occasion Jack had seemed to stir , and Brownlee had turned on the light in the middle of intercourse to make sure that his son was all right . 
 MacMillan said that during the summer of 1932 she experienced a nervous breakdown ( for which Florence Brownlee paid the hospital bills ) , and that she met and fell in love with Caldwell soon after . She resolved to end her affair with Brownlee but he reacted angrily , telling her that it would mean his wife 's death and MacMillan 's inability to find a job anywhere in Alberta . That evening , she confided the affair to her landlady . On October 31 , 1932 , she had dinner with Brownlee 's sons and visited Brownlee , who was sick in bed . Despite her protestations that she was on her way to a Halloween party with Caldwell , he insisted that they have sex , which they did . Thereafter , the affair resumed . On another occasion , he called her away from her visiting mother to have sex with him at the legislature building . 
 In late January 1933 , Caldwell proposed to her . She broke down and told him of the affair . She described his reaction as sympathetic , though he rescinded the marriage proposal . In May , at Caldwell 's urging , she consulted a lawyer , but continued the affair until July 5 , the night of the fateful drive . 
 MacMillan testified that for the duration of the affair she continued to have sex with Brownlee " from terror and because he told me it was my duty to do it and he seemed to have an influence over me which I could not break . " She claimed that there had been no love accompanying the sex , and that it had been physically painful for her on each occasion . 
 = = John Brownlee 's story = = 
 Brownlee denied absolutely MacMillan 's claims . He said that there had been no sexual activity between him and MacMillan , likening their relationship instead to that of an uncle and his favourite niece . To claims that he had induced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and arranged a position for her in the Attorney General 's office , he asserted " in the thirteen years I have been in public life I have never promised any person in this Province a position . " He denied having convinced MacMillan to move to Edmonton and stated that he had not even known that she had done so until Christopher Pattinson , Member of the Legislative Assembly ( MLA ) for Edson , told him . He further claimed that his sex life with Mrs. Brownlee was what he would consider normal for a husband and wife ( which was corroborated by his wife ) . 
 He acknowledged that he had been driving MacMillan around the evening of July 5 , 1933 , when he was followed by Caldwell and MacLean , but gave a dramatically different account of his reasons for doing so . According to him , there had been talk of MacMillan joining his family at their rental cottage at Sylvan Lake that weekend provided that she could get the necessary time off work , and that evening he called her to see whether or not she had been able to . During the ensuing phone conversation , MacMillan told him that she had other problems bothering her , and asked if Brownlee would take her for a drive to discuss them . He agreed to do so , and it was during this drive that he noticed that he was being followed . 
 In support of this story , Brownlee pointed to investigational work by Harry Brace , a private detective in the employ of Attorney General John Lymburn . According to Brace , Caldwell had told at least three witnesses that he expected to soon receive a large amount of money from someone " high up in political life " . He also specifically told one of Brace 's agents that he had deliberately set out to frame Brownlee , that in selecting Neil MacLean as his lawyer he had deliberately chosen a Liberal ( the Liberals were considered the major opposition to Brownlee 's government at the time ) , and that if the Liberals won the next election there would be " nothing I want I won 't be able to get " . Disappointingly for Brownlee , Brace did not uncover evidence that MacMillan was lying about the affair itself : Caldwell , based on his comments to Brace 's men , seemed very much under the impression that the affair had occurred exactly as claimed . Moreover , Brace found that Carl Snell , MacMillan 's one @-@ time suitor , claimed to have been told in 1932 that MacMillan was having a consensual affair with the premier . 
 Brownlee 's defenders called into doubt MacLean 's motivation for involvement in the case : according to rumour , MacLean had been involved in a drunk driving incident several years previous in which he had driven his car into a ditch . When another motorist had pulled him out , MacLean had attempted unsuccessfully to drive away with the chains still attached to his vehicle , for which he was charged . He had reputedly asked Brownlee , then the Attorney General , to have the charges dropped . Upon Brownlee 's refusal , he had allegedly vowed to " get " him . Finally , Brownlee made a point of noting that , as a medical student , Caldwell would have been well @-@ positioned to coach MacMillan on her claims about the pills she was taking to avoid pregnancy . According to Brownlee , the events alleged were a complete fabrication , the result of scheming by an opportunistic young medical student and his impressionable girlfriend , encouraged by a vindictive lawyer and unscrupulous political opponents .

 = = = Trial = = = 
 The trial began in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with three days of testimony from MacMillan . Brownlee 's lawyer , Arthur LeRoy Smith , used his cross examination to call into question almost everything MacMillan said . To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton , he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs , dated before she had even met Brownlee . He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction , which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton , the city had been engulfed in a blizzard . Moreover , the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until more than a year after that date . In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid 's room while staying with the Brownlees , Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee 's room . After MacMillan conceded her mistake , Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee 's room had a large <unk> on the door : if she had feared Brownlee , why had she not used it ? " Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said , " was the plaintiff 's response . MacMillan , when questioned , admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932 , which she had initially placed at six weeks , was actually only four . When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May , Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period . 
 Other witnesses for the plaintiffs included a former maid of Brownlee 's , who testified that she had seen the premier pick MacMillan up in his car late one night , and MacMillan 's landlady 's daughter , who testified that she found MacMillan sobbing in her room one night . Allan MacMillan was also called : though he testified that Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College , he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton . 
 The defence called Brownlee , who recounted his version of events . He testified that he had been otherwise occupied on many of the days that he and MacMillan had supposedly had sex ; in one case , he produced newspaper stories showing that he had been making a speech in Stettler at a time that MacMillan had claimed he was forcing himself upon her in Edmonton . In another , he testified that he was meeting with O. H. Snow , the mayor of Raymond . MacLean on cross @-@ examination tried to paint Brownlee as a man of tremendous persuasive powers , recalling his time as a lawyer in Calgary , only to have Brownlee retort that he had only ever tried two cases , spending most of his time drafting commercial documents . MacLean also emphasized the $ 1 @,@ 400 that Lymburn as Attorney General had spent investigating the case , suggesting that this amounted to government funds being spent to vindicate Brownlee personally ; outside of the courtroom , Lymburn responded that his office had received a complaint that an " Edmonton lawyer " — taken by all involved to be MacLean — had approached a young woman offering money to place Brownlee in a compromising position , and that , as a criminal allegation , it had been the obligation of his office to investigate . He further emphasized that , against his protestations , Brownlee had insisted on reimbursing the government for the full cost of the investigation . 
 After the premier 's testimony was completed , Smith called his wife , Florence Brownlee . She supported her husband 's account of MacMillan 's relationship with the Brownlee family and reported that , when the premier drove MacMillan home at night , he was very seldom late returning . On cross @-@ examination , she denied that she would have defended her husband if she believed him to be guilty . Additional witnesses for the defence included Brownlee 's personal secretary , Civil Service Commissioner Frederick Smailes , and four legislature janitors . Smailes acknowledged knowing at the time of MacMillan 's hiring that she was acquainted with Brownlee , but denied involvement on Brownlee 's part in the decision to hire her , while the janitors denied ever seeing a young woman enter the premier 's office in the evenings . Jessie <unk> , who had worked for the Brownlees as a maid , said that she had no reason to believe that there was a sexual relationship between the premier and MacMillan ; moreover , she specifically recalled the Halloween night MacMillan had referred to in her testimony , and testified that the household was far too bustling for the alleged sex to have occurred . 
 The trial concluded with a field trip , as the jury went to view both Brownlee 's house and two stretches of road where MacMillan had claimed key encounters took place . Rainy weather meant that on more than one occasion the jurors and lawyers had to push cars out of the mud . Though one road essentially matched MacMillan 's description , it was located next to a populated settlement rather than deserted as she had claimed . The other , in contrast to her description of it as a side road , was a busy highway . Upon the jury 's return , Smith surprised them by announcing that Brownlee 's counter @-@ claim was being dropped ; he said that there was no need to complicate the clear cut issue of " seduction or no seduction " with evidence about a conspiracy on the part of MacMillan and Caldwell . Legal historian Patrick Brode criticized this decision , suggesting that the jury was expecting proof of a conspiracy and that , when this proof was not forthcoming , Brownlee 's credibility was hurt . 
 Besides the factual issues that the jury was called on to adjudicate , there was a legal issue of what constituted " seduction " under the law . The basis of the claim was a two @-@ hundred @-@ year @-@ old tort which allowed a man to sue anybody who impregnated his female servant . The basis for damages under such a claim was the servant 's inability to perform her duties to the detriment of the employer . The tort was later broadened to allow the <unk> 's father to sue ; only in statute in 1903 was the law amended to give standing to the woman herself . At issue was what damage , if any , she needed to show in order to have a cause of action . The defence argued that in all precedents there had been a pregnancy resulting , and that without one the plaintiffs could not claim damages . In response , MacLean emphasized the not entirely consensual nature of the alleged relationship . Brownlee himself responded that if the alleged relationship had been non @-@ consensual , he should have been charged under the criminal law for rape , not sued for seduction ; that the plaintiffs had not attempted to press criminal charges was evidence , he believed , of their bad faith and financial motivation . 
 After six days of testimony , closing arguments were given : Smith 's lasted two hours and fifteen minutes and emphasized the discrepancies in MacMillan 's story . MacLean 's was a relatively brief forty minutes , in which he argued that the improbable and fantastic nature of his client 's tale was evidence that she could not possibly have invented it . Ives then instructed the jurors , and defined " seduction " as " inducing a woman to part with her virtue ... [ which ] may be by any artful device that brings about her consent . " After four hours and forty minutes the jury returned and announced its finding that Brownlee had seduced MacMillan in October 1930 when he had partially penetrated her , and that both she and her father had suffered damages in the amounts claimed . Ives immediately announced that he strongly disagreed with the jury 's findings , and that " the evidence does not warrant them " . On July 2 , he issued his written ruling , overturning the jury 's verdict and dismissing the action ; his reason for doing so was what he viewed as the lack of damage being demonstrated by the plaintiffs . According to Ives , even if the facts had been exactly as MacMillan had described , as a matter of law the plaintiffs could not claim damages without a pregnancy or an illness . 
 = = = Media and public reception = = = 
 The trial was covered in lurid detail , especially by the Edmonton Bulletin , which called it " the greatest drama ever to be heard in an Alberta court " . The Bulletin was a Liberal paper , and MacLean had given it an advance copy of his statement of claim , which allowed MacMillan 's allegations to be published and disseminated before the statement of claim was filed . The Bulletin was emphatically sympathetic to MacMillan in its coverage , and printed her detailed testimony ( which included the dates and times of specific encounters ) almost verbatim . Under the headline " Vivian <unk> to Harrowing Ordeal " , it praised the young plaintiff as " bearing up with wonderful fortitude " and facing the ordeal " with courageous mien " . Brownlee , in contrast , was a " love @-@ torn , sex crazed victim of passion and jealousy , forcing his will upon her in parked autos and on country highways " . The jury was not sequestered and was free to read these accounts . Edmontonians were no less enthralled than their newspaper , and many showed up to the courthouse early on the days of trial , hoping to get a seat . Towards the end of the trial , Ives revoked the Bulletin 's press privileges at the trial and fined its publisher $ 300 and a reporter $ 100 for publishing writing " likely to inflame public opinion and interfere with the even @-@ handed course of justice . " 
 Media attention on the trial spread beyond the provincial and national borders : Time magazine published at least two articles on the trial in the United States , and the Daily Mail and Paris Midi covered it from across the Atlantic . 
 Reaction to the trial 's outcome was mixed . The Bulletin was outraged , as was the Canadian Civil Liberties Protective Association , which called Ives ' decision to overturn the jury 's finding one that " set the clock back 300 years " . Both organized subscriptions to finance an expected appeal . The Winnipeg Free Press called for an investigation of Ives for apparent favouritism towards Brownlee . The Vancouver Sun , on the other hand , sympathized with the premier , arguing that his " personal difficulties should not have been aired publicly " . Brownlee 's political allies , including Irene Parlby and Henry Wise Wood , remained loyal , with Wood keeping a large picture of Brownlee on the wall of his guest bedroom .

 The plaintiffs appealed and the case went before the Alberta Supreme Court appeals division in January 1935 . On February 2 , by a 3 – 2 decision , the court upheld Ives ' ruling . The majority ruling by Chief Justice Horace Harvey cast serious doubts on MacMillan 's credibility , calling her story " quite unsupported by other evidence " and noting that she " showed a readiness to admit that she may have been mistaken as regards very positive statements previously made when by the questions it appeared there may be independent evidence she was wrong " . In addition to agreeing with Ives on the points of law , he felt that the jury had not based its finding of fact on the evidence in the case . Justices Mitchell and Ford concurred . Justice Clarke , in dissent , agreed that MacMillan 's story was unlikely , but expressed a willingness to defer to the jury on questions of fact . On the legal questions , he cited a precedent written by Justice Harvey himself in which the chief justice had argued that the inclusion of seduced women as potential plaintiffs under the Seduction Act proved that its framers intended a broader definition of damage than financial damage . Justice Lunney concurred . The court was unanimous in upholding Ives ' dismissal of Allan MacMillan 's action , and he did not appeal further . 
 Not satisfied with the verdict , the Bulletin again organized a campaign to fund an appeal , which was submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada ; on March 1 , 1937 , Ives ' decision was overturned . Chief Justice Lyman Duff , writing for the majority , accepted the jury 's finding of fact and , echoing Justice Clarke , concluded that the framers of the Alberta Seduction Act had not intended that damage to a <unk> be required to be the same as those to her father or employer ( i.e. financial ) in order to be actionable . The court ordered Brownlee to pay $ 10 @,@ 000 in damages to MacMillan , plus trial costs . Henry Hague Davis in dissent focussed less on the questions of law and more on the evidence in the case , and argued that the jury 's finding of fact was perverse and that the appeal should be dismissed . 
 After the Supreme Court ruling , Brownlee settled with MacMillan , but still desired to clear his name . On July 1 , 1937 , the federal government by Order in Council gave him leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council , at the time Canada 's highest court of appeal . On March 11 and 12 , 1940 , the committee heard Brownlee 's appeal . It was denied , as the committee endorsed the Supreme Court of Canada 's focus on statutory interpretation .

 For John Brownlee 's political career , Ives ' ruling and the subsequent appeals were irrelevant : once the jury 's finding came down , he immediately announced that he would resign as soon as a replacement could be found . On July 10 , 1934 , he was succeeded as Premier by Richard Gavin Reid , his government 's Treasurer and Minister of Health and Municipal Affairs . Brownlee stayed on as MLA and sought to retain his Ponoka seat in the 1935 provincial election , but was trounced by Edith Rogers of William Aberhart 's Alberta Social Credit League . Not a single UFA member won re @-@ election as Aberhart 's movement and its promises of innovative solutions to the western world 's economic problems rode to a decisive victory . In evaluating Social Credit 's victory , historians unanimously cite the province 's dire economic straits as the main factor , though University of Alberta historian David Elliott has acknowledged that " Aberhart and his cause were also helped " by the seduction scandal . This view has been endorsed by University of Western Ontario sociologist Edward Bell . John Barr , in his history of the Alberta Social Credit Party , is more dismissive , calling it " unlikely " that the scandal was a major factor in the UFA 's defeat . 
 Brode acknowledges that the question of whether Brownlee seduced MacMillan " defies any definitive answer " but says that the evidence presented in the trial did not justify a finding that he did , and speculates that if MacMillan had brought her suit in a later generation she would have been " laughed out of court " . Lakeland College historian and Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster does not take a position on whether or not Brownlee was guilty of seduction , but hints that a likely truth might lie " between the two extremes " of the parties ' claims : that Brownlee and MacMillan did have a consensual affair which was then <unk> and exploited by the premier 's more opportunistic and vengeful opponents . He leaves little doubt that he considers the behaviour of the Edmonton Bulletin and of the Liberal Party , especially its leader , William R. Howson , to have been profoundly unethical . Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel has criticized Foster for being too friendly towards Brownlee , saying that he does not consider the scandal sufficiently from MacMillan 's perspective . 
 A play at the 2008 Edmonton International Fringe Festival , Respecting the Action for Seduction : The Brownlee Affair , was based on the scandal , and received average to above average reviews . 
 After leaving office , John Brownlee returned to the practice of law . He died in 1961 . Vivian MacMillan stayed out of the limelight . She did not marry Caldwell , and returned to Edson , where on August 7 , 1935 , she wed confectioner Henry Sorenson . Following her husband 's death , she became the bookkeeper for a Calgary construction company . After an affair , she married her boss , Frank Howie , in 1955 . Vivian Howie died in 1980 . 
 = Brandenburg @-@ class battleship = 
 The four Brandenburg @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships were Germany 's first ocean @-@ going battleships . They were also the first German warship , of any type , to be fitted with wireless communications . The class comprised Brandenburg , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm , Weissenburg , and Wörth . All were laid down in 1890 and completed by 1893 , except for Weissenburg , which was completed in 1894 . The lead ship , Brandenburg , was built at the cost of 9 @.@ 3 million Marks and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm cost 11 @.@ 23 million Marks . The British Royal Navy derisively referred to the ships as the " whalers . " 
 Brandenburg and her three sisters served in a wide range of roles . In 1900 , the four ships were deployed to China during the Boxer Rebellion , after which they were substantially modernized . In 1910 , two of the ships , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg , were sold to the Ottoman Navy . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was sunk in 1915 by a British submarine while Weissenburg survived the war , only to be broken up in 1938 . Brandenburg and Wörth saw limited service during World War I as coastal defense ships before they were withdrawn for auxiliary duties . Both ships were sold for scrapping in May 1919 . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Brandenburg @-@ class ships were the first ocean @-@ going battleships built by the German Navy . They followed a number of coastal defense ships , including the Siegfried and Odin classes that were only intended for local defense of the German coastline . Design work on the ships began in late 1888 , under the leadership of Vice Admiral Alexander von Monts , who also secured funding for the new ships from the Reichstag . Admiral von Monts was the first naval officer appointed by the recently crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II . 
 The Brandenburg @-@ class ships were the foundation of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet . As they represented a shift in the strategic outlook of the German navy , the traditional method of ship construction , which relied heavily on foreign models , was abandoned . Some experimentation was implemented in the design process , particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships . Brandenburg and Wörth were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials , while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel @-@ steel alloy armor plating . The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation . While a novel concept , the midships turret caused prohibitive blast damage to the surrounding superstructure when fired , which led to the idea being abandoned . This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto @-@ dreadnoughts . This is incorrect , as the guns were not the same caliber , and the ships were designed to fight at close range , unlike the later dreadnought battleships . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships of the Brandenburg @-@ class were 113 @.@ 9 m ( 373 ft 8 in ) long at the waterline and 115 @.@ 7 m ( 379 ft 7 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 19 @.@ 5 m ( 64 ft ) which was increased to 19 @.@ 74 m ( 64 ft 9 in ) with the addition of torpedo nets , and had a draft of 7 @.@ 6 m ( 24 ft 11 in ) forward and 7 @.@ 9 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) aft . The Brandenburgs displaced 10 @,@ 013 t ( 9 @,@ 855 long tons ) at their designed weight , and up to 10 @,@ 670 t ( 10 @,@ 500 long tons ) at full combat load . 
 As was the standard for German warships of the period , the hulls of the Brandenburg @-@ class ships were constructed from both transverse and longitudinal steel frames , over which the steel side plates were riveted . The vessels had 13 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 48 percent of the length of the hull . The German navy regarded the ships as excellent sea @-@ boats ; the Brandenburgs had easy motion . They were also responsive to commands from the bridge and had a moderate turning circle . Speed loss at hard rudder was reduced to 30 percent , and the metacentric height was 1 @.@ 05 m ( 3 ft 5 in ) . However , the ships were " wet " at high speeds and suffered from severe pitching . The ships ' crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men , though while serving as the squadron flagship the standard crew was augmented by an additional 9 officers and 54 men . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 The ships were equipped with two sets of 3 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion engines ; each set drove a 3 @-@ bladed screw that was 5 m ( 16 ft ) in diameter . Both sets had their own engine room . Twelve transverse cylindrical boilers , with three fireboxes each , supplied steam to the engines at up to 12 atmospheres of pressure . The boilers were also divided into two boiler rooms . The engines were rated at 10 @,@ 000 ihp ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) , though in practice maximum power ranged from 9 @,@ 686 ihp ( 7 @,@ 223 kW ) for Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm to 10 @,@ 228 ihp ( 7 @,@ 627 kW ) in Wörth . The ships had a designed speed of 16 @.@ 5 knots ( 30 @.@ 6 km / h ; 19 @.@ 0 mph ) ; Brandenburg was the slowest , at 16 @.@ 3 knots ( 30 @.@ 2 km / h ; 18 @.@ 8 mph ) , while Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Wörth both achieved 16 @.@ 9 knots ( 31 @.@ 3 km / h ; 19 @.@ 4 mph ) on trials . The ships were designed to carry 650 t ( 640 long tons ) of coal for the boilers , though additional spaces in the hull allowed for up to 1 @,@ 050 t ( 1 @,@ 030 long tons ) . This enabled a maximum range of 4 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 000 km ; 4 @,@ 900 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Electrical power was provided by three generators . The equipment varied from ship to ship ; power output ranged from 72 @.@ 6 to 96 @.@ 5 kilowatts at 67 volts . The ships each had a single rudder .

 The vessels were unusual for their time in possessing a broadside of six heavy guns in three twin gun turrets , rather than the four guns typical of contemporary battleships . The forward and after turret carried 28 cm ( 11 inch ) K L / 40 guns , while the center turret carried a shorter L / 35 barrel . The shorter barrels were required to allow the turret to train from side to side . The L / 40 guns were mounted in Drh.L. C / 92 type turrets , which provided depression to − 5 degrees and elevation to 25 degrees . Both types of guns could fire armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) and high explosive ( HE ) shells . These shells weighed 240 kg ( 529 lb ) , and used the 73 kg ( 161 lb ) RPC 12 propellant charge . Muzzle velocity for the L / 40 gun was 820 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 690 fps ) . At maximum elevation , these guns could hit targets out to 15 @,@ 900 m ( 17 @,@ 400 yards ) . Because the barrels of the L / 35 guns were shorter , they had a correspondingly lower muzzle velocity , which was approximately 685 mps ( 2 @,@ 247 fps ) . As a result , the range of the guns was somewhat shorter , at about 14 @,@ 400 m ( 15 @,@ 700 yd ) . At a range of 12 @,@ 000 m ( 13 @,@ 000 yd ) , the AP shell could penetrate up to 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) of belt armor . Ammunition magazines stored a total of 352 shells . 
 The Brandenburg class 's secondary armament initially consisted of seven 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) SK L / 35 quick @-@ firing guns in casemates arranged around the forward superstructure . During the modernization between 1902 and 1904 , the Brandenburgs received an additional 10 @.@ 5 cm gun . These guns were supplied with a total of 600 rounds , although after the modernization , the 10 @.@ 5 cm magazines were increased to provide storage for a total of 1 @,@ 184 shells . 
 The ships also carried eight 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns , also mounted in casemates . Four were placed in pairs in sponsons towards the bow , while the remaining four were emplaced around the rear superstructure . These guns were supplied with a total of 2 @,@ 000 shells , though as with the 10 @.@ 5 cm guns , ammunition storage was increased during the modernization , to 2 @,@ 384 rounds . These guns fired 13 @.@ 8 kg ( 30 @.@ 4 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of 590 mps ( 1 @,@ 936 fps ) . Their rate of fire was approximately 15 shells per minute ; the guns could engage targets out to 10 @,@ 500 m ( 11 @,@ 500 yd ) . The gun mounts were manually operated . 
 The ships were also armed with six 45 cm torpedo tubes , all in above @-@ water swivel mounts . Four tubes were mounted on the sides of the ship , another in the bow , and the last in the stern . The tubes were supplied with a total of 16 torpedoes . These weapons were 5 @.@ 1 m ( 201 in ) long and carried an 87 @.@ 5 kg ( 193 lb ) TNT warhead . They could be set at two speeds for different ranges . At 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , the torpedoes had a range of 800 m ( 870 yd ) . At an increased speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , the range was reduced to 500 m ( 550 yd ) . One of the tubes was removed during the modernization . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 Weissenburg and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm were armored with nickel steel Krupp armor , but due to delivery problems , Brandenburg and Wörth were armored with a composite armor . The composite armor was constructed by layering steel @-@ clad wrought iron plates and wood planks , which was backed by two more layers of sheet iron . Krupp 's nickel steel armor was based on the Harvey process , which enriched the upper layers of the steel with carbon . This type of armor produced greater strength with thinner armor belts , which enabled ships equipped with it to carry more complete protection . Some portions of Brandenburg did receive the new Krupp armor , including the barbettes that held the fore and center main battery turrets . All four ships retained teak backing to their armor belts . 
 The Brandenburgs had a 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick armored deck . The forward conning tower had 300 mm ( 12 in ) thick sides and a 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick roof . Above the waterline , the armored belt was 400 mm ( 16 in ) in the central portion of the ship and tapered slightly to 300 mm fore and aft . Including the teak backing , the total thickness of the belt in the strongest area was 600 mm ( 24 in ) . Below the waterline , the armored belt was significantly thinner ; the thickest section of the belt was 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick , and tapered down to 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) on either end of the belt . The ships ' cupolas had 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick roofs and sides that consisted of three 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick layers , for a total of 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) . The barbettes were 300 mm thick and backed with 210 mm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) of wood .

 Ordered as battleship A , Brandenburg was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1890 . She was launched on 21 September 1891 . Fitting out work , which included the installation of the ship 's armament , lasted until 19 November 1893 when she was commissioned into the German navy . Wörth was ordered as battleship B , and was laid down at Germaniawerft in Kiel also in 1890 . Initial work on the ship proceeded the slowest of all four vessels of the class ; she was launched on 6 August 1892 . Fitting out work proceeded quickly , and she was commissioned on 31 October 1893 , the first ship of the class to enter active duty . Weissenburg , ordered as battleship " C " , was also laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in 1890 and launched on 14 December 1891 . She was the last ship of the class to enter active service , when she was commissioned on 5 June 1894 . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was the fourth and final ship of the class . She was ordered as battleship D , and was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven in 1890 . She was the first ship of the class to be launched , on 30 June 1891 . She was commissioned into the fleet the same day as her sister Brandenburg . 
 Shortly after the turn of the century , the ships were all taken into the drydocks at the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven for a major reconstruction . Wörth was the first to do so , starting in 1901 . Weissenburg followed in 1902 , Brandenburg in 1903 , and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm entered the shipyard in 1904 . During the modernization , a second conning tower was added in the aft superstructure , along with a gangway . The ships had their boilers replaced with newer models , and also had the hamper amidships reduced . The modifications resulted in a weight decrease of between 500 t ( 490 long tons ; 550 short tons ) and 700 t ( 690 long tons ; 770 short tons ) depending on the ship . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The ships of the Brandenburg @-@ class were assigned to the I Division of the I Battle Squadron upon their commissioning , along with the four older Sachsen @-@ class armored frigates , though by 1901 – 2 , the Sachsens were replaced by the new Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships . They saw their first major operation in 1900 , when they were deployed to China during the Boxer Rebellion . The expeditionary force consisted of the four Brandenburgs , six cruisers , 10 freighters , three torpedo boats , and six regiments of marines , under the command of Marshal Alfred von Waldersee . Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz opposed the plan , which he saw as unnecessary and costly . The force arrived in China after the siege of Peking had already been lifted . As a result , the task force suppressed local uprisings around Kiaochow . In the end , the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks . 
 After the Brandenburg @-@ class ships emerged from their refit in 1905 , they rejoined the active fleet . However , they were rapidly made obsolete by the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 . As a result , their service careers were limited . On 12 September 1910 , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg , the more advanced ships of the class , were sold to the Ottoman Empire and renamed Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis respectively . At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Brandenburg and Wörth were assigned to coastal defense duties , though this lasted only until 1915 , when they were withdrawn from active service . That year , both ships were transferred to the role of barracks ships ; Brandenburg was stationed in Libau while Wörth was in Danzig . It was intended to rebuild Brandenburg as a target ship , though this plan was eventually abandoned . Both Brandenburg and Wörth were struck from the naval register on 13 May 1919 and sold for scrapping . The two ships were purchased by Norddeutsche Tiefbauges , a shipbreaking firm headquartered in Berlin ; the firm had Brandenburg towed to Danzig where she and her sister ship were broken up for scrap . 
 On 8 August 1915 , Barbaros Hayreddin was en route to support the Turkish defenses at the Dardanelles when she was sunk by the British submarine HMS E11 , with the loss of 253 men . On 19 January 1918 , the battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau left the Dardanelles to attack British ships . At 11 : 30 , Goeben ran aground and was subjected to air attacks , which impeded salvage attempts . On 25 January , Turgut Reis arrived on the scene and towed the battlecruiser back to port . Turgut Reis survived the war and was used as a training ship in 1924 . She was later used as a hulk in the Bosporus , and eventually scrapped in 1938 . 
 = Illinois @-@ class battleship = 
 The Illinois @-@ class was a group of three pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the United States Navy commissioned at the beginning of the 20th century . The three ships , Illinois , Alabama , and Wisconsin , were built between 1896 and 1901 . They were transitional ships ; they incorporated advances over preceding designs , including the first modern gun turrets for the main battery , and new rapid @-@ firing secondary guns , but they were also the last American battleships to feature dated technologies like fire @-@ tube boilers and Harvey armor . They were armed with a main battery of four 13 @-@ inch ( 330 mm ) guns in two twin turrets , supported by a secondary battery of fourteen 6 in ( 150 mm ) guns . The ships had a designed speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , though they exceeded that speed by a significant margin . 
 The three ships served in a variety of roles and locations throughout their career . Illinois served with the North Atlantic Squadron and the European Squadron early in her career , while Wisconsin served as the flagship of the Pacific Fleet and then in the Asiatic Fleet . Illinois and Alabama started the cruise of the Great White Fleet in December 1907 from the east coast of the United States , though by the time they had rounded South America and stopped in California , Alabama was forced to leave the fleet due to machinery problems . Wisconsin joined the fleet there and continued on with it to the conclusion of its tour in February 1909 . All three ships were modernized in 1909 and served in the Atlantic Fleet for a short time . 
 By 1912 , all three ships had been reduced to the reserve fleet and were primarily employed as training ships . They continued in this role during World War I , training men to operate the machinery of warships and transports for the war effort . They were all decommissioned by 1920 . Illinois was loaned to the New York Naval Militia and was converted into a floating arsenal . Renamed Prairie State in 1941 , she was eventually sold for scrapping in 1956 . Wisconsin was broken up for scrap in 1922 , while Alabama was expended as a target ship in September 1921 in bombing tests with the US Army Air Service . 
 = = Design = = 
 Design work on what became the Illinois class began on 25 March 1896 , when Rear Admiral J. G. Walker convened a board to consider future battleship designs . At this time , the only modern battleship in service was the low @-@ freeboard Indiana ; the high @-@ freeboard battleship Iowa and the low @-@ freeboard Kearsarge class were under construction . As the Navy had little experience with modern battleships , the question settled on whether to repeat one of the low @-@ freeboard designs , which were suitable for coast defense , to build another Iowa , or to request a new design altogether . The Walker Board determined that another coastal battleship design would be imprudent , since the United States had long coastlines and therefore the new ships would need to have better seakeeping qualities than the Indiana or Kearsarge designs . 
 War games conducted by the fleet led the board to specify a draft of no more than 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) to allow the ships to enter the comparatively shallow ports of the Gulf Coast . This limitation had a significant effect on the design ; to meet it , weight would have to be kept to a minimum , which prevented copying the Iowa design outright , unless the main armament was reduced from 13 @-@ inch ( 330 mm ) to 12 in ( 300 mm ) guns . The board was unwilling to make that concession , and so a new design would be required . In addition , the board had determined that the 8 in ( 200 mm ) secondary gun was unnecessary , since though it could penetrate the thinner casemate armor on enemy battleships , it could not deliver a high @-@ explosive shell through the armor . Instead , the board decided that a new 6 in ( 150 mm ) rapid @-@ firing gun would be superior . It would also simplify the ammunition supply , since there would be only one secondary caliber . 
 The board determined that the armor layout of the Kearsarge design was sufficient and adopted it without change for the new ships . They did discard the superposed turrets of the <unk> , though , by mounting most of the secondary guns in a battery amidships . A new turret design for the main battery was adopted ; instead of the old , round Monitor @-@ style turrets of earlier ships , the Illinois design featured a balanced turret with sloped armor on the face . Since it was balanced , it would prevent the ship from listing when the battery was trained to either broadside , as was the case with the <unk> . The US Congress authorized three new battleships on 10 June 1896 ; the Bureau of Construction and Repair issued its requests for tenders from the various American shipbuilding companies twelve days later . Contracts for the new ships , to be named Illinois , Alabama , and Wisconsin , were awarded on 28 August .

 The ships of the Illinois class were 368 feet ( 112 m ) long at the waterline and 374 ft ( 114 m ) long overall . They had a beam of 72 ft 3 in ( 22 @.@ 02 m ) and a draft of 23 ft 6 in ( 7 @.@ 16 m ) . They displaced 11 @,@ 565 long tons ( 11 @,@ 751 t ) as designed and up to 12 @,@ 250 long tons ( 12 @,@ 450 t ) at full load . As built , they were fitted with heavy military masts , but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909 . They had a crew of 40 officers and 496 enlisted men . The crew increased to 690 – 713 later in her career . Steering was controlled with a single rudder , and the ships had a turning radius of 362 yards ( 331 m ) at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . The ships ' transverse metacentric height was 2 @.@ 7 feet ( 0 @.@ 82 m ) . 
 The ships were powered by two @-@ shaft triple @-@ expansion steam engines rated at 16 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) . Steam was provided by eight coal @-@ fired fire @-@ tube boilers that were trunked into a pair of funnels that were arranged side @-@ by @-@ side . They were the last ships of the US Navy to use fire @-@ tube boilers ; subsequent designs changed to more efficient and lighter water @-@ tube boilers . The engines generating a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , though they exceeded their rated performance on trials , with Illinois reaching 17 @.@ 45 knots ( 32 @.@ 32 km / h ; 20 @.@ 08 mph ) on 12 @,@ 757 ihp ( 9 @,@ 513 kW ) . The ships could store up to 1 @,@ 270 long tons ( 1 @,@ 290 t ) of coal , which allowed them to steam for 4 @,@ 190 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 760 km ; 4 @,@ 820 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships were armed with a main battery of four 13 in ( 330 mm ) / 35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline , one forward and aft . These guns fired a 1 @,@ 130 @-@ pound ( 510 kg ) shell with a 500 lb ( 230 kg ) brown powder charge , though this was replaced with a 180 lb ( 82 kg ) smokeless powder charge , which produced a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 000 feet per second ( 610 m / s ) . The gun had a range of 12 @,@ 500 yards ( 11 @,@ 400 m ) , though Navy regulations prescribed opening fire at 8 @,@ 000 yards ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) ; even this was beyond the range at which gunners at the time could reliably hit . At a range of 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) , the shells could penetrate 20 inches ( 510 mm ) of steel . The gun was slow @-@ firing , requiring 320 seconds between shots . The guns were mounted in Mark IV turrets , which had a range of elevation of 15 degrees to -5 degrees . The turrets required the guns to return to 2 degrees for loading . Ammunition storage was 60 shells per gun . 
 The secondary battery consisted of fourteen 6 in ( 152 mm ) / 40 caliber Mark IV guns , which were placed in casemates in the hull . They fired a 105 lb ( 48 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 660 m / s ) . For close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats , they carried sixteen 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) 6 @-@ pounder guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and six 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 1 @-@ pounder guns . These guns fired 6 @.@ 03 lb ( 2 @.@ 74 kg ) and 1 @.@ 088 lb ( 0 @.@ 494 kg ) shells , respectively . As was standard for capital ships of the period , the Illinois class carried four 18 in ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes in above @-@ water , hull mounted torpedo launchers . They were initially equipped with the Mark II whitehead design , which carried a 140 pounds ( 64 kg ) warhead and had a range of 800 yards ( 730 m ) at a speed of 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) .

 From their commissioning , Alabama and Illinois served with the North Atlantic Squadron . Both ships made visits to Europe during their early careers , and Illinois served as the flagship of the European Squadron for a short time in 1902 . She accidentally ran aground outside Oslo , Norway , in 1902 and returned to the North Atlantic Squadron in January 1903 . Wisconsin , having been built on the west coast of the United States , instead served in the Pacific Fleet as its flagship . In 1903 , she was transferred to the Asiatic Fleet , and remained there until late 1906 when she returned to California . 
 Illinois and Alabama steamed with the Great White Fleet on its world cruise that started in December 1907 . Wisconsin joined the fleet after it had rounded South America in July 1908 ; Alabama had to leave the fleet owing to engine damage that required repairs . Alabama was detached along with the battleship Maine ; the two ships continued the journey independently and on a greatly shortened itinerary . The rest of the ships then crossed the Pacific and stopped in Australia , the Philippines , and Japan before continuing on through the Indian Ocean . They transited the Suez Canal and toured the Mediterranean before crossing the Atlantic , arriving bank in Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909 for a naval review with President Theodore Roosevelt . 
 The three ships were modernized after their return in 1909 ; from 1912 , they were placed in reserve commission and employed as training ships for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy and naval militia units . They continued in this role through World War I , which the United States entered on 6 April 1917 . The ships trained engine room personnel , armed guards for merchant ships , and other specialties . Following the German surrender in November 1918 , most of the battleships of the Atlantic Fleet were used as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France . The Illinois @-@ class ships were not so employed , however , owing to their short range and small size , which would not permit sufficient additional accommodations . 
 The Illinois @-@ class ships served with the fleet only briefly after the war , still as training ships . By 1920 , they had all been decommissioned . Wisconsin was sold for scrapping in January 1922 and broken up for scrap . Illinois was instead converted into a floating armory for the New York Naval Militia ; renamed Prairie State in 1941 , she served in this role until 1956 , when she too was sold for scrap . Alabama met a more spectacular end as a target ship for bombing experiments conducted with the US Army Air Service in September 1921 . She was hit with several bombs , including white phosphorus weapons and 2 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 910 kg ) armor @-@ piercing bombs , before eventually foundering .

 = Mackinac Island = 
 Mackinac Island ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ in @-@ aw ) is an island and resort area , covering 3 @.@ 8 square miles ( 9 @.@ 8 km2 ) in land area , in the U.S. state of Michigan . It is located in Lake Huron , at the eastern end of the Straits of Mackinac , between the state 's Upper and Lower Peninsulas . The island was home to an Odawa settlement before European exploration began in the 17th century . It served a strategic position as a center on the commerce of the Great Lakes fur trade . This led to the establishment of Fort Mackinac on the island by the British during the American Revolutionary War . It was the site of two battles during the War of 1812 . 
 In the late 19th century , Mackinac Island became a popular tourist attraction and summer colony . Much of the island has undergone extensive historical preservation and restoration ; as a result , the entire island is listed as a National Historic Landmark . It is well known for its numerous cultural events ; its wide variety of architectural styles , including the famous Victorian Grand Hotel ; its fudge ; and its ban on almost all motor vehicles . More than 80 percent of the island is preserved as Mackinac Island State Park . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Like many historic places in the Great Lakes region , Mackinac Island 's name derives from a Native American language . Native Americans in the Straits of Mackinac region likened the shape of the island to that of a turtle . Therefore , they named it " <unk> " ( Ojibwe <unk> @-@ <unk> ) meaning " big turtle " . Andrew Blackbird , an Odawa historian , said it was named after a tribe that had lived there . The French spelled it with their version of the original pronunciation : Michilimackinac . The British shortened it to the present name : " Mackinac . " Michillimackinac is also spelled as <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , Mi @-@ shi @-@ ne @-@ macki naw @-@ go , <unk> , <unk> . 
 The Menominee traditionally lived in a large territory of 10 million acres extending from Wisconsin to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan . Historic references include one by Father Frederic Baraga , a Slovenian missionary priest in Michigan , who in his 1878 dictionary wrote : 
 <unk> ; <unk> — This name is given to some strange Indians ( according to the sayings of the <unk> [ Ojibwe ] ) , who are rowing through the woods , and who are sometimes heard shooting , but never seen . And from this word , the name of the village of Mackinac , or Michillimackinac , is derived . 
 <unk> is the Menominee word for turtle . In his 1952 The Indian Tribes of North America , John Reed Swanton recorded under the " Wisconsin " section : " Menominee , " a band named " <unk> <unk> Kimiko <unk> <unk> , ' Michilimackinac People , ' near the old fort at Mackinac , Mich . " 
 In an early written history of Mackinac Island ( 1887 ) by Andrew Blackbird , an official interpreter for the U.S. government and an Ottawa chief 's son , he describes that a small independent tribe called " Mi @-@ shi @-@ ne @-@ macki naw @-@ go " once occupied Mackinac Island . They became confederated with the Ottawa from Ottawa Island ( now Manitoulin Island ) situated north of Lake Huron . One winter the Mi @-@ shi @-@ ne @-@ macki naw @-@ go on Mackinac Island were almost entirely annihilated by the Seneca people from New York , who were part of the Iroquois Confederacy . Only two of the local natives escaped by hiding in one of the natural caves at the island . To commemorate the losses of this allied tribe , the Ottawa named what is now Mackinac Island , as " Mi @-@ shi @-@ ne @-@ macki @-@ <unk> . " In 1895 Fort Mackinac 's John R. Bailey , M. D. published his history , entitled Mackinac formerly Michilimackinac , describing some of the first recorded presence on Mackinac of French traders . They arrived in 1654 with a large party of Huron and Ottawa heading to Three Rivers ; another visitor was an adventurer making a canoe voyage in 1665 .

 Archaeologists have excavated prehistoric fishing camps on Mackinac Island and in the surrounding areas . <unk> , pottery , and other artifacts establish a Native American presence at least 700 years before European exploration , around AD 900 . The island is a sacred place in the tradition of some of its earliest known inhabitants , the Anishinaabe ( Ojibwa ) tribes , who consider it to be home to the <unk> Manitou , or the " Great Spirit " . According to legend , Mackinac Island was created by the Great Hare , <unk> and was the first land to appear after the recession of the Great Flood . The island was a gathering place for the local tribes where their offerings were made to <unk> Manitou , and it was the burial place of tribal chiefs .

 The first European likely to have seen Mackinac Island is Jean Nicolet , a French @-@ Canadian <unk> de bois , during his 1634 explorations . The Jesuit priest Claude <unk> founded a mission for the Native Americans on Mackinac Island in 1670 , and stayed over the winter of 1670 – 71 . <unk> 's fall 1671 successor , the missionary and explorer Jacques Marquette , moved the mission to St. Ignace soon after his arrival . With the mission as a focus , the Straits of Mackinac quickly became an important French fur trading location . The British took control of the Straits of Mackinac after the French and Indian War and Major Patrick Sinclair chose the bluffs of the island for Fort Mackinac in 1780 . 
 The Jesuit Relations ( 1671 ) contains a long description of Mackinac Island : 
 its fisheries , its phenomena of wind and tide , and the tribes who , now and in the past , have made it their abode . A favorite resort for all the <unk> tribes , many are returning to it since the peace with the Iroquois . On this account , the Jesuits have begun a new mission , opposite Mackinac , called St. Ignace . Thither have fled the Hurons , driven from <unk> Bay by fear of the Sioux , “ the Iroquois of the West . " 
 The Relations also indicate the tremendous strategic importance of Michillimackinac / Mackinac Island as " the central point for all travel on the upper Great Lakes , and for a vast extent of wilderness and half @-@ settled country beyond " to First Nations and Europeans ( prior to the arrival of railroads ) . The tribes who had inhabited Mackinac Island had been driven away by the Iroquois , leaving the island practically deserted until 1670 . The Huron people from Lake Superior , in fear of the Sioux , retreated to the shore north of Mackinac Island . Here Marquette continued his missionary labors with them , at the site of the present St. Ignace . Denonville ’ s memoir of 1688 claimed that the French had inhabited the area since 1648 . A small French garrison was sent there some time between 1679 and 1683 . 
 The name of Michillimackinac ( later abbreviated to Mackinac ) was applied generally to the entire vicinity , as well as specifically to the post at St. Ignace . Later it was applied to the fort and mission established on the south side of the Strait of Mackinac . 
 Although the British built Fort Mackinac to protect their settlement from attack by French @-@ Canadians and native tribes , the fort was never attacked during the American Revolutionary War . The entire Straits area was officially acquired by the United States through the Treaty of Paris in 1783 . However , much of the British forces did not leave the Great Lakes area until after 1794 , when Jay 's Treaty established U.S. sovereignty over the Northwest Territory . 
 = = = 19th century to present = = = 
 During the War of 1812 , the British captured the fort in the first battle of the conflict because the Americans had not yet heard that war had been declared . The victorious British attempted to protect their prize by building Fort George on the high ground behind Fort Mackinac . In 1814 , the Americans and British fought a second battle on the north side of the island . The American second @-@ in @-@ command , Major Andrew Hunter Holmes , was killed and the Americans failed to recapture the island . 
 Despite this outcome , the Treaty of Ghent of 1815 forced the British to return the island and surrounding mainland to the U.S. The United States reoccupied Fort Mackinac , and renamed Fort George as Fort Holmes , after Major Holmes . Fort Mackinac remained under the control of the United States government until 1895 and provided volunteers to defend the Union during the American Civil War . The fort was used as a prison for three Confederate sympathizers . 
 John Jacob Astor 's American Fur Company was centered on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported beaver pelts for thirty years . By the middle of the 19th century , commercial fishing for whitefish and lake trout began to replace the fur trade as the island 's primary industry . As sport fishing became more popular in the 1880s , hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake boat from Detroit . 
 Following the Civil War , the island became a popular tourist destination for residents of cities on the Great Lakes . Much of the federal land on Mackinac Island was designated as the second national park , Mackinac National Park , in 1875 , just three years after Yellowstone was named as the first national park . To accommodate an influx of tourists in the 1880s , the boat and railroad companies built hotels , including the Grand Hotel . Souvenir shops began to spring up as a way for island residents to profit from the tourists . Many wealthy industrialists built summer " cottages " along the island 's bluffs for extended stays . When the federal government left the island in 1895 , all of the federal land , including Fort Mackinac , was given to the state of Michigan and became Michigan 's first state park . The Mackinac Island State Park Commission appointed to oversee the island has limited private development in the park and requires leaseholders to maintain the island 's distinctive Victorian architecture . 
 Motor vehicles were restricted at the end of the 19th century because of concerns for the health and safety of the island 's residents and horses after local carriage drivers complained that automobiles startled their horses . This ban continues to the present with exceptions only for emergency and construction vehicles . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Mackinac Island is about 8 miles ( 13 km ) in circumference and 3 @.@ 8 square miles ( 9 @.@ 8 km2 ) in total area . The highest point of the island is the historic Fort Holmes ( originally called Fort George by the British before 1815 ) , which is 320 feet ( 98 m ) above lake level and 890 feet ( 271 m ) above sea level . According to the 2010 United States Census , the island has a year @-@ round population of 492 . The population grows considerably during the summer as hotels , restaurants , bars and retail shops , open only during the summer season , hire short @-@ term employees to accommodate as many as 15 @,@ 000 visitors per day . 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 Mackinac Island was formed as the glaciers of the last ice age began to melt around 13 @,@ 000 BC . The bedrock strata that underlie the island are much older , dating to Late Silurian and Early Devonian time , about 400 to 420 million years ago . Subsurface deposits of halite ( rock salt ) dissolved , allowing the collapse of overlying limestones ; these once @-@ broken but now solidified rocks comprise the Mackinac <unk> . The melting glaciers formed the Great Lakes , and the receding <unk> eroded the limestone bedrock , forming the island 's steep cliffs and rock formations . At least three previous lake levels are known , two of them higher than the present shore : Algonquin level <unk> date to about 13 @,@ 000 years ago , and the Nipissing level shorelines formed 4 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 years ago . During an intermediate period of low water between these two high @-@ water stages , the Straits of Mackinac shrank to a narrow gorge which discharged its water over Mackinac Falls , located just east of the island ( beyond Arch Rock ) , into Lake Huron . 
 As the Great Lakes assumed their present levels , the waterfall was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size . The steep cliffs were one of the primary reasons for the British army 's choice of the island for a fortification ; their decision differed from that of the French army , which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present @-@ day Mackinaw City . The limestone formations are still part of the island 's appeal . However , tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value . One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock , a natural limestone arch , 146 feet ( 45 m ) above the ground . Other popular geologic formations include Devil 's Kitchen , Skull Cave , and Sugar Loaf . 
 = = = Nature = = = 
 Mackinac Island contains a wide variety of terrain , including fields , marshes , bogs , coastline , boreal forest , and limestone formations . The environment is legally preserved on the island by the State Historic Park designation . About half of the shoreline and adjacent waters off Mackinac Island , including the harbor ( Haldimand Bay ) and the southern and western shore from Mission Point to Pointe aux Pins , is protected as part of the Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve , a state marine park . As it is separated from the mainland by 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of water , few large mammals inhabit the island , except those that traverse the ice during the winter months . Rabbits , fox , raccoons , otters , mink , gray and red squirrels , and chipmunks are all common as is the occasional beaver and coyote . Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them . There are many limestone caves serving as homes for the bats and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on . The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats . Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May , while smaller birds such as yellow warblers , American redstart , and indigo bunting are more common in early summer . Near the shoreline , gulls , herons , geese , and loons are common . Owls , including snowy owls and great grey owls , come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate . Other birds , such as chickadees , cardinals , blue jays , and woodpeckers , live on the island year @-@ round . Toads have also been found . 
 Mackinac Island contains over 600 species of vascular plants . Flowering plants and wildflowers are abundant , including trillium , lady slippers , forget @-@ me @-@ nots , violets , trout lily , spring beauty , hepatica , buttercups , and <unk> in the forests and orchids , fringed gentian , butter @-@ and @-@ eggs , and jack @-@ in @-@ the @-@ pulpit along the shoreline .

 The island 's newspaper is the Mackinac Island Town Crier . It has been owned and operated by Wesley H. Maurer Sr. and his family since 1957 as training for journalism . It is published weekly from May through September and bimonthly during the rest of the year . 
 = = Transportation = = 
 The island can be reached by private boat , by ferry , by small aircraft , and in the winter , by snowmobile over an ice bridge . The airport has a 3 @,@ 500 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 070 m ) paved runway , and daily charter air service from the mainland is available . In the summer tourist season , ferry service is available from Arnold Transit Company , Shepler 's Ferry , and Star Line Ferry to shuttle visitors to the island from St. Ignace and Mackinaw City . 
 Motorized vehicles have been prohibited on the island since 1898 , with the exception of snowmobiles during winter , emergency vehicles , and service vehicles . Travel on the island is either by foot , bicycle , or horse @-@ drawn carriage . Roller skates and roller blades are also allowed , except in the downtown area . Bicycles , roller skates / roller blades , carriages , and saddle horses are available for rent . An 8 @-@ mile ( 13 km ) road follows the island 's perimeter , and numerous roads , trails and paths cover the interior . M @-@ 185 , the United States ' only state highway without motorized vehicles , makes a circular loop around the island , closely hugging the shoreline . 
 The island is the location of Mackinac Island State Park , which covers approximately 80 percent of the island and includes Fort Mackinac as well as portions of the island 's historic downtown and harbor . No camping is allowed on the island , but numerous hotels and bed and breakfasts are available . 
 The downtown streets are lined with many retail stores , candy shops , and restaurants . A popular item at the candy shops is the locally produced and nationally known Mackinac Island fudge , leading to tourists sometimes being referred to as " <unk> " . Many shops sell a variety of fudge , and some of the confectioners have been operating for more than a century . The popularity of the fudge has led to the sales and marketing of Mackinac Island fudge not only throughout Michigan but outside the state as well . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Most of the buildings on Mackinac Island are built of wood , a few are of stone , and most have clapboard siding . The architectural styles on the island span 300 years , from the earliest Native American structures to the styles of the 19th century . The earliest structures were built by the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe ( Chippewa ) tribes before European exploration . At least two buildings still exist from the original French settlement in the late 18th century . Mackinac Island has the only example of northern French rustic architecture in the United States , and one of few survivors in North America . 
 Mackinac Island also contains examples of Federalist , Colonial , and Greek Revival styles . Much of the island is built in the later style of the Victorian era which includes Gothic Revival , Stick style , Italianate , Second Empire , Richardson Romanesque and Queen Anne styles . The most recent styles used on the island date from the late 19th century to the 1930s and include the Colonial and Tudor revival styles .

These scouts serve the state park as the Mackinac Island Governor 's Honor Guard . The program began in 1929 , when the State Park Commission invited eight Eagle Scouts , including young Gerald Ford , to serve as honor guards for the Michigan governor . 
 In 1974 , the program was expanded to include Girl Scouts . The program is popular , selective , and a long @-@ standing tradition . Scouts raise and lower twenty @-@ six flags on the island , serve as guides , and complete volunteer service projects during their stay . These scouts live in the Scout Barracks behind Fort Mackinac .

 = The Colours of Animals = 
 The Colours of Animals is a zoology book written in 1890 by Sir Edward Bagnall Poulton ( 1856 – 1943 ) . It was the first substantial textbook to argue the case for Darwinian selection applying to all aspects of animal coloration . The book also pioneered the concept of frequency @-@ dependent selection and introduced the term " aposematism " . 
 The book begins with a brief account of the physical causes of animal coloration . The second chapter gives an overview of the book , describing the various uses of colour in terms of the advantages it can bring through natural selection . The next seven chapters describe camouflage , both in predators and in prey . Methods of camouflage covered include background matching , resemblance to specific objects such as bird droppings , self @-@ decoration with materials from the environment , and the seasonal colour change of arctic animals . Two chapters cover warning colours , including both Batesian mimicry , where the mimic is edible , and Mullerian mimicry , where distasteful species mimic each other . A chapter then looks at how animals combine multiple methods of defence , for instance in the puss moth . Two chapters examine coloration related to sexual selection . Finally Poulton summarizes the subject with a fold @-@ out table including a set of Greek derived words that he invented , of which " aposematic " and " cryptic " survive in biological usage . 
 The Colours of Animals was well received on its publication , although the book 's support for sexual selection was criticised by Alfred Russel Wallace , and its Darwinism and critique of Lamarckism were attacked by Edward Drinker Cope . Wallace liked Poulton 's experimental work but was critical of his opinions on sexual selection . The Neo @-@ Lamarckian Cope criticised Poulton 's support for Darwin but liked the book 's many observations of animal coloration . Modern biologists respect Poulton 's advocacy of natural selection and sexual selection , despite the lack at the time of an adequate theory of heredity , and his recognition of frequency @-@ dependent selection .

 Evidence for natural selection 
 Poulton explains in his Preface that 
 My chief object has been to demonstrate the utility of colour and marking in animals . In many cases I have attempted to prove that Natural Selection has sufficed to account for the results achieved ; and I fully believe that further knowledge will prove that this principle explains the origin of all appearances except those which are due to the subordinate principle of Sexual Selection ... 
 Evidence for sexual selection 
 Poulton strongly supports Darwin both on the general theme of natural selection , and on the power of sexual selection in species which are sexually dimorphic ( where , usually , the male is showier than the female ) : 
 When we look at the marvellous eyes upon the train of a Peacock , or the more beautiful markings on the feathers of the male Argus Pheasant , it seems impossible that so wonderful and complete a result can have been produced by the aesthetic preferences of female birds . And yet Mr. Darwin shows the relation between these characters and much simpler markings on other parts of the surface . He proves that the one has been derived from the other by gradual modification ... Such facts , while eminently suggestive of ... some selective agency , seem to be unexplained by any other theory . 
 Poulton knew his view was controversial , but believed he was winning the argument : 
 Mr. Wallace 's chief objection is the lack of evidence that the female has any aesthetic preferences at all in the selection of her mate . When , however , he admits that display of their decorative plumage by male birds is ' demonstrated ' , and that the females are in all probability ' pleased or excited by the display ' , he certainly admits the possession of an aesthetic sense ... 
 Frequency @-@ dependent selection 
 In The Colours of Animals , Poulton introduced the concept of frequency @-@ dependent selection ( selection based on how abundant a form is ) in the context of a polymorphism which he argued would otherwise soon vanish : 
 If we breed from moths developed from the green larvae of , e.g. , the Large Emerald , the larvae in the next generation are chiefly green , and after several generations there is little doubt that the brown form would become excessively rare ; so also the green form would disappear if we bred from the brown varieties . But in nature both forms are common , and therefore it is certain that both must be advantageous to the species , or one of them would quickly disappear . I believe that it is a benefit to the species that some of its larvae should resemble brown and others green catkins , instead of all of them resembling either brown or green . In the former case the foes have a wider range of objects for which they may mistake the larvae , and the search must occupy more time , for equivalent results , than in the case of other species which are not dimorphic . 
 Mimicry and aposematism 
 The basic concept of warning coloration ( aposematism , like the black and yellow pattern of a wasp ) is approached very simply : 
 When an animal possesses an unpleasant attribute , it is often to its advantage to advertise the fact as publicly as possible . In this way it escapes a great deal of experimental ' tasting . ' The conspicuous patterns and strongly contrasted colours which serve as the signal of danger or inedibility are known as Warning Colours . 
 In the next paragraph Poulton ties aposematism to mimicry as follows : 
 It is these Warning Colours which are nearly always the objects of Protective Mimicry , and it will therefore be convenient to describe the former before the latter . 
 Poulton introduced the term aposematism with the words : 
 The second head ( <unk> Colours ) includes Warning Colours and Recognition Markings : the former warn an enemy off , and are therefore called Aposematic ; 
 = = = Contents = = = 
 The book 's structure emphasises the extent to which Poulton , like Darwin , relied on a mass of evidence , mainly from insects , to make his case : 
 Chapter 1 The Physical Cause of Animal Colours . 
 Poulton introduces absorption , scattering , colour due to " thin plates " ( structural coloration ) , diffraction and refraction . 
 Chapter 2 The Uses of Colour . 
 The effects of natural selection in creating or destroying colour are discussed . Colour can be non @-@ significant , e.g. directly useful for absorbing heat , Poulton argues , but " By far the most widespread use of colour is to assist an animal in escaping from its enemies or in capturing its prey ; the former is Protective , the latter Aggressive [ resemblance , i.e. camouflage ] . " The topics of mimicry , warning coloration , and sexual selection are introduced . 
 Chapter 3 Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera . 
 Poulton distinguishes " special " from " general " resemblances , meaning mimicking a specific object " of no interest to its enemies " , or just harmonising " with the general artistic effect of its surroundings " , giving examples from moth caterpillars found in England such as the peppered moth and the brimstone moth . 
 Chapter 4 Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera ( continued ) , Dimorphism , Etc . 
 The privet hawkmoth caterpillar is used as an example of " general resemblance " . Dimorphism , where caterpillars of a species are sometimes green , sometimes brown , is discussed . The delicacy of larvae is given as a reason for their " wonderful concealment " : one touch from a predator " being practically fatal " . The resemblance of Kallima and some moths to dead leaves is examined . 
 Chapter 5 Protective Resemblances In Vertebrata , Etc . 
 The camouflage of snakes , female birds that " undertake the duty of incubation " , birds ' eggs , mammals , fish , and marine molluscs is briefly covered . 
 Chapter 6 Aggressive Resemblances — Adventitious Protection . 
 The camouflage of predators including lizards , angler fish , mantises including <unk> bicornis and the bird @-@ dropping spider is described . " Adventitious protection " , making use of materials from the environment , is illustrated with examples such as the decorator crabs and caddis fly larvae , which build tubes " of grains of sand , small shells ( often alive ) , vegetable fragments " . 
 Chapter 7 Variable Protective Resemblance in Vertebrata , Etc . 
 The ability of animals including fish , lizards and frogs to change their colours quickly is discussed . The changing of the pelage of arctic animals is attributed to the indirect effect of the change in temperature , i.e. a physiological response not a simple physical effect . 
 Chapter 8 Variable Protective Resemblance In Insects . 
 Poulton describes in detail experiments demonstrating that moth pupae take on the colour of the background experienced earlier by the larvae . 
 Chapter 9 Protective Resemblances in Lepidoptera ( continued ) . 
 Poulton discusses the metallic appearance of insect pupae , which he says is the reason for the name " chrysalis " . He rejects the ( Lamarckian ) view of the " origin of colour , by the direct influence of environment accumulated through many generations " , which he agrees is " a very tempting conclusion " , because of " clear evidence that the medium of the nervous system was necessary . 
 Chapter 10 Warning Colours . 
 The conspicuous warning colours of many insects , skunks , snakes and salamanders are discussed . " It must have been obvious to any one interested in natural history that the insects met with during a walk in summer may be arranged in two great groups : ... difficult to find ... and ... startling colours and conspicuous attitudes " The association of warning with " nauseous or dangerous " animals is identified . The idea that warning coloured animals must be scarce relative to palatable ones is mentioned , along with the reason why different animals use the same warning colours . 
 Chapter 11 Warning Colours ( continued ) . 
 Poulton discusses the relationship of colours used for sexual selection and for warning , and continues the discussion of warning with many examples , including Mullerian mimicry , noting that this can both make a pair of distasteful species converge in appearance , and make a group of such species all resemble each other . 
 Chapter 12 Protective Mimicry . 
 The chapter looks at Batesian mimicry ( where the mimic is edible ) in both tropical butterflies and English moths , beginning " We now approach one of the most interesting aspects of our subject " . 
 Chapter 13 Protective and Aggressive Mimicry . 
 Poulton gives examples of mimicry in other insect groups , remarking the " very imperfect " resemblance of bee hawk @-@ moths to bees , which totally failed to " impose on " a lizard , but noting that the much more convincing mimicry of the hornet clearwing moth was treated with extreme caution by an inexperienced lizard . 
 Chapter 14 The Combination of Many Methods of Defence . 
 The chapter describes animals including the puss moth caterpillar which combines a threatening display with camouflage and the ability to eject an irritant fluid for protection . Poulton also discusses the lobster moth caterpillar . 
 Chapter 15 Colours Produced by Courtship . 
 Poulton discusses sexual selection in birds , butterflies and moths , and spiders , which he treats as another process alongside but <unk> to natural selection , with arguments against the views of Alfred Russel Wallace . He notes that it was remarkable that biological research since Darwin had focussed mainly on comparative anatomy and embryology , whereas Darwin himself was interested in " questions which concern the living animal as a whole " , and observes that there are " comparatively few true naturalists " , as opposed to " anatomists , <unk> , systematists , or collectors " . 
 Chapter 16 Other Theories of Sexual <unk> . 
 In this chapter , Poulton looks at " the causes which Mr. Wallace and other writers believe to have been efficient in producing sexual colouring " , such as the principle of " recognition marking " . Poulton uses the example of the satin bowerbird as evidence for an aesthetic sense . 
 Chapter 17 Summary And Classification . 
 Poulton sums up his views with a fold @-@ out table of " The Colours of Animals Classified According to Their Uses " . The Greek derived category names include the now widely used aposematic and cryptic , alongside such epithets as " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " and " <unk> " , with variants .

 = = = = Wallace in Nature = = = = 
 The co @-@ discoverer of natural selection Alfred Russel Wallace , reviewing Poulton in Nature , was interested by Poulton 's observations on thin films producing iridescence : " In some cases dried insects lose some of their metallic colours , but these reappear when the specimen is dipped in water . " However , Wallace objected to Poulton 's suggestion that arctic birds and mammals are white to reduce heat loss by radiation , for which he argued there was no evidence in favour , while a thicker " covering , such as actually occurs in all arctic animals " would reduce heat loss effectively , and could be observed to do so . 
 Wallace was enthusiastic about Poulton 's experimental work on how butterfly larvae vary their coloration according to the background , admiring " a number of ingenious experiments " in which Poulton illuminated the insects in light of one colour or another , causing reliable colour changes which could not be direct , like photography , but had to be mediated by the animal 's nervous system : 
 In some cases even the cocoons spun by the <unk> are modified by the surrounding colours ; and still more curious changes are effected in the larva itself when ... the same species feeds on several plants having differently @-@ coloured leaves . Even the presence of numerous dark twigs has been shown to cause a corresponding change of colour in the larva of the peppered moth ( <unk> betularia ) . " 
 Wallace 's main criticism , occupying half his lengthy review , was of Poulton 's acceptance of sexual selection . He begins by stating " Mr. Poulton fully accepts Darwin 's theory of female choice as the source of the greater part of the brilliant colour , delicate patterns , and ornamental appendages that exist among animals , and especially among birds and insects . " Wallace then cites Poulton on the courtship behaviour of spiders : 
 " ' The female always watches the antics of the male intently , but often refuses him in the end , ' even after dancing before her for a long time . ' Such observations strongly point towards the existence of female preference based on æsthetic considerations ' " 
 at once objecting " To the last four words we demur , as being altogether unproved . Why æsthetic considerations ? " Wallace then spends a whole page attacking Poulton on " the possession of an ' æsthetic sense ' by those creatures in which sexual ornament occurs " . Wallace objects that Poulton asserts the reality of sexual selection with no proof other than mentioning that insects can perceive colour , and that " a few birds collect bright objects , as in the case of the bower @-@ birds " . 
 Wallace gives a detailed counter @-@ example to refute Poulton 's argument , arguing that " really beautiful combinations of colour and marking " are found on the sea shells of molluscs " where sexual selection has certainly not come into play " . To make the point , Wallace lists 
 " the cones , <unk> , olives , harps , volutes , <unk> , and innumerable other molluscan shells ; while many of the sea @-@ anemones , and considerable numbers of the caterpillars with warning colours , are equally beautiful . " 
 And that was not all . Wallace continued : 
 " Still more doubtful and more opposed to reasonable probability is the statement that ' our standards of beauty are largely derived from the contemplation of the numerous examples around us , which ... have been created by the æsthetic preferences of the insect world ' <unk> ... to the colours and structures of flowers as being due to the need of attracting insects to fertilize them . " 
 There was , Wallace insisted , " not a particle of evidence " of aesthetic preferences in " an insect 's very limited mentality " . The mention of the term aesthetic was " not scientific " . 
 After so many " preceding remarks " against " the theory of sexual selection " , Wallace concludes that " The book is well illustrated by numerous excellent woodcuts and a coloured plate " , congratulates Poulton on " having produced so readable and suggestive a volume " , and on having " contributed so largely " by " his own researches " into animal coloration . 
 = = = = New York Times = = = = 
 An anonymous reviewer in the New York Times wrote that " Mr Poulton wishes first of all to put himself right with regard to his attitude to Darwinism " , mentioning that in 1888 he had been cited in the Edinburgh Review as attacking Darwinism . The reviewer hastens to agree that Poulton is in fact " ready to combat Wallace , his master , on points wherein that great fellow @-@ laborer with Charles Darwin dissents from the latter 's views . " 
 As an example of this , the reviewer mentions Poulton 's argument that Wallace must be wrong that " the coloring whereby the sexes often differ one from the other in a startling way is occasioned by a surplus vitality " because " sexual colors are only developed in species which court by day or twilight " and then only on parts of the body which the female " would <unk> and best see them " . 
 The New York Times reviewer argued that the title should have been less general " for readers are sure to demand too much from so comprehensive a term " , given that Poulton refers mainly to insects rather than " wild beasts " , but in the end he agreed " that Mr. Poulton has written a very suggestive treatise , well fitted for the general reader " . 
 = = = = E.D. Cope in American Naturalist = = = = 
 The Neo @-@ Lamarckian Edward Drinker Cope , reviewing the book for the American Naturalist , writes that " Mr. Poulton supports his own theory of the direct physiological value of the uses of colour to animals by a large amount of experimental evidence brought together from many sources " . Cope is attracted by " a detail of great interest " in a caterpillar 's camouflage " by the semblance of a small hole to indicate piercing by insect larvae " ( ichneumon flies , since they avoid caterpillars that are already parasitised ) , and is impressed by Poulton 's observations of " perhaps the most perfect concealment attained by any butterfly " in the dead leaf butterfly Kallima , first described by Alfred Russel Wallace . 
 While admiring of Poulton 's detailed observations , Cope is critical of his support for Darwin , arguing that Poulton fails to explain how the variability that natural selection needs to work on actually arises . ( The mechanisms of mutation and genetics were not to become adequately understood until the twentieth century rediscovery of Mendel 's work . ) 
 Cope also objects to Poulton 's critique of Lamarckism , where in a footnote he cites <unk> <unk> as writing that " other butterflies noticed this immunity [ and ] copied it , to which Cope replies as that " even the American Neo @-@ <unk> [ like Cope ] do not follow their founder so far as to believe that the volition of an animal could account for all the details of mimetic resemblance . " 
 = = = = Science journal = = = = 
 Science reviewed the book in November 1890 . The reviewer remarks that " It is impossible in this brief notice to do full justice to the wealth of interesting examples with which the author presents us " , and notes that unlike the " hackneyed " examples of mimicry and camouflage in other textbooks , " Many of the observations are original . " The reviewer remarks , also , on the " decided antithesis between warning and protective colors " , animals being either " as conspicuous as possible " , or as cryptic as possible , while the conspicuous ones " are usually accompanied by a nauseating taste , strongly smelling or irritant fluids , etc . " 
 The reviewer notes more critically that additional examples of mimicry might have been given , such as of Hymenoptera ( bees and wasps ) mimicked by Diptera ( flies ) , and would have liked fuller treatment of Bates 's " South American <unk> and <unk> " . The reviewer finds the closing chapters on " colors used in courtship " the most interesting of the book , since zoologists disagreed widely on the subject , and notes that Poulton sided with Darwin and against Wallace " who denies that the so @-@ called secondary sexual characters " can " owe their origin to sexual selection " . The reviewer , siding with Poulton , writes that " It would be difficult , we believe , to explain many of the facts cited by Poulton , notably Peckham 's observations on the courtship of spiders , from Wallace 's standpoint . " The review ends with a brief discussion of Poulton 's table classifying animal coloration , predicting ( correctly ) that the " Greek derivatives " such as <unk> and <unk> will not be generally adopted . 
 = = = = British Medical Journal = = = = 
 The British Medical Journal reviewed the book in July 1890 . The review begins by noting that the pre @-@ Darwinian view of colour " to @-@ day appears almost ridiculous " , adding that " we now know " that colour is of benefit to the animal , and is subject to natural selection . The reviewer writes that it is among Lepidoptera ( butterflies and moths ) that " protective resemblance or ' cryptic coloration ' is most beautifully illustrated , and the book teems with instances " of these , noting that Poulton had " made this part of the subject his own " . The review quotes examples including the twig larvae of the Brimstone moth and the " terrifying attitude " of the Puss moth caterpillar . 
 The reviewer , noting Wallace 's different opinion , has no difficulty with Poulton 's view of sexual selection , that it is " due to an aesthetic sense in the [ female ] animals " , and likes Poulton 's expression that " Natural Selection is a qualifying examination which must be passed by all candidates for honours ; Sexual Selection is an honours examination in which many who have passed the previous examination will be rejected . " The review objects to the " thick type headings to the subdivision of chapters " which it finds too much like " the ' new journalism ' " . It concludes by urging readers to compare the book with Darwin 's Descent of Man and with Wallace 's Darwinism . 
 = = = Modern view = = = 
 Poulton was a staunch supporter of Darwin , through a period when there was no adequate theory of heredity and both natural selection and sexual selection had become unpopular among scientists , and was attacked for his support both in The Colours of Animals and outside it . And he is recognised as the first scientist to identify frequency @-@ dependent selection , as described in this book . By 1919 , the book was being described in Nature as a classic work . 
 Poulton is paid homage by J.A. Allen and B.C. Clarke for his pioneering work on frequency dependent selection " by predators acting on non @-@ mimetic polymorphic prey ( i.e. for <unk> selection ) , anticipating many of the points made by later workers . We draw attention to his remarkable insight . " 
 The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography comments that Poulton 's book " concisely and simply explained the many forms of coloration in terms of natural selection ; these forms he ingeniously summarized in a comparative table introducing terms which became the standard nomenclature . " 
 In her book The Ant and the Peacock : Altruism and Sexual Selection from Darwin to Today , the Darwinian philosopher and rationalist Helena Cronin writes that in The Colours of Animals , Poulton defended Darwin 's theory of sexual selection , stressing the role of female choice . She suggests that while people have therefore taken Poulton for a staunch Darwinist and supporter of sexual selection , he " lost his initial enthusiasm for the theory " and " came to relegate it to a very minor position " in evolution . She writes that Poulton 's position was highly influential , stating that later " Darwinian experts on coloration " followed his views , citing Frank Evers Beddard 's 1892 Animal Coloration as evidence . 
 In his Introduction to Hugh Bamford Cott 's 1940 book Adaptive Coloration in Animals , Julian Huxley praised Cott 's work as " a worthy successor to Sir Edward Poulton 's The Colours of Animals ... The one was a pioneer study , the other is in many respects the last word on the subject " .

 = The Snowman ( fairy tale ) = 
 " The Snowman " is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a snowman who falls in love with a stove . It was published by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen as <unk> on 2 March 1861 . Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager describes the tale as a lyrical and poignant complement to Andersen 's " The Fir @-@ Tree " of December 1844 . 
 Wullschlager believes " The Snowman " was the product in part of Andersen ’ s " pining and discontent over " Harald Scharff , a handsome young dancer at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen . According to Wullschlager , the two men entered a relationship in the early 1860s that brought the poet " some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness . " It was the only homosexual affair during Andersen 's life that brought him happiness . 
 = = Plot = = 
 " The Snowman " begins with its eponymous hero standing in the garden of a manor house watching the sun set and the moon rise .. He is only a day old , and quite naive and inexperienced . His sole companion is a watchdog who warns him that the sun will make him run into the ditch . The dog senses a change in the weather , enters his kennel and goes to sleep . 
 At dawn , the land is covered in frosty whiteness when a young couple enter the garden to admire the scene and the Snowman . When they leave , the dog tells the Snowman the couple are sweethearts who will someday move into " the same kennel and share their bones " . He then recounts happier days when he slept under the stove in the housekeeper ‘ s room as a pampered pet . The Snowman can see the stove through a window in the house and believes it is female . He falls in love . The Snowman longs to be in the room with the stove , but the dog warns him he would melt . 
 All day the Snowman gazes upon the stove , and , at twilight , the stove glows . When the door of the room is opened , the flames leap out of the stove and glow upon the snowman 's face and chest . He is delighted . In the morning , the window is covered with frost and the Snowman cannot see the stove . He is stove @-@ sick and cannot enjoy the frosty weather . The dog warns the snowman of an imminent change in the weather . A thaw descends , and , one morning , the snowman collapses . The dog finds a stove poker used to build the snowman within his remains , and then understands why the snowman longed for the stove , " That 's what moved inside him ... Now he is over that , too ! " The girls in the house sing a springtime carol and the snowman is forgotten . 
 = = Background = = 
 Scholars have noted Andersen was attracted to both men and women during his middle years . Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager observes , " Andersen 's diaries leave no doubt that he was attracted to both sexes ; that at times he longed for a physical relationship with a woman and that other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men . " Andersen biographer Alison Prince comments , " It is obvious that Andersen struggled throughout his life with a painful sense of greatness and of being different from others . This was partly due to the suppressed homosexuality which set him apart in loneliness and forced him to take refuge in the safer and more conventional image of the talented and hypersensitive poet ... " Both believe " The Snowman " has its source and inspiration in Andersen 's relationship with a young male ballet dancer associated with the Royal Theater in Copenhagen . 
 = = = Andersen and Harald Scharff = = = 
 In 1857 in Paris , he made the acquaintance of fellow Dane Harald Scharff , a handsome and highly regarded young ballet dancer with Copenhagen 's Royal Theatre . Andersen was returning to Copenhagen via Paris following a visit to Charles Dickens in England , and Scharff was on holiday with his Copenhagen housemate , the actor Lauritz Eckardt . Andersen and Scharff toured Notre Dame together . Three years passed before Andersen again met the pair quite by accident in Bavaria in July 1860 ; the three men enjoyed a week together in Munich and its environs . It is probable that Andersen fell in love with Scharff at this time . According to his diary , Andersen did not " feel at all well " when the two young men left Munich on 9 July 1860 for Salzburg . 
 Following the departure of Scharff and Eckardt for Salzburg , Andersen traveled to Switzerland but grew despondent and then depressed . In November , he returned to Copenhagen and spent Christmas at <unk> , the estate of an aristocratic patron and friend on the coast of Zealand . His spirits lifted with the holiday festivities and " The Snowman ” was composed on New Year ’ s Eve 1860 . It was published with several other new tales by Andersen two months later on 2 March 1861 in New Fairy Tales and Stories . Second Series . First Collection . 1861 @.@ by the Copenhagen publisher C. A. Reitzel . 
 Andersen 's relationship with Scharff continued to develop and early in 1862 the two entered a relationship that brought Andersen " joy , some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness . " Andersen referred to this time in his life as his " erotic period " , but he was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff and displayed his feelings much too openly . Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous . The affair came to an end late in 1863 as Scharff gradually withdrew to focus on his friendship with Eckardt who had married an actress . Andersen noted in his diary 13 November 1863 : " Scharff has not visited me in eight days ; with him it is over . " Andersen took the end of the affair calmly and the two former lovers thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness . Andersen tried several times to lure Scharff into another intimate relationship but without success . 
 = = = Commentaries = = = 
 Andersen retained story ideas in his mind sometimes for years before coalescing with an event or mood in his life , and telling stories such as “ The Snowman ” was a compulsion with him . The tale has been described as poignant and lyrical , and as a self @-@ mocking autobiographical revelation in which Andersen expressed his conviction that love is a burning , unreciprocated pain , and that he would end his life <unk> and alone . The light @-@ hearted Snowman is a complement to Andersen ’ s tragic Fir Tree and , in telling the tale , Andersen returns “ to his earlier , tragicomic mode of sketching the fleeting autobiography of an everyday object which seems to have caught his eye at random and yet whose life story has an uncanny appropriateness to its physical form . ” 
 Andersen referred to " The Snowman " as a simple fairy tale , but the story may be viewed as a metaphor for life . The Snowman remains frozen to the ground , questioning fate , existence , and all that he sees and experiences . In this respect , the Snowman shares a common bond with Hamlet — both grope for what is hidden , for the real behind the surface . But there the similarities end . Scholars Jackie Wullschlager and <unk> Prince argue that Andersen 's tales are expressions of his homosexuality , and Graham Robb author of Strangers : Homosexual Love in the 19th Century calls his work an " Aesop of 19th @-@ century homosexuality " . and many of his heroes the victims of an unpopular sexual preference . " The Snowman " is a tale about misguided love , about a snowman who falls in love with what he believes is a female stove , and is Andersen 's best argument for the price paid for falling in love with the wrong type – with the stove representing the danger in this " wrong " relationship . Andersen spent a lifetime seeking validation by women and experienced only the pain of unreciprocated love . His diaries reveal Andersen resorted to masturbation as a sexual outlet , and one critic notes that " [ Andersen ] so fabulously struck out with the ladies that it seems he simply expanded his dating pool to men to hedge his bets . " 
 Andersen biographer Alison Prince believes the tale to be a parable representing the different kinds of love . When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand @-@ in @-@ hand , the disillusioned old dog tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into " the same kennel together and sharing each other 's bones " . The Snowman has a different idea of love , being enamored of the stove . Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman 's remains " a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems <unk> . "

According to The Buffalo News , Schiff had painted a mural along the school 's stairwell that referenced " drugs , safe sex , AIDS and racism " in the style of artist Keith Haring . In September of that year , the school 's superintendent , Walter S. Polka , decided that parts of the mural 's text were objectionable . The American Civil Liberties Union became involved in an extended legal fight over the constitutionality of Polka 's censorship , and a New York Supreme Court Justice sided with the Lewiston @-@ Porter School Board . In 1991 , the school board voted 5 @-@ 1 to paint over the mural . The board cited Schiff 's involvement in a recent ACT @-@ UP demonstration at the school — where demonstrators gave condoms and safe sex literature to students — as a major influence on their decision . 
 As part of a transition that included moving from Youngstown to Minneapolis to attend college at the University of Minnesota , Schiff shortened his name from the original Schiffhauer as a result of his parents ' shame and refusal to acknowledge his sexuality in the small conservative town of Youngstown NY where the family attended church in a conservative Roman Catholic Parish ( St. Bernard 's , Youngstown , NY ) . However , Robert and Rita Schiffhauer , Gary 's parents , soon joined the PFLAG Chapter in nearby Buffalo , NY in order to understand and support their son which they continued to do throughout their lives . Schiff 's official public statement is that he shortened his name in an effort to move <unk> memories of bullying that he said made his youth " an act of survival " . In October 1992 , he and six other students protested against the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) and its compliance with a longstanding ban on homosexuals in the military . The seven protesters interrupted a meeting of the University Board of Regents , demanded the expulsion of the ROTC from campus , and handcuffed themselves to the Regents ' chairs . Wearing signs that read " $ old , " suggesting that their human rights had been traded for Federal grant money , Schiff and the six other students were arrested by University Police and each charged with misdemeanors . 
 From 1993 to 1995 , Schiff directed the Progressive Student Leadership Exchange ( <unk> ) , a program modeled on the Civil Rights Movement 's Freedom Summer . The Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) took interest in the program , and invited Schiff to direct it as the newly named " Youth College for Campaign Training " in Washington , D.C. The HRC @-@ funded program invited people aged 18 – 24 to participate in workshops , and sent the participants to " target states " where they worked in groups as campaign staff members . The program was still in operation as late as 2006 . 
 After graduating in 1994 with a B.A. in women 's studies , Schiff moved to Washington , D.C. to work with the Human Rights Campaign . He returned to Minneapolis to work with Progressive Minnesota , " a grassroots group focused on community organizing and electoral politics . " In December 1997 , he became involved in a fight to save the Shubert Theater , a former vaudeville house on " Block E " in downtown Minneapolis , after the Minneapolis City Council approved a redevelopment plan that called for the theater 's demolition . Within days , Schiff organized " Save Our Shubert , " a grassroots effort to preserve the theater . After eight months , during which time Save our Shubert acted as a media contact , lobbied the city council , and " kept the Shubert in the public eye " , the Minneapolis City Council voted 9 @-@ 3 to move the theater to a space adjacent to the Hennepin Center for the Arts at a cost of $ 3 @.@ 9 million .

 Schiff , at the time working as a teaching assistant in the University of Minnesota 's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs on his way to earning a master 's degree in urban planning , took a leave of absence to run for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council against Michael Guest and Kathy Thurber in 2001 . He won unanimous DFL endorsement on September 11 , 2001 and , in a race that was overshadowed by the 2001 terrorist attacks , he ran against Lucky Rosenbloom , an African @-@ American Republican . Schiff received the endorsement of the Star Tribune , which noted his " first @-@ hand knowledge " of light rail systems in other U.S. cities . Elected by a large majority in November 2001 , Schiff became one of seven newly elected members on the 13 @-@ member city council , joining two Green Party members , two other openly gay council members , one African @-@ American council member , and four women . He was sworn into office on December 17 , 2001 , earlier than his fellow councilmembers , when Thurber resigned from her seat to assume the position of deputy director of Perpich Center for Arts Education .

 In his first term , Schiff sponsored and cosponsored numerous legal reforms to the Minneapolis Zoning Code that reduced bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses and housing developers , including a measure that permitted sidewalk cafes to use permanent outdoor furniture and a change in city zoning code that facilitated the construction of denser and more affordable housing . He also sponsored an ordinance to add domestic partnerships to the Zoning Code 's definition of " family " in terms of housing . 
 In 2003 , with colleagues Barbara Johnson and Sandy Colvin Roy , Schiff developed a last @-@ minute plan to restore $ 2 million in proposed cuts to the Minneapolis Fire and Police Departments , following a $ 26 million cut from Local Government Aid by former Governor Tim Pawlenty . That same year , he sponsored an ordinance that effectively blocked police officers , city inspectors , and other city employees from inquiring about a resident 's immigration status . The ordinance forbids police officers from arresting a suspect solely on the grounds of a suspected immigration status violation .

 In July 2004 , the Minneapolis City Council passed a ban on indoor smoking in bars , restaurants , pool halls , and bowling alleys by a 12 @-@ 1 margin . In March 2005 , the ban took effect alongside other indoor smoking bans passed by other cities in the Minneapolis @-@ St. Paul metropolitan area . Subsequently , during the 2005 Minneapolis City Council elections , a write @-@ in candidate named Dave <unk> received 10 percent of the ninth ward vote under a " Smoke Out Gary " campaign slogan — a reference to Schiff 's role as a co @-@ author of the smoking ban . 59 percent of voters re @-@ elected Schiff to a second term ; his main opponent , Green Party candidate David <unk> , won 30 percent of the vote . 
 In 2006 , Schiff sponsored eliminating a cap on taxi licenses in Minneapolis . The move angered some local taxi drivers , who noted that an attending increase in licenses would lead to greater competition in the local taxicab business . The City Council passed the cap lift , and the number of Minneapolis taxis doubled between 2010 and 2012 . 
 Beginning in 2008 , Schiff and other city leaders contended with local ramifications of the 2008 @-@ 2012 global recession , which included spate of foreclosures in economically distressed neighborhoods . In April 2008 , the city council approved a pilot mortgage assistance program called Minneapolis Advantage . The program , which passed the council 10 @-@ 2 , offered forgivable loans to <unk> who were interested in properties on the same block as foreclosed or city @-@ owned properties within targeted neighborhoods . Schiff argued that the initiative was not targeted enough to have the designed effect and voted against it , along with fellow councilmember Paul Ostrow . 
 The city also strictly regulated non @-@ motorized pedicabs ; it first permitted the bicycle @-@ powered taxis in 1984 , but there were no active pedicab licenses in the city by 2008 . Schiff proposed eliminating some restrictions , and the city council passed ordinances allowing pedicabs to operate on downtown streets , downtown bridges , and on the Nicollet Mall , at any time except the morning and evening rush hours . In October 2011 , when the city permitted pedicabs to operate during rush hours ( with new safety regulations ) , eight licensed pedicab companies operated forty cabs in the downtown area .

 In February 2012 , a reporter for the Minnesota Daily wrote that Schiff is " possibly the most active and popular City Council member " and noted that 60 percent of Ward 9 voters reelected him to a third term in 2009 . 
 An avid supporter of microbrewing in Minneapolis , Schiff sponsored the " Brew Beer Here " ordinance that allowed the sale of 64 @-@ ounce " growlers " of beer on Minneapolis brewery premises . Passed in August 2010 , the ordinance facilitated brewery operation within Minneapolis city limits and led to the opening of Harriet Brewing Company , the first Minneapolis brewery to open in decades . With colleague Elizabeth <unk> , Schiff co @-@ sponsored the " Surly Bill , " an ordinance that permits breweries to sell pints of their products on @-@ site . Schiff also proposed eliminating zoning constraints against establishments serving alcohol within 300 feet of a house of worship outside of the downtown area . The ordinance change was inspired by a struggle between Rob Miller , a brewer interested in opening a " pico brewery " called Dangerous Man Brewing in Northeast Minneapolis , and the church of Saints Cyril and Methodius Church , located across the street from the brewery 's proposed location . Citing his work to ease ordinances prohibitive to the microbrewing industry , Twin Cities Business named Schiff the most business @-@ friendly city councilor in Minneapolis in 2012 . 
 In 1997 , before he became a member of the city council , Schiff co @-@ authored an amendment to the City of Minneapolis Charter that mandated a voter referendum on city stadium subsidies that cost taxpayers over $ 10 million . As of 2009 , the Minnesota Vikings were moving forward on a $ 870 million plan to rebuild a downtown stadium on the site of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome . The team also considered building a new stadium in other cities , including Anoka , Minnesota and Los Angeles , California . Though supportive of the Vikings remaining in Minneapolis in 2012 , Schiff became an outspoken critic of the financing plan for the stadium when it came to a vote before the Minneapolis City Council , in part because it bypassed the charter amendment . Schiff also argued that the plan 's estimated cost to Minneapolis taxpayers , cited at $ 150 million in construction costs , failed to account for interest , maintenance costs , and upgrades over the course of the stadium 's expected 30 @-@ year lifespan . In a Star Tribune editorial , Schiff quoted figures presented by the city 's chief financial officer , Kevin Carpenter , which estimated a cumulative , 30 @-@ year cost that could range from $ 675 million to $ 890 million . Despite Schiff 's objections , the Minneapolis City Council approved the stadium financing 7 @-@ 6 . Subsequently , the football team moved forward with plans to demolish the Metrodome and rebuild a new stadium on the site , and Governor Mark Dayton signed a financing plan approved by the legislature .

 Schiff had been considering running for mayor of Minneapolis in the 2013 Minneapolis mayoral election as early as June 2012 , and stated that his ultimate decision would not be contingent upon whether Mayor R.T. Rybak opted to run for another term . Speaking from the Harriet Brewing tap room on January 29 , 2013 , Schiff announced his official candidacy for the position . On the same day , he also held an event in the Dinkytown area near the University of Minnesota with rapper Brother Ali to kick off his campaign . Schiff was the second City Councilmember to announce his candidacy after Betsy Hodges of Ward 13 , and Don Samuels of Ward 5 announced his candidacy later . 
 The University of Minnesota 's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs hosted the first mayoral debate on March 27 , with Schiff among the five declared candidates who were seeking the DFL nomination . A week later , on April 4 , Schiff took part in the city 's second mayoral debate , this time located at a <unk> @-@ neighborhood church . During the proceedings , he pledged that he would abide by the DFL 's endorsement , making him the sole candidate to vow so among the five candidates seeking the endorsement at the time . Schiff also participated in the city 's first mayoral debate dealing specifically with issues concerning Minneapolis 's Somali population , an event that took place on May 31 and was hosted at a Somali restaurant on Lake Street . Schiff received endorsements from the Minneapolis Firefighters Union , state representative Karen Clark , and former Vikings punter Chris <unk> , among others . 
 At the DFL endorsement convention , Schiff came in third place behind Mark Andrew and Hodges during the first two rounds of voting but was denied a place on the third round ballot after failing to meet a minimum vote threshold during round two . When Schiff backed Hodges with the intention , according to the Star Tribune , of preventing Andrew from receiving the 60 % of votes needed to win the endorsement , he lost the support of the Minneapolis Firefighters Union . The convention concluded with no winner and , because no one was endorsed , Schiff stated that he would remain in the race . His campaign manager , Mark Warren , left Schiff 's campaign shortly after the convention and a few days later , he declared an end to his bid for mayor and announced that he would campaign actively for Hodges .

 Schiff did not run for reelection in the City Council elections in 2013 . Activist and communications specialist Alondra Cano won his seat with over 47 percent of the vote and was sworn into office on January 6 , 2014 . On July 1 , 2014 , Schiff took over as president of the Council on Crime and Justice , an organization with the goal of guaranteeing " equal justice and improved public safety at the same time " .
