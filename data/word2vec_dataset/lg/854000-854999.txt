 = Down on the Upside = 
 Down on the Upside is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Soundgarden , released on May 21 , 1996 through A & M Records . It is the band 's third album with bassist Ben Shepherd . Following a worldwide tour in support of its previous album , Superunknown ( 1994 ) , Soundgarden commenced work on a new album . The music on the album was notably less heavy than the group 's preceding albums and featured the band experimenting with other sounds . 
 The album topped the New Zealand and Australian charts and debuted at number two on the United States ' Billboard 200 , selling 200 @,@ 000 copies in its opening week and spawning the singles " Pretty Noose " , " Burden in My Hand " , " Blow Up the Outside World " , and " Ty Cobb " . The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza tour and afterward supported the album with a worldwide tour . Down on the Upside would end up becoming Soundgarden 's final studio album for sixteen years as tensions within the band led to its break @-@ up in April 1997 . 
 The album 's title comes from lyrics in the fourth track " Dusty . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 The album 's recording sessions took place from November 1995 to February 1996 at Studio Litho and Bad Animals Studio in Seattle , Washington . Studio Litho is owned by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard . The band members made the decision to produce the album themselves . On the choice of not working with a producer , frontman Chris Cornell said that " a fifth guy is too many cooks and <unk> everything . It has to go down too many mental roads , which dilutes it . " Adam Kasper , who previously had worked with Soundgarden as an assistant engineer on Superunknown , worked with the band as a production collaborator . The album was mixed by Kasper . 
 Work on the album began in July 1995 . The band took a break to perform at festivals in Europe , where new material was road @-@ tested . Afterward , the band did more songwriting for about a month and then recorded most of the album at Studio Litho . The overall approach to songwriting was less collaborative than with past efforts , with the individual band members having brought in most of the songs more completely written . The band sought to try things it had not done before and to use a greater variety of material . The band tried to create a live atmosphere for the album , and looked to leave in sounds that producers would normally try to clean up , such as feedback and out @-@ of @-@ tune guitar parts . The overall time spent working on the album was less than what the band had spent working on Superunknown . Cornell described the album @-@ making process as " way faster and way easier " . 
 Most of the material was written by Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd , the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks . Reportedly , tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions , with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell 's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band 's trademark . Thayil 's only contribution to the album was the song " Never the Machine Forever " , for which he wrote both the lyrics and the music , and which was also the last song the band recorded . The song initially came out of a jam session Thayil had with Seattle musician Greg Gilmore . In the liner notes , Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song . He stated that he had a lot of incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged , so they did not make the album . Thayil said , " It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn 't satisfactory creative input , but on the other hand , I write all the solo bits and don 't really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar . " Cornell said , " By the time we were finished , it felt like it had been kind of hard , like it was a long , hard haul . But there was stuff we were discovering . " 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The album 's songs placed emphasis on vocals and melody over the heavy guitar riffs that were found on the band 's earlier LPs . It also features a rawer sound than Soundgarden 's previous album Superunknown , as the band members produced the record themselves . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that Soundgarden " retained their ambitious song structures , neo @-@ psychedelic guitar textures , and winding melodies but haven 't dressed them up with detailed production . " The songs vary in tempo throughout the course of the album , with Thayil describing the album as having a " dual nature . " He explained , " It keeps listeners on their toes and lets them know they 're not getting the same album over and over . " Shepherd called the album " the most accurate picture of what Soundgarden actually sounds like , " stating , " It 's way more raw . It 's way more honest . It 's way more ' responsible . ' " 
 The band explained at the time that it wanted to experiment with other sounds ( for example , the song " Ty Cobb " features Shepherd and Cornell playing mandolin and mandola ) . This experimentation can be heard to a lesser degree on Superunknown . Soundgarden used alternative tunings and odd time signatures on several of the album 's songs . For example , " Never the Machine Forever " uses a time signature of 9 / 8 . " Pretty Noose " and " Burden in My Hand " were written in C @-@ G @-@ C @-@ G @-@ G @-@ E tuning . 
 The overall mood of the album 's lyrics is not as dark as on previous Soundgarden albums . According to Cornell , " Pretty Noose " is about " an attractively packaged bad idea , " and " Ty Cobb " is about a " hardcore pissed @-@ off idiot . " Cornell said that the songs " Never Named " and " Boot Camp " are based on his childhood . Thayil said that the lyrics for " Never the Machine Forever " are about " a life @-@ and @-@ death match between an individual and a less specifically defined entity . " Cornell referred to " <unk> " as " self @-@ affirming . "

 The album 's cover art , photographed by Kevin Westenberg , features the members of the band in silhouette . At one point the cover art image for the " Blow Up the Outside World " single was considered for use as the cover art image for Down on the Upside . The album was also released in a limited edition with the Into the Upside interview disc . 
 The title Down on the Upside comes from a line in the song " Dusty " . The lyric is " I think it 's turning back on me / I 'm down on the upside . " Cornell said that the title represents the different feels on the album . In an interview Cornell explained how the name was chosen : 
 " I brought it up at some point because the song that the title came from was " Dusty , " but my title for it was " Down on the Upside , " but Ben wrote the music and he called it " Dusty . " So since we don 't really like having song titles being the title of the record , ' cause it brings this weird , undue focus to the song , I thought it would be cool to call it Down on the Upside . We started thinking about all these other titles , and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding anything ... So it was the last minute and we were at a photo shoot for Spin and someone called and said , ' We need your title now so we can start doing the record package , ' so Matt [ Cameron ] brought up the title again , and everyone went , ' yeah , that 's it . ' " 
 According to an interview with the band , Cameron and Shepherd jokingly said that two other titles considered for the album were Mr. <unk> Pants and Comin ' At Ya !

 Down on the Upside reached number two on the Billboard 200 album chart . It was held off the top spot by the Fugees album , The Score . The record has gone on to sell 1 @.@ 6 million copies in the United States , and has been certified Platinum by the RIAA . 
 Spin gave the album an eight out of ten . The review said that the album is " as sprawling and generous @-@ spirited as Superunknown , but ... is a looser and live @-@ er @-@ sounding affair , not seeking the same level of aural precision . " Alternative Press gave the album a three out of five . The review said that Soundgarden are " now fully capable of penning some damned spiffy pop songs , " and added that " they sound more human here , like they 're playing in your living room . " Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave Down on the Upside three out of five stars , observing that the album has " some quality frenzy , " but criticizing it for " lack [ ing ] defining episodes of catharsis . " Fricke said , " Soundgarden seem to be digging in their heels rather than kicking up dirt , relying too much on drone @-@ y impressionism and clever ( as opposed to cleaving ) guitar motifs . " Neil Strauss of The New York Times called the album the " rawer , looser follow @-@ up to Superunknown . " He added , " Generally , identifying with animals in song lyrics is a sign of low self @-@ esteem , and Soundgarden is no exception . For all the virility and macho power that rock singers have tried to wring from the [ snake ] , Soundgarden remains more interested in the fact that it is the only animal cursed to spend its days slithering on the ground . " 
 David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B + . Browne said , " Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric . " He praised several songs as being " as powerful as anything the band has done . " Browne criticized the album 's production , saying " like many self @-@ produced efforts , it shows . " He added , " With arrangements that crest and fall to the point where a road map would have helped , the overlong ( 16 @-@ song ) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming . " Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars , saying that " it might seem like nothing more than heavy metal , but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven 't tempered their ambitions at all . " The reviewer for Melody Maker said that " their roots don 't matter now . All I care for now is the immediacy of their pop moments . " Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star ( ) , describing it as " brutal depression simplified " and highlighted by the songs " Ty Cobb " and " <unk> " , while Jason Josephes from Pitchfork Media called it a " double shot of grunge , no foam but plenty of caffeine . " 
 Down on the Upside included the singles " Pretty Noose " , " Burden in My Hand " , and " Blow Up the Outside World " , all of which had accompanying music videos . All three singles placed on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts . The album 's other commercially released single , " Ty Cobb " , did not chart , however its <unk> B @-@ side , " <unk> " , also from the album , did chart . " Burden in My Hand " was the most successful song from Down on the Upside on the rock charts , spending a total of five weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock charts and reaching number two on the Modern Rock charts . At the 1997 Grammy Awards , " Pretty Noose " received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance .

 The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza tour with Metallica . Metallica had insisted on Soundgarden 's appearance on the tour . Thayil said that the band wasn 't interested in doing the tour until it became a " Metallica tour . " During the Lollapalooza tour , the band members reportedly took separate flights and then met at the gigs . 
 After Lollapalooza , the band embarked on a worldwide tour . Tensions continued to increase and when asked if the band hated touring , Cornell said , " We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious , because it becomes repetitious . You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them . That 's the point where we hate touring . " The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing . Cornell said that " after a number of years , you start to feel like you 're acting . All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up , and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while . " Thayil had an issue with how the band 's audience had changed , stating that " nowadays , you also have the kids and the housewives , the casual fans . With your casual fans , you say , ' Thanks for the money . ' And they say , ' Thanks for the song . ' " The band 's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell 's throat problems . 
 At the tour 's final stop in Honolulu , Hawaii on February 9 , 1997 , Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure , and subsequently stormed off the stage . The band retreated , with Cornell returning to conclude the show with a solo encore . On April 9 , 1997 , the band announced its disbanding . Thayil said , " It was pretty obvious from everybody 's general attitude over the course of the previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction . " Cameron later said that Soundgarden was " eaten up by the business . "

 Various versions of the " Burden in My Hand " single featured two B @-@ sides from the Down on the Upside recording sessions that were not included on the album , " Karaoke " and " Bleed Together " . " Bleed Together " was included on the band 's 1997 greatest hits compilation , A @-@ Sides , and was released as a promo CD single in 1997 . Thayil said that the song was not included on Down on the Upside because the band was not pleased with the mixing that was done on the song and the band already had enough songs . Another song that was written and recorded for the album is " Kristi " . Cameron said it is one of his favorite Soundgarden songs . " Kristi " was finally mixed in 2014 and included on Echo of Miles : Scattered Tracks Across the Path , along with both " Karaoke " and " Bleed Together " .

 Malawi ( / <unk> / , / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; Chichewa : [ <unk> ] or [ <unk> ] ) , officially the Republic of Malawi , is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland . It is bordered by Zambia to the northwest , Tanzania to the northeast , and Mozambique on the east , south and west . The country is separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by Lake Malawi . Malawi is over 118 @,@ 000 km2 ( 45 @,@ 560 sq mi ) with an estimated population of 16 @,@ 777 @,@ 547 ( July 2013 est . ) . Its capital is Lilongwe , which is also Malawi 's largest city ; the second largest is Blantyre and the third is Mzuzu . The name Malawi comes from the Maravi , an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area . The country is also nicknamed " The Warm Heart of Africa " . 
 Malawi is among the smallest countries in Africa . Lake Malawi takes about a third of Malawi 's area . 
 The area of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by migrating Bantu groups around the 10th century . Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonized by the British . In 1953 Malawi , then known as Nyasaland , a protectorate of the United Kingdom , became a protectorate within the semi @-@ independent Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland . The Federation was dissolved in 1963 . In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under Queen Elizabeth II with the new name Malawi . Two years later it became a republic . Upon gaining independence it became a one @-@ party state under the presidency of Hastings Banda , who remained president until 1994 , when he lost an election . Peter Mutharika is the current president . Malawi has a democratic , multi @-@ party government . Malawi has a small military force that includes an army , a navy and an air wing . Malawi 's foreign policy is pro @-@ Western and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several international organisations , including the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations and the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) . 
 Malawi is among the world 's least @-@ developed countries . The economy is heavily based in agriculture , with a largely rural population . The Malawian government depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs , although this need ( and the aid offered ) has decreased since 2000 . The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy , improving education , health care , environmental protection , and becoming financially independent . Since 2005 , Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues , and the country 's outlook appears to be improving , with a rise in the economy , education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008 . 
 Malawi has a low life expectancy and high infant mortality . There is a high prevalence of HIV / AIDS , which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures . There is a diverse population of native peoples , Asians and Europeans , with several languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs . Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past , by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had re @-@ emerged . 
 = = History = = 
 The area of Africa now known as Malawi had a very small population of hunter @-@ gatherers before waves of Bantu @-@ speaking peoples began emigrating from the north around the 10th century . Although most of the Bantu peoples continued south , some remained permanently and founded ethnic groups based on common ancestry . By 1500 AD , the tribes had established the Kingdom of Maravi that reached from north of what is now <unk> to the Zambezi River and from Lake Malawi to the Luangwa River in what is now Zambia . 
 Soon after 1600 , with the area mostly united under one native ruler , native tribesmen began encountering , trading with and making alliances with Portuguese traders and members of the military . By 1700 , however , the empire had broken up into areas controlled by many individual ethnic groups , which was noted by the Portuguese in their information gathering . The Swahili @-@ Arab slave trade reached its height in the mid- 1800s , when approximately 20 @,@ 000 people were enslaved and considered to be carried yearly from <unk> to Kilwa where they were sold . 
 Missionary and explorer David Livingstone reached Lake Malawi ( then Lake Nyasa ) in 1859 and identified the Shire Highlands south of the lake as an area suitable for European settlement . As the result of Livingstone 's visit , several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established in the area in the 1860s and 1870s , the African Lakes Company Limited was established in 1878 to set up a trade and transport concern working closely with the missions , and a small mission and trading settlement was established at Blantyre in 1876 and a British Consul took up residence there in 1883 . The Portuguese government was also interested in the area so , to prevent Portuguese occupation , the British government sent Harry Johnston as British consul with instructions to make treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction . 
 In 1889 , a British protectorate was proclaimed over the Shire Highlands , which was extended in 1891 to include the whole of present @-@ day Malawi as the British Central Africa Protectorate . In 1907 , the protectorate was renamed Nyasaland , a name it retained for the remainder of its time under British rule . In a prime example of what is sometimes called the " Thin White Line " of colonial authority in Africa , the colonial government of Nyasaland was formed in 1891 . The administrators were given a budget of £ 10 @,@ 000 ( 1891 nominal value ) per year , which was enough to employ ten European civilians , two military officers , seventy Punjab Sikhs , and eighty @-@ five Zanzibar porters . These few employees were then expected to administer and police a territory of around 94 @,@ 000 square kilometres with between one and two million people . 
 In 1944 , the Nyasaland African Congress ( NAC ) was formed by the Africans of Nyasaland to promote local interests to the British government . In 1953 , Britain linked Nyasaland with Northern and Southern Rhodesia in what was the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland , often called the Central African Federation ( CAF ) , for mainly political reasons . Even though the Federation was semi @-@ independent , the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists , and the NAC gained popular support . An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. Hastings Banda , a European @-@ trained doctor working in Ghana who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause . Banda was elected president of the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959 . He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for Nyasaland , with a clause granting Africans the majority in the colony 's Legislative Council . 
 In 1961 , Banda 's Malawi Congress Party ( MCP ) gained a majority in the Legislative Council elections and Banda became Prime Minister in 1963 . The Federation was dissolved in 1963 , and on 6 July 1964 , Nyasaland became independent from British rule and renamed itself Malawi . Under a new constitution , Malawi became a republic with Banda as its first president . The new document also formally made Malawi a one @-@ party state with the MCP as the only legal party . In 1971 , Banda was declared president @-@ for @-@ life . For almost 30 years , Banda presided over a rigidly authoritarian regime , which ensured that Malawi did not suffer armed conflict . However , oppositional parties like the Malawi Freedom Movement of Orton <unk> or the Socialist League of Malawi existed but were founded in exile . 
 Despite his political severity , however , Malawi 's economy while Banda was president was often cited as an example of how a poor , landlocked , heavily populated , mineral @-@ poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development . While in office , and using his control of the country , Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one @-@ third of the country 's GDP and employed 10 % of the wage @-@ earning workforce . All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolized by the building of a top boarding school called <unk> Academy ( Eton of Africa ) . In Banda 's own words " I do not want my boys and girls to do what I had to do — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education " , was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi . 
 Under pressure for increased political freedom , Banda agreed to a referendum in 1993 , where the populace voted for a multi @-@ party democracy . In late 1993 a presidential council was formed , the life presidency was abolished and a new constitution was put into place , effectively ending the MCP 's rule . In 1994 the first multi @-@ party elections were held in Malawi , and Banda was defeated by Bakili Muluzi ( a former Secretary General of the MCP and former Banda Cabinet Minister ) . Re @-@ elected in 1999 , Muluzi remained president until 2004 , when Dr. Bingu wa Mutharika was elected . Although the political environment is described as " challenging " , as of 2009 , the multi @-@ party system still exists in Malawi . <unk> parliamentary and presidential elections were held for the fourth time in Malawi in May 2009 , and President Mutharika was successfully re @-@ elected , despite charges of election fraud from his rival . 
 President Mutharika was seen by some as increasingly autocratic and dismissive of human rights , and in July 2011 protests over high costs of living , devolving foreign relations , poor governance and a lack of foreign exchange reserves erupted . The protests left 18 people dead and at least 44 others suffering from gunshot wounds . In April 2012 , Mutharika died of a heart attack ; the presidential title was taken over by former Vice @-@ President Joyce Banda . 
 In 2014 Joyce Banda lost elections ( coming third ) and was replaced by Peter Mutharika , the brother of the third elected president of Malawi . 
 = = Government and politics = = 
 Malawi is a democratic , multi @-@ party government , currently under the leadership of Peter Mutharika , who defeated former president Joyce Banda in the 2014 elections , despite alleged poll rigging . The current constitution was put into place on 18 May 1995 . The branches of the government consist of executive , legislative and judicial . The executive includes a president who is both chief of state and head of government , first and second vice presidents and a cabinet . The president is elected every five years , and the vice president is chosen by the president . A second vice president may be appointed by the president if so chosen , although they must be from a different party . The members of the cabinet are appointed by the president and can be from either inside or outside of the legislature . 
 The legislative branch consists of a unicameral National Assembly of 193 members who are elected every five years , and although the Malawian constitution provides for a Senate of 80 seats , one does not exist in practice . If created , the Senate would provide representation for traditional leaders and a variety of geographic districts , as well as special interest groups including the disabled , youth and women . There are currently nine political parties , with the Democratic Progressive Party acting as the ruling party and the Malawi Congress Party and the United Democratic Front acting as the main opposition parties in the National Assembly . Suffrage is universal at 18 years of age , and the central government budget for 2009 / 2010 is $ 1 @.@ 7 billion . 
 The independent judicial branch is based upon the English model and consists of a Supreme Court of Appeal , a High Court divided into three sections ( general , constitutional and commercial ) , an Industrial Relations Court and Magistrates Courts , the last of which is divided into five grades and includes Child Justice Courts . The judicial system has been changed several times since Malawi gained independence in 1964 . Conventional courts and traditional courts have been used in varying combinations , with varying degrees of success and corruption . 
 Malawi is composed of three regions ( the Northern , Central and Southern regions ) , which are divided into 28 districts , and further into approximately 250 traditional authorities and 110 administrative wards . Local government is administered by central government @-@ appointed regional administrators and district commissioners . For the first time in the multi @-@ party era , local elections took place on 21 November 2000 , with the UDF party winning 70 % of the available seats . There was scheduled to be a second round of constitutionally mandated local elections in May 2005 , but these were cancelled by the government . 
 In February 2005 , President Mutharika split with the United Democratic Front and began his own party , the Democratic Progressive Party , which has attracted reform @-@ minded officials from other parties and won elections across the country in 2006 . In 2008 , President Mutharika had implemented reforms to address the country 's major corruption problem , with at least five senior UDF party members facing criminal charges . In 2012 , Malawi was ranked 7th of all countries in sub @-@ Saharan Africa in the Ibrahim Index of African Governance , an index that measures several variables to provide a comprehensive view of the governance of African countries . Although the country 's governance score was higher than the continental average , it was lower than the regional average for southern Africa . Its highest scores were for safety and rule of law , and its lowest scores were for sustainable economic opportunity , with a ranking of 47th on the continent for educational opportunities . Malawi 's governance score had improved between 2000 and 2011 . Malawi held its most recent elections in May 2014 , with challenger Peter <unk> defeating incumbent President Joyce Banda .

 = = = Foreign relations = = = 
 Former President Hastings Banda established a pro @-@ Western foreign policy that continued into early 2011 . It included good diplomatic relationships with many Western countries . The transition from a one @-@ party state to a multi @-@ party democracy strengthened Malawian ties with the United States . Significant numbers of students from Malawi travel to the US for schooling , and the US has active branches of the Peace Corps , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for International Development in Malawi . Malawi maintained close relations with South Africa throughout the Apartheid era , which strained Malawi 's relationships with other African countries . Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994 , diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries . In 2010 , however , Malawi 's relationship with Mozambique became strained , partially due to disputes over the use of the Zambezi River and an inter @-@ country electrical grid . In 2007 , Malawi established diplomatic ties with China , and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then , despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies . In 2011 , relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom was damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika . Mutharika expelled the ambassador from Malawi , and in July 2011 , the UK announced that it was suspending all budgetary aid because of Mutharika 's lack of response to criticisms of his government and economic mismanagement . On 26 July 2011 , the United States followed suit , freezing a US $ 350 million grant , citing concerns regarding the government 's suppression and intimidation of demonstrators and civic groups , as well as restriction of the press and police violence . 
 Malawi has been seen as a haven for refugees from other African countries , including Mozambique and Rwanda , since 1985 . These influxes of refugees have placed a strain on the Malawian economy but have also drawn significant inflows of aid from other countries . Donors to Malawi include the United States , Canada , Germany , Iceland , Japan , the Netherlands , Norway , Sweden , Ireland , the UK and Flanders ( Belgium ) , as well as international institutions such as the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the European Union , the African Development Bank and UN organisations . 
 Malawi is a member of several international organisations including the Commonwealth , the UN and some of its child agencies , the IMF , the World Bank , the African Union and the World Health Organization . Malawi tends to view economic and political stability in southern Africa as a necessity , and advocates peaceful solutions through negotiation . The country was the first in southern Africa to receive peacekeeping training under the African Crisis Response Initiative . 
 = = = Human rights = = = 
 As of 2010 , international observers noted issues in several human rights areas . Excessive force was seen to be used by police forces , security forces were able to act with impunity , mob violence was occasionally seen , and prison conditions continued to be harsh and sometimes life @-@ threatening . However , the government was seen to make some effort to prosecute security forces who used excessive force . Other legal issues included limits on free speech and freedom of the press , lengthy pretrial detentions , and arbitrary arrests and detentions . Societal issues found included violence against women , human trafficking , and child labour . Corruption within the government is seen as a major issue , despite the Malawi Anti @-@ Corruption Bureau 's ( ACB ) attempts to reduce it . The ACB appears to be successful at finding and prosecuting low level corruption , but higher level officials appear to be able to act with impunity . Corruption within security forces is also an issue . Malawi had one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world . In 2015 Malawi raised the legal age for marriage from 15 to 18 . Other issues that have been raised are lack of adequate legal protection of women from sexual abuse and harassment , very high maternal mortality rate , and abuse related to accusations of witchcraft . 
 As of 2010 , homosexuality has been illegal in Malawi , and in one recent case , a couple perceived as homosexual faced extensive jail time when convicted . The convicted pair , sentenced to the maximum of 14 years of hard labour each , were pardoned two weeks later following the intervention of United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon . In May 2012 , President Joyce Banda pledged to repeal laws criminalising homosexuality . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Malawi is a landlocked country in southeastern Africa , bordered by Zambia to the northwest , Tanzania to the northeast and Mozambique to the south , southwest and southeast . It lies between latitudes 9 ° and 18 ° S , and longitudes 32 ° and 36 ° E. 
 The Great Rift Valley runs through the country from north to south , and to the east of the valley lies Lake Malawi ( also called Lake Nyasa ) , making up over three @-@ quarters of Malawi 's eastern boundary . Lake Malawi is sometimes called the Calendar Lake as it is about 365 miles ( 587 km ) long and 52 miles ( 84 km ) wide . The Shire River flows from the south end of the lake and joins the Zambezi River 250 miles ( 400 km ) farther south in Mozambique . The surface of Lake Malawi is located at 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 457 m ) above sea level , with a maximum depth of 2 @,@ 300 feet ( 701 m ) , which means the lake bottom is over 700 feet ( 213 m ) below sea level at some points . 
 In the mountainous sections of Malawi surrounding the Rift Valley , plateaus rise generally 3 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 914 to 1 @,@ 219 m ) above sea level , although some rise as high as 8 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 438 m ) in the north . To the south of Lake Malawi lie the Shire Highlands , gently rolling land at approximately 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 914 m ) above sea level . In this area , the Zomba and <unk> mountain peaks rise to respective heights of 7 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 134 and 3 @,@ 048 m ) . 
 Malawi 's capital is Lilongwe , and its commercial centre is Blantyre with a population of over 500 @,@ 000 people . Malawi has two sites listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List . Lake Malawi National Park was first listed in 1984 and the <unk> Rock Art Area was listed in 2006 . 
 Malawi 's climate is hot in the low @-@ lying areas in the south of the country and temperate in the northern highlands . The altitude moderates what would otherwise be an equatorial climate . Between November and April the temperature is warm with equatorial rains and thunderstorms , with the storms reaching their peak severity in late March . After March , the rainfall rapidly diminishes and from May to September wet mists float from the highlands into the plateaus , with almost no rainfall during these months . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Malawi is among the world 's least @-@ developed countries . Around 85 % of the population live in rural areas . The economy is based on agriculture , and more than one @-@ third of GDP and 90 % of export revenues come from this . In the past , the economy has been dependent on substantial economic aid from the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and other countries . Malawi was ranked the 119th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings . 
 In December 2000 , the IMF stopped aid disbursements due to corruption concerns , and many individual donors followed suit , resulting in an almost 80 % drop in Malawi 's development budget . However , in 2005 , Malawi was the recipient of over US $ 575 million in aid . The Malawian government faces challenges in developing a market economy , improving environmental protection , dealing with the rapidly growing HIV / AIDS problem , improving the education system , and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent . Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 under the leadership of President Mutharika and Financial Minister <unk> . This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems , but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase . The overall cost to the economy ( and healthcare system ) is unknown . 
 In addition , some setbacks have been experienced , and Malawi has lost some of its ability to pay for imports due to a general shortage of foreign exchange , as investment fell 23 % in 2009 . There are many investment barriers in Malawi , which the government has failed to address , including high service costs and poor infrastructure for power , water , and telecommunications . As of 2009 , it was estimated that Malawi had a GDP ( purchasing power parity ) of $ 12 @.@ 81 billion , with a per capita GDP of $ 900 , and inflation estimated at around 8 @.@ 5 % in 2009 . 
 Agriculture accounts for 35 % of GDP , industry for 19 % and services for the remaining 46 % . Malawi has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world , although economic growth was estimated at 9 @.@ 7 % in 2008 and strong growth is predicted by the International Monetary Fund for 2009 . The poverty rate in Malawi is decreasing through the work of the government and supporting organizations , with people living under the poverty line decreasing from 54 % in 1990 to 40 % in 2006 , and the percentage of " ultra @-@ poor " decreasing from 24 % in 1990 to 15 % in 2007 . 
 Many analysts believe that economic progress for Malawi depends on its ability to control population growth . 
 In January 2015 southern Malawi was devastated by the worst floods in living memory , stranding at least 20 @,@ 000 people . These floods affected more than a million people across the country , including 336 @,@ 000 who were displaced , according to UNICEF . Over 100 people were killed and an estimated 64 @,@ 000 hectares of cropland were washed away . 
 = = = Agriculture and industry = = = 
 The main agricultural products of Malawi include tobacco , sugarcane , cotton , tea , corn , potatoes , sorghum , cattle and goats . The main industries are tobacco , tea and sugar processing , sawmill products , cement and consumer goods . The industrial production growth rate is estimated at 10 % ( 2009 ) . The country makes no significant use of natural gas . As of 2008 , Malawi does not import or export any electricity , but does import all its petroleum , with no production in country . Beginning in 2006 , the country began mixing unleaded petrol with 10 % ethanol , produced in @-@ country at two plants , to reduce dependence on imported fuel . In 2008 , Malawi began testing cars that ran solely on ethanol , and initial results are promising , and the country is continuing to increase its use of ethanol . 
 As of 2009 , Malawi exports an estimated US $ 945 million in goods per year . The country 's heavy reliance on tobacco places a heavy burden on the economy as world prices decline and the international community increases pressure to limit tobacco production . Malawi 's dependence on tobacco is growing , with the product jumping from 53 % to 70 % of export revenues between 2007 and 2008 . The country also relies heavily on tea , sugar and coffee , with these three plus tobacco making up more than 90 % of Malawi 's export revenue . Because of a rise in costs and a decline in sales prices , Malawi is encouraging farmers away from tobacco towards more profitable crops , including spices such as paprika . India hemp is another possible alternative , but arguments have been made that it will bring more crime to the country through its resemblance to varieties of cannabis used as a recreational drug and the difficulty in distinguishing between the two types . This concern is especially important because the cultivation of Malawian cannabis , known as Malawi Gold , as a drug has increased significantly . Malawi is known for growing " the best and finest " cannabis in the world for recreational drug use , according to a recent World Bank report , and cultivation and sales of the crop may contribute to corruption within the police force . 
 Other exported goods are cotton , peanuts , wood products and apparel . The main destination locations for the country 's exports are South Africa , Germany , Egypt , Zimbabwe , the United States , Russia and the Netherlands . Malawi currently imports an estimated US $ 1 @.@ 625 billion in goods per year , with the main commodities being food , petroleum products , consumer goods and transportation equipment . The main countries that Malawi imports from are South Africa , India , Zambia , Tanzania , the US and China . 
 In 2006 , in response to disastrously low agricultural harvests , Malawi began a program of fertiliser subsidies that were designed to re @-@ energize the land and boost crop production . It has been reported that this program , championed by the country 's president , is radically improving Malawi 's agriculture , and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries . 
 = = = Infrastructure = = = 
 As of 2012 , Malawi has 31 airports , 7 with paved runways and 24 with unpaved runways . As of 2008 , the country has 797 kilometres ( 495 mi ) of railways , all narrow @-@ gauge , and , as of 2003 , 15 @,@ 451 miles ( 24 @,@ 866 km ) of roadways , 6 @,@ 956 kilometres ( 4 @,@ 322 mi ) paved and 8 @,@ 495 kilometres ( 5 @,@ 279 mi ) unpaved . Malawi also has 700 kilometres ( 430 mi ) of waterways on Lake Malawi and along the Shire River . 
 As of 2011 , there were 3 @.@ 952 million cell phones and 173 @,@ 500 landline telephones in Malawi . There were 716 @,@ 400 Internet users in 2009 , and 1099 Internet hosts as of 2012 . As of 2007 there was one government @-@ run radio station and approximately a dozen more owned by private enterprise . The one TV station was government owned . In the past , Malawi 's telecommunications system has been named as some of the poorest in Africa , but conditions are improving , with 130 @,@ 000 land line telephones being connected between 2000 and 2007 . Telephones are much more accessible in urban areas , with less than a quarter of land lines being in rural areas .

 Malawi has a population of over 15 million , with a growth rate of 2 @.@ 75 % , according to 2009 estimates . The population is forecast to grow to over 45 million people by 2050 , nearly tripling the estimated 16 million in 2010 . 
 Malawi 's population is made up of the Chewa , Nyanja , <unk> , Yao , <unk> , Sena , Tonga , Ngoni , and <unk> native ethnic groups , as well as populations of Asians and Europeans . The official language is English . Major languages include Chichewa , a language spoken by over 57 % of the population , <unk> ( 12 @.@ 8 % ) , <unk> ( 10 @.@ 1 % ) , and <unk> ( 9 @.@ 5 % ) .

 = = = Religion = = = 
 Malawi is a majority Christian country , with a significant Muslim minority , although the exact figures are disputed . There is limited data with widely varying estimates on religious affiliation in the country . According to the Malawi Religion Project run by the University of Pennsylvania in 2010 , approximately 68 % of the population identify as Christians , 25 % as Muslim and 5 % as " other " . Slightly more dated CIA statistics from 1998 indicate that 82 % of the population was Christian , with 13 % Muslim . The largest Christian groups in Malawi are the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian ( <unk> ) . The <unk> is the biggest Protestant denomination in Malawi with 1 @.@ 3 million members . There are smaller Presbyterian denominations like the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Malawi and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Malawi . There are also smaller numbers of Anglicans , Baptists , Jehovah 's Witnesses ( approx . 89 @,@ 000 ) , evangelicals and Seventh @-@ day Adventists . Most of the Muslim population is Sunni , of either the <unk> or <unk> groups , with few Ahmadiyya Muslims . Other religious groups within the country include Rastafarians , Hindus , Baha 'is ( 0 @.@ 2 % ) and around 300 Jews . Atheists make up around 4 % of the population , although this number may include people who practice traditional African religions . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 Malawi has central hospitals , regional and private facilities . The public sector offers free health services and medicines , while non @-@ government organisations offers services and medicines for fees . Private doctors offer fee @-@ based services and medicines . Health insurance schemes have been established since 2000 . The country has a pharmaceutical manufacturing industry consisting of four privately owned pharmaceutical companies . Malawi 's healthcare goal is for " promoting health , preventing , reducing and curing disease , and reducing the occurrence of premature death in the population " . 
 Infant mortality rates are high , and life expectancy at birth is 50 @.@ 03 years . There is a high adult prevalence rate of HIV / AIDS , with an estimated 930 @,@ 000 adults ( or 11 @.@ 9 % of the population ) living with the disease in 2007 . There are approximately 68 @,@ 000 deaths a year from HIV / AIDS ( 2007 ) . Approximately 250 new people are infected each day , and at least 70 % of Malawi 's hospital beds are occupied by HIV / AIDS patients . The high rate of infection has resulted in an estimated 5 @.@ 8 % of the farm labor force dying of the disease . The government spends over $ 120 @,@ 000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease . In 2006 , international superstar Madonna started Raising Malawi , a foundation that helps AIDS orphans in Malawi , and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans , called I Am Because We Are . Raising Malawi also works with the Millennium Villages Project to improve education , health care , infrastructure and agriculture in Malawi . 
 There is a very high degree of risk for major infectious diseases , including bacterial and <unk> diarrhoea , hepatitis A , typhoid fever , malaria , plague , schistosomiasis , and rabies . Malawi has been making progress on decreasing child mortality and reducing the incidences of HIV / AIDS , malaria and other diseases ; however , the country has been " [ performing ] dismally " on reducing maternal mortality and promoting gender equality . Female genital mutilation ( FGM ) , while not widespread , is practiced in some local communities . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 In Malawi , primary education is not compulsory , but the Constitution requires that all people be entitled to at least five years of primary education . In 1994 , free primary education for all children was established by the government , which increased attendance rates . Dropout rates are higher for girls than boys , attributed to security problems during the long travel to school , as girls face a higher prevalence of gender @-@ based violence . However , attendance rates for all children are improving , with enrollment rates for primary schools increased from 58 % in 1992 to 75 % in 2007 , while the number of students who begin in standard one and complete standard five has increased from 64 % in 1992 to 86 % in 2006 . However attendance in secondary school falls to approximately 25 % , with attendance rates being slightly higher for males . Youth literacy has also increased , moving from 68 % in 2000 to 82 % in 2007 . This increase is primarily attributed to improved learning materials in schools , better infrastructure and feeding programs that have been implemented throughout the school system . 
 Education in Malawi comprises eight years of primary education , four years of secondary school and four years of university . 
 There are four public universities in Malawi namely ; Mzuzu , Lilongwe University of Agriculture and natural Resources , University of Malawi and Malawi University of Science and Technology . Besides these , there are also private universities like ; <unk> , Malawi Lakeview , Catholic University of Malawi , MIM etc . The entry requirements is six credits on the Malawi school Certificate of Education certificate which is equivalent to O levels . 
 In 2016 , the Malawi eHealth Research Centre in partnership with Mzuzu University and Luke International will establish Malawi 's first fully dedicated eHealth Research Centre . This new research facility will contribute to improve health and social outcomes for communities in Malawi , by enhancing the quality of research and education in eHealth and healthcare . 
 = = Military = = 
 Malawi maintains a small standing military of approximately 25 @,@ 000 men , the Malawian Defence Force . It consists of army , navy and air force elements . The Malawi army originated from British colonial units formed before independence , and is now made up of two rifle regiments and one parachute regiment . The Malawi Air Force was established with German help in 1976 , and operates a small number of transport aircraft and multi @-@ purpose helicopters . The Malawian Navy has 3 vessels operating on Lake Malawi , based in Monkey Bay . 
 = = Culture = = 
 The name " Malawi " comes from the Maravi , a Bantu people who emigrated from the southern Congo around 1400 AD . Upon reaching northern Lake Malawi , the group divided , with one group moving south down the west bank of the lake to become the group known as the Chewa , while the other group , the ancestors of today 's Nyanja , moved along the east side of the lake to the southern section of Malawi . Ethnic conflict and continuing migration prevented the formation of a society that was uniquely and cohesively Malawian until the dawn of the 20th century . Over the past century , ethnic distinctions have diminished to the point where there is no significant inter @-@ ethnic friction , although regional divisions still occur . The concept of a Malawian nationality has begun to form around a predominantly rural people who are generally conservative and traditionally nonviolent . 
 From 1964 – 2010 , and again since 2012 , the Flag of Malawi is made up of three equal horizontal stripes of black , red and green with a red rising sun superimposed in the center of the black stripe . The black stripe represented the African people , the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom , green represented Malawi 's ever @-@ green nature and the rising sun represented the dawn of freedom and hope for Africa . In 2010 , the flag was changed , removing the red rising sun and adding a full white sun in the center as a symbol of Malawi 's economic progress . The change was reverted in 2012 . 
 Its dances are a strong part of Malawi 's culture , and the National Dance Troupe ( formerly the <unk> Cultural Troupe ) was formed in November 1987 by the government . Traditional music and dances can be seen at initiation rites , rituals , marriage ceremonies and celebrations . Soccer is the most common sport in Malawi , introduced there during British colonial rule . Basketball is also growing in popularity . 
 The indigenous ethnic groups of Malawi have a rich tradition of basketry and mask carving , and some of these goods are used in traditional ceremonies still performed by native peoples . Wood carving and oil painting are also popular in more urban centres , with many of the items produced being sold to tourists . There are several internationally recognised literary figures from Malawi , including poet Jack <unk> , history and fiction writer Paul <unk> and authors <unk> <unk> , Felix <unk> , Frank <unk> and David <unk> . 
 Malawian cuisine is diverse , with tea and fish being popular features of the country 's cuisine . Sugar , coffee , corn , potatoes , sorghum , cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy . Lake Malawi is a source of fish including <unk> ( similar to bream ) <unk> ( similar to sardine ) , <unk> ( similar to salmon and <unk> ) . <unk> is a food staple made from ground corn and served with side dishes of meat and vegetable . It can be eaten for lunch and dinner .

 Springbok ( 1870 – 1897 ) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won the seventh Belmont Stakes in 1873 . <unk> in 1870 , he was sired by the imported stallion Australian , his dam was a daughter of Lexington . During his racing career he started 25 races , winning 17 of them . Besides the Belmont , Springbok won the Saratoga Cup twice , in 1874 and 1875 and was named Champion Older Male horse in 1874 and 1875 . After retiring from the racetrack , he sired five stakes winners and died in 1897 .

 Springbok was sired by the imported horse Australian and out of the mare Hester . Hester was by Lexington and out of a mare named Heads I Say by imported stallion Glencoe . Springbok was foaled in 1870 , and was a chestnut stallion , bred by A. J. Alexander of Woodburn , Kentucky . Springbok was one of 26 stakes winning foals sired by Australian . Springbok was Hester 's only stakes winning foal . 
 At two years of age , Springbok was owned and raced by Daniel Swigert , but was sold that year to David McDaniel for $ 2 @,@ 000 ( approximately $ 40 @,@ 000 today ) .

 Springbok won the seventh running of the Belmont Stakes in 1873 at Jerome Park Racetrack . He carried 110 pounds ( 50 kilograms ) in the race , which had a winning time of 3 minutes 11 ⁄ 4 seconds . He won $ 5 @,@ 200 ( approximately $ 103 @,@ 000 today ) for his owner from the race . The race was run on June 7 over a distance of 1 5 ⁄ 8 miles ( i.e. 13 furlongs ( 2 @,@ 600 meters ) ) on a fast track . He won the race by four lengths from the second placed finisher , Count D 'Orsay , and the third place was <unk> . The winning jockey was James Rowe , Sr. , later to be a noted trainer . This was the third of three consecutive wins of the Belmont Stakes by David McDaniel as both owner and trainer , as he had already won the 1871 race with Harry Bassett and the 1872 race with Joe Daniels . 
 Besides the Belmont , Springbok won the 1874 and 1875 Saratoga Cup and the 1874 Citizens Stakes . During the 1870s , the Saratoga Cup was a 2 1 ⁄ 4 miles ( 3 @,@ 600 m ) race . In 1874 , Springbok won the race while carrying 108 pounds ( 49 kg ) , beating Preakness who came in second , and Katie Pease , who placed third . The winning time was 4 minutes 113 ⁄ 4 seconds , with a value to the winner of $ 2 @,@ 450 ( approximately $ 51 @,@ 000 today ) . His 1875 Saratoga Cup win was a dead heat with the horse Preakness . In that race , Springbok carried 114 pounds ( 52 kg ) , and the winning time was 3 minutes 561 ⁄ 4 seconds . Third place was secured by Grinstead . The win paid $ 2 @,@ 250 ( approximately $ 48 @,@ 000 today ) to Springbok 's owner . 
 Springbok 's total race career was 25 starts with 17 wins for a total earnings of $ 20 @,@ 020 ( approximately $ 431 @,@ 000 today ) . He is considered to be the 1874 American Champion Older Male Horse , and also the Champion Older Male Horse for 1875 , a title he shared with Preakness .

 = House of Mindaugas = 
 The House of Mindaugas was the first royal family of Grand Duchy of Lithuania , centered on Mindaugas , the first known and undoubted sovereign of Lithuania . He was crowned as King of Lithuania in 1253 and assassinated ten years later . His known family relations end with children ; there is no data on his great @-@ grandchildren or any relations with the Gediminids , a dynasty of sovereigns of Lithuania and Poland that started with Butigeidis ca . 1285 and ended with Sigismund II Augustus in 1572 . 
 Historians have to make considerable assumptions trying to reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about the early history of Lithuania . The matter is further complicated by the 16 – 17th century genealogies , most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle , that mixed legends and facts into one . The legends about <unk> , a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy , are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies . The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles , most important of these being the Hypatian Codex . 
 = = Family tree = = 
 Mindaugas and his brother Dausprungas are first mentioned among the 5 elder dukes in a 1219 treaty with Galicia – Volhynia . Since at that time both brothers had to be relatively young , it implies that they inherited their high status . However , no written sources of the period talk about their father , except the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle , which mentions in passing that he was a powerful Grand Duke ( ein <unk> <unk> ) . Chronicles written in the 16 – 17th centuries gave him the name of <unk> ( Lithuanian : <unk> ) and made him part of the <unk> ' legends . Historian Edvardas Gudavičius argued that because the 1219 treaty mentioned two pairs of young brothers among the 5 elder dukes ( Mindaugas and Dausprungas , <unk> and <unk> ) , it was very likely that they were sons of powerful Lithuanian dukes Daugirutis and <unk> , killed in 1213 and 1214 . 
 Dausprungas is not mentioned anywhere else . However , it is known that Mindaugas had two nephews , Tautvilas and Gedvydas , who waged a war against their uncle . Since historians do not have any data on other brothers of Mindaugas , it is generally assumed that the two were sons of Dausprungas . During the civil war of 1249 – 1252 Tautvilas and Gedvydas asked Daniel of Galicia , their brother @-@ in @-@ law , for help . This bit of information indicates that they also had a sister . The sister was the second wife of Daniel and they did not have children . <unk> ' wife must have been Duke of Samogitia Vykintas ' sister since Vykintas was an uncle of Tautvilas and Gedvydas . It is believed that Gedvydas died in 1253 in a campaign against Bohemia , as it is the last message about him . Tautvilas was killed by his cousin Treniota in 1263 . Some historians suggest that Tautvilas had a son , Constantine , who ruled Vitebsk , however others disagree and claim that his son might have been <unk> , who was sent by Novgorod to Pskov in 1271 . 
 It is assumed that Mindaugas had three wives even though nothing is known about the first one . The assumption is made because Mindaugas had two older children , Vaišvilkas and a daughter of unknown name , who already led independent lives while the children Mindaugas had with Morta were young and still dependent on their father . Vaišvilkas became such a devoted Orthodox that he voluntarily gave up the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania in favor of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Shvarn and died heirless . The only known daughter of Mindaugas , by marriage with Shvarn in 1255 , became the Queen of Galicia ( 1255 – 1264 ) and Princess of Chełm ( 1264 ) . According to one source , after Shvarn 's death his brother Lev of Galicia married the childless widow Ramona to his ally count <unk> . Their children were the originators of the Sas noble family of western Ukraine and Poland . 
 In the commentary of the 1219 treaty with Galicia – Volhynia it is noted that Mindaugas took the wife of <unk> from the <unk> family for himself . It is assumed that <unk> ' wife and Morta are the same woman . It is known that <unk> died in 1252 in a battle against Mindaugas ; however the date of Mindaugas and Morta 's wedding is unknown . There is no consensus on how many children Morta had . The chronicles mention two sons , <unk> and <unk> , in 1261 . In 1263 two sons , <unk> and <unk> , were assassinated together with Mindaugas . This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these are the same two sons , whose name got distorted by scribes , or they are four sons . There is no data on any rivals to the crown after the assassination , except for Vaišvilkas and Tautvilas ; it would indicate that , whether there were two or four sons , they had perished in their youth . 
 After Morta 's death in 1262 , Mindaugas took her sister ( name unknown ) as his wife despite her being married to Daumantas . This cruel act motivated Daumantas to become an ally of Treniota and assassinate Mindaugas with two of his sons . Treniota was Mindaugas ' nephew . It is believed that he was son of Duke of Samogitia , either Vykintas or <unk> . If it really was Vykintas , then there was a double marriage : Vykintas ' sister married Dausprungas and Dausprungas ' ( and Mindaugas ' ) sister married Vykintas . <unk> is mentioned only once in the 1219 treaty . The other nephew , <unk> , played a role in Lithuanian state in 1242 – 1260 .

 = Herbie Collins = 
 Herbert ( Herbie ) Leslie Collins ( 21 January 1888 in Darlinghurst , Sydney , New South Wales – 28 May 1959 in Little Bay , Sydney ) was an Australian cricketer who played 19 Tests between 1921 and 1926 . An all @-@ rounder , he captained the Australian team in eleven Tests , winning five , losing two with another four finishing in draws . In a Test career delayed by First World War he scored 1 @,@ 352 runs at an average of 45 @.@ 06 , including four centuries . Collins was also a successful rugby league footballer , winning the 1911 NSWRFL season 's grand final with the Eastern Suburbs club and also representing Queensland . 
 Collins was a keen gambler , a pastime that became habitual during his time as a soldier in the Great War . After the war , he played with the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team ( AIF XI ) that toured England , South Africa and Australia and was later appointed captain of the team . He was not a stylish or forceful batsman , preferring to rely on nudges and deflections to score runs . His slow left arm off @-@ spin , bowled from a two step run up , was seldom seen after the AIF XI tour . On return to Australia , he made his Test début against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) scoring 104 in the second innings ; the fifth Australian to score a century on Test début . He was appointed captain of the Australian team in 1921 in South Africa , when the previous captain , Warwick Armstrong , fell ill . 
 His Test career finished in disappointment and in a cloud of suspicion when Australia lost the Fifth Test and the Ashes against England in 1926 . While some former players and cricket administrators suspected a case of match fixing , no material evidence supporting this has emerged . After his retirement from cricket , Collins used his gambling knowledge to start a career in horse racing , working as a bookmaker and commission agent . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Collins was born in Darlinghurst , an inner suburb of Sydney , the son of Thomas , an accountant , and Emma ( née Charlton ) . He attended Albion Street ( Superior ) Public School , where he showed an aptitude for cricket and rugby union .

 He made his first @-@ class cricket debut against South Australia in 1909 – 1910 and was disappointing , scoring three and one and taking 1 / 35 . He played one further match for the season , against Victoria . For the next two seasons , his opportunities at first @-@ class level were limited but he managed to play against the touring South African and English sides . 
 Collins also played first grade rugby league at this time in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership . He played at five @-@ eighth in Eastern Suburbs ' grand final win of the 1911 NSWRFL season alongside the great Dally Messenger . He also played in Brisbane for Toombul 's club , gaining selection for Queensland in 1912 . 
 Collins 's first full season for NSW was in 1912 – 1913 , playing ten matches and scoring 598 runs at an average of 42 @.@ 71 . He finished the season with 282 against Tasmania at Hobart . During the 1913 Australian winter , Collins was part of an Australian team that toured North America , playing Gentlemen of Philadelphia and a combined Canada – United States team . 
 = = First World War and Services XI = = 
 In 1915 Collins was one of 417 @,@ 000 Australians who enlisted and was a member of the First Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) as a reinforcement for the Australian Light Horse . He served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and later on the Western Front , carting ammunition to the artillery shelling the German lines . At the end of the War , Collins was a Lance Corporal . 
 Following the war he was included in an Australian Imperial Forces cricket team , touring England in 1919 . Charles Kelleway , an officer , was the captain of the team for the first six matches . Despite Collins 's rank Field Marshal Birdwood , the former commander of the Australian Corps , asked him to take over the captaincy for the remainder of the tour . Some of his colleagues were officers such as Jack Gregory and Nip Pellew . Collins proved a capable and popular skipper with the team losing only four of twenty eight matches during the tour . He scored 1 @,@ 615 runs including five centuries at an average of 38 @.@ 45 and took 106 wickets at 16 @.@ 55 apiece . 
 On their way home the AIF team played ten matches in South Africa , eight of them first @-@ class , remaining undefeated in this section of the tour . While Jack Gregory relished the conditions , the local newspapers acclaimed Collins as the finest player in the touring team . Collins scored 602 runs in South Africa at an average of 50 @.@ 58 and took 39 wickets at 16 @.@ 53 . In a match at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg against the South African XI , Collins scored 235 from a total of 441 in the first innings as the AIF XI won by 8 wickets . 
 On arrival back in Australia , the AIF team played three first @-@ class matches , defeating the reigning Sheffield Shield champions New South Wales and perennial Shield powerhouse Victoria . A likely victory against Queensland was frustrated due to torrential rain . The results in Australia demonstrated the strength of the AIF team and within a few months of the team 's dissolution , Collins would make his Test début , along with his AIF team @-@ mates , Gregory , wicket @-@ keeper Bert Oldfield and the batsmen Johnny Taylor and Nip Pellew .

 = = = Début = = = 
 Test cricket returned from its hiatus in 1920 with the English touring Australia . Collins , also a selector , was one of six AIF XI players to make his début in the First Test of that series . The First Test was played on Collins 's home ground , the Sydney Cricket Ground and Collins had reason to feel at home , scoring 70 and 104 . Collins was only the fifth Australian to make a century on Test début . Collins scored another century in the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval , batting 258 minutes for 162 , helping Australia to a 119 run victory . Over the 1920 – 1921 series , Collins made 557 runs at an average of 61 @.@ 88 . 
 The Australians toured England in 1921 , the first representative tour since the disastrous 1912 Triangular Tournament . Collins was included in the squad that would win the series comprehensively , three Tests to nil . In the First Test at Trent Bridge , Collins broke his thumb , ruling him out of the next two internationals . He returned to the team for the Fourth Test , after Australia had already wrapped up the series . England had fought back well and Australia were forced to defend grimly . Batting for over four and a half hours with what Wisden described as " inexhaustible patience " , Collins scored 40 runs in Australia 's only innings to force a draw . Collins scored 1 @,@ 222 runs in all matches on tour at an average of 33 @.@ 94 . 
 = = = Captain = = = 
 On the return trip to Australia , the Australian team stopped in South Africa for a short tour . Due to illness , captain Warwick Armstrong was unable to take part in any of the matches and as a result Collins was appointed captain in his place . The first two Tests were drawn but Australia won the third Test and the series at Cape Town . In the second Test of the series , Collins scored a remarkable double century ( 203 ) on the matting pitch at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg , unearthing a range of shots he had rarely used . With Gregory , who scored 119 , the pair put on a partnership of 209 in 85 minutes , destroying the South African bowling . In six matches played , Collins scored 548 runs , including two centuries at an average of 60 @.@ 88 . 
 The next international visitors to Australia were the English team of 1924 – 1925 , under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan . In the First Test at Sydney , Collins opened the batting and scored 114 . Batting with a young Victorian in his début Test , Bill Ponsford , Collins was confident enough to shelter him from the brilliant swing bowling of Maurice Tate . Ponsford went on to make a century ( 110 ) on début . Ponsford later said " I was most grateful for Herbie taking [ Tate 's bowling ] until I was settled in . I doubt I would have scored a century but for his selfless approach . " In the Second Test at Melbourne , chasing 600 , the English pair of Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day for an unbroken partnership of 283 . Before play commenced the next day , Collins said to his profligate leg spinner , " You 're going straight on to get Hobbs if we 're to have a chance " . The first ball of the day , Mailey bowled a full toss . Collins moved the field , leaving a gap in the offside field . The next ball was another full toss and Hobbs , looking to hit it into the gap , missed it all ends up and was bowled for 154 . 
 The Adelaide Test was a thriller with England needing 27 runs to win the Test with two wickets in hand . Collins , ever the gambler , threw the ball once again to Mailey , who was not known for his accuracy or containment . The gamble paid off with Mailey dismissing Tich Freeman and Gregory removing Gilligan at the other end to win the Test by eleven runs and secure The Ashes . Australia won the series four Tests to one . During the Adelaide Test , Collins was approached by a " well known racing identity " who offered him £ 100 to throw the match . Collins rejected the approach and suggested to team mate Arthur Mailey that they throw the visitor down the stairs . 
 = = = Controversy and retirement = = = 
 The 1926 tour of England would be Collins 's last . Partly as a result of a wet English summer , the first four Tests of the five @-@ Test series ended in draws . Collins had a disappointing tour , suffering from neuritis and in constant pain from arthritis . He missed the Third and Fourth Tests when admitted to hospital but recovered to resume his place as captain for the Fifth Test . 
 The Fifth Test , played at the Oval , saw England win the toss and bat . They compiled 280 , Mailey taking five wickets . Australia responded with 302 , dismissed late on the second day . At stumps , England – in their second innings – were 0 / 49 . A violent thunderstorm inundated the ground overnight , rendering the pitch sticky . Collins attracted a great deal of negative attention by using the inexperienced Arthur Richardson as a main strike bowler at the expense of the likes of Mailey and Clarrie Grimmett . The English openers , Hobbs and Sutcliffe , took advantage of this by compiling a 172 @-@ run opening partnership . England were bowled out in their second innings for 436 , 415 runs ahead . Australia were dismissed for 125 , losing the match by 289 runs . The Test was to be Collins 's last . 
 Such was the disappointment at losing the Ashes , Collins was stripped not only of the New South Wales captaincy but also that of his local club , Waverley . Former players , including his former Waverley captain , the influential Monty Noble , publicly criticised Collins ' captaincy . Hunter Hendry , viewing the match from the stands , suspected Collins threw the match . Despite his reputation as a gambler , there is no material evidence that Collins ever fixed the result of any cricket match . 
 = = Rugby league career = = 
 In the 1911 cricket off season Collins played rugby league for Sydney 's Eastern Suburbs club . A five @-@ eighth , Collins played alongside rugby league " immortal " , Dally Messenger when the Eastern Suburbs club won its first ever premiership . In the 1912 season he played in Brisbane for Toombul 's club and represented Queensland on three occasions . 
 = = Outside cricket = = 
 Collins was an enthusiastic gambler , renowned by his team mates for finding any reason to bet . Mailey stated that Collins 's haunts " were the racetrack , the dog track , a baccarat joint at Kings Cross , a two @-@ up school in the Flanders trenches and anywhere a quiet game of poker was being played . " His New South Wales team mate Hal Hooker remarked of Collins : 
 He would bet on anything — perhaps he was the original of the saying about flies crawling up the window . Waiting on a railway line he would bet on how many trains would pass through the opposite <unk> how may carriages would be on the next one , how many carriage windows would be open . In a train he would produce a brass top stamped Put and Take — he paid or collected according to which way it fell when it stopped spinning . 
 Collins was known for all night poker sessions before going out to open the batting but refused to play against his fellow cricketers , seeing no challenge in taking money from novices . His gambling attracted some criticism and Collins was seen by many , including some cricket administrators , as an inveterate gambler . 
 He turned his interest in gambling into a career , taking out a bookmakers ' licence for a period and he served as a steward at pony races in Sydney . Neither role appealed to him as much as acting as a commission agent for other bookmakers . Collins would " lay @-@ off " for bookmakers over committed on certain horses , placing large bets carefully and with cool calculation . He won and lost two fortunes on the track and at one stage required the assistance of the New South Wales Cricketers Fund to support him and his invalid mother . He re @-@ enlisted in the Australian Army during the Second World War , stationed at Victoria Barracks with the rank of sergeant . 
 In 1940 , Collins , then aged 51 , married 24 @-@ year @-@ old Marjorie Paine , the daughter of a race steward . The marriage produced a son before ending in divorce eleven years later ; a petition served by Collins was not defended by his wife . After his divorce , Collins continued to frequent gambling clubs at Kings Cross , participating in all @-@ night poker sessions . Despite giving up smoking late in life , his lungs failed him and he died of cancer in 1959 , aged 70 . 
 = = Playing style and personality = = 
 Collins was short , no more than 5 ft 8 in ( 173 cm ) and slight . As a batsman , he was not an extravagant strokeplayer , preferring to avoid risk and leave balls on a good length where possible . He batted with very little backlift and at first inspection could seem <unk> , scoring only from pushes and prods , nudges and dabs . His patience was renowned with the contemporary cricket writer Ray Robinson remarking " [ Collins ] had an implacable trench warfare style that in difficult times earned admiration from his own side , put bowlers on the road to exasperation and sent onlookers through the doors of bars . " His one bold shot was an over @-@ the @-@ shoulder hook shot , finishing standing on his right foot , his left foot six inches in the air . Deficient in driving power , bowlers learnt to lessen his scoring power by pitching the ball well up . He often batted without the protection of gloves , especially on easy pitches . 
 Collins bowled his slow left arm spinners off two steps , with seemingly little effort . In South Africa while bowling , a batsman was heard to yell " Collins is getting weary , Why don 't you carry him to the wicket ? " After his efforts for the AIF team he seldom bowled long spells again . 
 Popular with his men , Collins was respected for his faith in his team mates and his ability to relate to different personalities . The Test leg @-@ spinner , Arthur Mailey noted , " I learnt more of the psychology of cricket from Collins from all the hundreds of cricketers I met . " Bert Oldfield said of Collins , " He studied every player 's temperament and acted accordingly . " Collins was undemonstrative , expecting his fieldsmen to look at him every after every delivery and adjust their position in response to his slight hand movements or even a bent finger . He was last to shower at the end of a day 's play , preferring to sit in a corner in silence . His team mates assumed that he was contemplating the day 's action and pondering on the next day 's possibilities . He was a successful Test captain , leading Australia to five wins and two losses ; four matches finished in draws . 
 Many nicknames attached themselves to Collins , including " Lucky " and " Horseshoe " as a result of his reputation for fortune , especially when it came to tossing the coin . His players called him " <unk> " ( probably because of his left @-@ handedness ) and " Nutty " ; it is unclear if this was because he used his " nut " ( head ) or was a hard nut to crack . Mailey nicknamed him " The squirrel " , claiming that Collins eyes glowed at night , enabling him to see better at night than by day . Collins has a bohemian character who enjoyed all night poker and baccarat sessions and evenings at the opera . " Poker Face " , indeed , was another of his nicknames . He had a light tenor voice himself and would sometimes sing at parties . While in the army , Collins became a chain smoker but he remained a teetotaller , save for an occasional glass of celebratory champagne . 
 = HMS Active ( 1869 ) = 
 HMS Active was a Volage @-@ class corvette built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s . Launched in 1869 , she entered service in 1873 , and was the Commodore 's ship on the Cape of Good Hope and West Africa Station . Her crew served ashore in both the Third Anglo @-@ Ashanti and Zulu Wars . From 1885 to 1898 , the ship was the flagship of the Training Squadron . Active was sold for scrap in 1906 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Active was 270 feet ( 82 @.@ 3 m ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 42 feet 1 inch ( 12 @.@ 8 m ) . Forward the ship had a draught of 16 feet 5 inches ( 5 @.@ 0 m ) , but aft she drew 21 ft 5 in ( 6 @.@ 5 m ) . Active displaced 3 @,@ 078 long tons ( 3 @,@ 127 t ) and had a burthen of 2 @,@ 322 tons . Her iron hull was covered by a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) layer of oak that was sheathed with copper from the waterline down to prevent biofouling . Watertight transverse bulkheads subdivided the hull . Her crew consisted of 340 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship had one 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal return connecting rod @-@ steam engine made by Humphreys and Tennant driving a single 19 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) propeller . Five rectangular boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 30 psi ( 207 kPa ; 2 kgf / cm2 ) . The engine produced a total of 4 @,@ 130 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 080 kW ) which gave Active a maximum speed of 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship carried 410 long tons ( 420 t ) of coal , enough to steam 2 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 700 km ; 2 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Active was ship rigged and had a sail area of 16 @,@ 593 square feet ( 1 @,@ 542 m2 ) . The lower masts were made of iron , but the other masts were wood . The ship 's best speed under sail alone was 12 @.@ 5 knots ( 23 @.@ 2 km / h ; 14 @.@ 4 mph ) . Her funnel was semi @-@ retractable to reduce wind resistance and her propeller could be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail . 
 The ship was initially armed with a mix of 7 @-@ inch and 64 @-@ pounder 64 cwt rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . The six 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) guns and two of the four 64 @-@ pounders were mounted on the broadside while the other two were mounted on the forecastle and poop deck as chase guns . In 1879 , ten BL 6 @-@ inch 80 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading guns replaced all the broadside weapons . Two carriages for 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedoes were added as well .

 HMS Active was laid down in 1867 and launched on 13 March 1869 . The ship was completed in March 1871 at a total cost of £ 126 @,@ 156 . Of this , £ 85 @,@ 795 was spent on her hull and £ 40 @,@ 361 on her machinery . Unlike her sister ship Volage , Active was placed in reserve after completion until 1873 when she was commissioned to serve as the flagship of the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station , Commodore William Hewett . The ship participated in naval operations during the Third Anglo @-@ Ashanti War of 1874 and some of her crew were landed to reinforce the forces ashore . Commodore Francis Sullivan replaced Hewett in 1876 and he retained command until 1879 when the ship returned home to refit .

 Between 19 November 1878 and 21 July 1879 , during the Anglo @-@ Zulu War , 173 men of Active ( along with men from Tenedos , Shah and Boadicea ) served ashore as part of an 858 @-@ man naval brigade . The group from Active comprised 10 officers , 100 seamen , 5 idlers , 42 Marines , 14 <unk> , and 2 medical attendants . In addition to small arms , they were equipped with two 12 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading guns , 24 @-@ pounder rockets , and a Gatling gun . The 12 @-@ pounders were exchanged for two of the Army 's 7 @-@ pounder mountain guns before entering Zululand . 
 Attached to the No.1 Column commanded by Colonel Charles Pearson , they crossed the Tugela River from Natal into Zululand on 12 January 1879 . On 22 January they saw action in the Battle of <unk> , driving off an attacking force of Zulus with rockets , Martini @-@ Henry rifles and the Gatling gun . The same day the British main force was defeated at the Battle of Isandlwana , and so Pearson 's column advanced to <unk> , where it was besieged for two months , until relieved on 3 April . During the campaign , Active 's crew suffered only one man killed , and nine wounded in action against the enemy , while nine died of disease during the siege , and one man drowned while crossing the Tugela . In 1881 the South Africa Medal was awarded to those members of Active 's crew that had served there .

 A memorial to the men of Active who lost their lives during the African campaigns can be found in Victoria Park , Portsmouth . 
 = Volcanic ash = 
 Volcanic ash consists of fragments of pulverized rock , minerals and volcanic glass , created during volcanic eruptions and measuring less than 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 079 inches ) in diameter . The term volcanic ash is also often loosely used to refer to all explosive eruption products ( correctly referred to as tephra ) , including particles larger than 2mm . Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere . The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass . Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions , causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma . Once in the air , ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away . 
 Due to its wide dispersal , ash can have a number of impacts on society , including human and animal health , disruption to aviation , disruption to critical infrastructure ( e.g. , electric power supply systems , telecommunications , water and waste @-@ water networks , transportation ) , primary industries ( e.g. , agriculture ) , buildings and structures . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions , phreatomagmatic eruptions and during transport in pyroclastic density currents . 
 Explosive eruptions occur when magma decompresses as it rises , allowing dissolved volatiles ( dominantly water and carbon dioxide ) to <unk> into gas bubbles . As more bubbles nucleate a foam is produced , which decreases the density of the magma , accelerating it up the conduit . Fragmentation occurs when bubbles occupy ~ 70 @-@ 80 vol % of the erupting mixture . When fragmentation occurs , violently expanding bubbles tear the magma apart into fragments which are ejected into the atmosphere where they solidify into ash particles . Fragmentation is a very efficient process of ash formation and is capable of generating very fine ash even without the addition of water . 
 Volcanic ash is also produced during phreatomagmatic eruptions . During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes into contact with bodies of water ( such as the sea , lakes and marshes ) groundwater , snow or ice . As the magma , which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water , comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms ( <unk> effect ) . Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma . This increases the heat transfer which leads to the rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the volcanic vent . Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism , leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles . 
 Pyroclastic density currents can also produce ash particles . These are typically produced by lava dome collapse or collapse of the eruption column . Within pyroclastic density currents particle abrasion occurs as particles interact with each other resulting in a reduction in grain size and production of fine grained ash particles . In addition , ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments , due to the conservation of heat within the flow . These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which is removed from pyroclastic density currents in co @-@ ignimbrite ash plumes . 
 Physical and chemical characteristics of volcanic ash are primarily controlled by the style of volcanic eruption . Volcanoes display a range of eruption styles which are controlled by magma chemistry , crystal content , temperature and dissolved gases of the erupting magma and can be classified using the volcanic explosivity index ( VEI ) . Effusive eruptions ( VEI 1 ) of basaltic composition produce < 105 m3 of ejecta , whereas extremely explosive eruptions ( VEI 5 + ) of rhyolitic and dacitic composition can inject large quantities ( > 109 m3 ) of ejecta into the atmosphere . Another parameter controlling the amount of ash produced is the duration of the eruption : the longer the eruption is sustained , the more ash will be produced . For example , the second phase of the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull was classified as VEI 4 despite a modest 8 km high eruption column , but the eruption continued for a month , which allowed a large volume of ash to be ejected into the atmosphere . 
 = = Properties = = 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 The types of minerals present in volcanic ash are dependent on the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted . Considering that the most abundant elements found in magma are silica ( SiO2 ) and oxygen , the various types of magma ( and therefore ash ) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly explained in terms of their silica content . Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~ 45 - 55 % silica that is generally rich in iron ( Fe ) and magnesium ( Mg ) . The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica ( > 69 % ) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition ( e.g. , andesite or dacite ) have a silica content between 55 @-@ 69 % . 
 The principal gases released during volcanic activity are water , carbon dioxide , sulfur dioxide , hydrogen , hydrogen sulfide , carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride . These sulfur and halogen gases and metals are removed from the atmosphere by processes of chemical reaction , dry and wet deposition , and by adsorption onto the surface of volcanic ash . 
 It has long been recognised that a range of sulfate and halide ( primarily chloride and fluoride ) compounds are readily mobilised from fresh volcanic ash . ; It is considered most likely that these salts are formed as a consequence of rapid acid dissolution of ash particles within eruption plumes , which is thought to supply the cations involved in the deposition of sulfate and halide salts . 
 While some 55 ionic species have been reported in fresh ash leachates the most abundant species usually found are the cations Na + , K + , Ca2 + and Mg2 + and the anions Cl − , F − and <unk> − . <unk> ratios between ions present in leachates suggest that in many cases these elements are present as simple salts such as NaCl and CaSO4 . In a sequential leaching experiment on ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , chloride salts were found to be the most readily soluble , followed by sulfate salts Fluoride compounds are in general only sparingly soluble ( e.g. , CaF2 , <unk> ) , with the exception of fluoride salts of alkali metals and compounds such as calcium <unk> ( <unk> ) . The pH of fresh ash leachates is highly variable , depending on the presence of an acidic gas condensate ( primarily as a consequence of the gases SO2 , HCl and HF in the eruption plume ) on the ash surface . 
 The crystalline @-@ solid structure of the salts act more as an insulator than a conductor . However , once the salts are dissolved into a solution by a source of moisture ( e.g. , fog , mist , light rain , etc . ) , the ash may become corrosive and electrically conductive . A recent study has shown that the electrical conductivity of volcanic ash increases with ( 1 ) increasing moisture content , ( 2 ) increasing soluble salt content , and ( 3 ) increasing compaction ( bulk density ) . The ability of volcanic ash to conduct electric current has significant implications for electric power supply systems .

 Volcanic ash particles erupted during magmatic eruptions are made up of various fractions of <unk> ( glassy , non @-@ crystalline ) , crystalline or lithic ( non @-@ magmatic ) particles . Ash produced during low viscosity magmatic eruptions ( e.g. , Hawaiian and Strombolian basaltic eruptions ) produce a range of different pyroclasts dependent on the eruptive process . For example , ash collected from Hawaiian lava fountains consists of <unk> ( light brown basaltic glass ) pyroclasts which contain rare <unk> ( small quench crystals ) and phenocrysts . Slightly more viscous eruptions of basalt ( e.g. , Strombolian ) form a variety of pyroclasts from irregular <unk> droplets to blocky <unk> ( black to dark brown microcrystalline pyroclasts ) . In contrast , most high @-@ silica ash ( e.g. rhyolite ) consists of pulverised products of pumice ( <unk> shards ) , individual phenocrysts ( crystal fraction ) and some lithic fragments ( xenoliths ) . 
 Ash generated during phreatic <unk> [ e ] ns primarily consists of hydrothermally altered lithic and mineral fragments , commonly in a clay matrix . Particle surfaces are often coated with aggregates of zeolite crystals or clay and only relict textures remain to identify <unk> types . 
 = = = = Morphology = = = = 
 The morphology ( shape ) of volcanic ash is controlled by a plethora of different eruption and kinematic processes . Eruptions of low @-@ viscosity magmas ( e.g. , basalt ) typically form droplet shaped particles . This droplet shape is , in part , controlled by surface tension , acceleration of the droplets after they leave the vent , and air friction . Shapes range from perfect spheres to a variety of twisted , elongate droplets with smooth , <unk> surfaces . 
 The morphology of ash from eruptions of high @-@ viscosity magmas ( e.g. , rhyolite , dacite , and some andesites ) is mostly dependent on the shape of vesicles in the rising magma before disintegration . Vesicles are formed by the expansion of magmatic gas before the magma has solidified . Ash particles can have varying degrees of <unk> and vesicular particles can have extremely high surface area to volume ratios . <unk> , troughs , and tubes observed on grain surfaces are the result of broken vesicle walls . <unk> ash particles from high @-@ viscosity magma eruptions are typically angular , vesicular <unk> fragments or thin vesicle @-@ wall fragments while lithic fragments in volcanic ash are typically equant , or angular to <unk> . Lithic morphology in ash is generally controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall rock broken up by spalling or explosive expansion of gases in the magma as it reaches the surface . 
 The morphology of ash particles from phreatomagmatic eruptions is controlled by stresses within the chilled magma which result in fragmentation of the glass to form small blocky or pyramidal glass ash particles . <unk> shape and density play only a minor role in the determination of grain shape in phreatomagmatic eruptions . In this sort of eruption , the rising magma is quickly cooled on contact with ground or surface water . Stresses within the " quenched " magma cause fragmentation into five dominant <unk> shape @-@ types : ( 1 ) blocky and equant ; ( 2 ) vesicular and irregular with smooth surfaces ; ( 3 ) moss @-@ like and convoluted ; ( 4 ) spherical or drop @-@ like ; and ( 5 ) plate @-@ like . 
 = = = = Density = = = = 
 The density of individual particles varies with different eruptions . The density of volcanic ash varies between 700 – 1200 kg / m3 for pumice , 2350 – 2450 kg / m3 for glass shards , 2700 – 3300 kg / m3 for crystals , and 2600 – 3200 kg / m3 for lithic particles . Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source , fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations . The high density and hardness ( ~ 5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale ) together with a high degree of angularity , make some types of volcanic ash ( particularly those with a high silica content ) very abrasive . 
 = = = = Grain size = = = = 
 Volcanic ash consists of particles ( pyroclasts ) with diameters < 2 mm ( particles > 2 mm are classified as lapilli ) , and can be as fine as 1 μm . The overall grain size distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions . Few attempts have been made to correlate the grain size characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it , though some predictions can be made . <unk> magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas , due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity . The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions , probably because vesicle size in the pre @-@ eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas . There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by <unk> and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater . 
 = = Dispersal = = 
 Ash particles are incorporated into eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity . The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards . As air is drawn into the column , the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise <unk> into the atmosphere . At a point where the bulk density of the column is the same as the surrounding atmosphere , the column will cease rising and start moving laterally . Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano , depending on eruption column height , particle size of the ash and climatic conditions ( especially wind direction and strength and humidity ) . 
 Ash fallout occurs immediately after the eruption and is controlled by particle density . Initially , coarse particles fall out close to source . This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli , which is the result of particle agglomeration within the column . Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind . This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano . Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high @-@ altitude winds . These particles can impact on the aviation industry ( refer to impacts section ) and , combined with gas particles , can affect global climate . 
 Volcanic ash plumes can form above pyroclastic density currents , these are called co @-@ ignimbrite plumes . As pyroclastic density currents travel away from the volcano , smaller particles are removed from the flow by <unk> and form a less dense zone overlying the main flow . This zone then <unk> the surrounding air and a buoyant co @-@ ignimbrite plume is formed . These plumes tend to have higher concentrations of fine ash particles compared to magmatic eruption plumes due to the abrasion within the pyroclastic density current .

 Population growth has caused the progressive encroachment of urban development into higher risk areas , closer to volcanic centres , increasing the human exposure to volcanic ash fall events . 
 Infrastructure is critical to supporting modern societies , particularly in urban areas , where high population densities create high demand for services . These infrastructure networks and systems support urban living , and provide lifeline services upon which we depend for our health , education , transport and social networking . Infrastructure networks and services support a variety of facilities across a broad range of sectors . 
 Volcanic ash fall events can disrupt and or damage the infrastructure upon which society depends . Several recent eruptions have illustrated the vulnerability of urban areas that received only a few millimetres or centimetres of volcanic ash . This has been sufficient to cause disruption of transportation , electricity , water , sewage and storm water systems . Costs have been incurred from business disruption , replacement of damaged parts and insured losses . Ash fall impacts on critical infrastructure can also cause multiple knock @-@ on effects , which may disrupt many different sectors and services . 
 Volcanic ash fall is physically , socially and economically disruptive . Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas many hundreds of kilometres from the source , and causes disruptions and losses in a wide variety of different infrastructure sectors . Impacts are dependent on : ash fall thickness ; the duration of the ash fall ; the grain size and chemistry of the ash ; whether the ash is wet or dry ; and any preparedness , management and prevention ( mitigation ) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall . Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences . These are discussed in the following sections . 
 = = = Infrastructure sectors = = = 
 = = = = Electricity = = = = 
 Volcanic ash can cause disruption to electric power supply systems at all levels of power generation , transformation , transmission and distribution . There are four main impacts arising from ash @-@ contamination of apparatus used in the power delivery process : 
 Wet deposits of ash on high voltage insulators can initiate a leakage current ( small amount of current flow across the insulator surface ) which , if sufficient current is achieved , can cause ‘ flashover ’ ( the unintended electrical discharge around or over the surface of an insulating material ) . 
 If the resulting short @-@ circuit current is high enough to trip the circuit breaker then disruption of service will occur . Ash @-@ induced flashover across transformer insulation ( bushings ) can burn , etch or crack the insulation irreparably and will likely result in the disruption of power supply . 
 Volcanic ash can erode , pit and scour metallic apparatus , particularly moving parts such as water and wind turbines and cooling fans on transformers or thermal power plants . 
 The high bulk density of some ash deposits can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading . This is most hazardous when the ash and / or the lines and structures are wet ( e.g. , by rainfall ) and there has been ≥ 10 mm of ash fall . Fine @-@ grained ash ( e.g. , < 0 @.@ 5 mm diameter ) adheres to lines and structures most readily . Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation , causing it to fall onto lines . Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware . 
 Controlled outages of vulnerable connection points ( e.g. , substations ) or circuits until ash fall has subsided or for de @-@ energised cleaning of equipment . 
 = = = = Drinking water supplies = = = = 
 Following an eruption , it is very common for the public to hold fears about chemical contamination of water supplies . However , in general , the physical impacts of an ashfall will tend to overwhelm problems caused by the release of chemical contaminants from fresh volcanic ash . Impacts vary according to the type of treatment system . 
 = = = = = Large water treatment plants = = = = = 
 Groundwater @-@ fed systems are resilient to impacts from ashfall , although airborne ash can interfere with the operation of well @-@ head pumps . Electricity outages caused by ashfall can also disrupt electrically powered pumps if there is no backup generation . 
 For surface water sources such as lakes and reservoirs , the volume available for dilution of ionic species leached from ash is generally large . The most abundant components of ash leachates ( Ca , Na , Mg , K , Cl , F and SO4 ) occur naturally at significant concentrations in most surface waters and therefore are not affected greatly by inputs from volcanic ashfall , and are also of low concern in drinking water , with the possible exception of fluorine . The elements iron , manganese and aluminium are commonly enriched over background levels by volcanic ashfall . These elements may impart a metallic taste to water , and may produce red , brown or black staining of <unk> , but are not considered a health risk . Volcanic ashfalls are not known to have caused problems in water supplies for toxic trace elements such as mercury ( Hg ) and lead ( Pb ) which occur at very low levels in ash leachates . 
 A further point to note is that drinking @-@ water treatment commonly involves the addition of treatment chemicals such as aluminium sulfate or ferric chloride as <unk> , lime for pH adjustment , chlorine for disinfection and fluoride compounds for dental health . 
 The physical impacts of ashfall can affect the operation of water treatment plants . Ash can block intake structures , cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors . Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation / flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity ( the level of suspended solids , measured in <unk> turbidity units ) in the incoming water . In most cases , changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant . <unk> will be more likely to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation / flocculation treatment . Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters . In most cases , increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall , but there will not be service interruptions . 
 The final step of drinking water treatment is disinfection to ensure that final drinking water is free from infectious microorganisms . As suspended particles ( turbidity ) can provide a growth substrate for microorganisms and can protect them from disinfection treatment , it is extremely important that the water treatment process achieves a good level of removal of suspended particles . 
 = = = = = Small treatment systems = = = = = 
 Many small communities obtain their drinking water from diverse sources ( lakes , streams , springs and groundwater wells ) . Levels of treatment vary widely , from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection ( usually chlorination ) , to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step . It should be noted that unless a high quality source is used , such as secure groundwater , disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium , which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration . 
 Volcanic ashfall is likely to have major effects on these systems . Ash will clog intake structures , cause abrasion damage to pumps and block pipes , settling ponds and open filters . High levels of turbidity are very likely to interfere with disinfection treatment and doses may have to be adjusted to compensate . It is essential to monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system . 
 = = = = = Rainwater @-@ fed supplies = = = = = 
 Many households , and some small communities , rely on rainwater for their drinking water supplies . Roof @-@ fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall , as they have a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume . In these cases , leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended . Prior to an ashfall , downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected . A further problem is that the surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic . Unlike most surface waters , rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity ( acid @-@ neutralising capacity ) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters . This may lead to problems with <unk> , whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with . This can be a particular problem if there are lead @-@ head nails or lead flashing used on the roof , and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings . 
 = = = = = Water demand = = = = = 
 During ashfall events large demands are commonly placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result . Shortages compromise key services such as firefighting and can lead to a lack of water for hygiene , sanitation and drinking . Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully , and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water ( e.g. , cleaning with brooms rather than hoses ) . 
 = = = = Wastewater treatment = = = = 
 Wastewater networks may sustain damage similar to water supply networks . It is very difficult to exclude ash from the sewerage system . Systems with combined storm water / sewer lines are most at risk . Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow / infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections ( e.g. , from roof downpipes ) , cross connections , around manhole covers or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes . 
 Ash @-@ laden sewage entering a treatment plant is likely to cause failure of mechanical <unk> equipment such as step screens or rotating screens . Ash that penetrates further into the system will settle and reduce the capacity of biological reactors as well as increasing the volume of sludge and changing its composition . 
 = = = = Aircraft = = = = 
 The principal damage sustained by aircraft flying into a volcanic ash cloud is abrasion to forward @-@ facing surfaces , such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings , and accumulation of ash into surface openings , including engines . <unk> of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments . However , some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors ( e.g. , pitot tubes ) can become blocked with ash . Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades . The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor , reducing its efficiency . The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass . The ash then solidifies on turbine blades , blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall . 
 The composition of most ash is such that its melting temperature is within the operating temperature ( > 1000 ° C ) of modern large jet engines . The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume , the length of time the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots . Critically , melting of ash , particularly volcanic glass , can result in accumulation of <unk> ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes , resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust . The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem . It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180 ° turn . Volcanic gases , which are present within ash clouds , can also cause damage to engines and acrylic windshields , although this damage may not surface for many years . 
 = = = = = Occurrence = = = = = 
 There are many instances of damage to jet aircraft as a result of an ash encounter . On 24 June 1982 a British Airways Boeing 747 @-@ <unk> ( Flight 9 ) flew through the ash cloud from the eruption of Mount <unk> , Indonesia resulting in the failure of all four engines . The plane descended 24 @,@ 000 feet ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) in 16 minutes before the engines restarted , allowing the aircraft to make an emergency landing . On 15 December 1989 a KLM Boeing 747 @-@ 400 ( Flight 867 ) also lost power to all four engines after flying into an ash cloud from Mount Redoubt , Alaska . After dropping 14 @,@ 700 feet ( 4 @,@ 500 m ) in four minutes , the engines were started just 1 – 2 minutes before impact . Total damage was US $ 80 million and it took 3 months ' work to repair the plane . In the 1990s a further US $ 100 million of damage was sustained by commercial aircraft ( some in the air , others on the ground ) as a consequence of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines . 
 In April 2010 airspace all over Europe was affected , with many flights cancelled @-@ which was unprecedented @-@ due to the presence of volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere from the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull . On 15 April 2010 the Finnish Air Force halted training flights when damage was found from volcanic dust ingestion by the engines of one of its Boeing F @-@ 18 Hornet fighters . On 22 April 2010 UK RAF Typhoon training flights were also temporarily suspended after deposits of volcanic ash were found in a jet 's engines . In June 2011 there were similar closures of airspace in Chile , Argentina , Brazil , Australia and New Zealand , following the eruption of <unk> @-@ Cordón <unk> , Chile . 
 = = = = = Detection = = = = = 
 Volcanic ash clouds are very difficult to detect from aircraft as no onboard cockpit instruments exist to detect them . However , a new system called Airborne Volcanic Object Infrared Detector ( <unk> ) has recently been developed by <unk> Aviation , a daughter company of the Norwegian Institute for Air Research , which will allow pilots to detect ash plumes up to 100 km ( 62 mi ) ahead and fly safely around them . The system uses two fast @-@ sampling infrared cameras , mounted on a forward @-@ facing surface , that are tuned to detect volcanic ash . This system can detect ash concentrations of < 1 mg / m3 to > 50 mg / m3 , giving pilots approximately 7 – 10 minutes warning . The camera is currently being tested by easyJet airline company . 
 In addition , ground and satellite based imagery , radar , and lidar can be used to detect ash clouds . This information is passed between meteorological agencies , volcanic observatories and airline companies through Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers ( <unk> ) . There is one <unk> for each of the nine regions of the world . <unk> can issue advisories describing the current and future extent of the ash cloud . 
 = = = = = Airport systems = = = = = 
 Volcanic ash not only affects in @-@ flight operations but can affect ground @-@ based airport operations as well . Small accumulations of ash can reduce visibility , create slippery runways and taxiways , infiltrate communication and electrical systems , interrupt ground services , damage buildings and parked aircraft . Ash accumulation of more than a few millimeters requires removal before airports can resume full operations . Ash does not disappear ( unlike snowfalls ) and must be disposed of in a manner that prevents it from being <unk> by wind and aircraft . 
 = = = = Land transport = = = = 
 Ash may disrupt transportation systems over large areas for hours to days , including roads and vehicles , railways and ports and shipping . Falling ash will reduce the visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous . In addition , fast travelling cars will stir up ash , creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards . Ash accumulations will decrease traction , especially when wet , and cover road markings . Fine @-@ grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces , especially between moving parts . Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement . Rail transport is less vulnerable , with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility . 
 Marine transport can also be impacted by volcanic ash . Ash fall will block air and oil filters and abrade any moving parts if ingested into engines . Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall . <unk> ash ( pumice and scoria ) will float on the water surface in ‘ pumice rafts ’ which can clog water intakes quickly , leading to over heating of machinery . 
 = = = = Communications = = = = 
 Telecommunication and broadcast networks can be affected by volcanic ash in the following ways : attenuation and reduction of signal strength ; damage to equipment ; and overloading of network through user demand . Signal attenuation due to volcanic ash is not well documented ; however , there have been reports of disrupted communications following the 1969 Surtsey eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption . Research by the New Zealand @-@ based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to low frequency services such as satellite communication . Signal interference may also be caused by lightning , as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes . 
 Telecommunication equipment may become damaged due to direct ash fall . Most modern equipment requires constant cooling from air conditioning units . These are susceptible to blockage by ash which reduces their cooling efficiency . Heavy ash falls may cause telecommunication lines , masts , cables , aerials , antennae dishes and towers to collapse due to ash loading . Moist ash may also cause accelerated corrosion of metal components . 
 Reports from recent eruptions suggest that the largest disruption to communication networks is overloading due to high user demand . This is common of many natural disasters . 
 = = = = Computers = = = = 
 Computers may be impacted by volcanic ash , with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall , but it is unlikely they will completely fail . The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components , such as cooling fans , cd drives , keyboard , mice and touch pads . These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working ; however , most can be restored to working order by cleaning with compressed air . Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers ; however , will not affect laptop computers . 
 = = = = Buildings and structures = = = = 
 Damage to buildings and structures can range from complete or partial roof collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials . Impacts depend on the thickness of ash , whether it is wet or dry , the roof and building design and how much ash gets inside a building . The specific weight of ash can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50 @-@ 100 % . Problems associated with ash loading are similar to that of snow ; however , ash is more severe as 1 ) the load from ash is generally much greater , 2 ) ash does not melt and 3 ) ash can clog and damage gutters , especially after rain fall . Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction , including roof slope , construction materials , roof span and support system , and age and maintenance of the building . Generally flat roofs are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs . Roofs made of smooth materials ( sheet metal or glass ) are more likely to shed ash than roofs made with rough materials ( thatch , asphalt or wood shingles ) . Roof collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage . For example , the collapse of roofs from ash during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people . 
 = = = Human and animal health = = = 
 Ash particles of less than 10 µm diameter suspended in the air are known to be <unk> , and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort , breathing difficulty , eye and skin irritation , and nose and throat symptoms . Most of these effects are short @-@ term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre @-@ existing respiratory conditions . The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size , mineralogical composition and chemical coatings on the surface of the ash particles . Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure , the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction ; the proportion of ash with less than 10 µm diameter , known as <unk> . The social context may also be important . 
 Chronic health effects from volcanic ash fall are possible , as exposure to free crystalline silica is known to cause silicosis . Minerals associated with this include quartz , <unk> and <unk> , which may all be present in volcanic ash . These minerals are described as ‘ free ’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element to create a new mineral . However , magmas containing less than 58 % SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica . 
 The exposure levels to free crystalline silica in the ash are commonly used to characterise the risk of silicosis in occupational studies ( for people who work in mining , construction and other industries , ) because it is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer . Guideline values have been created for exposure , but with unclear rationale ; UK guidelines for particulates in air ( <unk> ) are 50 µg / m3 and USA guidelines for exposure to crystalline silica are 50 µg / m3 . It is thought that the guidelines on exposure levels could be exceeded for short periods of time without significant health effects on the general population . 
 There have been no documented cases of silicosis developed from exposure to volcanic ash . However , long @-@ term studies necessary to evaluate these effects are lacking . 
 Ingesting ash may be harmful to livestock , causing abrasion of the teeth , and in cases of high fluorine content , fluorine poisoning ( toxic at levels of > 100 µg / g ) for grazing animals . It is known from the 1783 eruption of Laki in Iceland that fluorine poisoning occurred in humans and livestock as a result of the chemistry of the ash and gas , which contained high levels of Hydrogen Fluoride . Following the 1995 / 96 Mount Ruapehu eruptions in New Zealand , two thousand ewes and lambs died after being affected by fluorosis while grazing on land with only 1 – 3 mm of ash fall . Ash ingestion may also cause gastrointestinal blockages . Sheep that ingested ash from the 1991 Mount Hudson volcanic eruption in Chile , suffered from diarrhoea and weakness . The added weight of ash in the wool led to fatigue and sheep could not stand up . 
 = = = Environment and agriculture = = = 
 Volcanic ash can have a detrimental impact on the environment which can be difficult to predict due to the large variety of environmental conditions that exist within the ash fall zone . Natural waterways can be impacted in the same way as urban water supply networks . Ash will increase water turbidity which can reduce the amount of light reaching lower depths , which can inhibit growth of submerged aquatic plants and consequently affect species which are dependent on them such as fish and shellfish . High turbidity can also affect the ability of fish gills to absorb dissolved oxygen . Acidification will also occur , which will reduce the pH of the water and impact the fauna and flora living in the environment . Fluoride contamination will occur if the ash contains high concentrations of fluoride . 
 Ash accumulation will also affect pasture , plants and trees which are part of the horticulture and agriculture industries . Thin ash falls ( < 20 mm ) may put livestock off eating , and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth . There may be an increase in pasture production due to a <unk> effect and slight fertilizing effect , such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995 / 96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions . Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation . Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness , ash chemistry , compaction of ash , amount of rainfall , duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall . The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH , which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil ’ s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive . Ash will also impact upon arable crops , such as fruit , vegetables and grain . Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality , contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading . 
 Young forests ( trees < 2 years old ) are most at risk from ash falls and are likely to be destroyed by ash deposits > 100 mm . Ash fall is unlikely to kill mature trees , but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls ( > 500 mm ) . <unk> of trees may also occur , especially if there is a coarse ash component within the ash fall . 
 Land rehabilitation after ash fall may be possible depending on the ash deposit thickness . Rehabilitation treatment may include : direct seeding of deposit ; mixing of deposit with buried soil ; scraping of ash deposit from land surface ; and application of new topsoil over the ash deposit . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Critical infrastructure and infrastructure services are vital to the functionality of modern society , to provide : medical care , policing , emergency services , and lifelines such as water , wastewater , and power and transportation links . Often critical facilities themselves are dependent on such lifelines for operability , which makes them vulnerable to both direct impacts from a hazard event and indirect effects from lifeline disruption . 
 The impacts on lifelines may also be inter @-@ dependent . The vulnerability of each lifeline may depend on : the type of hazard , the spatial density of its critical linkages , the dependency on critical linkages , susceptibility to damage and speed of service restoration , state of repair or age , and institutional characteristics or ownership . 
 The 2010 eruption of <unk> in Iceland highlighted the impacts of volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services . During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of € 1 @.@ 5 @-@ 2 @.@ 5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010 . Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries , losses in the tourism industry , destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland ( in combination with glacial melt water ) , and costs associated with emergency response and clean @-@ up . However , across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption , the insurance industry , the postal service , and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide . These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event . 
 = = Preparedness , mitigation and management = = 
 Preparedness for ashfalls should involve sealing buildings , protecting infrastructure and homes , and storing sufficient supplies of food and water to last until the ash fall is over and clean @-@ up can begin . Dust masks can be worn to reduce inhalation of ash and mitigate against any respiratory health affects . Goggles can be worn to protect against eye irritation . 
 The International Volcanic <unk> Impacts Working Group of <unk> maintains a regularly updated database of impacts and mitigations strategies at http : / / <unk> / ash 
 At home , staying informed about volcanic activity , and having contingency plans in place for alternative shelter locations , constitutes good preparedness for an ash fall event . This can prevent some impacts associated with ash fall , reduce the effects , and increase the human capacity to cope with such events . A few items such as a flashlight , plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from ash ingress , and battery operated radios , are extremely useful during ash fall events . 
 The protection of infrastructure must also be considered within emergency preparedness . Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified , and all others should be shut down to reduce damage . It is also important to keep ash out of buildings , machinery and lifeline networks ( in particular water and wastewater systems , ) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles . Windows and doors should be closed and shuttered if possible , to prevent ingress of ash into buildings . 
 Communication plans should be made beforehand to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken . Spare parts and back @-@ up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible . Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites , before ash fall occurs , to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean @-@ up . Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean @-@ up teams in advance of ash fall events . 
 Some effective techniques for the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus , and actions to mitigate or limit damage . The latter include covering of openings such as : air and water intakes , aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events . Roads may be closed to allow clean @-@ up of ash falls , or speed restrictions may be put in place , in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall . To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks , drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system . Ash can be moistened ( but not saturated ) by sprinkling with water , to prevent <unk> of ash and to aid clean @-@ up . <unk> of clean @-@ up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean @-@ up efforts also constitute good management practice . 
 = = Volcanic ash soils = = 
 Volcanic ash 's primary use is that of a soil <unk> . Once the minerals in ash are washed into the soil by rain or other natural processes , it mixes with the soil to create an <unk> layer . This layer is highly rich in nutrients and is very good for agricultural use ; the presence of lush forests on volcanic islands is often as a result of trees growing and flourishing in the Phosphorus and Nitrogen @-@ rich <unk> .

 = Dutch 1913 battleship proposal = 
 A Dutch proposal to build new battleships was originally tendered in 1912 , after years of concern over the expansion of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station . Only four coastal defense ships were planned , but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer ( lower house of the parliament ) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for the Nederlands @-@ Indië ( Netherlands East Indies , abbr . NEI ) , so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912 . 
 The Royal Commission reported in August 1913 . It recommended that the Koninklijke Marine ( Royal Navy ) acquire nine dreadnought @-@ type battleships to protect the NEI from attack and help guarantee the country 's neutrality in Europe . Five of these would be based in the colony , while the other four would operate out of the Netherlands . Seven foreign companies submitted designs for the contract ; naval historians believe that a 26 @,@ 850 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 27 @,@ 280 tonnes ) ship , whose design was submitted by the German firm Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft , would have been eventually selected . 
 The Royal Commission 's proposal led to a debate between senior officers in the Navy and the Koninklijke <unk> ( Royal Army ) over how to best protect the NEI , and the question of how the cost of the ships should be split between the Netherlands and the NEI also was not settled until July 1914 . After considering the recommendations , the Dutch Government decided to acquire four battleships , and a bill seeking funding for them was introduced into the Dutch parliament in August 1914 . However , this was withdrawn following the outbreak of the First World War that month . A new royal commission into Dutch defense needs held after the war did not recommend that battleships be procured and none were ever ordered . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the early years of the 20th century , the Dutch became concerned about their ability to defend their colonial empire in the NEI from foreign aggressors . Fears of an eventual Japanese attack developed following the total defeat of the Russian Pacific and Baltic Fleets in the Russo – Japanese War . Moreover , the withdrawal of most of the British China Station 's warships in 1905 meant that there was no credible force in the Pacific to deter the Imperial Japanese Navy , which had been victorious over the Russians and was building powerful cruisers armed with 300 mm ( 12 in ) guns . 
 At the time , the Dutch naval force in the NEI , the Dutch Squadron in the East Indies , was widely seen as inadequate . It comprised a small number of destroyers , ironclads and armored cruisers , most of which were not battle @-@ worthy . In response to the perceived threat of Japanese attack , the Dutch laid down a coastal defense ship , De Zeven <unk> , and eight destroyers of the Wolf class , while beginning plans for other ships . In addition , a submarine for the colony was approved in 1911 . Four coast defense ships were projected in one of the two major bills to come before the House of Representatives in 1912 . Specifications for these ships included an armament of four 280 @-@ mm ( 11 @-@ inch ) and ten 102 @-@ mm ( 4 @-@ inch ) guns and three torpedo tubes and they would have been armored with a belt of 152 @-@ mm ( 6 @-@ inch ) and turret armor of 203 mm ( 8 inches ) . Two triple @-@ expansion engines generating 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower would drive the ships through the water at 18 knots ( 21 mph ; 33 km / h ) . One ship of this design was very close to being authorized in 1912 , but it was felt by experts and the House of Representatives that the Netherlands would be better served by constructing dreadnoughts of a type similar to the Spanish España class . Further plans for coast @-@ defense ships were shelved pending the findings of a Royal Commission , formed on 5 June 1912 . Its goal was to assess the steps needed to improve the defenses of the East Indies . 
 Meanwhile , in September 1912 the Navy Minister , Hendrikus Colijn , contacted the German firm Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft and asked them to prepare a design for dreadnought battleships suited to the NEI . Germaniawerft submitted their design to the Royal Netherlands Navy on 25 September 1912 . The proposed ships were generally similar to the German Kaiser class , but with eight 343 mm ( 13 @.@ 5 in ) L / 50 guns in four turrets mounted en echelon rather than ten 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns in five turrets , and two <unk> mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) medium guns . The proposed Dutch ships were 1 knot ( 1 @.@ 9 km / h ) faster and had a longer range , at the expense of lighter armor protection , similar to that used in contemporary German battlecruisers . By the time the design was proposed the Dutch authorities had decided that mounting the armament en echelon was inferior to superfiring turrets , and asked Germaniawerft to submit a revised design incorporating this armament , enhanced ammunition storage and other minor improvements . 
 = = Proposal = = 
 The Royal Commission handed its findings and recommendations to the government in August 1913 . It concluded that international relations were deteriorating in the Pacific and there was an increased risk of the NEI becoming involved in a war between western and Asian powers . As a result , the Commission argued that the Netherlands should develop a powerful fleet of warships to enforce Dutch neutrality and offer a credible defense should any nation attack the NEI or the home country itself . The Commission was very specific in its call for nine dreadnoughts , stating that they should be ships of 20 @,@ 668 long tons ( 23 @,@ 148 short tons ; 21 @,@ 000 t ) , possessing a speed of 21 knots ( 24 mph ; 39 km / h ) , and mounting eight 340 mm ( 13 in ) guns , sixteen 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) , and twelve 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns . It was also recommended that the fleet include six 1 @,@ 200 long tons ( 1 @,@ 300 short tons ; 1 @,@ 200 t ) " torpedo cruisers " — believed by Conway 's to be closer to large destroyers — eight 500 long tons ( 560 short tons ; 510 t ) destroyers ( a role which would be filled by the <unk> class ) , eight torpedo boats ( also already completed , though they were old ) , eight large submarines and two large minelayers . This ambitious plan was estimated to cost nearly <unk> each year for the next 35 ( until 1949 ) , adding up to about <unk> ; this would triple the Navy 's budget . The Commission recommended that the cost of the fleet be partially offset by reducing the size of the Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger ( Royal Dutch East Indies Army ) as the Navy would provide a stronger defense from attack than the Army could . 
 The requirement for nine battleships was determined by the defense needs of both the Netherlands and NEI . The Commission recommended that four battleships be active at all times in the NEI , with a fifth ship held in reserve there . The remaining four battleships would be based in the Netherlands . Ships sent to the NEI would return to Europe after twelve years in the tropics and complete another eight years service before being scrapped . 
 The Dutch Navy would need a significant manpower expansion of 2 @,@ 800 sailors to crew all of the proposed battleships . The Commission believed that it was unlikely that sufficient Dutch citizens would volunteer , and that as a result Indonesian sailors should be recruited and trained for service in the NEI . Strong segregation between white and Indonesian sailors was to be maintained to the maximum extent practical for unit efficiency . 
 One member of the Commission , the chief accountant of the Ministry of Finance , A. van <unk> , objected to the report 's conclusions . He provided a note to Queen Wilhelmina , which argued that advocates of building large warships had forced their views on the other members of the commission . Moreover , he believed that the proposed fleet would be inadequate given the rapid naval expansion being undertaken by the major powers , and that if it was adopted there would be a requirement to buy further dreadnoughts in order to keep pace . This note was included as an appendix to the Commission 's report . 
 The Royal Commission 's proposals were extensively debated . Hendrick van Kol , who was one of the leaders of the Social Democratic Workers ' Party , argued that building up a strong fleet would hinder Dutch neutrality by making it impossible to avoid battle with foreign fleets which passed through NEI waters en route to other destinations . Other critics of the plan believed that it would be unwise for the Netherlands to join the naval arms race which was taking place in Europe at the time , and that competition between the major powers meant that none of them would allow another nation to occupy either the Netherlands or the NEI . The Dutch Army also opposed the development of a strong fleet in the NEI , arguing that a land force centered on Java would be better able to mount a prolonged resistance against a large invasion force and that reducing the size of the Army to fund the fleet would leave it unable to suppress insurrections . The Governor @-@ General of the NEI , Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg , argued that both a stronger Army and Navy were necessary , and advocated for seven battleships to be stationed in the Indies . He believed that the cost of this alternative could be managed by reducing the planned battleship force in European waters to three small ships . Other supporters of the proposal , led by the Onze Vloot ( " Our Fleet " ) naval advocacy association , argued that it was necessary to build a strong fleet which was capable of defending the NEI as the loss of the colonial empire would greatly damage the Dutch economy and reduce the country 's prestige . The Dutch Naval staff also debated the relative merits of torpedo boats and battleships , and concluded that while small craft and submarines were suitable for defending the Netherlands , large warships were needed to effectively protect the sprawling East Indies . 
 After considering the Royal Commission 's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships . All the ships were to be permanently stationed in the NEI , and none would be used in European waters . The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission , however . Idenburg opposed this decision , and unsuccessfully argued for at least a fifth battleship to be built . In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about to order the first ship , and that it would be paid for by a loan borne by NEI . 
 = = Design = = 
 Germaniawerft submitted a revised battleship design ( designated Project No. 753 ) to the Dutch Navy on 4 March 1913 , well before the Royal Commission reported back to the Government . As requested , the new design mounted its main armament in superfiring turrets . Other changes included an increase in the number of 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns to sixteen , a 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ) faster maximum speed , different armor protection , replacement of two of the side @-@ launching torpedo tubes with a single stern tube and an increase in the number of rounds carried for each gun from 60 to 100 for the main armament and 100 to 150 for the medium guns . The new design also had a single funnel and a tripod mast that supported a director tower . Displacement was increased from 19 @,@ 535 tons to 20 @,@ 040 tons . Germaniawerft submitted a modified version of this design later in the year which increased the ships ' displacement to 20 @,@ 700 tons and substituted eight 343 mm ( 13 @.@ 5 inch ) L / 45 guns mounted in two quadruple turrets which were better protected than the four double turrets in the Project No. 753 proposal . This design was not accepted , however . 
 A meeting chaired by the Navy Minister , Jean Jacques <unk> , was held on 10 November 1913 to finalize the battleships ' specifications . It was decided that the ships would be armed with eight 343 mm ( 13 @.@ 5 inch ) L / 45 guns in four superfiring turrets mounted on the centerline , a secondary armament of sixteen 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) and twelve 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 9 inch ) guns and at least two , possibly four , 533 mm ( 21 inch ) side @-@ launching submerged torpedo tubes and a single stern torpedo tube . The ships were to have a speed of at least 21 knots ( 39 km / h ) and an endurance of more than 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 300 km ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) . They would be propelled by oil @-@ fired boilers powering turbines and three or four propeller shafts . Armor protection would comprise a main belt at least 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 inches ) thick and at least 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 inches ) over the gun turrets and conning tower . A crew of 110 officers and petty officers and 750 ratings was envisioned , and designers were permitted to reduce the armor protection at ships ' bow and stern to save weight for improvements to crew living conditions if necessary . 
 On 13 March 1914 the Dutch Government altered the battleships ' specifications to require a displacement of 25 @,@ 000 tons , main armament of 356 mm ( 14 inch ) guns , speed of 22 knots ( 25 mph ; 41 km / h ) and endurance of 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 900 mi ; 11 @,@ 000 km ) . The specified speed was faster than normal for contemporary battleships and their belt armor protection was relatively thin . These characteristics were meant to aid the ships in fighting on the Java Sea ; with the good visibility common in that area , naval battles could — and most likely would — be fought at a longer range than would be feasible in other areas like the North Sea , meaning that more shells would strike the deck rather than the belt . 
 Eleven firms or groups of firms were invited to tender to build the ships , with proposals due on 4 June 1914 . Proposals were received from seven firms ; Germaniawerft , Blohm & Voss , AG Vulcan in cooperation with Bethlehem Steel and AG Weser from Germany as well as the British firms Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co , Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company and Vickers . It is believed that Armstrong submitted at least five different designs . As Dutch shipyards lacked the capability to build large battleships , the ships would have been constructed abroad . 
 The proposal from Germaniawerft ( designated Project No. 806 ) is regarded by both Conway 's and historian Anthonie van Dijk as being the most likely to have been selected . This design envisioned 24 @,@ 605 long ton ships with a length of 184 meters ( 604 ft ) , beam of 28 meters ( 92 ft ) and draft of 9 meters ( 30 ft ) . The main armament of eight 356 mm guns was to be mounted in four superfiring turrets , while the sixteen 150 mm guns would be placed in casemates about 6 meters ( 20 ft ) above the waterline . Their machinery would include six double @-@ ended boilers and one single @-@ ended boiler and three turbine sets were to drive three propeller shafts . Armor would have included a belt of 250 mm amidships and 150 mm to fore and aft . Germaniawerft reserved the right to subcontract Blohm & Voss to build some of the ships and offered a delivery time for the first ship of 28 months following the date the order was made . 
 Other major proposals included the ones from Blohm & Voss and Vickers . While both included the same armament as Germania , the former design had a smaller displacement — 26 @,@ 055 long tons ( 26 @,@ 473 metric tons ) versus 28 @,@ 033 long tons ( 28 @,@ 483 t ) — and devoted a greater amount of weight to protection : 8 @,@ 974 long tons ( 9 @,@ 118 t , 34 @.@ 8 % of the displacement ) , versus 8 @,@ 820 long tons ( 8 @,@ 960 t , 31 @.@ 77 % ) . Blohm & Voss ' design included a belt starting at 150 mm in the bow , increasing to 250 mm , then tapering to 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in the stern . It would have been powered by six double @-@ ended coal boilers with oil burners alongside . These boilers would have generated 38 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( shp ) to drive four propellers , giving the ships a maximum speed of 22 knots ( 25 mph ; 41 km / h ) . Only one rudder would have been fitted . The Vickers design had a shorter belt of 250 mm amidships , and would have used 15 boilers with oil burners to provide 34 @,@ 000 shp and the same 22 knots .

 = = Debate over costs = = 
 There was an extensive debate over how to divide the cost of the proposed fleet between the Netherlands and NEI . The members of the Royal Commission were split on this question ; while a minority preferred an equal division , the majority wanted the NEI to pay most of the costs . The public debate on this issue was centered on the questions of who should pay for the ships and who would make the greatest profits from the NEI remaining under Dutch rule . Arguments against the NEI paying for the ships included that the resources required were needed to fund economic and social development and that the cost of the ships would increase opposition to Dutch rule , thereby worsening the security situation in the East Indies . Some critics of the plan also argued that it was unreasonable to expect the Dutch subjects in the NEI pay for ships intended to prolong colonial rule . In contrast , Onze Vloot published pamphlets which claimed that Dutch rule was seen as beneficial in the NEI , and that both white and native residents of the islands would be willing to pay for the ships as they were necessary to guarantee its continuation . These pamphlets also argued that the cost of the ships was modest compared to the NEI 's economic output . 
 In order to avoid a confrontation over the naval budget , the Dutch Government postponed parliamentary discussions of the Royal Commission 's recommendations during 1913 and early 1914 . By this time Onze Vloot 's campaign in support of the fleet had gained considerable momentum . In late 1913 the Government accepted an offer made by representatives of the Dutch business community to contribute 120 @,@ 000 guilders towards the cost of a second battleship once parliament approved funding for the first ship . Despite this , the Government continued to delay submitting a plan for the defense of the NEI to parliament , though work continued on it . The main difficulty remained the question of how to pay for the fleet . The Minister of the Colonies , Thomas B. <unk> , believed that the NEI 's population needed to be sheltered from the cost of the ships to the extent possible so that funding for welfare projects was not reduced or taxes increased from what were already high levels . In 1914 he settled on a plan under which the necessary revenue would be raised through increasing the taxes on export duties and freight moved by privately owned railways and ships . 
 A bill setting out arrangements for funding and building the fleet was finalized in mid @-@ July 1914 . At this time the Navy had not yet settled on a final battleship design . It was planned that the first ship 's keel would be laid in December 1914 and fitting out be completed sometime in 1918 . The bill was not immediately introduced into parliament , however , as Idenburg was given until 10 August to comment on it . The outbreak of the First World War led to the bill being withdrawn due to the uncertain international circumstances and the impossibility of buying battleships from foreign shipbuilders in wartime . Instead , the Government ordered three Java @-@ class cruisers in 1915 , though only two were completed . 
 A new Royal Commission into the defense of the Netherlands and NEI was held during 1920 and 1921 . This Commission did not recommend that any battleships be constructed ; instead it proposed that all ships under construction as at 31 December be completed along with a further two cruisers , 12 destroyers and 16 submarines . This plan was considered unaffordable , however , especially given the strength of the disarmament movement internationally . A Navy Bill to fund a reduced version of the Royal Commission 's proposal was introduced to parliament in November 1921 , but was eventually defeated by a single vote in October 1923 . Renewed Dutch concerns over Japanese aggression in the late 1930s led to a proposal to build three Design 1047 battlecruisers for service in the NEI , but construction of these ships had not begun when the Netherlands was overrun by German forces in May 1940 . 
 = Whippet = 
 The Whippet ( also English Whippet or Snap dog ) is a dog breed of medium @-@ size . They are a sighthound breed that originated in England , where they descended from greyhounds . Whippets today still strongly resemble a smaller greyhound . Shown in the Hound group , Whippets have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia . Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing , agility , and flyball . 
 Whippets were originally greyhounds that were deemed unsuitable for hunting because of their size . They were returned to their peasant breeders after being maimed so that they could not be used to hunt and break the Forest law . These maimed dogs were bred together and used to catch rats , and hunt rabbits . When the Forest law was repealed , these " miniature greyhounds " became popular in the sport of dog racing . This has led to Whippets being described as " the poor man 's racehorse . " They are still frequently used as racing dogs today , as they have the highest running speed of breeds their weight : 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) and even challenge greyhounds for top speed . Whippets are , however , the fastest accelerating dog in the world . 
 = = History = = 
 Whippets were bred to hunt by sight , coursing game in open areas at high speeds . One can find numerous representations of small greyhound @-@ like hounds in art dating back to Ancient Egyptian times . Pharaohs bred a small sighthound dog related to the greyhound to keep in their palaces , and this dog may be the ancestor of today 's Whippets . In medieval England , a small greyhound breed became popular for use as a ratting dog . The first written English use of the word whippet with regard to a type of dog was in 1610 . However , the first dog to be called a Whippet was actually a greyhound @-@ spaniel cross and has little to do with the modern Whippet . 
 The original whippets were thought to be English Greyhounds that were too small for stag hunting in the forests of England . These dogs were frequently returned to their breeders , who were usually peasants and as such could not own hunting dogs under the Forest law . Because of this , dogs returned to them were maimed , usually by cutting a tendon in a leg or removing the toes on one paw . The breeders kept these dogs and continued to breed them , producing a smaller version of a greyhound that was suited for rat catching and hunting hares and rabbits . When the Forest Law was repealed , the " small greyhounds " became immensely popular . Whippets were then commonly known as " snap dogs " for their tendency to " snap up " nearby prey . In the picture by Jean @-@ Baptiste Oudry ( 1686 – 1755 ) of two dogs presented to Louis XV , they are either whippets or small greyhounds , but are probably related to an early form of whippet . Oudry also painted a second painting of <unk> with a different , non @-@ sighthound dog . There is a 1758 painting by Pompeo <unk> entitled Portrait of Charles Compton , 7th Earl of Northampton which features a similar whippet @-@ like dog . 
 In the nineteenth century , Whippet racing was a major sport in England . The Whippet was held in high regard in the northern parts of England and Wales , but was generally disregarded in the rest of the country . At the time , there were two varieties of Whippet . The first type had a smooth coat , was more popular in Lancashire , Yorkshire , and the Midlands , and became the modern Whippet . The other had a rough coat from crossbreeding with Bedlington Terriers , was more popular in Durham and Northumberland and was frequently referred to as a " rabbit dog " . Early specimens were taken from the race track by the dog fanciers of the time and exported around the world . John Taylor said that " In all the shapes and forms of <unk> ; of all which there are but two sorts that are useful to man 's profits , which two are the <unk> and the little <unk> , whippet , or house @-@ <unk> ; all the rest are for pleasure and recreation . " 
 The age of the modern Whippet dawned in 1891 when The Kennel Club granted the breed official recognition , thus making the Whippet eligible for competition in dog shows , and commencing the recording of their pedigrees . In the United States , the Whippet was recognised in 1888 by the American Kennel Club . Whippets arrived in the United States with mill operators from England , and the first populations were established in Massachusetts . The Whippet is the 55th most popular breed according to the American Kennel Club . 
 In 1964 , Ch . Courtenay <unk> of Pennyworth won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show . In 1992 , <unk> Dutch Gold won best in show at Crufts , and a Whippet known as <unk> Call the Tune won in 2004 . In 2011 , <unk> . <unk> 's Chanel , a female Whippet , was chosen as the hound Show Dog of the Year by the Westminster Kennel Club . 
 = = Racing = = 
 Dog racing was originally an extension of hare coursing . Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid @-@ nineteenth century . The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as ' <unk> ' , and dogs who participated were said to be ' trained to the rag ' . Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip , who was frequently also the race judge . The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time , and they would race towards their owners , who were standing at the opposite end of the track waving towels . 
 Whippet rags were a popular Sunday event in the north and Midlands at the time . There were also international events ; in Australia , at a track known as Gurney 's Paddock , there were races of more than 300 whippets every Saturday , and three nights a week at the White City track . Eventually , the sport evolved and dogs were divided into four groups : those who hunted rabbits , which was not governed by rules ; those who coursed hare , for which a set of rules was established ; those trained to the rag ; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to greyhound races . Few of the Whippets of any of the four types were purebred , as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races . Many racing dogs were part terrier , part Greyhound , or part Lurcher . 
 In 1967 , the British Whippet Racing Association was established to bring around reform and consistency in race rules and procedures for races involving non @-@ purebred Whippets . A year later , viewing the non @-@ purebred dogs as a threat , the Whippet Club Racing Association was established exclusively for purebred animals .

 = = = Appearance = = = 
 Whippets are a medium @-@ sized dog weighing from 15 to 42 pounds ( 6 @.@ 8 to 19 @.@ 1 kg ) . There are two height ranges for Whippets , depending on whether or not the dog is being shown in North America . The Fédération Cynologique Internationale and The Kennel Club both call for heights of 18 @.@ 5 to 20 inches ( 47 to 51 cm ) for males and 17 @.@ 5 to 18 @.@ 5 inches ( 44 to 47 cm ) for females . Whippets tend to be somewhat larger in the United States and Canada as the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club standards are larger ; 18 @.@ 5 to 22 @.@ 5 inches ( 47 to 57 cm ) for males , and 17 @.@ 5 to 21 @.@ 5 inches ( 44 to 55 cm ) for females . Because colour is considered immaterial in judging Whippets , they come in a wide variety of colours and marking patterns , everything from solid black to solid white , with red , fawn , brindle , blue , or cream . The coat is short , smooth and close . 
 They are the fastest dog of their weight , capable of achieving speeds of 35 miles per hour ( 56 km / h ) . This is due to their unique way of running , which is referred to as a double suspension gallop . This gait results in four of the dog 's legs being off the ground twice in each stride , once when the legs are completely extended and again when they are tucked under the body . 
 = = = Temperament = = = 
 Whippets are quiet and not prone to barking , but require regular exercise . They are generally gentle dogs and may be content to spend much of the day resting . The AKC describes them as " quiet and dignified in their owner 's living room " and says they make " excellent house dogs . " Whippets have been called a " poor man 's racehorse " by the colliers in Lancashire and Yorkshire . 
 Despite being bred for racing , Whippets can be couch potatoes . When not running around , they are usually asleep or <unk> in their owner 's lap . They are not prone to fighting but have been known to chase small pets , due to their sighthound nature . They also have a tendency to get up on furniture . Whippets are touch sensitive , meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly . 
 = = Health = = 
 Whippets course , work , and race ; they have been bred for these jobs for years . This has kept them a structurally sound breed which is predominantly free from the physical exaggerations that can lead to certain health problems . Whippets are , like other sighthounds , intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics . This is in part due to their low concentration of body fat and their liver 's inability to metabolise the anaesthetics . 
 Given proper nutrition , exercise , and veterinary care , most Whippets live for 12 to 15 years . A UK breed survey puts the median lifespan at 12 years 10 months . They are generally healthy , and are not prone to the frequent ear infections , skin allergies , or digestive problems that can afflict other breeds . Genetic eye defects , though quite rare , have been noted in the breed . Because of this , the American Whippet Club recommends that breeders test for this defect in their breeding stock . Hip dysplasia is rare in Whippets , with only 1 @.@ 2 % of 161 evaluations performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals being determined as <unk> . 
 The heart of a Whippet is large and slow beating , often being <unk> or even intermittent when the animal is at rest . This sometimes causes concern to the owner , or to the vet not experienced with the breed . Whippets will , however , demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise . In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets . 
 A 2007 study identified a myostatin mutation particular to Whippets that is significantly associated with their athletic performance . Whippets with a single copy of this mutation are generally very fast ; those with two copies have disproportionately large musculature and are known as " bully whippets " . These bully whippets experience no significant health problems beyond those experienced by a normal whippet , but may be more prone to muscle cramping . The mutation has not been seen in Greyhounds or other sighthound breeds , or in heavily muscled dogs such as <unk> , Bulldogs , Rottweilers or American Staffordshire Terriers . 
 = Chilean battleship Capitán Prat = 
 Capitán Prat was a unique ironclad battleship of the Chilean Navy built in the late 1880s and completed in 1890 . Armed with a main battery of four 9 @.@ 4 in ( 240 mm ) guns in four single turrets , Capitán Prat was the first battleship in the world to be equipped with an electrical system . She was built in the La Seyne dockyard in France , and commissioned into the Chilean fleet in 1891 . Foreign navies tried to purchase the ship twice before the outbreak of wars , including an American attempt in 1898 and a Japanese offer in 1903 . 
 Capitán Prat served in the fleet for about ten years , until she was disarmed in accordance with a treaty signed with Argentina intended to stop a naval arms race between the two countries . The ship returned to service , however , and remained on active duty with the fleet until 1926 , when she was reduced to a coastal defense ship . In 1928 – 1930 , she was used as a submarine tender , and in 1935 , she was disarmed and used as a training ship for engineers . She remained in the Navy 's inventory until 1942 , when she was sold for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Capitán Prat was 328 feet ( 100 m ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 60 ft 8 in ( 18 @.@ 49 m ) . She displaced 6 @,@ 901 metric tons ( 6 @,@ 792 long tons ; 7 @,@ 607 short tons ) and had a draft of 22 ft 10 in ( 6 @.@ 96 m ) . Her hull was steel @-@ built , with wood and copper sheathing , and was equipped with a ram bow . The ship mounted two masts , both with fighting tops . She had a crew of 480 officers and enlisted men . 
 She was powered by a pair of horizontal expansion engines that were supplied with steam by five cylindrical boilers . The boilers were trunked into two funnels on the centerline . Her propulsion system was rated at 12 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 900 kW ) for a top speed of 18 @.@ 3 kn ( 33 @.@ 9 km / h ; 21 @.@ 1 mph ) . She was designed to carry 400 t ( 390 long tons ; 440 short tons ) of coal , though she could carry up to 1 @,@ 100 t ( 1 @,@ 100 long tons ; 1 @,@ 200 short tons ) . She was the first battleship of any navy to utilize electricity to power machinery . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of four 9 @.@ 4 in ( 240 mm ) / 35 caliber guns in single , electrically powered turrets . One was placed forward , on the centerline , two were mounted amidships , and the fourth was located aft of the superstructure on the centerline . Her secondary battery consisted of eight 4 @.@ 7 in ( 120 mm ) guns in four twin turrets ; they were mounted on either side of the foremast and mainmast . Close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of six 6 @-@ pounder guns , four 3 @-@ pounder guns , and ten 1 @-@ pounder guns . She was also armed with four 18 in ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes in deck @-@ mounted launchers . One was in the bow , another in the stern , and two on the broadside . 
 The ship 's armor consisted of Creusot steel . Her armored belt was 11 @.@ 8 in ( 300 mm ) thick amidships above the waterline , and 7 @.@ 8 in ( 200 mm ) below . Above the waterline , the belt was reduced to 4 @.@ 9 in ( 120 mm ) forward and 5 @.@ 9 in ( 150 mm ) aft . The belt was 3 @.@ 9 in ( 99 mm ) below the waterline , on either end of the ship . The belt extended for 2 ft 4 in ( 0 @.@ 71 m ) above the waterline and 4 ft 7 in ( 1 @.@ 40 m ) below . The citadel was 3 @.@ 1 in ( 79 mm ) thick and protected the ship 's machinery spaces amidships . It extended to the upper deck and was closed on either ends by bulkheads 3 @.@ 1 in ( 79 mm ) thick . Outside the citadel , the deck was protected by 2 in ( 51 mm ) thick armor . The barbettes for the main battery guns were 8 to 10 @.@ 8 in ( 200 to 270 mm ) thick , with 2 in ( 51 mm ) thick hoods to protect the gun crews . The conning tower had 10 @.@ 5 in ( 270 mm ) thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 On 22 August 1887 , the National Congress of Chile passed a law authorizing the construction of new vessels to modernize the fleet . As part of this , they decided to order a new battleship from a foreign shipyard . The contract for constructing the new Chilean battleship was <unk> throughout the European shipyards , and was sought by British , German , and French shipbuilders . The contract for Capitán Prat was awarded to the Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée shipyard in La Seyne , France on 18 April 1889 . The cost of the ship was agreed at £ 391 @,@ 000 , and she was laid down in 1889 . The ship was launched on 20 December 1890 , commissioned into the Chilean fleet in 1891 , and arrived in Chile in May 1893 . Capitán Prat received favorable reviews from contemporary naval critics , as she was seen as a prime example of combining a high speed with good armament and armor protection . She was also heralded as " the most powerful war ship possessed by any South American Government [ sic ] ... [ and ] any vessel at present in commission in the United States Navy . " 
 The construction of the ship helped begin a naval arms race between Chile and Argentina . In addition to Capitán Prat , the Chilean Navy ordered two new protected cruisers and a pair of torpedo boats . Argentina responded with the battleships Independencia and Libertad . The race continued through the 1890s , even after the expensive 1891 Chilean Civil War . The race culminated in the orders for two armored cruisers for the Argentine Navy and two Constitución @-@ class battleships for the Chilean Navy , though the latter two were purchased by the United Kingdom . The British , concerned over the possibility of war between the two countries , mediated an agreement , which resulted in the <unk> de Mayo . The treaty ended the expensive arms race and stipulated that both countries arrive at an agreement to balance their fleets . The latter led to the demilitarization of Capitán Prat and two Argentine armored cruisers , though all were later rearmed . 
 In March 1898 , shortly before the outbreak of the Spanish – American War , the US Navy attempted to purchase Capitán Prat to bolster its fleet for the coming conflict with Spain . The negotiations fell through , however , and the ship remained in Chile . By 1903 , in the prelude to the Russo @-@ Japanese War , the Japanese government looked into purchasing Capitán Prat and the cruiser Esmeralda , along with other South American warships . Esmeralda was eventually purchased and commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Izumi . By 1907 , the ship was seen as outmoded in comparison to newer armored cruisers in the fleet . In 1909 – 1910 , the ship was modernized , which included the installation of twelve new Babcock & Wilcox watertube boilers in place of the old cylindrical boilers , increasing the ship 's top speed to 19 @.@ 5 kn ( 22 @.@ 4 mph ; 36 @.@ 1 km / h ) . The height of her funnels was also increased . 
 On 11 March 1916 , Capitán Prat suffered a magazine explosion while she was anchored in port in Valparaiso . Two cases of bad cordite propellant in the aft main battery magazine exploded . The construction of the ship , however , which provided a quick venting of the explosion , and defects in the propellant cases that allowed the explosive gasses to escape easily , saved the ship from destruction . The cordite was by that time 17 to 20 years old , about the maximum life @-@ span of the propellant . By 1926 , Capitán Prat was reduced to a coast defense ship . From 1928 to 1930 , the ship was designated as a submarine tender for Chile 's H and Capitan O 'Brien @-@ class submarines . She was disarmed in 1935 to serve with the mechanical training school . The old battleship was ultimately sold for scrap in 1942 .

It was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti , an Italian sculptor whose works were popular with European royals and the nobility , though often less well regarded by critics and the artistic establishment . The statue was first produced in clay and displayed at The Great Exhibition in 1851 , where it was located outside the west entrance to the Crystal Palace . It was well received at the time and two years later Queen Victoria and Prince Albert headed a list of illustrious subscribers to a fund that aimed to raise money for the casting of the statue in bronze . 
 Although the money was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally completed in 1856 , a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years . The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition . This prompted opposition , as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry 's newly completed Palace of Westminster . Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached that it would be placed in Old Palace Yard , Marochetti 's preferred location . It was installed in October 1860 , though it was not until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas @-@ reliefs on either side of the pedestal . 
 The quality of the statue 's workmanship caused problems during its first half @-@ century ; the horse 's tail fell off the day after it was installed at the Great Exhibition , and forty years after its installation it was discovered to be riddled with holes and to have never been properly attached to its pedestal . It narrowly escaped destruction during the Second World War when a German bomb dropped during the Blitz landed a few metres away and peppered it with shrapnel . The pedestal and the horse 's tail were damaged and Richard 's sword was bent by the blast . In 2009 , the Parliamentary authorities undertook a project to conserve and restore the statue .

 The statue was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti and is located in Old Palace Yard outside the Palace of Westminster , opposite Westminster Abbey in London . With its pedestal , it stands 9 metres ( 30 ft ) high , showing King Richard I on horseback . The king is depicted wearing a crowned helmet and a chainmail shirt with a surcoat , and lifting a sword into the air . The horse paws the ground , as if preparing for a charge into battle . Marochetti described his work as being inspired by Richard I rather than accurately depicting a 12th @-@ century knight . 
 It stands on a granite pedestal also designed by Marochetti and made by Freeman & Co. of Penryn , Cornwall . Bas @-@ relief panels showing Crusaders fighting the Saracens at the Battle of Ascalon and Richard on his deathbed pardoning Bertran de Born , the archer who fatally shot him in 1199 , were added to the east and west sides of the pedestal in 1866 – 67 . As the statue cannot be accessed by the general public – the area around it is used as the House of Lords car park – the west @-@ side scene showing Richard and Bertran is the only one visible from the street . According to Marochetti , the two bas @-@ reliefs were designed in the style of Lorenzo Ghiberti 's doors at the Florence Baptistry . Bronze letters on the front of the pedestal bear the inscription <unk> I <unk> DE LION / 1189 – 1199 .

 = = = Creation and display at the Great Exhibition = = = 
 Marochetti was born in Italy and was ennobled by the Kingdom of Sardinia but lived and worked in France , creating a number of prestigious works for the royalist French government in the 1830s . He made his name by creating equestrian statues ; one , of the Duke of Wellington , was erected in Glasgow in 1840 . By the 1840s , however , his popularity in continental Europe was in decline . The French Revolution of 1848 , which saw the final overthrow of the French monarchy , prompted him to resettle in London and seek new patrons among the British elite . 
 Marochetti was not popular with the Victorian artistic establishment ; Punch referred to him derisively as " Count <unk> " , while John Timbs wrote that he " owed more of his success in life to royal and noble patrons than artistic merit . " It was certainly true that he benefited from the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . His courtly manners impressed Victoria on their first meeting in 1849 , and soon afterwards he became involved with the Prince Consort 's plans for what became The Great Exhibition of 1851 . Several countries planned to display sculptures of romantic historical figures in their contributions to the exhibition . The genre was common in mainland Europe but relatively rare in England at the time . Marochetti was probably aware that the Belgian sculptor Eugene Simonis intended to show his statue of Godfrey de Bouillon , the leader of the First Crusade , which King Leopold I of Belgium had commissioned . The two men had a number of connections ; they shared the same bronze founder , Soyer of Paris , and Simonis was influenced by Marochetti 's earlier acclaimed statue of the Duke of Savoy , Emanuele Filiberto . The Italian sculptor was probably motivated by a sense of competition with the Belgian in designing his Richard I. 
 Marochetti 's creation of the clay model of the statue involved not only the sculptor himself but also the painter Victor <unk> , King Louis Philippe 's personal physician Henri <unk> de <unk> and the singers Mario and Garcia , all of whom contributed manual input . A clay model of the statue was displayed as one of two statues positioned outside the western entrance of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park . Unfortunately it was so poorly assembled that shortly after the opening of the exhibition on 1 May 1851 , the horse 's tail fell off . It was repaired and the statue eventually attracted critical acclaim . The art critic John Ruskin said of the model , " it will tend more to educate the public with respect to art than anything we have done for centuries " . It came to be regarded as one of the more popular items in the exhibition and Prince Albert personally took King Leopold to see it and the statue by Simonis , which now stands in the Grand Place of Brussels . The Art Journal was later to describe it as " unquestionably a vigorous and spirited example of the bravura class of sculpture . " 
 = = = Casting and dispute over location = = = 
 Major General Charles Richard Fox proposed during the exhibition that a bronze cast should be made of the statue to serve as a memorial to the exhibition , marking one end of the site of the Crystal Palace with a statue of Prince Albert at the other end . A campaign got underway two years later , in May 1853 , with a variety of the great and the good signing a brochure promoting a scheme to erect the statue somewhere in London . Its supporters included the Duke of Sutherland , Lord Lansdowne , the Earl of Shaftesbury , the sculptor John Henry Foley , the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray , the ceramic manufacturer William Taylor Copeland and the Conservative MP ( and future Prime Minister ) Benjamin Disraeli . The Times was strongly in favour of the project due to the influence of its foreign affairs reporter Henry Reeve , who had known Marochetti since as early as 1839 . The Royal Family also let it be known that they were supporters , with Queen Victoria donating £ 200 and Prince Albert £ 100 . 
 The future location of the statue was a contentious issue from the outset , with Fox 's proposal of a site in Hyde Park being sidelined in favour of leaving the site open for future consideration . The appropriateness of its theme in relation to the Great Exhibition was also questioned . The Art Journal pointed out the contradiction between " the effigy of a valiant crusader " and " the great Peace congress of 1851 " and asked why " a foreign sculptor alone " was being selected to commemorate a British exhibition . The Lord Mayor of London , Thomas Challis , was similarly critical , declaring that the statue depicted " muscular power and the almost savage ferocity of war ... , while ... the Great Exhibition afforded an example of the cordial amity of nations . " His criticism was perhaps not unrelated to the fact that he was promoting a rival scheme to commemorate the Exhibition . Others criticised the statue 's lack of realism . As The Times observed after the statue 's installation , the sculptor " sacrificed probabilities in the close fit he has given to Richard 's mail shirt , which is made to display the swelling biceps and folded mass of pectoral muscle as accurately as a knitted woollen jersey . " 
 Despite the criticism , £ 5 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to £ 456 @,@ 000 today ) was raised by private donations for a bronze version to be created . Parliament subsequently agreed to contribute £ 1 @,@ 650 for the pedestal and a further £ 1 @,@ 500 for two bas @-@ reliefs to be installed on its sides . In 1854 a plaster version was placed in New Palace Yard facing west outside Westminster Hall , but Charles Barry , the architect of the palace , was opposed to its placement there . The Art Journal criticised the New Palace Yard location on the grounds that the statue was merely a novelty and , worse , depicted an unworthy subject – " a disobedient son and a bad governor " . It also suffered from being lost against the architectural details of the Palace of Westminster . By early May 1854 , the plaster statue had been removed . 
 In 1856 , Marochetti had the statue cast in bronze at the workshop that he had established in the early 1850s in Sydney Mews , off Fulham Road . The casting and the statue 's gifting to the nation in the summer of 1856 made the question of its location all the more essential to resolve . Other sites were considered , including outside Buckingham Palace , Carlton Gardens near the Horse Guards and even on top of Marble Arch . Prince Albert himself suggested locating it outside the west entrance of Westminster Abbey , looking down the newly created Victoria Street . Punch mocked the ongoing search for a location in an August 1857 issue , calling Richard I " the Wandering Statue of London " . The anonymous writer asked whether " no @-@ one [ will ] find standing @-@ room for this fugitive king ? Is there no spot , no royal mews , no academic stable where his over @-@ driven steed can be taken in to bait ? " 
 Marochetti proposed to install it in Old Palace Yard outside the south window of Westminster Hall . His idea was considered by the Fine Arts Commission for the Palace of Westminster and was deemed acceptable , although Sir Charles Barry again opposed it . His reasoning was that Old Palace Yard was " too limited in area , and too irregular and unsymmetrical in its form and approaches , to give due effect to it , as a work of art ... " For his part , Marochetti positively preferred the location 's irregularity to the symmetry of a formally laid @-@ out square . The dispute continued until 1859 when the Commissioner of Works , Lord John Manners , finally agreed to install the statue in Marochetti 's favoured location . By this time Sir Charles Barry was seriously ill ( and died on 12 May 1860 ) so was no longer in a position to offer opposition . 
 = = = Installation and subsequent history = = = 
 Parliament voted to fund a pedestal for the statue , carved from Cornish granite , but transportation delays meant that it was not until 26 October 1860 that the statue was placed on its pedestal and unveiled to the public . It was completely undecorated at first but a bronze shield was placed on the front end of the pedestal shortly after the installation . The Times ( probably its pro @-@ Marochetti reporter Henry Reeve ) declared that with the installation of the statue " a great reproach had been removed from London " , which now finally had a great equestrian monument which displayed a " combination of life and picturesqueness " . It claimed that Marochetti 's Richard I ranked " with the few great statues of that class in Europe " . Not all critics were as fulsome ; the British critic and poet Francis Turner Palgrave castigated it as " an essentially vulgar and low @-@ class work precisely on the grounds that call forth the wonder of uncultivated spectators . " It was said to have been particularly appreciated by London 's <unk> , who tethered their horses nearby . 
 Marochetti also intended to add bas @-@ reliefs to either side of the pedestal and had provisioned it with " sunk panels " ready for the reliefs to be installed . He proposed to create four " alto <unk> in the style of the <unk> doors on the <unk> at Florence " , depicting the coronation of Richard in Westminster Abbey , the taking of Ascalon , Richard as a prisoner of the Saracens and Richard on his deathbed . He quoted £ 2 @,@ 500 for all four , but Parliament voted instead to grant him £ 1 @,@ 500 for two scenes – Ascalon and the death of Richard . 
 Marochetti accepted the commission and created plaster models of the reliefs . He installed one of the models in his château in France , where it remains today , while the other was set into the wall of a gardener 's cottage adjoining his French estate . The bronze relief of the deathbed scene was added to the pedestal in August 1866 , while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867 . The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament , created by John Cross , that depicted the same subject . 
 Marochetti also pursued an abortive project to install a second giant equestrian statue in Old Palace Yard , this time portraying Edward , the Black Prince . He envisaged the two statues facing each other on either side of the entrance to the House of Lords . Although the scheme was reported in several journals , including the Illustrated London News , the Art Journal and the Athenaeum , and was strongly criticised for its perceived thematic inappropriateness , nothing came of it . Three different versions of the model for Marochetti 's Black Prince came to light at the turn of the 21st century . They appear to have been designed at the same time as his Richard I , demonstrating their common origins ; models of the two statues almost certainly would have co @-@ existed in his workshop and Marochetti probably intended to seek a commission from Prince Albert . However , the death of the Prince Consort in 1861 deprived him of his most influential patron , and Marochetti 's own death was to follow in 1867 . Queen Victoria purchased one of Marochetti 's statuette versions of the Black Prince following the sculptor 's death and gave it to her son Edward , Prince of Wales . It is still part of the Royal Collection . 
 The statue has required repair work on several occasions to fix damage and defects . Only a few months after it was installed , it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind . Marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary . During the winter of 1908 – 09 , frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part of the statue . It was found that between 60 – 80 leaks were letting water into the interior of the statue and causing further damage when it froze . It was also discovered that the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under its own weight on the two ends of its base . Repair work took place to remedy these problems . 
 The statue was damaged during the Second World War when a large German bomb hit Old Palace Yard on 26 September 1940 , during the Blitz . The bomb exploded only a few metres away from the statue and reportedly lifted it bodily off the ground . The upper part of the sword was bent and the tail of the horse suffered several holes from pieces of shrapnel . Vincent Massey , the High Commissioner for Canada , argued that the sword should be left unrepaired , as it symbolised " the strength of democracy which will bend but not break under attack . " The sword was replaced in 1947 , and other repair work was also done . However , damage to the pedestal can still be seen . The statue received Grade II listed status in February 1970 . 
 In the summer of 2009 , the Parliamentary authorities undertook a three @-@ week conservation project to repair and restore the statue . It consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old coating of black wax , <unk> the bronze surface to return it to its original colour and treating it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements . The bas reliefs on the pedestal were also cleaned and treated , as was the pedestal itself . 
 = Banksia scabrella = 
 Banksia scabrella , commonly known as the Burma Road Banksia , is a species of woody shrub in the genus Banksia . It is classified in the series Abietinae , a group of several species of shrubs with small round or oval inflorescences . It occurs in a number of isolated populations south of Geraldton , Western Australia , with the largest population being south and east of Mount Adams . Found on sandy soils in heathland or shrubland , it grows to 2 m ( 7 ft ) high and 3 m ( 10 ft ) across with fine needle @-@ like leaves . Appearing in spring and summer , the inflorescences are round to oval in shape and tan to cream with purple styles . Banksia scabrella is killed by fire and regenerates by seed . 
 Originally collected in 1966 , Banksia scabrella was one of several species previously considered to be forms of Banksia sphaerocarpa , before it was finally described by banksia expert Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus . Like many members of the Abietinae , it is rarely seen in cultivation ; however , it has been described as having horticultural potential . 
 = = Description = = 
 Banksia scabrella grows as a low shrub to 2 m ( 7 ft ) in height and 3 m ( 10 ft ) across , with a spreading habit . Its lateral branches are low and often rest on the ground . The small linear leaves measure 0 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 8 cm in length and 0 @.@ 1 cm in width and are crowded along the stems . George recorded flowering as occurring in spring and summer ( September to January ) , but The Banksia Atlas recorded the species in bloom in April . Flowers occur in " flower spikes " , or inflorescences , made up of hundreds of small flowers , or florets , densely packed around a woody axis . Quite conspicuous , they are terminal ( occurring on the ends of branches ) or on short side branchlets . Round or oval in shape , the cream or tan inflorescences are 3 to 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) high and 7 – 9 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 6 in ) wide . The individual flowers are light yellow or cream , with the styles and upper floral parts purple . The perianths measure 2 @.@ 7 to 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) , while the pistils 3 @.@ 4 to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 8 in ) in length and are curved at the apex . The inflorescences fade to grey as they age and the old flowers do not fall off . Up to 80 follicles develop on one spike , and remain closed until opened after a bushfire .

 = = Taxonomy = = 
 First collected on 4 September 1966 , southeast of Walkaway , Banksia scabrella was described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus Banksia . He gave it the epithet scabrella , a diminutive of the Latin adjective scaber " rough " , referring to the leaves . George placed B. scabrella in subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike , section Oncostylis because its styles are hooked , and the resurrected series Abietinae , which he constrained to contain only round @-@ fruited species . He initially thought its closest relative to be Banksia leptophylla , which is found in the same region , and later felt it to be B. lanata , which has similarly coloured inflorescences but longer smooth leaves . It was one of several new species previously regarded as a form of Banksia sphaerocarpa . 
 In 1996 , botanists Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics . They retained George 's subgenera and many of his series , but discarded his sections . Banksia ser . Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic , and so retained . It further resolved into four subclades , so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries . Banksia scabrella appeared in the third of these , initially called the " telmatiaea clade " for its most basal member . As with George 's classification , B. lanata and two subspecies of B. leptophylla emerged as close relatives of B. scabrella , but there was some question over the relationships between all five forms in the clade . 
 This clade became the basis for a new subseries <unk> , which Thiele defined as containing species with " <unk> and <unk> common bracts on the infructescence axes " , and seedling stems which were densely <unk> ( covered in fine hair ) . Thiele and Ladiges ' arrangement was not accepted by George , and was largely discarded by him in his 1999 arrangement . B. ser . Abietinae was restored to George 's 1981 circumscription , and all of Thiele and Ladiges ' subseries were abandoned . The placement of B. scabrella in George 's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows : 
 Banksia 
 B. subg . Banksia 
 B. sect . Banksia ( 9 series , 50 species , 9 subspecies , 3 varieties ) 
 B. sect . Coccinea ( 1 species ) 
 B. sect . Oncostylis 
 B. ser . Abietinae 
 B. sphaerocarpa ( 3 varieties ) 
 B. micrantha 
 B. grossa 
 B. telmatiaea 
 B. leptophylla ( 2 varieties ) 
 B. lanata 
 B. scabrella 
 B. violacea 
 B. incana 
 B. laricina 
 B. pulchella 
 B. meisneri ( 2 subspecies ) 
 B. nutans ( 2 varieties ) 
 A 2002 study by American botanists Austin Mast and Tom Givnish concurred with Alex George 's observations in that molecular analysis mapped out scabrella as one of a clade containing B. lanata , both subspecies of B. leptophylla and B. telmatiaea , with B. grossa as a more distant relative . Early in 2007 , Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it , and publishing B. subg . Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons . They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete ; in the meantime , if Mast and Thiele 's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement , then B. scabrella is placed in B. subg . Spathulatae . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Banksia scabrella is found in two disjunct areas of scattered populations ; the first discovered being southeast of the small town of Walkaway south of Geraldton , while a more populous cluster is found southeast of Mount Adams in Western Australia . The average annual rainfall over its range is around 450 mm ( 18 in ) . It has been placed on the Declared Rare and Priority Flora List , where it is classified as a " Priority Four – Rare " taxon ; although it is rare , it is not currently threatened by any identifiable factors . These taxa require monitoring every 5 to 10 years . Many stands are populous , and number over 100 plants . However , over half the known population of Banksia scabrella is found on road verges . Found in deep pale yellow or white sand in kwongan scrubland and heathland , Banksia scabrella grows on flat areas or gentle slopes and is found in association with B. leptophylla and a dwarf form of B. attenuata . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species , including B. scabrella , have proteoid roots , roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter . These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient @-@ poor soils , such as the phosphorus @-@ deficient native soils of Australia . B. scabrella is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback . 
 Killed by fire , the species regenerates from seed afterwards . The resultant seedlings have been recorded flowering two or three years after bushfires , although records are few . No pollinators were recorded during observations for the Banksia Atlas , although banksia flowerheads in general play host to a variety of birds , mammals and insects . 
 The region between Geraldton and Gingin is a rich one for Abietinae banksias , and nine species occur there . Despite this , there is little overlap in range and habitat ; Banksia scabrella is unusual in its co @-@ occurrence with B. leptophylla . It is also associated with the endangered heath shrub Leucopogon marginatus . Burma Road Nature Reserve is one of the few protected conservation areas in its range ; there , Banksia scabrella is found most commonly in ( and forms a prominent part of ) a mallee <unk> , which is dominated by the cord rush <unk> <unk> as a ground cover , and the mallee Eucalyptus <unk> as an emergent species . It is found occasionally in acacia scrub @-@ heath , and rarely in acacia thickets and banksia woodland . An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow , depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Seeds do not require any treatment , and take 14 to 16 days to germinate . Rarely cultivated , Banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years from seed . Information is limited on its reliability , but it has been grown successfully in South Australia . It is fast @-@ growing but ultimately untidy in habit , and would benefit from regular pruning . Some forms in the wild have a more compact habit , and are more promising for horticulture . 
 = Dangerous ( Michael Jackson song ) = 
 " Dangerous " is a pop song by African American recording artist Michael Jackson . The song appeared as the fourteenth and final track on Jackson 's solo studio album of the same name , released in November 1991 . Written and composed by Jackson , Bill Bottrell and Teddy Riley , the song was planned as the tenth single from the album , set for a January 1994 release . However , these plans were canceled due to allegations of child sexual abuse which were made against Jackson in August 1993 , Jackson 's health concerns , and the failure of the previous single , " Gone Too Soon " . 
 Prior to the planned release of the song , " Dangerous " received a positive reaction from contemporary critics in reviews of the track 's parent album . Although the song has not been released as a single , " Dangerous " entered music charts in mid @-@ 2009 after Jackson 's death in June . Jackson also performed the song live . In 1994 , songwriter Crystal Cartier alleged that Jackson , Bottrell and Riley had plagiarized " Dangerous " . At the subsequent court hearing the judge ruled in favor of Jackson , Bottrell and Riley , due to lack of evidence ; Cartier was refused the right to appeal her case . 
 Near the end of Dangerous : The Short Films , the song is played over footage of various performances during his Dangerous World Tour . 
 = = Background = = 
 " Dangerous " was developed from another song titled " Streetwalker " , which Jackson wrote for his 1987 Bad album . During recording sessions in September 1990 for Dangerous , Jackson recorded a 6 : 40 minute demo of " Dangerous " , which he wrote with Bill Bottrell . Teddy Riley later added writing and produced it with Jackson in early 1991 . According to music commentator Nelson George the demo is " very different to the final version . Here the keyboards are spacey , in strong contrast to the taunt , mechanical rhythm track . Throughout the song , Jackson keeps up a spoken word rap about the dangerous woman who is this song 's subject . Overall it is much moodier " . The demo was released in November 2004 , on The Ultimate Collection . A different , longer version also exists , with Jackson heard screaming at the beginning — after a sound protection wall fell on him as he was about to record . " The genesis of the songs we co @-@ wrote [ for Dangerous ] " , said Bottrell , " consisted of Jackson humming melodies and grooves , and him then leaving the studio while I developed these ideas with a bunch of drum machines and samplers " . " Dangerous " is played in the key of D minor with Jackson 's vocal range being from <unk> to B5 . The song 's tempo is moderate at 113 beats per minute . The song 's chorus has the same melody as that of Jam , another song from the Dangerous album , albeit at a slightly slower tempo .

 In 1994 , songwriter Crystal Cartier accused Jackson , Bottrell and Riley of plagiarizing the song . Cartier claimed she had written , copyrighted and recorded the song in 1985 . At a court hearing , Jackson testified that " Dangerous " grew out of a song called " Streetwalker " , which he co @-@ wrote with Bottrell in 1985 . His original demo version of the song was played in court . The recordings were followed by a cappella performances of " Dangerous " and " Billie Jean " , giving a rare insight into his songwriting habits . As Cartier was unable to supply any original tapes to back up her suit , the judge found in Jackson 's favour , and Cartier was refused the right to appeal . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Although the song was not released as a single , the live performances of " Dangerous " remained a staple of Jackson 's concerts since the third leg of the Dangerous Tour . " Dangerous " was a song that involved group choreography , similar to " Smooth Criminal " , which also appears as part of the mix in later performances . There were five live performance versions of " Dangerous " , although Jackson nearly always <unk> this song : 
 The first was performed on the final leg of the Dangerous Tour and at the 1993 American Music Awards . This version included Jackson singing the second verse , chorus , bridge , and third speaking interlude . 
 The second was performed from 1995 to 1997 , on some presentations like the 1995 MTV Music Awards , and during most of the concerts for the HIStory World Tour . It did not contain the second verse , bridge or third speaking interlude . This version samples an extract from " Owner of a Lonely Heart " by Yes , Ennio Morricone 's The Good , the Bad and the Ugly theme , " Smooth Criminal " , Janet Jackson 's " You Want This " and " Let 's Dance " , Judy Garland 's " Get Happy " , Monty Norman 's " James Bond Theme " , and a guitar intro from Duran Duran 's " A View to a Kill " . The HIStory Tour version contains slightly more sound effects during the breakdown ; Jackson spoke the rap in the beginning live during the concert in Ostend , Belgium on September 3 , 1997 . Dangerous was not performed on two concerts , the final concert in Tokyo and the concert in Manila . 
 The third was performed twice : during both 1999 Michael Jackson & Friends concerts . It is similar to the 1995 mix , but has clicking sound effects instead of the main drumbeat during the spoken part , and a short interlude with the dancers introducing themselves . 
 The fourth was performed twice on the 50th American Bandstand Special and President Clinton 's presidential gala in 2002 and is a variation of both the second and third version . There are clicking beats as with the 1999 mix , but only replacing the finger snaps in the beginning and the main beat begins as it does in the 1995 mix . In the American Bandstand performance Jackson briefly sang a section live . 
 The fifth was being rehearsed for his This Is It concerts in Staples Center and the Forum in L.A , but were cancelled because of his sudden death . Audio of this version leaked online in 2010 . It is similar to the 1999 mix , but in the beginning makes a combination between the clicking beats of 1999 mix and the finger snaps of 1995 mix . It features snippets of " Morphine " , " 2000 Watts " , " Heartbreak Hotel " , " Stranger in Moscow " , and the Psycho theme . In January 2011 , at the " Carnival Dance Showcase " , the This Is It concerts dancers performed a snippet of " Dangerous " as it would have been in the concerts , but without the leaked intro . 
 For the Michael Jackson and Friends concerts and on , Jackson wore a red shirt instead of the original white shirt and tie , but the tie was kept in . For all of the performances but the American Bandstand one , Michael would have an armband in his black jacket . 
 = = Planned release as a single and critical analysis = = 
 The album Dangerous was released in November 1991 , and with shipments of seven million copies in the United States and 32 million copies sold worldwide , it stands as one of the world 's best @-@ selling records . The album 's appeal and commercial success prompted Jackson 's record company to keep releasing singles throughout 1992 and 1993 , especially as Jackson was still promoting the album with a worldwide concert tour . However August 1993 saw intensifying media scrutiny surrounding allegations of child sexual abuse on Jackson 's part . The albums ninth single , " Gone Too Soon " , did not perform well in the United Kingdom and Jackson 's health deteriorated , which eventually led to the cancellation of the albums tenth single " Dangerous " but it was released with " Remember the Time " and " Black or White " on the box set Tour Souvenir Pack . An alternative version and a remix , entitled " Roger 's Rough Dub " , were both to be included on the expanded edition of Dangerous – the bonus disc was later canceled . 
 " Dangerous " was generally well received by contemporary music critics . Jon Pareles , a writer for The New York Times , called it " [ Jackson 's ] latest song about a predatory lover " and highlighted the lyrics " I felt taken by lust 's strange inhumanity , " observing , " He is a great dancer , yet his songs proclaim a terror of the body and of fleshly pleasures . " Music critic Nelson George said of the song , " [ it is ] a pile driving track ... that explodes from radio speakers . ' Dangerous ' in fact , opens another window into Michael 's artistic process . " Writer Barry Farber noted that the same lyrics " are an excellent representation of how sex can sometimes feel like a powerful biologically driven force . "

 Route 166 is a short , 3 @.@ 73 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 00 km ) state highway in Ocean County , New Jersey . The route provides an alternate alignment of U.S. Route 9 through South Toms River and Toms River . The southern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 northbound in Beachwood , where it heads northward along Atlantic City Boulevard . The route continues until ending where U.S. Route 9 leaves the Parkway north of Toms River . US 9 itself uses the Garden State Parkway to bypass Toms River . 
 Route 166 is a former alignment of New Jersey Route 4 , designated in 1920 and U.S. Route 9 , designated in 1927 through Toms River . The highways were realigned when the Garden State Parkway was built , and the original alignment became U.S. Route 9 Alternate in the 1950s , which was eventually replaced with Route 166 . The alignment has remained the same since .

 Route 166 begins at an interchange with U.S. Route 9 northbound ( Atlantic City Boulevard ) in the community of South Toms River . The route heads northward along the right @-@ of @-@ way of Atlantic City Boulevard , progressing northward along residential homes . Paralleling to the north of U.S. Route 9 , Route 166 continues , passing a war memorial in the southern portion of the business district . In the center of the community , the highway intersects with Ocean County Route 621 ( Admiral Avenue ) . There , Route 166 turns to the northeast , running along the shoreline for the Atlantic Ocean . Heading past a marina , the highway crosses on a four @-@ lane bridge over the ocean and into Toms River . 
 After landing down on the Toms River side , Route 166 heads to the northwest , intersecting with the incomplete <unk> Boulevard . The highway turns off its right @-@ of @-@ way , and crosses another branch into the center of Toms River . Passing the Riverfront Landing , Route 166 intersects with the eastern / southern terminus of County Route 527 ( Water Street ) . The highway continues northward along commercial buildings as Main Street , passing to the west of Toms River High School and back into the residential districts . Route 166 continues northbound to an interchange with New Jersey Route 37 ( Little League World Champions Boulevard ) in Toms River . At the interchange , Route 166 switches names from Main Street to Lakewood Road , which heads northwestward . 
 Route 166 , after changing monikers , continues northwestward through the commercial and industrial portions of Toms River , intersecting with several local and county roads until a fork with Ocean County Route 623 , where the highway forks at Riverside Cemetery . A short distance later , the highway begins a split parallel with the Garden State Parkway and U.S. Route 9 to the east . Route 166 then leaves the commercial and industrial districts for the residential ones soon later , crossing through several developments including Colonial Gardens . The highway continues northward , intersecting with Albert Avenue , where it returns to the commercial area . After an intersection with Briar Knoll , Route 166 divides , approaching Interchange 83 on the Garden State Parkway , where the designation terminates . The right @-@ of @-@ way continues northward as U.S. Route 9 . 
 = = History = = 
 The alignment of Route 166 was originally part of Route 4 prior to 1927 , designated from Absecon to Rahway . This designation remained in place for seven years , until the 1927 state highway renumbering , which remained part of an extended Route 4 . A year prior to the state highway renumbering , the alignment of Route 4 was also co @-@ designated as part of U.S. Route 9 , which had been assigned as part of a nationwide system . Route 4 remained intact <unk> with Route 9 until the state highway renumbering on January 1 , 1953 . On that day , Route 4 was truncated back to Fort Lee in Bergen County , and the alignment became only U.S. Route 9 . A bypass was built of the Route 9 alignment in the 1950s along with construction of the Garden State Parkway , which was completed soon after . The route currently Route 166 became U.S. Route 9 Alternate by 1954 , remaining for several years , when it was decommissioned in place for Route 166 . The route has remained intact since .

The band were finishing their studio album Radio Africa when Hill approached them requesting for input regarding the song . The producer left the band alone to make additions to the track and returned hours later to listen to it . Giving little reaction after hearing it , Hill expressed interest in recording " everything I 'd heard here " and told the band that they would hear from him later . 
 On 26 April , the Fédération Internationale de Football Association ( FIFA ) announced that " Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) " would serve as the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup , which was to begin in South Africa later in June , and would also appear on Listen Up !

 = = Composition = = 
 A pop song , " Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) " draws inspiration from traditional African music and blends an African Colombian rhythm with a Soca @-@ influenced beat . It contains instrumentation from a Southern African guitar . The chorus of the song and the words " waka waka " are borrowed from " <unk> , " a 1986 song recorded by Cameroonian band Golden Sounds , which was a hit not only across Africa but also in Shakira 's native country , Colombia . According to Debora Halbert , author of the book The State of Copyright : The Complex Relationships of Cultural Creation in a <unk> World , Golden Sounds are not the original creators of the chorus too , since it has been adapted from " military marches of unknown origins that go back as far as World War II . " 
 The lyrics of " Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) " compare football ( soccer ) players to soldiers on a battlefield and encourage them to fight for their goals . Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music Chart Blog described them to be " about an undisclosed event which is about to happen for Africa , in which everyone gets together and enjoys the fruits of their hard work , even though there have been many hardships along the way . " The Spanish version of the song does not contain a war metaphor and instead " talks about walls coming down . "

 FIFA 's decision to choose " Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) " as the official song was negatively received by South African people , who felt Shakira was not the " right person to represent the country 's first World Cup , " arguing that an African artist should have been assigned the role . South African musicians were also displeased regarding the lack of native acts scheduled to perform at the FIFA World Cup Kick @-@ Off Celebration Concert on 10 June 2010 . They expressed anger towards the South African Football Association ( SAFA ) for letting international artists like Alicia Keys , the Black Eyed Peas , and Shakira to headline the event . Subsequently , the Creative Workers Union of South Africa planned a demonstration to be held on 15 April , but called it off after SAFA announced that the repertoire of performing acts would be finalised after " consultation with fans and host cities . " Danny <unk> , head of the South African World Cup Organising Committee and president of SAFA , released a statement assuring that " the incredibly talented South African and African music industry will play a major part in the tournament 's off @-@ field success and character . " Freshlyground 's violinist Kyla @-@ Rose Smith defended FIFA 's decision to select " Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) " as the official song , saying : " I think that the World Cup is a global event but it ’ s also a business , a huge marketing exercise . FIFA requires a musician of a certain global reach to appeal to all the different kinds of people who are involved and witness and watch the World Cup . So I understand the choice of someone like Shakira . " 
 The " waka waka " riff of the song also generated controversy . In June 2010 , it was reported that Dominican musician <unk> Vargas had decided to file a lawsuit against Shakira for plagiarising the riff off his composition " El Negro No <unk> " for a sum of $ 11 million , which was performed by Dominican group Las <unk> del Can . However , Vargas later directly addressed the issue and said he did not have any intention to sue Shakira , clarifying that he himself did not own the riff used in " El Negro No <unk> , " and that the prior statements made in his name were fabricated .

 Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music Chart Blog gave the song a four out of five rating and praised its welding of " undulating African guitars to a clod @-@ hopping , skippy township beat . " However , he felt the song did not seem to be about the World Cup and could " just as easily be about a global effort to build water @-@ pipes in the worst drought @-@ ridden areas of the continental land @-@ mass . " Robert Copsey from Digital Spy rated it three out of five stars , favouring its " ludicrously catchy " chorus , although he commented : " Somewhat inevitably , ' Waka Waka ( This Time For Africa ) ' sees Shak [ ira ] replace her usual kooky lyrics with lines that wouldn 't sound out of place on an X Factor winner 's song . " Kyle Anderson from MTV picked " Waka Waka ( This Time for Africa ) " as the best official World Cup song , calling it a " funky , inspirational tune . " Canada.com critic Stuart <unk> , however , was highly critical of the song and called it " sonic vomit " and " perhaps the stupidest official song for any major sporting event ever . "

 = Eleanor Sophia Smith = 
 Eleanor Sophia Smith ( 15 June 1858 – 30 June 1942 ) was an American composer and music educator . She was one of the founders of Chicago 's Hull House Music School , and headed its music department from 1893 to 1936 . 
 Born into a musical family , Smith taught herself to play the piano and later became a classically trained musician . Earning a teaching degree , she began publishing music compositions for children using the philosophy of Friedrich Fröbel , advocating for less memorization and drilling and more attention to intuitive appreciation of music . Studying composition and voice in Germany , she also toured the country observing choirs and their teaching techniques . 
 Returning to the United States in 1890 , Smith began working at the settlement house , Hull House , as a music instructor . Within three years she had co @-@ founded the Hull House Music School , a school which followed her progressive teaching ideas , cross @-@ training students in vocal music as well as instruments . Simultaneously , she worked in several institutions in the Chicago area which trained music educators . 
 Smith published numerous compilations of songs , including two six @-@ volume textbook series , which were widely used throughout the United States . Most of her writings were focused on children 's voices and contained short songs written with attention paid to the limited range and short attention span of children . Many of her compositions were still being used in music education programs in the latter part of the 20th century . 
 = = Early years and education = = 
 Born in Atlanta , Illinois in 1858 , Eleanor was the daughter of Willard Newton and Matilda ( <unk> ) Smith . She came from a musical family , as her father was a noted bass in the First Presbyterian Church Choir in Chicago between 1860 and 1871 . In an interview she gave in 1908 , Smith claimed that both sides of her family were musical , noting that a paternal great @-@ grandfather composed hymns and that her maternal line was a musical mix of Danish , French , German and Jewish ancestry . Smith taught herself to play the piano and did not begin any formal training for voice or composition until she was eighteen years old . She had very poor vision , which limited her ability to use her eyes for long periods of time . She studied at the Hershey School of Musical Art , and published her first cantata , " The Golden Asp " , while still a student there . She later graduated from Cook County Normal School , but continued to study music privately as a pupil of Frances A. Root ( voice ) and Frederick Grant Gleason ( composition ) . 
 = = Career = = 
 After completing her schooling , Smith commenced teaching at the Cook County Normal School for a few years , before moving to Germany to continue her studies . She went to Berlin in 1887 , where she studied with Moritz Moszkowski ( composition ) , Julius Hey ( voice ) and Ludwig Bussler for three years . While she was in Germany , she traveled through the country observing choirs where she could obtain permission to do so . In some instances , she was not allowed to observe or be seen , as her presence was deemed improper in groups made up of only male performers or students . While in Berlin , she and friends discussed the benefits of teaching where students were cross @-@ trained in both piano and voice , which would be advantageous to both . Such study would prevent pianists from losing the melodic focus and being overly technical and singers would gain technique rather than focusing solely on performance . As early as 1885 , she was publishing songs and collaborating with poets for lyrics , including such works as " Cradle Song " , " A Million Little Diamonds " , " Only Thine Own Mine Art " , " The Quest " and " She Kisses with her Eyes " . Smith gained a reputation as a songwriter by the early 1890s and many of her works were translated into German during this period . She also wrote hymns , though they may have remained in manuscript . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Smith began publishing for children in 1887 , with her first volume of children 's music entitled Songs for Little Children , Part 1 . She was a proponent and follower of the teaching philosophy of Friedrich Fröbel . Smith incorporated Fröbel 's ideas that childhood is a universal experience in which children learn by imitation , using their natural abilities . Her compositions also recognized that children learn by movement and play , but have limited attention spans . Thus , the compositions she created were usually short melodies , with limited vocal ranges , and were easy to sing . The songs were in major keys , typically C , F , and G and extended only from C1 to F2 . Most melodies were made in stepped triads and provided pauses for activity . For example , in her song " The Wind Mill " there is an eight measure rest for the children to make the motions of the turning blades . 
 In 1894 , after Smith returned from Germany , she published her second volume Songs for Little Children , Part 2 . As in her previous work , most of the songs were in major keys with the most common being A @-@ flat major and E @-@ flat major . Second , third , fourth and fifth intervals were typical in her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns . In this volume , most of the compositions were Smith 's own work , though some of the pieces were adaptations of German folk songs . 
 Smith 's first textbook series , The Modem Music Series , in six volumes was published in 1898 by Scott , Foresman and Company , with rights later purchased by the Silver Burdette Company . It was a collaboration with Robert Foresman , another music educator who believed that children should be allowed to learn intuitively . It set forth a new movement in music instruction which rejected the traditional sight singing memorization method of training and instead relied on the " song method " . In this type of instruction , students learned the skills for reading music from a combination of interval recognition , ear training and observation of songs . The books were successful , using many of Smith 's own songs and became the basis for similar textbooks based on her ideas and works , such as the publication in 1909 by Charles H. Congdon called the Congdon Music Readers series , which incorporated 21 songs by Smith . Smith published a second textbook series , The Eleanor Smith Music Series , in 1908 , which also contained six volumes and was widely distributed in US public schools . 
 In 1910 , Smith published Songs of a Little Child ’ s Day , which included 66 songs of original compositions by Smith and text by Emilie Poulsson . The songs focused on a limited range to make it easy for high @-@ pitched children 's voices to sing the works and most of the songs contained sixteen bars or less . Accompaniment lines for the piano , duplicated the vocal lines , but had artistic flourishes , such as a section in the piece " The Busy Wind " , which used a repetitive pattern of sixteenth notes to imitate the sound of blowing wind . In honor of the 25th anniversary of Hull House , in 1915 , five of Smith 's compositions were published as The Hull @-@ House Songs . The themes represented social issues which were prevalent at the time including " The Land of the Noonday Night " about mining safety , the " Suffrage Song " about women 's voting , and " The Shadow Child " about child labor with words penned by poet , Harriet Monroe . As early as 1901 , she had written compositions for poems with social themes , such as the work she created for Morris Rosenfeld 's poem " Sweat Shop " . Other works Smith authored include : " Song Pictures " ; " Twelve Songs for Twelve Boys " ; " The Golden Asp " ( cantata ) ; " Wedding Music " ( No. 1 and No. 2 ) ; " Trolls ' Holiday " ( operetta ) ; and " Twelve Songs " . Her works continued to be popular into the 1980s , attesting to the quality of their composition .

 Smith arrived at Hull House in the autumn of 1890 and shortly after her first visit began to give voice and piano lessons to both children and adults . Initially free concerts were given on Sunday , both as a means to uplift the community and to highlight the talents of the settlement house teachers and musicians . Between November 1891 and April 1892 , there were 22 Sunday concerts held at Hull House before the music school was officially founded . Smith was one of the founders of Hull House Music School the following year , which became the first settlement music school in the United States . She invited one of her friends from Germany , Amalie <unk> , who had been teaching piano at the Klindworth Conservatory to help her with the school . <unk> taught both piano and voice at the school until 1898 . Mary <unk> Smith , one of the benefactors of Hull House provided the funding to establish the school . 
 In the late 1890s , Jane Addams and Smith had a disagreement over Hull House 's Sunday concerts . Smith , a classically trained musician , felt that the purpose of the events should be to present educationally challenging programs . Addams , felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered . A compromise was finally reached at the turn of the decade , with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal , and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material . The disagreement over content was serious enough to lead to Smith 's resignation in 1901 . Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content , she was able to persuade Smith to remain . 
 Smith 's teaching style differed from conventional music instruction at the time in that she required instrumental students to study voice . Piano , organ and violin instruction was offered by 1907 . Organ was under the instruction of Gertrude Madeira Smith , Eleanor 's sister , and violin was taught by Charles <unk> of the Chicago Orchestra . Five assistants also helped the teachers . Smith felt that adding vocal training gave a level of experience that was neglected by singular focus on memorization of scales and structural drills usually prevalent for those learning instruments . She also incorporated songs from the students ' homelands as a way to intermingle their old cultures with their new lives and made effort to involve the parents in the development of the curricula . As a progressive reformer , Smith advocated that inclusive diversity was a means of building a cosmopolitan citizenry united by pursuit of music excellence . She also encouraged students to compose music from their earliest instruction and to recover songs from their cultural backgrounds . 
 As well as teaching music at Hull House , Smith served as the choral director . She also composed songs and arranged music specifically for her students to perform . She initiated an annual Christmas concert which also included a dramatic presentation and was eagerly anticipated by the neighborhood for its holiday pageantry . Under her direction of the music school , the Hull House Boy 's Band developed , which included immigrant boys from the neighborhood who would later become noted jazz performers . Jazz pianist Art Hodes recalled that one of the first jam sessions he ever had occurred when a young clarinetist named Benny Goodman joined the Boy 's Band . James Petrillo , who would later become the leader of the musician 's union , the American Federation of Musicians , was also a member of the group . 
 In addition to her work at Hull House , Smith was involved in public education . Francis Wayland Parker invited her to head the vocal music department at the Chicago Normal School in 1897 and she was asked by John Dewey to teach at the University of Chicago as the head of the Department of Music , School of Education from 1901 to 1910 . She not only trained teachers for Dewey but assisted him in developing a revised curriculum for the music education program . Smith also instructed courses at the Chicago Kindergarten College and at the Froebel Kindergarten College , both training colleges for teachers of very young children .

 Smith favored women 's suffrage , and was an Episcopalian by religion . She was a member of the Chicago Woman 's Club , <unk> Country Club , North Side Branch Equal Suffrage League , and the Audubon Society . In 1897 , she moved into the settlement house and lived there until 1924 . At that time , she lived in the home of Mary <unk> Smith , where she remained until around 1934 . Smith returned to Hull House as a resident until she retired in 1936 , and was succeeded by her sister , Gertrude . For health reasons , at that time , Smith moved to Midland , Michigan , where she resided with a niece until her death on June 30 , 1942 in Midland . She was buried in Annapolis , Maryland . 
 Posthumously , Smith 's papers were donated to the University of Illinois at Chicago to preserve what Jane Addams described as " one of the most finely creative minds " which " fulfilled the highest mission of music " .

 = Stefan Lochner = 
 Stefan Lochner ( the Dombild Master or Master Stefan ) ( c . 1410 – 1451 ) was a German painter working in the late " soft style " of the International Gothic . His paintings combine that era 's tendency towards long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism , virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance . Based in Cologne , a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe , Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer . Extant works include single panel oil paintings , devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts , which often feature fanciful and dark blue winged angels . Today some thirty @-@ seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence . 
 Less is known of his life . Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south @-@ west Germany around 1410 , and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries . Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death . We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III , a major city occasion . Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city . Thereafter he seems to have over @-@ extended his finances and fallen into debt . Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there , apart from the records of creditors , mention of Stephan Lochner ends ; it is presumed he died that year , aged around 40 . 
 Lochner 's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th century art during the early 19th century romantic period . Despite extensive historical research , attribution remains difficult ; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the notname the Dombild Master , a name taken from the Dombild Altarpiece ( in English cathedral picture , also known as the Altarpiece of the City 's Patron Saints ) still in Cologne Cathedral . One of Dürer 's diary entries became key , 400 years later , in the 20th century establishment of Lochner 's identity . Only two attributed works are dated , and none are signed . His influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial . Apart from the many direct copies made in the later 15th century , echoes of his panels can be seen in works by Rogier van der Weyden and Hans Memling . Lochner 's work was praised by Friedrich Schlegel and Goethe for its qualities , especially the " sweetness and grace " of his Madonnas . 
 = = Identity and attribution = = 
 There are no signed paintings by Lochner , and his identity was not established until the 19th century . J. F. <unk> in an 1823 article identified the Dombild ( meaning " Cathedral picture " ) or Altarpiece of the City 's Patron Saints with a work mentioned in an account of a visit to Cologne in 1520 in the diary of Albrecht Dürer . The notoriously thrifty artist paid 5 silver pfennig to see an altarpiece by " Maister Steffan " some seventy years after Lochner 's death . Although Dürer fails to mention specifically which of Maister Steffan 's panels he had seen , his description matches exactly the centre panel of the Dombild Altarpiece . The altarpiece is referred to in a number of other records . It was repaired and re @-@ gilded in 1568 , and mentioned in Georg Braun 's <unk> Orbis Terrarum in 1572 . 
 German Gothic art underwent a revival in the early 19th century Romantic period , when the work was seen as a climax of the late Gothic period . The German philosopher and critic Friedrich Schlegel was instrumental in reviving Lochner 's reputation . He wrote lengthy tracts comparing the Dombild favourably to the work of Raphael , and believed it exceeded anything by van Eyck , Dürer or Holbein . Later , Goethe was enthusiastic , emphasising Lochner 's German " spirit and origin " ; he described the Dombild as the " axis around which the ancient Netherlandish art resolves into the new " . 
 Lochner 's identity remained unknown for centuries , and no other known works were associated with the Dombild altarpiece . In 1816 Ferdinand Franz Wallraf identified him as Philipp Kalf , based on a reading of a name inscribed on the cloth of a figure on the right of the centre panel . He misinterpreted markings on the stone floor pictured in Annunciation to read 1410 , which he took as the year of completion . Johann <unk> Fiorillo discovered a 15th @-@ century record that read " in 1380 there was an excellent painter in Cologne called Wilhelm , who had no equal in his art and who depicted human beings as if they were alive " . In 1850 Johann Jakob Merlo identified " Maister Steffan " with the historical Stefan Lochner . 
 In 1862 , Gustav Waagen became one of the first art historians to try to place Lochner 's works in chronological order . His reasoning was based the assumption that Lochner developed from the early idealised forms usually associated with early 15th century Cologne , and later absorbed the techniques and realism of the Netherlandish painters . In this way he placed the lighter " gaiety " of Lochner 's Madonna paintings as from the beginning of his career , with the more stern and pessimistic crucifixions and doom panels at the end . Today , art historians believe the reverse to be true ; the dramatic and innovative polyptychs came first , and the single Madonnas and panels of saints are from his mid career . 
 Based on their similarity to the Altar of the City Patrons , art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner , although a number have questioned whether the diary entry was authentically made by Dürer . Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged , most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996 . In either case , the extent of Lochner 's direct hand , as opposed to those of workshop members or followers , is debated . Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451 , the year of his death . 
 = = Life = = 
 The outline of the historical Stefan Lochner 's life has been established from a small number of records , mostly relating to commissions , payments and property transfers . There are no documents relating to his early life , a contributing factor being the loss of archival records from his supposed birthplace during the French occupation of Cologne . 
 The primary sources relating to Lochner 's life are a June 1442 payment by the city of Cologne in relation to Friedreich 's visit ; deeds of 27 October 1442 and 28 August 1444 outlining the transfer of ownership of the house at <unk> ; October 1444 deeds for the purchase of two houses in st Alban ; his 24 June 1447 registration as a citizen of Cologne ; his December 1447 election to the municipal council ; his Christmas 1450 re @-@ election to that post ; an August 1451 correspondence with the city council ; a 22 September 1451 announcement of the setting up of a plague graveyard next to his property , and finally , court records dated 7 January 1452 detailing the appropriation of his property . 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Through threadbare clues and supposition , mostly centred around a relatively wealthy couple that perished during a plague , believed to be his parents , Lochner is thought to have come from Meersburg , near Lake Constance . Georg and <unk> Lochner were citizens and died there in 1451 . A " Stefan " is referred to as " Stefan Lochner of Constance " in two documents dated 1444 and 1448 . However , there is no archival evidence that he was there , and his style bears no trace of the art in that region . There are no further records of him or his family in the town except for a mention of <unk> ( a fairly uncommon name ) in the village of <unk> , two kilometers from Meersburg . 
 However records indicate that Lochner 's talent was recognised from an early age . He may have been of Netherlandish origin or worked there for a master , possibly Robert Campin . Lochner 's work seems influenced by Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden ; elements of their styles can be detected in the structure and colourisation of Lochner 's mature works , especially in his Last Judgment , although neither is thought to be the master with whom he studied . 
 = = = Move to Cologne and success = = = 
 By the 1440s , Cologne was the largest and wealthiest city in the Holy Roman Empire . It controlled and taxed the passage of trade from Flanders to Saxony , and became a financial , religious and artistic center . The city had a long tradition of producing high quality visual art , and in the 14th century its output was considered to be equal to that of Vienna and Prague . Cologne 's artists concentrated on more personal and intimate subject matters , and the area became known for its production of small panels of " great lyrical charm and loveliness , which reflected the deep devotion of the writings of the German mystics " . 
 During the 1430s , painting in Cologne had become conventional and somewhat old fashioned , and still under the influence of the courtly style of the Master of Saint Veronica , active until 1420 . After his arrival Lochner , who was earlier exposed to the Netherlandish painters and already working in oils , eclipsed other artists in the city . According to the art historian Emmy Wellesz , after Lochner 's arrival " painting in Cologne became infused with a new life " , perhaps enriched by the earlier exposure to the Netherlandish artists . He became widely celebrated as the most capable and modern painter in the city , where he was known as " Maister Steffan zu Cöln " . 
 Lochner first appears in extant records in 1442 , nine years before he died . He moved to Cologne where he received a commission from the city council for the provision of decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III . Lochner was seemingly well established and although other artists were involved in preparing for the event , he was responsible for the most important arrangements . The centrepiece seems to have been the Dombild Altarpiece , described by modern art historians as " the most important commission of the fifteenth century in Cologne " . He is recorded as having been paid forty marks and ten shillings for his effort . 
 Lochner bought a house with his wife Lysbeth around 1442 . Nothing else is known about her and the couple apparently had no children . In 1444 he acquired two larger properties , the " <unk> <unk> " , near Saint Alban Church , and the " <unk> Alden <unk> " . Historians have speculated whether these acquisitions indicate a need to house a growing group of assistants due to his rising commercial success . It is likely that he lived in one house and worked in the other . The purchases may have caused a strain ; in around 1447 he seems to have encountered financial difficulties , and he was forced to <unk> the homes . Second mortgages were taken out in 1448 . 
 = = = Plague and death = = = 
 In 1447 the local painter 's guild elected Lochner as their representative municipal councilor , or <unk> . The appointment implies that he had lived in Cologne since at least 1437 , as only those who had been living in the city for ten years could take up the position . He had not taken up citizenship immediately , possibly to avoid paying the 12 guilder fee . He was obliged to act as <unk> , and on 24 June 1447 he became a burgher of Cologne . The role of municipal councilor could only be held for a one @-@ year term , with two years vacated before reoccupation . Lochner was re @-@ elected for a second term in the winter of 1450 – 51 , but died in office . 
 There was an outbreak of plague in 1451 , and there are no surviving records of him after Christmas of that year . On 16 August 1451 the council of Meersburg was informed by officials in Cologne that Lochner would be unable to attend to the will and estate of his parents , recently deceased . It is presumed he was by then already ill ; plague was widespread in the area . On 22 September Saint Alban parish requested permission to burn victims in the lot next to his house – there was no longer room in their cemetery . Lochner died sometime between this date and December 1451 when creditors took possession of his house . Records from 1451 do not mention Lysbeth , who was presumably already dead . 
 = = Style = = 
 Lochner worked in the late International Gothic ( schöne <unk> ) style , already considered dated and old @-@ fashioned by the 1440s , yet is widely regarded as innovative . He introduced a number of progressions to painting in Cologne , especially by filling his backgrounds and landscapes with specific and elaborate details , and by rendering his figures with more bulk and volume . Wellesz described his paintings as evidencing an " intensity of feeling which gives a very special and very moving quality to his work . His devotion is reflected in his figures : it charges with symbolic meaning the smallest details of his paintings ; and , in a hidden , almost magical way , it speaks from the concord of his pure and glowing colours . " 
 Lochner painted with oil , preparing the surface in a way typical of other North German artists ; in some works he attached canvas to the panel support underneath the usual chalk ground . This was probably done where there were to be large areas of plain gilding . Where the gold ground was to have a pattern such as a brocade , this was carved into the chalk ground before gilding , and , in some paintings , elements had moulded additions applied to raise the surface to be gilded . He employed a number of techniques when gilding , to give different effects . These included laying the leaf with water for burnished passages , and with oil or varnish sizing ( mordant gilding ) for the more decorative areas . His colour schemes tend to be bright and luminous , filled with varieties of red , blue and green pigments . He often employed ultramarine , then expensive and difficult to source . His figures are regularly outlined with red paint . He was innovative in his rendering of flesh tones , which he built up using lead whites to give pale complexions with almost porcelain qualities . In this he refers to an older tradition of indicating women of high nobility whose paleness was associated with a life spent indoors , " shielded from toiling in the fields , which was the lot of most " . In particular , this technique follows the Master of Veronica , although the earlier painter 's figures had an almost yellowish , ivory hue . Lochner 's Madonnas tend to be clothed in saturated blues which resonate with surrounding yellow , red and green paint . According to James Snyder , the artist " employed these four basic colors for his harmonies " , but went beyond by using more subdued and deep hues in a technique referred to as " pure color " . 
 Like Conrad von Soest , Lochner often applied black cross @-@ hatching on gold , usually to render metallic objects such as brooches , crowns or buckles , in imitation of goldsmiths work on precious objects such as reliquaries and chalices . He was heavily influenced by the art and process of metalwork and goldsmithing , especially in his painting of gold grounds , and it has been suggested that he may have once trained as a goldsmith . Evidence of his imitation of elements of their craft is apparent even in his underdrawings . Notable and elaborate painted examples include the tooled gold border of the angelic concert in his Last Judgement , and Gabriel 's clasp on the outer wing of the Dombild altarpiece . 
 Lochner seems to have prepared on paper before approaching his underdrawings ; there is little evidence of reworking , even when positioning large groups of figures . Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied , for example g for <unk> ( yellow ) or w for <unk> ( white ) , and there are few deviations in the finished work . He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective , enlarged or diminished the size of figures . The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill , dynamism and confidence ; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking . Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled , for example St Ursula 's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints , which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems . 
 Perhaps influenced by van Eyck 's Madonna in the Church , Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light . According to the art historian Brigitte Corley , the clothes of " protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light , reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white , greens to a warm pale yellow , and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red " . Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck , but also from von Soest 's Crucifixion , where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John 's red robe , as yellows rays eventually become white . There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons , i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives . Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece . 
 Unlike the painters in the Low Countries , Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective ; his pictures are often set in shallow space , while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold . Thus , and given his harmonious colour schemes , Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic . This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication ; his arrangements are often innovative . The worlds he paints are hushed , according to Snyder , achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles . Angels form circles around the heavenly figures ; the heavenly figures ' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes . According to Snyder , the viewer is slowly " drawn into empathy with the revolving forms " . 
 Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works , it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner 's style . Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art . Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear , suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445 , predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne . 
 = = Work = = 
 = = = Panel paintings = = = 
 Lochner 's major works include three large polyptychs : the Dombild Altarpiece ; the Last Judgement , which is broken apart and in several collections ; and Nuremberg 's Crucifixion . Only two attributed paintings are dated ; the 1445 Nativity now in the Alte Pinakothek , Munich , and the Presentation in the Temple from 1447 , now in Darmstadt . There is a smaller , earlier version of the presentation scene at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation , Lisbon , dated 1445 . As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries , 15th @-@ century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works , especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait . 
 Wing panels and other fragments of Lochner 's larger works are today spread across various museums and collections . Two surviving double @-@ sided wing panels from an altarpiece with images of saints are in the London 's National Gallery and the Wallraf @-@ Richartz Museum , Cologne ( this now sawn through so both sides can be displayed on a wall ) . The wings of the Last Judgement originally had six parts , painted on both sides , but have been sawn into twelve individual pictures , now divided between the Wallraf @-@ Richartz Museum , the Alte Pinakothek in Munich and the <unk> Museum in Frankfurt . It is probably from early in his career , but in subject matter and background differs from other extant and attributed works . While the elements are arranged in typical harmony , the composition and tone are unusually dark and dramatic . The Crucifixion is also an early work and reminiscent of late medieval painting . It has a heavily ornamented gilded background and the smooth flowing quality of the ' soft ' Gothic style . 
 The extant works repeatedly address the same scenes and themes . The nativity is recurrent , while several panels depict the Virgin and Child , often surrounded by a chorus of angels , or in earlier panels , blessed by a hovering representation of God or a dove ( representing the Holy Ghost ) . In many instances Mary is enclosed in her usual enclosed garden . Several reveal the work of a number of hands , with weaker and less confident passages attributed to workshop members . The figures of Mary and Gabriel on the reverse of the Dombild were drawn more rapidly and with less skill than the figures on the main panels , and their drapery is modelled with , according to the art historian Julien Chapuis , a certain " stiffness " , while the cross hatching " achieves no clear definition of relief " . A number of drawings have been associated with him , but only one , a <unk> brush and ink on paper entitled Virgin and Child and now in the Musee du Louvre , is attributed with confidence . 
 = = = Illuminated manuscripts = = = 
 Lochner is associated with three surviving books of hours ; in Darmstadt , Berlin and Anholt . The extent of his association in each is debated ; workshop members were probably heavily involved in their production . The most famous is the early 1450s Prayer book of Stephan Lochner now at Darmstadt ; the others are the Berlin Book of Prayers of c . 1444 , and the Anholt <unk> , completed in the 1450s . The manuscripts are very small ( Berlin : 9 @.@ 3 cm x 7 cm , Darmstadt : 10 @.@ 7 cm x 8 cm , Anholt : 9 cm x 8 cm ) and similar in layout and colourisation and are each extensively decorated in gold and blue . The borders are ornamented in bright colours and contain acanthus scrolls , gold foliage , flowers , berry @-@ like fruits and round pods . The Darmstadt book includes a complete cycle of the Martyrdom of the Apostles . Its illustrations contain Lochner 's characteristic application of deep blue , reminiscent of his Virgin in the Rose Garden . 
 The art historian Ingo Walther detects Lochner 's hand in the " pious intimacy and soulfulness of the figures , always expressed so gently and elegantly , even in the extremely small format of the pictures " . Chapuis agrees with the attribution , noting how many of the miniatures share thematic similarities to attributed panels . He writes that the illustrations " are not a peripheral phenomenon . On the contrary , they address several of the concerns articulated in Lochner 's paintings and formulate them anew . There is little doubt that these exquisite images stem from the same mind . " The text of the Darmstadt book is written in Cologne vernacular , the Berlin book in Latin . 
 = = = Other formats = = = 
 There are extant liturgical vestments containing embroidered figures , including that of St. Barbara , in Lochner 's style and with similar facial types . This has led to some speculation whether Lochner provided the models . In addition a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar in style , and there has been debate whether he might have been responsible for church murals ; the over @-@ life size figures of the Dombild and Virgin with the Violet indicate his ability to work on a monumental scale . 
 Two drawings on paper in the British Museum and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux @-@ Arts were at times thought to be studies for the Munich Nativity . The lines of the folds in the garments closely match those of the painting , although the technical ability does not . The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating that it was a study piece for workshop members . The London piece is superior , but its lines are more rigid , lacking Lochner 's fluidity , and so its attribution has been relegated to a draughtsman closely associated with Lochner . 
 = = Influences = = 
 Lochner 's art seems indebted to two broad sources ; Netherlandish artists van Eyck and Robert Campin , and the earlier German masters Conrad von Soest and the Master of Saint Veronica . From the former Lochner drew his realism in depicting naturalistic backgrounds , objects and clothes . From the latter he adopted the somewhat antiquated manner of depicting figures , especially females , with doll @-@ like , eloquent and sensitive features , to present " iconic , almost timeless " atmospheres , enhanced by the then old @-@ fashioned gold backgrounds . Lochner 's figures have idealised facial features typical of medieval portraiture . His subjects , females in particular , usually have the high foreheads , long noses , small rounded chins , tucked blond curls and prominent ears typical of the late Gothic , giving them the characteristic monumentality of 13th @-@ century art , placing them on seemingly similar shallow backgrounds . 
 Lochner probably saw van Eyck 's c . 1432 Ghent Altarpiece during his visit to the Netherlands and seems to have borrowed a number of its compositional elements . The similarities include the manner in which the figures engage with their space and the emphasis on and rendering of elements such as brocades , gems and metals . Some figures in Lochner 's paintings are directly borrowed from Ghent , and a number of facial features match those seen in van Eyck . His Virgin with the Violet has often been compared to van Eyck 's 1439 Virgin at the Fountain . Similarly to those in van Eyck 's work , Lochner 's angels often sing or play musical instruments , including lutes and organs . 
 He seemingly rejected some aspects of van Eyckian realism , notably in his depictions of shadows , and his unwillingness to apply transparent glazes . As a colourist , Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style , even if this inhibited realism . He did not utilise the newly developed Netherlandish techniques of representing perspective , but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The historical evidence suggests that Lochner 's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime , and remained so until the 16th century . Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux @-@ Arts . The influence of Lochner 's Last Judgement can be seen in Hans Memling 's Gdansk altarpiece , where the gates of Heaven are similar , as is the rendering of the blessed . Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne , and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy . The latter 's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner 's <unk> of Bartholomew , especially in the executioner 's pose , while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner 's Adoration of the Magi triptych ; specifically , the king in the central panel with his back to the viewer , and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves . 
 The Heisterbach Altarpiece , a dismantled double set of wings now broken apart and divided between Bamberg and Cologne , is heavily indebted to Lochner 's style . The inner panels show sixteen scenes from the lives of Christ and the Virgin that bear multiple similarities to Lochner 's work , including in format , compositional motifs , physiognomy and colourisation . The work was for a period attributed to Lochner , but is now generally accepted as bearing his strong influence . In 1954 Alfred <unk> described the Master of the Heisterbach Altarpiece as Lochner 's " best @-@ known and most important pupil and follower " , although research in 2014 indicates that the two may have collaborated on the panels . 
 Research in 2014 by Iris Schaeffer into the underdrawings of the Dombild Altarpiece established two guiding hands , presumably Lochner and an exceptionally talented pupil , whom she concludes was in probability the principal artist behind the Heisterbach Altarpiece . A counter view is that Lochner 's workshop was producing to a deadline , and he delegated as a matter of expediency .

 = = Plot = = 
 The series is the first of the Gundam franchise set in the " Cosmic Era " in which mankind is divided between normal Earth dwelling humans , known as " Naturals " , and the genetically altered super @-@ humans known as " Coordinators " . The primary conflict of the story plot derives from jealous hatred by Naturals of the abilities of Coordinators , leading to hate crimes , and eventually the emigration of almost all Coordinators who flee into space to live idyllic lives on giant orbital space colonies called PLANTS of their own design . War eventually breaks out between Earth and the Plants . The Earth is divided between two major factions , the Earth Forces formed from most of the natural born human nations , primarily the Eurasians and the Atlantic Federation , and a natural human supremacist group known as Blue Cosmos with its slogan , " For the preservation of our blue and pure world " . The Earth Forces are not a unified alliance , and infighting and mistrust exist between their various nation states . The second major Earth nation is the Orb Union , a staunchly politically neutral and isolationist nation located on small Pacific Ocean islands ruled by a hereditary monarchy and still contains Coordinator citizens . 
 Two major events precede the story , known as the Bloody Valentine tragedy that initiated war between the PLANTS and the Earth Forces when one of the PLANT space stations , Junius @-@ 7 , is destroyed by a nuclear bomb . The second event is the counterattack by the PLANTS that buries Neutron Jammers deep into Earth 's crust that halts all nuclear reactions and long range radar and radio , causing most areas of earth to go without electricity or communication , and requiring mobile suits to rely on rechargeable batteries . 
 The PLANTS are a technological power house , developing many new technologies that give them equal power to Earth despite their very small population . It is the invention of the Mobile Suits that give their military the edge in the beginning of the war . 
 The story begins in the neutral Orb Union owned space colony Heliopolis , where secret development of 5 advanced mobile suits for the Earth Forces war effort in exchange for their technical data to be shared with the neutral Orb Union military . Additionally Heliopolis constructs a unique carrier battleship , the Archangel to base the five mobile suits from for the Earth Forces . The colony is attacked by ZAFT forces , the military of the Coordinators , with the objective of stealing the new units . During the incursion an Orb union student and Coordinator named Kira Yamato , upon seeing his friends in danger , pilots the <unk> @-@ <unk> Strike mobile suit to fend off the invaders but the colony is critically damaged in the ensuing fight . As Heliopolis disintegrates , the survivors board the Archangel , and begin their journey to the Alliance base in Alaska . During the journey to Earth , Kira pilots the Strike to counter a series of attacks by ZAFT but is seemingly killed by his childhood friend , ZAFT soldier Athrun Zala , during one of their battles in which he also is nearly killed . Kira survives the attack and is taken by a blind priest to one of the PLANT space colonies , home to the Coordinators to recover . The Archangel arrives in Alaska but ZAFT launches a full @-@ scale attack on the base overpowering their enemies . 
 Kira goes to Alaska with the <unk> @-@ <unk> Freedom , a highly advanced , nuclear powered , and Neutron Jammer proof ZAFT mobile suit stolen by the PLANT pop star Coordinator Lacus Clyne daughter of Siegel Clyne , President of the Supreme Council of PLANT . Using Freedom , Kira ends the battle between the two armies , but the Alaska base is subsequently destroyed . The Archangel flees to the neutral country of the Orb Union . The Archangel and a new ship , the Orb Union ship Kusanagi leave Earth for space where they then join Lacus Clyne 's rebel faction and their stolen ZAFT battleship , the Eternal ( meant to carry the Freedom and Justice mobile suites ) to form the Three Ships Alliance with the common goal of ending the war between the Naturals and Coordinators . In the midst of the conflict , Athrun learns that Kira survived and searches for him under orders to recover Gundam Freedom , and is given an equally powerful prototype Gundam Justice . However , after learning of Patrick Zala 's , Athrun 's father and the radical militant faction leader of the PLANT Supreme Council , plan to commit genocide Athrun deserts him and joins the Three Ships Alliance . In a final battle , the Earth Forces deploys nuclear weapons equipped Neutron Jammer <unk> technology copied from stolen data on the Freedom and Justice <unk> power systems . The Earth Forces intend to destroy the PLANT space colonies but are stopped by ZAFT 's GENESIS , a super weapon microwave laser designed to commit genocide on the Naturals . The Three Ship Alliance intervenes to defeat the GENESIS ending the battle . The war ultimately ends as a peace treaty is signed .
