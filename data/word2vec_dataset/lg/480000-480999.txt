 Suillellus luridus is a stout fungus with a thick yellow @-@ olive to olive @-@ brown convex cushion @-@ shaped cap that can reach 20 cm ( 8 in ) in diameter . The cap colour tends to darken with age , and regions of red , orange , purple , brown , or olive @-@ green can develop in maturity . The cap surface is tomentose ( velvety ) , becoming smoother with old age , and sticky in wet weather . The pore surface is initially dark red before turning orange @-@ red , and has a lighter @-@ coloured zone encircling the margin . There are 2 – 3 circular pores per millimetre , and the tubes are 1 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) deep . The tubes are shorter around the cap margin and close to the stem , where they form a circular depression . Initially pale yellow , the tubes gradually become olive @-@ yellow and then bluish @-@ green upon exposure to air . A characteristic feature is the presence of a maroon layer between the tubes and the flesh . The thick stem is 8 – 14 cm ( 3 – 6 in ) tall and 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) wide , and bears a distinctive orange @-@ red <unk> pattern on a paler yellowish or ochre background . The flesh is yellowish , with red marks in the cap , and stains an intense dark blue when bruised or broken . There is a faint sour smell , and the taste is described as mild . 
 Variety <unk> can be distinguished from the main form by the reddish discolouration of the stem base that occurs both on the exterior surface and in the flesh . Variety rubriceps has a deep crimson red cap , while var. <unk> has a pale yellow or dirty ochre cap , sometimes with pink tones throughout . 
 The spore dust is olive to brownish olive . The spores are oval to somewhat fuse @-@ shaped , measuring 11 – 15 μm long by 4 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 5 μm wide . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped and four @-@ spored , and measure 29 @.@ 2 – 36 @.@ 5 by 11 @.@ 0 – 12 @.@ 4 μm . Cystidia on the sides of the tubes ( pleurocystidia ) are fuse @-@ shaped with swollen middles and long necks , measuring 33 – 48 by 7 @.@ 3 – 13 @.@ 5 μm ; cheilocystidia ( on the edges of the pores ) have a similar morphology . The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 8 μm wide that are interwoven compactly , and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles . In contrast , the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched , measuring 3 @.@ 7 – 8 @.@ 8 μm . Hyphae do not contain clamp connections . The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour . 
 Some chemical tests can be used to help identify the mushroom . A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish , and orange @-@ yellow on the flesh , while ferrous sulphate solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish @-@ yellow . Melzer 's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue , after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded .

 Also found on calcareous ( chalky ) soils , Rubroboletus satanas is larger and has a pale cap , and its upper stem lacks the reticulations characteristic of S. luridus . Its flesh does not turn blue so markedly on bruising or cutting . It has a more globular overall shape , and young mushrooms carry a smell of decay . The edible <unk> luridiformis can be distinguished from S. luridus by its dark brown cap ; it also grows on sandy soils associated with conifers . In North America , it can be confused with the poisonous Rubroboletus pulcherrimus , which has a fatter stalk and deeper red pores . Initially collected in Michigan under oak , Boletus <unk> resembles S. luridus but has shorter spores and its cystidia are dark brown in Melzer 's reagent . Boletus species that share a similar appearance with S. luridus but lack reticulation in their stems include B. subvelutipes ( found in North America and Asia ) and B. <unk> ( United States ) . 
 Boletus caucasicus , found in southern Europe , has yellow flesh in the cap tissue immediately above the tube layer , in contrast to the reddish colour of the same flesh found in S. luridus . Another European species , Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus , has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap . The Chinese species <unk> sinensis , originally described as a form of S. luridus , can be most reliably distinguished from the latter by its larger spores , which have been reported to be as large as 12 – 17 by 5 @.@ 5 – 7 μm . Fruit bodies closely resembling S. luridus have been recorded in Australia , though renamed Boletus <unk> as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family Myrtaceae . 
 = = Ecology and distribution = = 
 The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous trees such as oak , birch and beech on chalky soils . It is also suspected of being a mycorrhizal associate of subshrub rock roses in the genus Helianthemum . Field studies indicate that the fungus , when paired as a mycorrhizal partner with seedlings of the conifer <unk> lanceolata , increases the seedling 's survival rate , augments its height and ground diameter , and increases the chlorophyll content in the leaves . A similar growth @-@ enhancing effect had been noted earlier with Pinus <unk> seedlings . These beneficial effects on plant growth are a result of multiple interactions among the fungus , host plant , and indigenous soil microbes that increase the biomass of carbon , and increase the bacterial diversity in the mycorrhizosphere . In a study comparing the salinity resistance of three common ectomycorrhizal fungi ( the others were Suillus bovinus and S. luteus ) , S. luridus was the most tolerant to high concentrations of salt , and is a good candidate species for the inoculation of tree seedlings to be planted on saline soil . Fruit bodies grow singly or scattered on the ground , from June to November after summer rains . S. luridus may occur in parks near a single tree , though it will not be found in acidic soils . 
 The predilection of insects for this mushroom was noted by 19th @-@ century British mycologist Anna Maria Hussey , who wrote in 1847 : 
 there are very few of the soft @-@ fleshed tribes , all of which are the nurseries of innumerable insects , so much in favour as the poisonous Boletus luridus , on breaking an old one it is a living mass of larvae . Our present subject is so soon attacked by insects that it is very rare to find specimens devoid of wriggling life , and being a very common and abundant kind , it must be of great service in the economy of insect existence . 
 Several fly species have been recorded feeding on the fruit bodies , including <unk> <unk> , P. <unk> , <unk> diaphanus , and , in North America , Drosophila <unk> , Pegomya <unk> , P. winthemi , Megaselia pygmaeoides , and <unk> assimilis . In contrast , slugs tend to avoid consuming this species . 
 The fungus is widespread in Europe , east to the Black Sea region and eastern Anatolia in Turkey , and Pakistan , where it has been recorded from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Gali and <unk> . In North America , it is known from eastern Canada and the United States east of the Great Lakes , although in one instance it was found in North Dakota . Its range extends south to Mexico , and it has been recorded once from Costa Rica . In Asia , it has been found in the Bar 'am Forest in the Upper Galilee in northern Israel , and India . Taiwan , It is widely distributed in China , having been found in Hebei , Jiangsu , Anhui , Henan , Guangdong , and Yunnan provinces . The variety rubriceps has been recorded growing under linden ( Tilia ) in the Czech Republic . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Mild tasting , Suillellus luridus is edible after thorough cooking and is highly regarded in France . It is also commonly consumed in Italy and China . The mushroom is sold in regional markets in central Mexico ; despite this , it is considered inedible by inhabitants of La Malinche National Park . Caution is advised if choosing this species for consumption , as it resembles other less edible blue @-@ staining boletes . Some guidebooks recommend avoiding it altogether . If eaten raw or insufficiently cooked , symptoms of gastrointestinal poisoning can occur within 30 minutes to two hours , including nausea , vomiting , abdominal cramps , and diarrhoea . A full recovery can be expected within 24 to 48 hours if fluid losses are restored . Chemical analysis has revealed traces of the toxin muscarine and its stereoisomers . 
 Suillellus luridus has been suspected of causing an enhanced alcohol sensitivity similar to that caused by the common ink cap ( Coprinopsis atramentaria ) , with gastric symptoms . A German mycologist reported having suffered symptoms himself upon imbibing alcohol with this " otherwise excellent " mushroom . A 1982 report of three cases from Switzerland further incriminated the species , yet a 1994 study casts doubt on this ; researchers Ulrich <unk> and Hartmut Laatsch looked for antabuse @-@ like compound coprine content in S. luridus and similar species , and found none in the historical suspect but did find indications for it in the rare B. torosus . They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical incidents was a misidentification of B. torosus with S. luridus , though they could not rule out S. luridus containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol @-@ related reactions . 
 = = Chemistry = = 
 The composition of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid , with smaller proportions of 1 @-@ butanol , 3 @-@ methyl @-@ 1 @-@ butanol , <unk> acid , palmitic acid , linoleic acid methyl ester , and <unk> acid . <unk> compounds might be responsible for the characteristic odour of the dried mushroom . The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol , with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds . The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid ( 53 @.@ 4 % of total fatty acids ) , oleic acid ( 24 @.@ 1 % ) , and palmitic acid ( 10 @.@ 2 % ) . Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration ( 96 @.@ 9 μM per gram of dry weight ) , followed by glutamine ( 9 @.@ 7 ) and alanine ( 8 @.@ 2 ) . 
 The carotenoid content of the fruit bodies differs substantially between the cap , the tubes , and the stem . The upper part of the cap , which contains 3 @.@ 1 micrograms of carotenoid per gram ( µg / g ) fresh weight , has predominantly <unk> ( 47 % of total carotenoids ) , 4 @-@ keto @-@ α @-@ carotene ( 40 @.@ 2 % ) , and δ @-@ carotene ( 6 @.@ 4 % ) . The major carotenoids in the tubes ( totaling 4 @.@ 3 µg / g ) include <unk> ( 31 @.@ 1 % ) , <unk> ( 17 @.@ 2 % ) , 4 @-@ keto @-@ α @-@ carotene ( 17 @.@ 1 % ) , and <unk> ( 15 @.@ 8 % ) .

The colour change observed with tissue injury is caused by variegatic and xerocomic acids , both of which turn blue when oxidized enzymatically upon exposure to air .

 Mohammed Yasser Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al @-@ Qudwa ( / <unk> , <unk> / ; Arabic : محمد <unk> عبد الرحمن عبد <unk> <unk> ; 24 August 1929 – 11 November 2004 ) , popularly known as Yasser Arafat ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) or by his kunya Abu Ammar ( Arabic : أبو <unk> , ' Abū <unk> ) , was a Palestinian leader . He was Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , President of the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) , and leader of the Fatah political party and former paramilitary group , which he founded in 1959 . Originally opposed to Israel 's existence , he modified his position in 1988 when he accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242 . Arafat and his movement operated from several Arab countries . In the late 1960s and early 1970s , Fatah faced off with Jordan in a brief civil war . Forced out of Jordan and into Lebanon , Arafat and Fatah were major targets of Israel 's 1978 and 1982 invasions of that country . 
 Later in his career , Arafat engaged in a series of negotiations with the government of Israel to end the decades @-@ long conflict between it and the PLO . These included the Madrid Conference of 1991 , the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit . His political rivals , including Islamists and several PLO leftists , often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to the Israeli government . In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize , together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres , for the negotiations at Oslo . During this time , Hamas and other militant organizations rose to power and shook the foundations of the authority that Fatah under Arafat had established in the Palestinian territories . In late 2004 , after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army , Arafat became ill , fell into a coma and died on 11 November 2004 at the age of 75 . While the cause of Arafat 's death has remained the subject of speculation , investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved . 
 Arafat remains a controversial figure . The majority of the Palestinian people — regardless of political ideology or faction — viewed him as a heroic freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of his people , while many Israelis have described him as an unrepentant terrorist . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Birth and childhood = = = 
 Arafat was born in Cairo , Egypt . His father , Abdel Raouf al @-@ Qudwa al @-@ Husseini , was a Palestinian from Gaza City , whose mother , Yasser 's paternal grandmother , was Egyptian . Arafat 's father battled in the Egyptian courts for 25 years to claim family land in Egypt as part of his inheritance but was unsuccessful . He worked as a textile merchant in Cairo 's religiously mixed <unk> District . Arafat was the second @-@ youngest of seven children and was , along with his younger brother Fathi , the only offspring born in Cairo . His mother , <unk> Abul Saud , was from a Jerusalem @-@ based family . She died from a kidney ailment in 1933 , when Arafat was four years of age . 
 Arafat 's first visit to Jerusalem came when his father , unable to raise seven children alone , sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother 's family in the Moroccan Quarter of the Old City . They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years . In 1937 , their father recalled them to be taken care of by their older sister , <unk> . Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father ; when he died in 1952 , Arafat did not attend the funeral , nor did he visit his father 's grave upon his return to Gaza . Arafat 's sister <unk> stated in an interview with Arafat 's biographer , British historian Alan Hart , that Arafat was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services . When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going , he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 In 1944 , Arafat enrolled in the University of King Fuad I and graduated in 1950 . He later claimed to have sought a better understanding of Judaism and Zionism by engaging in discussions with Jews and reading publications by Theodor Herzl and other prominent Zionists . At the same time , he became an Arab nationalist and began procuring weapons to be smuggled into the former British Mandate of Palestine , for use by irregulars in the Arab Higher Committee and the Army of the Holy War militias . 
 During the 1948 Arab – Israeli War , Arafat left the University and , along with other Arabs , sought to enter Palestine to join Arab forces fighting against Israeli troops and the creation of the state of Israel . However , instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian fedayeen , Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood , although he did not join the organization . He took part in combat in the Gaza area ( which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict ) . In early 1949 , the war was winding down in Israel 's favor , and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support . 
 After returning to the University , Arafat studied civil engineering and served as president of the General Union of Palestinian Students ( <unk> ) from 1952 to 1956 . During his first year as president of the union , the University was renamed Cairo University after a coup was carried out by the Free Officers Movement overthrowing King Farouk I. By that time , Arafat had graduated with a bachelor 's degree in civil engineering and was called to duty to fight with Egyptian forces during the Suez Crisis ; however , he never actually fought . Later that year , at a conference in Prague , he donned a solid white keffiyeh – different from the fishnet @-@ patterned one he adopted later in Kuwait , which was to become his emblem . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 In 1990 , Arafat married Suha Tawil , a Palestinian Christian when he was 61 and Suha , 27 . Before their marriage , she was working as a secretary for Arafat in Tunis after her mother introduced her to him in France . Prior to Arafat 's marriage , he adopted fifty Palestinian war orphans . 
 During her marriage , Suha tried to leave Arafat on many occasions , but was not permitted to by her husband . She views her marriage to Arafat as a mistake . Suha said she regrets the marriage and given the choice again , would not have wed him . 
 On 24 July 1995 , Arafat 's wife Suha gave birth to a daughter in Neuilly @-@ sur @-@ Seine , France . She was named <unk> after Arafat 's deceased mother . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 Arafat 's full name was Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Raouf Arafat al @-@ Qudwa . Mohammed Abdel Rahman was his first name , Abdel Raouf was his father 's name and Arafat his grandfather 's . Al @-@ Qudwa was the name of his tribe and al @-@ Husseini was that of the clan to which the al @-@ <unk> belonged . The al @-@ Husseini clan was based in Gaza and is not related to the well @-@ known al @-@ Husayni clan of Jerusalem . 
 Since Arafat was raised in Cairo , the tradition of dropping the Mohammed or Ahmad portion of one 's first name was common ; notable Egyptians such as Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak did so . However , Arafat also dropped Abdel Rahman and Abdel Raouf from his name as well . During the early 1950s , Arafat adopted the name Yasser , and in the early years of Arafat 's guerrilla career , he assumed the nom de guerre of Abu Ammar . Both names are related to Ammar ibn Yasir , one of Muhammad 's early companions . Although he dropped most of his inherited names , he retained Arafat due to its significance in Islam . 
 = = Rise of Fatah = = 
 = = = Founding of Fatah = = = 
 Following the Suez Crisis in 1956 , Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser agreed to allow the United Nations Emergency Force to establish itself in the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip , precipitating the expulsion of all guerrilla or " fedayeen " forces there — including Arafat . Arafat originally attempted to obtain a visa to Canada and later Saudi Arabia , but was unsuccessful in both attempts . In 1957 , he applied for a visa to Kuwait ( at the time a British protectorate ) and was approved , based on his work in civil engineering . There he encountered two Palestinian friends : Salah Khalaf ( " Abu Iyad " ) and Khalil al @-@ Wazir ( " Abu Jihad " ) , both official members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood . Arafat had met Abu Iyad while attending Cairo University and Abu Jihad in Gaza . Both would later become Arafat 's top aides . Abu Iyad traveled with Arafat to Kuwait in late 1960 ; Abu Jihad , also working as a teacher , had already been living there since 1959 . After settling in Kuwait , Abu Iyad helped Arafat obtain a temporary job as a schoolteacher . 
 As Arafat began to develop friendships with Palestinian refugees ( some of whom he knew from his Cairo days ) , he and the others gradually founded the group that became known as Fatah . The exact date for the establishment of Fatah is unknown . In 1959 , the group 's existence was attested to in the pages of a Palestinian nationalist magazine , <unk> Nida al @-@ Hayat ( Our Palestine , The Call of Life ) , which was written and edited by Abu Jihad . <unk> is a reverse acronym of the Arabic name Harakat al @-@ Tahrir al @-@ Watani al @-@ <unk> which translates into " The Palestinian National Liberation Movement " . " Fatah " is also a word that was used in early Islamic times to refer to " conquest . " 
 Fatah dedicated itself to the liberation of Palestine by an armed struggle carried out by Palestinians themselves . This differed from other Palestinian political and guerrilla organizations , most of which firmly believed in a united Arab response . Arafat 's organization never embraced the ideologies of the major Arab governments of the time , in contrast to other Palestinian factions , which often became satellites of nations such as Egypt , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , Syria and others . 
 In accordance with his ideology , Arafat generally refused to accept donations to his organization from major Arab governments , in order to act independently of them . He did not want to alienate them , and sought their undivided support by avoiding ideological alliances . However , to establish the groundwork for Fatah 's future financial support , he enlisted contributions from the many wealthy Palestinians working in Kuwait and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf , such as Qatar ( where he met Mahmoud Abbas in 1961 ) . These businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to the Fatah organization . Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries , such as Libya and Syria . 
 In 1962 , Arafat and his closest companions migrated to Syria — a country sharing a border with Israel — which had recently seceded from its union with Egypt . Fatah had approximately three hundred members by this time , but none were fighters . In Syria , he managed to recruit members by offering them higher incomes to enable his armed attacks against Israel . Fatah 's manpower was incremented further after Arafat decided to offer new recruits much higher salaries than members of the Palestine Liberation Army ( PLA ) , the regular military force of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , which was created by the Arab League in 1964 . On 31 December , a squad from al @-@ Assifa , Fatah 's armed wing , attempted to infiltrate Israel , but they were intercepted and detained by Lebanese security forces . Several other raids with Fatah 's poorly trained and badly @-@ equipped fighters followed this incident . Some were successful , others failed in their missions . Arafat often led these incursions personally . 
 Arafat was detained in Syria 's Mezzeh Prison when a Palestinian Syrian Army officer , Yusef Urabi , was killed . Urabi had been chairing a meeting to ease tensions between Arafat and Palestinian Liberation Front leader Ahmed Jibril , but neither Arafat nor Jibril attended , delegating representatives to attend on their behalf . Urabi was killed during or after the meeting amid disputed circumstances . On the orders of Defense Minister Hafez al @-@ Assad , a close friend of Urabi , Arafat was subsequently arrested , found guilty by a three @-@ man jury and sentenced to death . However , he and his colleagues were pardoned by President Salah Jadid shortly after the verdict . The incident brought Assad and Arafat to unpleasant terms , which would surface later when Assad became President of Syria .

 On 13 November 1966 , Israel launched a major raid against the Jordanian administered West Bank town of as @-@ Samu , in response to a Fatah @-@ implemented roadside bomb attack which had killed three members of the Israeli security forces near the southern Green Line border . In the resulting skirmish , scores of Jordanian security forces were killed and 125 homes razed . This raid was one of several factors that led to the 1967 Six @-@ Day War . 
 The Six @-@ Day war began when Israel launched air strikes against Egypt 's air force on 5 June 1967 . The war ended in an Arab defeat and Israel 's occupation of several Arab territories , including the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Although Nasser and his Arab allies had been defeated , Arafat and Fatah could claim a victory , in that the majority of Palestinians , who had up to that time tended to align and sympathize with individual Arab governments , now began to agree that a ' Palestinian ' solution to their dilemma was indispensable . Many primarily Palestinian political parties , including George Habash 's Arab Nationalist Movement , Hajj Amin al @-@ Husseini 's Arab Higher Committee , the Islamic Liberation Front and several Syrian @-@ backed groups , virtually crumbled after their sponsor governments ' defeat . Barely a week after the defeat , Arafat crossed the Jordan River in disguise and entered the West Bank , where he set up recruitment centers in Hebron , the Jerusalem area and Nablus , and began attracting both fighters and financiers for his cause . 
 At the same time , Nasser contacted Arafat through the former 's adviser Mohammed Heikal and Arafat was declared by Nasser to be the " leader of the Palestinians . " In December 1967 Ahmad Shukeiri resigned his post as PLO Chairman . Yahya <unk> took his place and invited Arafat to join the organization . Fatah was allocated 33 of 105 seats of the PLO Executive Committee while 57 seats were left for several other guerrilla factions . 
 = = = Battle of Karameh = = = 
 Throughout 1968 , Fatah and other Palestinian armed groups were the target of a major Israeli army operation in the Jordanian village of Karameh , where the Fatah headquarters — as well as a mid @-@ sized Palestinian refugee camp — were located . The town 's name is the Arabic word for ' dignity ' , which elevated its symbolism in the eyes of the Arab people , especially after the collective Arab defeat in 1967 . The operation was in response to attacks , including rockets strikes from Fatah and other Palestinian militias , within the Israeli @-@ occupied West Bank . According to Said Aburish , the government of Jordan and a number of Fatah commandos informed Arafat that large @-@ scale Israeli military preparations for an attack on the town were underway , prompting fedayeen groups , such as George Habash 's newly formed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) and Nayef Hawatmeh 's breakaway organization the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( DFLP ) , to withdraw their forces from the town . Though advised by a sympathetic Jordanian Army divisional commander to withdraw his men and headquarters to the nearby hills , Arafat refused , stating , " We want to convince the world that there are those in the Arab world who will not withdraw or flee . " Aburish writes that it was on Arafat 's orders that Fatah remained , and that the Jordanian Army agreed to back them if heavy fighting ensued . 
 In response to persistent PLO raids against Israeli civilian targets , Israel attacks the town of Karameh , Jordan , the site of a major PLO camp . The goal of the invasion was to destroy Karameh camp and capture Yasser Arafat in reprisal for the attacks by the PLO against Israeli civilians , which culminated in an Israeli school bus hitting a mine in the Negev . However , plans for the two operations were prepared in 1967 , one year before the bus incident . When Jordan saw the size of the raiding forces entering the battle it was lead to the assumption that Israel had another goal of capturing Balqa Governorate to create a Golan Heights similar situation . Israel assumed that the Jordanian Army would ignore the invasion , but the latter fought alongside the Palestinians and opened heavy fire that inflicted losses upon the Israeli forces . This engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian forces . The Israelis were repelled at the end of a day 's battle , having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 141 PLO prisoners . Both sides declared victory . On a tactical level , the battle went in Israel 's favor and the destruction of the Karameh camp was achieved . However , the relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the Israel Defense Forces and was stunning to the Israelis . Although the Palestinians were not victorious on their own , King Hussein let the Palestinians take credit . Some have alleged that Arafat himself was on the battlefield , but the details of his involvement are unclear . However , his allies – as well as Israeli intelligence – confirm that he urged his men throughout the battle to hold their ground and continue fighting . 
 The battle was covered in detail by Time , and Arafat 's face appeared on the cover of the 13 December 1968 issue , bringing his image to the world for the first time . Amid the post @-@ war environment , the profiles of Arafat and Fatah were raised by this important turning point , and he came to be regarded as a national hero who dared to confront Israel . With mass applause from the Arab world , financial donations increased significantly , and Fatah 's weaponry and equipment improved . The group 's numbers swelled as many young Arabs , including thousands of non @-@ Palestinians , joined the ranks of Fatah . 
 When the Palestinian National Council ( PNC ) convened in Cairo on 3 February 1969 , Yahya <unk> stepped down from his chairmanship of the PLO . Arafat was elected chairman on 4 February . He became Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Palestinian Revolutionary Forces two years later , and in 1973 , became the head of the PLO 's political department . 
 = = Confrontation with Jordan = = 
 In the late 1960s , tensions between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly ; heavily armed Palestinian elements had created a virtual " state within a state " in Jordan , eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country . After their proclaimed victory in the Battle of Karameh , Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan . They set up roadblocks , publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces , molested women and levied illegal taxes — all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored . King Hussein considered this a growing threat to his kingdom 's sovereignty and security , and attempted to disarm the militias . However , in order to avoid a military confrontation with opposition forces , Hussein dismissed several of his anti @-@ PLO cabinet officials , including some of his own family members , and invited Arafat to become Prime Minister of Jordan . Arafat refused , citing his belief in the need for a Palestinian state with Palestinian leadership . 
 Despite Hussein 's intervention , militant actions in Jordan continued . On 15 September 1970 , the PFLP hijacked five planes and landed three of them at Dawson 's Field , located 30 miles ( 48 km ) east of Amman . After the passengers were moved to other locations , three of the planes were blown up . This tarnished Arafat 's image in many western nations , including the United States , who held him responsible for controlling Palestinian factions that belonged to the PLO . Arafat , bowing to pressure from Arab governments , publicly condemned the hijackings and suspended the PFLP from any guerrilla actions for a few weeks . He had taken the same action after the PFLP attacked Athens Airport . The Jordanian government moved to regain control over its territory , and the next day , King Hussein declared martial law . On the same day , Arafat became supreme commander of the PLA . 
 As the conflict raged , other Arab governments attempted to negotiate a peaceful resolution . As part of this effort , Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September . Arafat 's speech drew sympathy from attending Arab leaders . Other heads of state took sides against Hussein , among them Muammar Gaddafi , who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal . A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides , but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the summit , and the conflict resumed shortly afterward . 
 By 25 September , the Jordanian army achieved dominance , and two days later Arafat and Hussein agreed to a ceasefire in Amman . The Jordanian army inflicted heavy casualties on the Palestinians — including civilians — who suffered approximately 3 @,@ 500 fatalities . After repeated violations of the ceasefire from both the PLO and the Jordanian Army , Arafat called for King Hussein to be toppled . Responding to the threat , in June 1971 , Hussein ordered his forces to oust all remaining Palestinian fighters in northern Jordan , which they accomplished . Arafat and a number of his forces , including two high @-@ ranking commanders , Abu Iyad and Abu Jihad , were forced into the northern corner of Jordan . They relocated near the town of Jerash , near the border with Syria . With the help of <unk> Masri , a pro @-@ Palestinian Jordanian cabinet member , and Fahd al @-@ <unk> , the Saudi ambassador to Jordan , Arafat managed to enter Syria with nearly two thousand of his fighters . However , due to the hostility of relations between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al @-@ Assad ( who had since ousted President Salah Jadid ) , the Palestinian fighters crossed the border into Lebanon to join PLO forces in that country , where they set up their new headquarters .

 = = = Official recognition = = = 
 Because of Lebanon 's weak central government , the PLO was able to operate virtually as an independent state . During this time in the 1970s , numerous leftist PLO groups took up arms against Israel , carrying out attacks against civilians as well as military targets within Israel and outside of it . 
 Two major incidents occurred in 1972 . The Fatah subgroup Black September hijacked Sabena Flight 572 en route to Vienna and forced it to land at the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod , Israel . The PFLP and the Japanese Red Army carried out a shooting rampage at the same airport , killing twenty @-@ four civilians . Israel later claimed that the assassination of PFLP spokesman Ghassan <unk> was a response to the PFLP 's involvement in masterminding the latter attack . Two days later , various PLO factions retaliated by bombing a bus station , killing eleven civilians . 
 At the Munich Olympic Games , Black September kidnapped and killed eleven Israeli athletes . A number of sources , including Mohammed Oudeh ( Abu Daoud ) , one of the masterminds of the Munich massacre , and Benny Morris , a prominent Israeli historian , have stated that Black September was an armed branch of Fatah used for paramilitary operations . According to Abu Daoud 's 1999 book , " Arafat was briefed on plans for the Munich hostage @-@ taking . " The killings were internationally condemned . In 1973 – 74 , Arafat closed Black September down , ordering the PLO to withdraw from acts of violence outside Israel , the West Bank and Gaza Strip . 
 In 1974 , the PNC approved the Ten Point Program ( drawn up by Arafat and his advisers ) , and proposed a compromise with the Israelis . It called for a Palestinian national authority over every part of " liberated " Palestinian territory , which refers to areas captured by Arab forces in the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War ( present @-@ day West Bank , East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip ) . This caused discontent among several of the PLO factions ; the PFLP , DFLP and other parties formed a breakaway organization , the Rejectionist Front . 
 Israel and the US have alleged also that Arafat was involved in the 1973 Khartoum diplomatic assassinations , in which five diplomats and five others were killed . A 1973 United States Department of State document , declassified in 2006 , concluded " The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat . " Arafat denied any involvement in the operation and insisted it was carried out independently by the Black September group . Israel claimed that Arafat was in ultimate control over these organizations and therefore had not abandoned terrorism . 
 In addition , some circles within the US State Department viewed Arafat as an able diplomat and negotiator who could get support from many Arab governments at once . An example of that , we find in March 1973 that Arafat tried to arrange for a meeting between the President of Iraq and the Emir of Kuwait in order to resolve their disputes . 
 Also in 1974 , the PLO was declared the " sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people " and admitted to full membership of the Arab League at the Rabat Summit . Arafat became the first representative of a non @-@ governmental organization to address a plenary session of the UN General Assembly . In his United Nations address , Arafat condemned Zionism , but said , " Today I have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter 's gun . Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand . " He wore a holster throughout his speech , although it did not contain a gun . His speech increased international sympathy for the Palestinian cause . 
 Following recognition , Arafat established relationships with a variety of world leaders , including Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin . Arafat was Amin 's best man at his wedding in Uganda in 1975 . 
 = = = Fatah involvement in Lebanese Civil War = = = 
 Although hesitant at first to take sides in the conflict , Arafat and Fatah played an important role in the Lebanese Civil War . Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub @-@ groups such as the PFLP , DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front ( <unk> ) , Arafat aligned the PLO with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement ( LNM ) . The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt , who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders . Although originally aligned with Fatah , Syrian President Hafez al @-@ Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides . He sent his army , along with the Syrian @-@ backed Palestinian factions of as @-@ Sa 'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command ( PFLP @-@ GC ) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right @-@ wing Christian forces against the PLO and the LNM . The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to <unk> Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun , a son of former President Camille Chamoun . 
 In February 1975 , a pro @-@ Palestinian Lebanese MP , <unk> Saad , was shot and killed , reportedly by the Lebanese Army . His death , from his wounds , the following month , and the massacre in April of that year of 27 Palestinians and Lebanese travelling on a bus from Sabra and Shatila to the Tel al @-@ Zaatar refugee camp by Phalangist forces , precipitated the Lebanese Civil War . Arafat was reluctant to respond with force , but many other Fatah and PLO members felt otherwise . For example , the DFLP carried out several attacks against the Lebanese Army . In 1976 , an alliance of Christian militias with the backing of the Lebanese and Syrian armies besieged Tel al @-@ Zaatar camp in east Beirut . The PLO and LNM retaliated by attacking the town of Damour , a Phalangist stronghold where they massacred 684 people and wounded many more . The Tel al @-@ Zaatar camp fell to the Christians after a six @-@ month siege in which thousands of Palestinians , mostly civilians , were killed . Arafat and Abu Jihad blamed themselves for not successfully organizing a rescue effort . 
 PLO cross @-@ border raids against Israel grew during the late 1970s . One of the most severe — known as the Coastal Road massacre — occurred on 11 March 1978 . A force of nearly a dozen Fatah fighters landed their boats near a major coastal road connecting the city of Haifa with Tel Aviv @-@ <unk> . There they hijacked a bus and sprayed gunfire inside and at passing vehicles , killing thirty @-@ seven civilians . In response , the IDF launched Operation Litani three days later , with the goal of taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River . The IDF achieved this goal , and Arafat withdrew PLO forces north into Beirut . 
 After Israel withdrew from Lebanon , cross @-@ border hostilities between PLO forces and Israel continued , though from August 1981 to May 1982 , the PLO adopted an official policy of refraining from responding to provocations . On 6 June 1982 , Israel launched an invasion of Lebanon to expel the PLO from southern Lebanon . Beirut was soon besieged and bombarded by the IDF ; Arafat declared the city to be the " Hanoi and Stalingrad of the Israeli army . " The Civil War 's first phase ended and Arafat — who was commanding Fatah forces at Tel al @-@ Zaatar — narrowly escaped with assistance from Saudi and Kuwaiti diplomats . Towards the end of the siege , the US and European governments brokered an agreement guaranteeing safe passage for Arafat and the PLO — guarded by a multinational force of eight hundred US Marines supported by the US Navy — to exile in Tunis . 
 Arafat returned to Lebanon a year after his eviction from Beirut , this time establishing himself in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli . This time Arafat was expelled by a fellow Palestinian working under Hafez al @-@ Assad . Arafat did not return to Lebanon after his second expulsion , though many Fatah fighters did . 
 = = Headquarters in Tunisia = = 
 Arafat and Fatah 's center for operations was based in Tunis , the capital of Tunisia , until 1993 . In 1985 Arafat narrowly survived an Israeli assassination attempt when Israeli Air Force F @-@ 15s bombed his Tunis headquarters as part of Operation Wooden Leg , leaving 73 people dead ; Arafat had gone out jogging that morning . 
 = = = First Intifada = = = 
 During the 1980s , Arafat received financial assistance from Libya , Iraq and Saudi Arabia , which allowed him to reconstruct the badly damaged PLO . This was particularly useful during the First Intifada in December 1987 , which began as an uprising of Palestinians against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip . The word Intifada in Arabic is literally translated as " tremor " , however , it is generally defined as an uprising or revolt . 
 The first stage of the Intifada began following an incident at the Erez checkpoint where four Palestinian residents of the <unk> refugee camp were killed in a traffic accident involving an Israeli driver . Rumors spread that the deaths were a deliberate act of revenge for an Israeli shopper that was stabbed to death by a Palestinian in Gaza four days earlier . Mass rioting broke out and within weeks and partly upon consistent requests by Abu Jihad , Arafat attempted to direct the uprising , which lasted until 1992 – 93 . Abu Jihad had previously been assigned the responsibility of the Palestinian territories within the PLO command and according to biographer Said Aburish , had " impressive knowledge of local conditions " in the Israeli @-@ occupied territories . On 16 April 1988 , as the Intifada was raging , Abu Jihad was assassinated in his Tunis household by an Israeli hit squad . Arafat had considered Abu Jihad as a PLO counterweight to local Palestinian leadership in the territories , and led a funeral procession for him in Damascus . 
 The most common tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was throwing stones , molotov cocktails , and burning tires . The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non @-@ violent protests against Israeli occupation by engaging in tax resistance and other boycotts . Israel responded by confiscating large sums of money in house @-@ to @-@ house raids . As the Intifada came to a close , new armed Palestinian groups — in particular Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( <unk> ) — began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings , and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically . 
 = = = Change in direction = = = 
 In 1970 , Arafat declared : " Our basic aim is to liberate the land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River . We are not concerned with what took place in June 1967 or in eliminating the consequences of the June war . The Palestinian revolution 's basic concern is the uprooting of the Zionist entity from our land and liberating it . " However , in early 1976 , at a meeting with US Senator Adlai Stevenson III , Arafat suggested that if Israel withdrew a " few kilometers " from parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and transferred responsibility to the UN , Arafat could give " something to show his people before he could acknowledge Israel 's right to exist " . 
 On 15 November 1988 , the PLO proclaimed the independent State of Palestine . Though he had frequently been accused of and associated with terrorism , in speeches on 13 and 14 December Arafat repudiated ' terrorism in all its forms , including state terrorism ' . He accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242 and Israel 's right " to exist in peace and security " and Arafat 's statements were greeted with approval by the US administration , which had long insisted on these statements as a necessary starting point for official discussions between the US and the PLO . These remarks from Arafat indicated a shift away from one of the PLO 's primary aims — the destruction of Israel ( as entailed in the Palestinian National Covenant ) – and toward the establishment of two separate entities : an Israeli state within the 1949 armistice lines , and an Arab state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . On 2 April 1989 , Arafat was elected by the Central Council of the Palestine National Council , the governing body of the PLO , to be the president of the proclaimed State of Palestine . 
 Prior to the Gulf War in 1990 – 91 , when the Intifada 's intensity began to wear down , Arafat supported Saddam Hussein 's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US @-@ led coalition attack on Iraq . He made this decision without the consent of other leading members of Fatah and the PLO . Arafat 's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam ; On 17 January 1991 , Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization . Arafat 's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil @-@ producing Arab states that supported the US @-@ led coalition . Many in the US also used Arafat 's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace . After the end of hostilities , many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to the PLO and began providing financial support for the organization 's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups . Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992 , when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash @-@ landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm . Two pilots and an engineer were killed ; Arafat was bruised and shaken . 
 = = Palestinian Authority and peace negotiations = = 
 = = = Oslo Accords = = = 
 In the early 1990s , Arafat and leading Fatah officials engaged the Israeli government in a series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords . The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self @-@ rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five @-@ year period , along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas . The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad , to patrol areas of self @-@ rule . Authority over the various fields of rule , including education and culture , social welfare , direct taxation and tourism , would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government . Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors , including utilities , industry , trade and communication . 
 Prior to signing the accords , Arafat — as Chairman of the PLO and its official representative — signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel . In return , Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , on behalf of Israel , officially recognized the PLO . The following year , Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , along with Shimon Peres . The Palestinian reaction was mixed . The Rejectionist Front of the PLO allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements . It was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon , Syria , and Jordan as well as by many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories . However , the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and Arafat 's promise for peace and economic well @-@ being . 
 = = = Establishing authority in the territories = = = 
 In accordance with the terms of the Oslo agreement , Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas . However , Arab states of the Persian Gulf — Arafat 's usual source for financial backing — still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations because for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War . Ahmed <unk> — a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo — publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt . 
 In 1994 , Arafat moved to Gaza City , which was controlled by the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) — the provisional entity created by the Oslo Accords . Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA , the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC . In July , after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians , the Basic Laws of the Palestinian National Authority was published , in three different versions by the PLO . Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA . He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members . Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus . He began subordinating non @-@ governmental organizations that worked in education , health , and social affairs under his authority by replacing their elected leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him . He then appointed himself chairman of the Palestinian financial organization that was created by the World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity . 
 Arafat established a Palestinian police force , named the Preventive Security Service ( PSS ) , that became active on 13 May . It was mainly composed of PLA soldiers and foreign Palestinian volunteers . Arafat assigned Mohammed Dahlan and Jibril <unk> to head the PSS . Amnesty International accused Arafat and the PNA leadership for failing to adequately investigate abuses by the PSS ( including torture and unlawful killings ) of political opponents and dissidents as well as the arrests of human rights activists . 
 Throughout November and December 1995 , Arafat toured dozens of Palestinian cities and towns that were evacuated by Israeli forces including Jenin , Ramallah , al @-@ Bireh , Nablus , <unk> and Tulkarm , declaring them " liberated " . The PNA also gained control of the West Bank 's postal service during this period . On 20 January 1996 , Arafat was elected president of the PNA , with an overwhelming 88 @.@ 2 percent majority ( the other candidate was charity organizer <unk> Khalil ) . However , because Hamas , the DFLP and other popular opposition movements chose to boycott the presidential elections , the choices were limited . Arafat 's landslide victory guaranteed Fatah 51 of the 88 seats in the PLC . After Arafat was elected to the post of President of the PNA , he was often referred to as the Ra 'is , ( literally president in Arabic ) , although he spoke of himself as " the general " . In 1997 , the PLC accused the executive branch of the PNA of financial mismanagement causing the resignation of four members of Arafat 's cabinet . Arafat refused to resign his post . 
 = = = Other peace agreements = = = 
 In mid @-@ 1996 , Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister of Israel . Palestinian @-@ Israeli relations grew even more hostile as a result of continued conflict . Despite the Israel @-@ PLO accord , Netanyahu opposed the idea of Palestinian statehood . In 1998 , US President Bill Clinton persuaded the two leaders to meet . The resulting Wye River Memorandum detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and PNA to complete the peace process . 
 Arafat continued negotiations with Netanyahu 's successor , Ehud Barak , at the Camp David 2000 Summit in July 2000 . Due partly to his own politics ( Barak was from the leftist Labor Party , whereas Netanyahu was from the rightist Likud Party ) and partly due to insistence for compromise by President Clinton , Barak offered Arafat a Palestinian state in 73 percent of the West Bank and all of the Gaza Strip . The Palestinian percentage of sovereignty would extend to 90 percent over a ten- to twenty @-@ five @-@ year period . Also included in the offer was the return of a small number of refugees and compensation for those not allowed to return . Palestinians would also have " custodianship " over the Temple Mount , sovereignty on all Islamic and Christian holy sites , and three of Jerusalem 's four Old City quarters . Arafat rejected Barak 's offer and refused to make an immediate counter @-@ offer . He told President Clinton that , " the Arab leader who would surrender Jerusalem is not born yet . " 
 After the September 2000 outbreak of the Second Intifada , negotiations continued at the Taba summit in January 2001 ; this time , Ehud Barak pulled out of the talks to campaign in the Israeli elections . In October and December 2001 , suicide bombings by Palestinian militant groups increased and Israeli counter strikes intensified . Following the election of Ariel Sharon in February , the peace process took a steep downfall . Palestinian elections scheduled for January 2002 were postponed — the stated reason was an inability to campaign due to the emergency conditions imposed by the Intifada , as well as IDF incursions and restrictions on freedom of movement in the Palestinian territories . In the same month , Sharon ordered Arafat to be confined to his <unk> 'a headquarters in Ramallah , following an attack in the Israeli city of Hadera ; US President George W. Bush supported Sharon 's action , claiming that Arafat was " an obstacle to the peace . " 
 = = Political survival = = 
 Arafat 's long personal and political survival was taken by most Western commentators as a sign of his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician , given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations . Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel 's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel . Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah . The complex and fragile web of relations between the US , Israel , Saudi Arabia , and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat 's longevity as the leader of the Palestinians . 
 Israel attempted to assassinate Arafat on a number of occasions , but has never used its own agents , preferring instead to " turn " Palestinians close to the intended target , usually using blackmail . According to Alan Hart , the Mossad 's specialty is poison . According to Abu Iyad , two attempts were made on Arafat 's life by the Israeli Mossad and the Military Directorate in 1970 . In 1976 , Abu Sa 'ed , a Palestinian agent working for the Mossad , was enlisted in a plot to put poison pellets that looked like grains of rice in Arafat 's food . Abu Iyad explains that Abu Sa 'ed confessed after he received the order to go ahead , explaining that he was unable to go through with the plot because , " He was first of all a Palestinian and his conscience wouldn 't let him do it . " Arafat claimed in a 1988 interview with Time that because of his fear of assassination by the Israelis , he never slept in the same place two nights in a row . 
 = = = Relations with Hamas and other militant groups = = = 
 Arafat 's ability to adapt to new tactical and political situations was perhaps tested by the rise of the Hamas and <unk> organizations , Islamist groups espousing <unk> policies with Israel . These groups often bombed non @-@ military targets , such as malls and movie theaters , to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties . In the 1990s , these groups seemed to threaten Arafat 's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood . 
 An attack carried out by Hamas militants killed 29 Israeli civilians celebrating Passover , including many senior citizens . In response , Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield , a major military offensive into major West Bank cities . Mahmoud al @-@ <unk> , a Hamas leader in Gaza , stated in September 2010 that Arafat had instructed Hamas to launch what he termed " military operations " against Israel in 2000 when Arafat felt that negotiations with Israel would not succeed . 
 Some Israeli government officials opined in 2002 that the armed Fatah sub @-@ group al @-@ Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades commenced attacks towards Israel in order to compete with Hamas . On 6 May 2002 , the Israeli government released a report , based in part on documents , allegedly captured during the Israeli raid of Arafat 's Ramallah headquarters , which allegedly included copies of papers signed by Arafat authorizing funding for al @-@ Aqsa Martyrs Brigades ' activities . The report implicated Arafat in the " planning and execution of terror attacks " . 
 = = = Attempts to marginalize = = = 
 Persistent attempts by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed . Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that , given his own history , would normally have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him . Marwan Barghouti ( a leader of al @-@ Aqsa Martyrs Brigades ) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada , but Israel had him arrested for allegedly being involved in the killing of twenty @-@ six civilians , and he was sentenced to five life terms . 
 Arafat was finally allowed to leave his compound on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement : six PFLP militants , including the organization 's secretary @-@ general Ahmad Sa <unk> , wanted by Israel , who had been holed up with Arafat in his compound , would be transferred to international custody in Jericho . After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted . With that , and a promise that he would issue a call to the Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis , Arafat was released . He issued such a call on 8 May . On 19 September 2002 , the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat . In March 2003 , Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US . 
 After the Israeli security Cabinet on 11 September 2003 had decided that " Israel will act to remove this obstacle [ Arafat ] in the manner , at the time , and in the ways that will be decided on separately " , Israeli Cabinet members and officials had hinted on Arafat 's death and the Israeli military had begun making preparations for Arafat 's possible expulsion in the near future , many feared for his life . Israeli peace activists of Gush Shalom , Knesset members and others went into the Presidential Compound , prepared to serve as a human shield . The compound remained under siege until Arafat 's transfer to a French hospital , shortly before his death . 
 In 2004 , President Bush dismissed Arafat as a negotiating partner , saying he had " failed as a leader " and accused him of undercutting Abbas when he was prime minister ( Abbas resigned the same year he was given the position ) . Arafat had a mixed relationship with the leaders of other Arab nations . His support from Arab leaders tended to increase whenever he was pressured by Israel ; for example , when Israel declared in 2003 it had made the decision , in principle , to remove him from the Israeli @-@ controlled West Bank . In an interview with the Arabic news network Al Jazeera , Arafat responded to Ariel Sharon 's suggestion that he be exiled from the Palestinian territories permanently , by stating , " Is it his [ Sharon 's ] homeland or ours ? We were planted here before the Prophet Abraham came , but it looks like they [ Israelis ] don 't understand history or geography . " 
 = = Financial dealings = = 
 Under the Oslo Peace Accords , Israel undertook to deposit the VAT tax receipts on goods purchased by Palestinians into the Palestinian treasury . Until 2000 , these monies were transferred directly to Arafat 's personal accounts at Bank Leumi , in Tel Aviv . 
 In August 2002 , the Israeli Military Intelligence Chief alleged that Arafat 's personal wealth was in the range of US $ 1 @.@ 3 billion . In 2003 the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) conducted an audit of the PNA and stated that Arafat diverted $ 900 million in public funds to a special bank account controlled by Arafat and the PNA Chief Economic Financial adviser . However , the IMF did not claim that there were any improprieties , and it specifically stated that most of the funds had been used to invest in Palestinian assets , both internally and abroad . 
 However , in 2003 , a team of American accountants — hired by Arafat 's own finance ministry — began examining Arafat 's finances . In its conclusions , the team claimed that part of the Palestinian leader 's wealth was in a secret portfolio worth close to $ 1 billion , with investments in companies like a Coca @-@ Cola bottling plant in Ramallah , a Tunisian cell phone company and venture capital funds in the US and the Cayman Islands . The head of the investigation stated that " although the money for the portfolio came from public funds like Palestinian taxes , virtually none of it was used for the Palestinian people ; it was all controlled by Arafat . And none of these dealings were made public . " An investigation conducted by the General Accounting Office reported that Arafat and the PLO held over $ 10 billion in assets even at the time when he was publicly claiming bankruptcy . 
 Although Arafat lived a modest lifestyle , Dennis Ross , former Middle East negotiator for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton , stated that Arafat 's " walking @-@ around money " financed a vast patronage system known as <unk> . According to Salam Fayyad — a former World Bank official whom Arafat appointed Finance Minister of the PNA in 2002 — Arafat 's commodity monopolies could accurately be seen as gouging his own people , " especially in Gaza which is poorer , which is something that is totally unacceptable and immoral . " Fayyad claims that Arafat used $ 20 million from public funds to pay the leadership of the PNA security forces ( the Preventive Security Service ) alone . 
 Fuad <unk> , former financial aide to Arafat , told the Israeli security service Shin Bet that Arafat used several million dollars of aid money to buy weapons and support militant groups . During Israel 's Operation Defensive Shield , the Israel army recovered counterfeit money and documents from Arafat 's Ramallah headquarters . The documents showed that , in 2001 , Arafat personally approved payments to <unk> militants . The Palestinians claimed that the counterfeit money was confiscated from criminal elements . 
 = = Illness and death = = 
 The first reports of Arafat 's failing health by his doctors for what his spokesman said was the flu came on 25 October 2004 , after he vomited during a staff meeting . His condition deteriorated in the following days . Following visits by other doctors , including teams from Tunisia , Jordan , and Egypt — and agreement by Israel to allow him to travel — Arafat was taken to France on a French government jet , and was admitted to the Percy military hospital in <unk> , a suburb of Paris . On 3 November , he had lapsed into a gradually deepening coma . 
 Arafat was pronounced dead at 03 : 30 UTC on 11 November 2004 at the age of 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident ( hemorrhagic stroke ) . Initially , Arafat 's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials , and Arafat 's wife refused an autopsy . French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation , although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition . When Arafat 's death was announced , the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning , with Qur 'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , and tires burned in the streets . The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning . 
 = = = Funeral = = = 
 On 11 November 2004 , a French Army Honor Guard held a brief ceremony for Arafat , with his coffin draped in a Palestinian flag . A military band played the French and Palestinian national anthems , and a Chopin funeral march . French President Jacques Chirac stood alone beside Arafat 's coffin for about ten minutes in a last show of respect for Arafat , whom he hailed as " a man of courage " . The next day , Arafat 's body was flown from Paris aboard a French Air Force transport plane to Cairo , Egypt for a brief military funeral there , attended by several heads of states , prime ministers and foreign ministers . Egypt 's top Muslim cleric Sayed Tantawi led mourning prayers preceding the funeral procession . 
 Israel refused Arafat 's wish to be buried near the Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque or anywhere in Jerusalem , citing security concerns . Israel also feared that his burial would strengthen Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem . Following the Cairo procession , Arafat was " temporarily " buried within the <unk> in Ramallah ; tens of thousands of Palestinians attended the ceremony . Arafat was buried in a stone , rather than wooden , coffin , and Palestinian spokesman Saeb Erekat said that Arafat would be reburied in East Jerusalem following the establishment of a Palestinian state . After Sheikh <unk> Tamimi discovered that Arafat was buried improperly and in a coffin — which is not in accordance with Islamic law — Arafat was reburied on the morning of 13 November at around 3 : 00 am . On 10 November 2007 , prior to the third anniversary of Arafat 's death , President Mahmoud Abbas unveiled a mausoleum for Arafat near his tomb in commemoration of him . 
 = = = Theories about the cause of death = = = 
 Numerous theories have appeared regarding Arafat 's death , with the most prominent being poisoning ( possibly by polonium ) and AIDS @-@ related illnesses , as well as liver disease or a platelet disorder . 
 In September 2005 , an Israeli @-@ declared AIDS expert claimed that Arafat bore all the symptoms of AIDS based on obtained medical records . But others , including Patrice Mangin of the University of Lausanne and The New York Times disagreed with this claim , insisting that Arafat 's record indicated that it was highly unlikely that the cause of his death was AIDS . Arafat 's personal doctor Ashraf al @-@ <unk> and aide Bassam Abu Sharif maintained that Arafat was poisoned , possibly by thallium . A senior Israeli physician concluded that Arafat died from food poisoning . Both those claims were rejected by Haaretz and The New York Times . Then @-@ Palestinian foreign minister Nabil <unk> had also ruled out poisoning after talks with Arafat 's French doctors . 
 On 4 July 2012 , Al Jazeera published the results of a nine @-@ month investigation , which revealed that none of the causes of Arafat ’ s death suggested in several rumors could be true . Tests carried out by a Swiss scientific experts found traces of polonium in quantities much higher than could occur naturally on Arafat 's personal belongings . On 12 October 2013 , the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer @-@ reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat 's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium @-@ free , suggesting that Arafat could have died of polonium poisoning . 
 On 27 November 2012 , three teams of international investigators , a French , a Swiss , and a Russian team , collected samples from Arafat 's body and the surrounding soil in the mausoleum in Ramallah , to carry out an investigation independently from each other . 
 On 6 November 2013 , Al Jazeera reported that the Swiss forensic team had found levels of polonium in Arafat 's ribs and pelvis 18 to 36 times the average , and were 83 percent confident that polonium poisoning occurred , but Professor <unk> disagreed with this interpretation by Al Jazeera and only states that the poisoning hypothesis by polonium is " reasonably supported " . According to the Swiss expert team ( including notably experts in radio @-@ chemistry , radio @-@ physics and legal medicine ) , on a probability scale ranging from one to six , death by polonium poisoning is around five . Forensic Biologist Nathan Lents of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice , said the report 's results are consistent with a possible polonium poisoning , but " There 's certainly not a smoking gun here . " Derek Hill , a professor in radiological science at University College London who was not involved in the investigation , said " I would say it 's clearly not overwhelming proof , and there is a risk of contamination ( of the samples ) , but it is a pretty strong signal . ... It seems likely what they 're doing is putting a very cautious interpretation of strong data . " 
 On 26 December 2013 , a team of Russian scientists released a report saying they had found no trace of radioactive poisoning — a finding that comes after the French report found traces of the radioactive isotope polonium . Vladimir <unk> , the head of the Federal Medical and Biological Agency , said that Arafat died of natural causes ( without explaining which ) and the agency had no plans to conduct further tests . Unlike the Swiss report , the French and Russian reports were not made public , at the time . The Swiss experts read the French and Russian reports and explained that the radiologic data measured by the other teams support their conclusions of a probable death by polonium poisoning .

 Massospondylus ( / <unk> / mas @-@ oh @-@ <unk> @-@ di @-@ <unk> ; from Greek , <unk> ( <unk> , " longer " ) and <unk> ( <unk> , " vertebra " ) ) is a genus of sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Early Jurassic Period ( Hettangian to Pliensbachian ages , ca . 200 – 183 million years ago ) . It was described by Sir Richard Owen in 1854 from remains discovered in South Africa , and is thus one of the first dinosaurs to have been named . Fossils have since been found at other locations in South Africa , Lesotho , and Zimbabwe . Material from Arizona 's Kayenta Formation , India , and Argentina has been assigned to this genus at various times , but the Arizonan and Argentinian material are now assigned to other genera . 
 The type species is M. carinatus ; seven other species have been named during the past 150 years , but only M. kaalae among these is still considered valid . Early sauropodomorphs systematics have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years , and many scientists disagree where exactly Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree . The family name Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus , but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph relationships is in a state of flux , it is unclear which other dinosaurs — if any — belong in a natural grouping of <unk> ; several 2007 papers support the family 's validity . 
 Although Massospondylus was long depicted as quadrupedal , a 2007 study found it to be bipedal . It was probably a plant eater ( herbivore ) , although it is speculated that the early sauropodomorphs may have been omnivorous . This animal , which was 4 – 6 metres ( 13 – 20 ft ) long , had a long neck and tail , with a small head and slender body . On each of its forefeet , it bore a sharp thumb claw that was used in defense or feeding . Recent studies indicate that Massospondylus grew steadily throughout its lifespan , possessed air sacs similar to those of birds , and may have cared for its young . 
 = = Description = = 
 Massospondylus was a mid @-@ size sauropodomorph , around 4 metres ( 13 ft ) in length and weighed approximately 1000 kilograms ( 2200 lb ) , although a few sources have estimated its length at up to 6 metres ( 20 ft ) . It was a typical early sauropodomorph , with a slender body , a long neck and a proportionally very small head . The vertebral column was composed of nine cervical ( neck ) vertebrae , 13 dorsal ( back ) vertebrae , three sacral ( hip ) vertebrae , and at least 40 caudal ( tail ) vertebrae . The pubis faced forward , as with most saurischians . It had a slighter build than that of Plateosaurus , an otherwise similar dinosaur . The neck was proportionally longer than in most other <unk> , with the foremost cervicals being four times the length of their width . The forelimbs were only half the length of the hindlimbs but quite powerful , as indicated by the broad upper end of the humerus that provided attachment areas for a large arm musculature . Like Plateosaurus , it had five digits on each hand and foot . The hand was short and wide , with a large sickle shaped thumb claw used for feeding or defense against predators . The thumb was the longest finger in the hand , while the fourth and fifth digits were tiny , giving the forepaws a lopsided look . 
 = = = Cranial anatomy = = = 
 The small head of Massospondylus was approximately half the length of the femur . Numerous openings , or fenestrae , in the skull reduced its weight and provided space for muscle attachment and sensory organs . These fenestrae were present in pairs , one on each side of the skull . At the front of the skull were two large , elliptical nares , which were roughly half the size of the orbits . The orbits were proportionally larger in Massospondylus than in related genera , such as Plateosaurus . The antorbital fenestrae , smaller than those seen in Plateosaurus , were situated between the eyes and the nose . At the rear of the skull were two more pairs of temporal fenestrae : the lateral temporal fenestrae immediately behind the eye sockets , which were shaped like an inverted " T " in Massospondylus , and the supratemporal fenestrae on top of the skull . Small fenestrae also penetrated each mandible . The shape of the skull is traditionally restored as wider and shorter than that of Plateosaurus , but this appearance may be due just to differential crushing experienced by the various specimens . Some features of the skull are variable between individuals ; for example , the thickness of the upper border of the orbit and the height of the posterior maxilla . These differences may be due to sexual dimorphism or individual variation . 
 Tooth count is variable between individuals and increases with skull size . The premaxilla shows the constant number of four teeth per side in all known skulls ; however , in the maxilla , the tooth count ranges from 14 to 22 . There are 26 teeth in each side of the lower jaw in the largest known skull . The height of the teeth crowns decreases from front to back in the upper jaw , but was more or less constant in the lower jaw . The lack of pronounced tooth wear and the variable height of the crowns suggests that the teeth were replaced by succeeding new ones in relatively short time intervals . Notably , there was variation in the tooth morphology based on the position of the teeth in the jaw . The heterodonty present in Massospondylus is greater than that present in Plateosaurus , although not as pronounced as the specialization of teeth in Heterodontosaurus . Teeth closer to the front of the snout had round cross @-@ sections and tapered to points , unlike the back teeth , which were spatulate and had oval cross @-@ sections . 
 As with other early sauropodomorphs , it has been proposed that Massospondylus had cheeks . This theory was proposed because there are a few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones , unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of <unk> reptiles . The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate . Crompton and <unk> ( 1986 ) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced <unk> and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw to make up the difference in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout . However , the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top – bottom plane , and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The first fossils of Massospondylus were described by paleontologist Sir Richard Owen in 1854 . Originally , Owen did not recognize these finds as those of a dinosaur ; instead he attributed them to " large , extinct , carnivorous reptiles " that were related to today 's lizards , chameleons and iguanas . This material , a collection of 56 bones , was found in 1853 by the government surveyor Joseph Millard Orpen in the Upper Elliot Formation at <unk> , South Africa and was donated to the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London . Among the remains were vertebrae from the neck , back , and tail ; a shoulder blade ; a humerus ; a partial pelvis ; a femur ; a tibia ; and bones of the hands and feet . All these bones were found disarticulated , making it difficult to determine if all material belongs to a single species or not . However , Owen was able to distinguish three different types of caudal vertebrae , which he attributed to three different genera : Pachyspondylus , Leptospondylus and Massospondylus . Massospondylus was separated from the other two genera on the basis of its much longer caudal vertebrae , which also lead to the scientific name that has been derived from the Greek terms <unk> / <unk> ' longer ' and <unk> / <unk> ' vertebra ' . However , later it was shown that the putative caudal vertebrae of Massospondylus were actually cervical vertebrae and that all the material probably belongs only to a single species . On May 10 , 1941 , the Hunterian Museum was demolished by a German bomb , destroying all the fossils ; only casts remain . 
 Possible Massospondylus remains have been found in the Upper Elliot Formation , the Clarens Formation , and the Bushveld Sandstone of South Africa and Lesotho ; the Forest Sandstone and the Upper <unk> Sandstone of Zimbabwe . These remains consist of at least 80 partial skeletons and four skulls , representing both juveniles and adults . The report of Massospondylus from Arizona 's Kayenta Formation is based on a skull described in 1985 . The skull of the Kayenta specimen from Arizona is 25 % larger than the largest skull from any African specimen . The Kayenta specimen possesses four teeth in the premaxilla and sixteen in the maxilla . Uniquely among dinosaurs , it also had tiny , one @-@ <unk> ( 0 @.@ 04 in- ) long palatal teeth . Recent restudy of African Massospondylus skulls , however , indicates that the Kayenta specimen does not pertain to Massospondylus . This Kayenta skull and associated postcranial elements , identified collectively as MCZ 8893 , has been recently referred to the newly described genus <unk> . 
 Massospondylus had also been reported from Argentina , but this has been reassessed as a closely related but distinct genus . The fossils included several partial skeletons and at least one skull , found in the Lower Jurassic Canon del Colorado Formation of San Juan , Argentina . This material was named <unk> in 2009 . 
 = = = Species = = = 
 Many species have been named , although most are no longer considered valid . M. carinatus , named by Richard Owen , is the type species . Other named species include : M. browni Seeley , 1895 , M. harriesi Broom 1911 , M. hislopi Lydekker , 1890 , M. huenei Cooper , 1981 , M. kaalae Barrett 2009 , M. rawesi Lydekker , 1890 , and M. schwarzi Haughton , 1924 . 
 M. browni , M. harriesi , and M. schwarzi were all found in the Upper Elliot Formation of Cape Province , South Africa . All three are based on fragmentary material , and were regarded as indeterminate in the most recent review . M. browni is based on two cervical , two back , and three caudal vertebrae and miscellaneous hind limb elements . M. harriesi is known from a well @-@ preserved forelimb and parts of a hindlimb . M. schwarzi is known from an incomplete hind limb and sacrum . M. hislopi and M. rawesi were named from fossils found in India . M. hislopi is based on vertebrae from the Upper Triassic Maleri Formation of Andhra Pradesh , whereas M. rawesi is based on a tooth from the Upper Cretaceous <unk> Formation of Maharashtra . M. hislopi was tentatively retained as an indeterminate sauropodomorph in the latest review , but M. rawesi may be a theropod or <unk> . M. huenei is a combination derived by Cooper for Lufengosaurus huenei , as he considered Lufengosaurus and Massospondylus to be synonyms . This synonymy is no longer accepted . 
 M. kaalae was described in 2009 on the basis of a partial skull from the Upper Elliot Formation in Eastern Cape of South Africa . This species is known from the same time and region as some specimens of M. carinatus . It differs from the type species in the morphology of the braincase , as well as in several other characters of the skull such as the proportions of the premaxilla . 
 = = = Dubious names = = = 
 Several dinosaurs are often considered synonymous with Massospondylus . These include the above @-@ mentioned Leptospondylus and Pachyspondylus , as well as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> taylori and <unk> , which are dubious names of little scientific value . <unk> <unk> was named by Harry Seeley in 1894 . According to Broom ( 1911 ) , " Originally most of the skeleton was in the rock , and it was regarded by the farmers as the skeleton of a Bushman , but it is said to have been destroyed through fear that a Bushman skeleton in the rock might tend to weaken the religious belief of the rising generation . " Seeley however , states that most of the skeleton was lost by a failed attempt to free it from the rock by using gunpowder . Some partial leg bones were salvaged . Together with Massospondylus carinatus , Owen named Leptospondylus capensis and Pachyspondylus <unk> . <unk> erectus was named by <unk> van <unk> in 1920 based on a nearly complete skeleton . <unk> also named <unk> gracilis , which consisted of a partial skeleton . <unk> taylori was named by Sidney H. Haughton in 1924 . It consists of hip bones . All of the above fossils come from the Hettangian or Sinemurian faunal stages of South Africa , where Massospondylus has been found . Under the rules of zoological nomenclature , these names are junior synonyms . They were named after Massospondylus was described in a scientific paper ; the name Massospondylus thus takes priority . 
 <unk> , known from a young specimen , may also be synonymous with Massospondylus . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Basal sauropodomorph systematics continue to undergo revision , and many genera once considered classic " prosauropods " have recently been removed from the group in phylogenetic nomenclature , on the grounds that their inclusion would not constitute a clade ( a natural grouping containing all descendants of a single common ancestor ) . Yates and Kitching ( 2003 ) published a clade consisting of Riojasaurus , Plateosaurus , Coloradisaurus , Massospondylus , and Lufengosaurus . Galton and Upchurch ( 2004 ) included <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Coloradisaurus , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Lufengosaurus , Massospondylus , Melanorosaurus , Mussaurus , Plateosaurus , Riojasaurus , <unk> , Saturnalia , Sellosaurus , <unk> , <unk> and Yunnanosaurus in a monophyletic Prosauropoda . Wilson ( 2005 ) considered Massospondylus , <unk> , Plateosaurus , and Lufengosaurus a natural group , with Blikanasaurus and <unk> possible sauropods . <unk> and Yates ( 2007 ) considered <unk> , Blikanasaurus and Melanorosaurus possible sauropods . Yates ( 2007 ) placed <unk> , Melanorosaurus , and Blikanasaurus as basal sauropods and declined to use the term Prosauropoda , as he considered it synonymous with Plateosauridae . However , he did not rule out the possibility that a small group of prosauropods consisting of Plateosaurus , Riojasaurus , Massospondylus and their closest kin were monophyletic . 
 Massospondylus is the type genus of the proposed family Massospondylidae , to which it gives its name . The Massospondylidae family may also include Yunnanosaurus , although Lu et al . ( 2007 ) placed Yunnanosaurus in its own family . Yates ( 2007 ) considered Massospondylus , Coloradisaurus , and Lufengosaurus <unk> , with Yunnanosaurus in <unk> . Smith and Pol ( 2007 ) also found a Massospondylidae in their phylogenetic analysis , including Massospondylus , Coloradisaurus , and Lufengosaurus , as well as their new genus , Glacialisaurus . <unk> , based on the fossils once thought to belong to a South American form of Massospondylus , was also classified as a <unk> , as was <unk> , another South American genus that was named in 2011 . Pradhania was originally regarded as a more basal sauropodomorph but new cladistic analysis performed by Novas et al . , 2011 suggests that Pradhania is a <unk> . Pradhania presents two shared traits of the Massospondylidae recovered in their phylogenetic analysis , and the fossils of Pradhania were discovered from the same region and basin in India as M. hislopi . 
 = = Paleoecology = = 
 The faunas and floras of the Early Jurassic were similar worldwide , with conifers adapted for hot weather becoming the common plants ; basal sauropodomorphs and theropods were the main constituents of a worldwide dinosaur fauna . The environment of early Jurassic southern Africa has been described as a desert . African Massospondylus was a contemporary of <unk> ; turtles ; a <unk> ; <unk> ; early crocodylomorphs ; <unk> and <unk> therapsids ; <unk> mammals ; and dinosaurs including the small theropod Megapnosaurus <unk> and several genera of early ornithischians , such as Lesothosaurus and the heterodontosaurids Abrictosaurus , Heterodontosaurus , Lycorhinus and Pegomastax . Until recently , Massospondylus was regarded as the only known sauropodomorph from the Upper Elliot Formation . However , newer finds revealed a diverse contemporary sauropodomorph fauna with six additional species , including <unk> , <unk> and two unnamed taxa as well as two unnamed sauropods . 
 It is not clear which carnivores may have preyed on Massospondylus . Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age in southern Africa , such as Megapnosaurus , were smaller than mid @-@ sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus . These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to wear <unk> , which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws . The 6 @-@ <unk> ( 20 <unk> ) long carnivorous theropod <unk> lived during the same period ( Hettangian to Sinemurian stages ) as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 As with all dinosaurs , much of the biology of Massospondylus , including its behavior , coloration , and physiology , remains unknown . However , recent studies have allowed for informed speculation on subjects such as growth patterns , diet , posture , reproduction , and respiration . 
 A 2007 study suggested that Massospondylus may have used its short arms for defense against predators ( " defensive <unk> " ) , in intraspecies combat , or in feeding , although its arms were too short to reach its mouth . Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex ( thumb ) claw in combat , to strip plant material from trees , digging , or for grooming . 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 A 2005 study indicated that Massospondylus ' sister taxon , Plateosaurus , exhibited growth patterns affected by environmental factors . The study indicated that , when food was plentiful or when the climate was favorable , Plateosaurus exhibited accelerated growth . This pattern of growth is called " developmental plasticity " . It is unseen in other dinosaurs , including Massospondylus , despite the close relationship between the two . The study indicated that Massospondylus grew along a specific growth trajectory , with little variation in the growth rate and ultimate size of an individual . Another study of age determination indicated that Massospondylus grew at a maximum rate of 34 @.@ 6 kg ( 76 @.@ 3 lb ) per year and was still growing at around 15 years of age . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Early sauropodomorphs such as Massospondylus may have been herbivorous or omnivorous . As recently as the 1980s , paleontologists debated the possibility of carnivory in the " prosauropods " . However , the hypothesis of carnivorous " prosauropods " has been discredited , and all recent studies favor a herbivorous or omnivorous lifestyle for these animals . Galton and Upchurch ( 2004 ) found that cranial characteristics ( such as jaw articulation ) of most basal sauropodomorphs are closer to those of herbivorous reptiles than those of carnivorous ones , and the shape of the tooth crown is similar to those of modern herbivorous or omnivorous iguanas . The maximum width of the crown was greater than that of the root , resulting in a cutting edge similar to those of extant herbivorous or omnivorous reptiles . Barrett ( 2000 ) proposed that basal sauropodomorphs supplemented their herbivorous diets with small prey or carrion . <unk> ( gizzard stones ) have been found in association with three Massospondylus fossils from the Forest @-@ Sandstone in Zimbabwe , and with a Massospondylus @-@ like animal from the Late Triassic of Virginia . Until recently , scientists believed that these stones functioned as a gastric mill to aid ingestion of plant material , compensating for its inability to chew , as it is the case in many modern birds . However , Wings and Sander ( 2007 ) showed that the polished nature and the abundance of those stones precluded a use as an effective gastric mill in most non @-@ theropod dinosaurs , including Massospondylus . 
 = = = Gait and range of motion = = = 
 Although long assumed to have been quadrupedal , a 2007 anatomical study of the forelimbs has questioned this , arguing that their limited range of motion precluded effective habitual quadrupedal gait . Neither could the forelimbs swing fore and behind in a fashion similar to the hindlimbs , nor could the hand be rotated with the palmar surfaces facing downwards . This inability to pronate the hand is also supported by in @-@ situ finds of articulated ( still @-@ connected ) arms that always show <unk> hands with palmar faces facing each other . The study also ruled out the possibility of " knuckle @-@ walking " and other forms of locomotion that would make an effective locomotion possible without the need to pronate the hand . Although its mass suggests a quadrupedal nature , Massospondylus would have been restricted to its hind legs for locomotion . 
 Since the discovery of rudimentary and nonfunctional clavicles in ceratopsians , it was assumed that these shoulder bones were reduced in all dinosaurs that did not have true <unk> . Robert Bakker ( 1987 ) suggested that this would have allowed the shoulder blades to swing with the forelimbs in quadrupedal dinosaurs , increasing their functional forelimb length . This would have reduced the discrepancy of length between fore- and hindlimbs in a quadrupedal Massospondylus . However , a recent discovery shows that Massospondylus possessed well @-@ developed clavicles that were joined in a furcula @-@ like arrangement , acting like a clasp between the right and left shoulder blades and prohibiting any rotation of these bones . This discovery indicates that the clavicle reduction is limited to the evolutionary line leading to the ceratopsians . It also indicates that the furcula of birds is derived from clavicles . 
 Michael Cooper ( 1981 ) noted that the zygapophyses of the neck vertebrae were inclined , prohibiting significant horizontal movement of the neck , so that " consequently any significant movement in this direction must have been accomplished by a change in the position of the entire body " . This was contradicted in a recent study , noting that only the basalmost cervicals show inclined zygapophyses , allowing sufficient horizontal movement of the neck as a whole . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 In 1976 , a clutch of seven 190 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old Massospondylus eggs was found in Golden Gate Highlands National Park in South Africa by James Kitching , who identified them as most likely belonging to Massospondylus . It was nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15 @-@ <unk> ( 6 in- ) long embryos . They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found . By early 2012 , at least 10 egg clutches from at least four fossiliferous horizons had been found , with up to 34 eggs per clutch . This indicates that this nesting site may have been used repeatedly ( site fidelity ) , by groups of animals ( colonial nesting ) ; in both cases , these represent the oldest evidence of this behaviour . Sedimentary structures indicate that the nesting area was in the vicinity of a lake . The eggshells were very thin ( about 0 @.@ 1 mm ) , allowing gas exchange even in a low oxygen and carbon dioxide rich environment , which indicates that the eggs were at least partly buried in the substrate . There are no hints that Massospondylus constructed nests ; however , the arrangement of the eggs in tight rows indicates that the eggs were pushed in this position by the adults . 
 The embryos probably represented near @-@ hatchlings . While the skeletal features were similar to those of the adults , the body proportions were very dissimilar . The head was big with a short snout and very large orbits , whose diameter amounts 39 % of the entire skull length . The neck was short , contrasting to the very long neck in the adults . Girdle bones and caudals were relatively tiny . The forelimbs were of equal length to the hindlimbs , indicating that newly hatched Massospondylus were quadrupedal , unlike the bipedal adults . The discovery of hatching footprints with manus impressions confirmed their quadrupedality . These impressions show that the hand was not pronated , with palm faces facing each other and the thumb facing forwards . The <unk> manus and the big head indicate that an effective locomotion was not possible for newly hatched Massospondylus . Notably , the near @-@ hatchings had no teeth , suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves . Based on the lack of teeth and the ineffective locomotion , scientists speculate that postnatal care might have been necessary . This is further supported by evidence that the hatchings remained at the nest sites until they had doubled in size . 
 Newly hatched juveniles are known from a second sauropodomorph , Mussaurus ; these remains resemble those of the embryonic Massospondylus , suggesting that quadrupedality was present in newly hatched Mussaurus and presumably other basal sauropodomorphs as well . The quadrupedality of the hatchings suggests that the quadrupedal posture of later sauropods may have evolved from retention of juvenile characteristics in adult animals , an evolutionary phenomenon known as <unk> . This discovery therefore " sheds some light in the evolutionary pathways through which the peculiar adaptations of giant dinosaurs were attained " , stated French paleontologist Eric Buffetaut . 
 = = = Respiratory system = = = 
 Many saurischian dinosaurs possessed vertebrae and ribs that contained hollowed @-@ out cavities ( pneumatic foramina ) , which reduced the weight of the bones and may have served as a basic ' flow @-@ through ventilation ' system similar to that of modern birds . In such a system , the neck vertebrae and ribs are hollowed out by the cervical air sac ; the upper back vertebrae , by the lung ; and the lower back and sacral ( hip ) vertebrae , by the abdominal air sac . These organs constitute a complex and very efficient method of respiration . " <unk> " are the only major group of saurischians without an extensive system of pneumatic foramina . Although possible pneumatic indentations have been found in Plateosaurus and <unk> , the indentations were very small . One study in 2007 concluded that basal sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs , based on the evidence for them in sister taxa ( theropods and sauropods ) . The study concluded that it was impossible to determine whether basal sauropodomorphs had a bird @-@ like flow @-@ through lung , but that the air sacs were almost certainly present .

 = Quagga catshark = 
 The quagga catshark ( Halaelurus quagga ) is a species of catshark , belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae . A small , slim @-@ bodied shark reaching 37 cm ( 15 in ) in length , it has a distinctive color pattern of narrow , dark brown vertical bars , which resemble those of the quagga . Its head is short and flattened , with a pointed snout tip that is not upturned . 
 Little is known of the quagga catshark 's natural history , as it is known only from nine specimens caught off southwestern India and eastern Somalia . Inhabiting the offshore waters of continental shelf at depths of 59 – 220 m ( 194 – 722 ft ) or more , it is a bottom @-@ dwelling predator of shrimps . It exhibits an oviparous mode of reproduction , with a record of a female containing eight eggs that were enclosed in brown capsules bearing long tendrils at the corners . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species . It is not economically valued but is taken as bycatch . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first specimen of the quagga catshark was a 27 cm ( 11 in ) long adult male collected by the paddle steamer <unk> Investigator from a depth of 187 m ( 614 ft ) off the Malabar Coast of India . It was described by British naturalist Alfred William Alcock in A Descriptive Catalogue of the Indian Deep @-@ sea Fishes in the Indian Museum , published in 1899 . He assigned the new species to the genus Scyllium ( a synonym of Scyliorhinus ) and named it after the quagga ( Equus quagga quagga ) because of their similar color patterns . Later authors moved this species to the genus Halaelurus . 
 Only nine quagga catshark specimens have been recorded . In addition to Alcock 's type specimen , four males were <unk> from off the eastern Somalian coast by the research ship RV Anton Bruun in 1964 . Four more individuals , two male and two female , were found amongst the contents of commercial fishing trawls conducted off Quilon , India in 2010 . A male specimen reported from the Gulf of Aden in 1939 was later re @-@ identified as a speckled catshark ( H. <unk> ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 Slender and firm @-@ bodied , the quagga catshark has a short and flattened head with a pointed snout . The slightly protruding tip of the snout is not upturned like in some other Halaelurus species . The anterior rims of the nostrils bear triangular flaps of skin . The small , horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and have rudimentary nictitating membranes ; below the eyes are thick ridges , and behind them are tiny spiracles . The rather large mouth is curved , with the upper teeth exposed when closed . There are short furrows at the corners of the mouth . The jaws contain 26 – 28 upper and 27 lower tooth rows on each side ; in addition , there are three tooth rows at the upper symphysis ( jaw midpoint ) and one row at the lower . The teeth have three cusps . The five pairs of gill slits are placed higher than the level of the mouth ; the fifth pair are smaller than the rest . 
 The moderately large and rounded pectoral fins are positioned fairly close to the pelvic fins . Adult males have thin , tapering claspers with a denticle @-@ covered knob on the outer side near the tip . The first dorsal fin is placed just behind the pelvic fin bases , while the larger second dorsal fin is placed just behind the anal fin . The anal fin is larger than the second dorsal fin and comparable in size to the pelvic fins . The caudal fin has a small but discernible lower lobe and a large upper lobe with a notch in its trailing margin . The thick skin is covered by dermal denticles , which have arrowhead @-@ shaped crowns with a central ridge and three posterior teeth . This shark has a striking dorsal color pattern consisting of over 20 narrow , dark brown vertical bars on a light brown background ; the bars run from the head to the tail and extend onto the dorsal fins . The underside is off @-@ white , and the pectoral , pelvic , and anal fins have pale trailing margins . The largest known specimen is 37 cm ( 15 in ) long . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The known specimens of the quagga catshark have been collected from the Laccadive Sea off southwestern India and from the Indian Ocean off Somalia . The Indian sharks were caught between the depths of 90 and 220 m ( 300 and 720 ft ) or possibly 280 m ( 920 ft ) , while the Somalian sharks were caught at depths of 59 to 70 m ( 194 to 230 ft ) . This is a bottom @-@ dwelling species found far from shore over the continental shelf . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The diet of the quagga catshark consists of deep @-@ living shrimps . Its reproduction is oviparous like the other members of its genus . One of the female Indian specimens was gravid with eight eggs , divided evenly between the two oviducts . The eggs are enclosed in brown purse @-@ shaped capsules measuring 3 @.@ 8 – 4 @.@ 0 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) in length , with long coiled tendrils at their four corners . The smallest known specimen is 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) long , which is probably close to the size at hatching . Males reach sexual maturity at between 28 and 35 cm ( 11 and 14 in ) long ; female maturation size is unknown . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The quagga catshark is harmless and is not utilized by humans . It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear ; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters , though specific data on this species is lacking . Therefore , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it as Data Deficient . 
 = Japanese battleship Haruna = 
 Haruna ( <unk> ) , named after Mount Haruna , was a warship of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War I and World War II . Designed by the British naval engineer George Thurston , she was the fourth and last battlecruiser of the Kongō class , amongst the most heavily armed ships in any navy when built . Laid down in 1912 at the Kawasaki Shipyards in Kobe , Haruna was formally commissioned in 1915 on the same day as her sister ship , Kirishima . Haruna patrolled off the Chinese coast during World War I. During gunnery drills in 1920 , an explosion destroyed one of her guns , damaged the gun turret , and killed seven men . During her career , Haruna underwent two major reconstructions . Beginning in 1926 , the Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt her as a battleship , strengthening her armor and improving her speed and power capabilities . In 1933 , her superstructure was completely rebuilt , her speed was increased , and she was equipped with launch catapults for floatplanes . Now fast enough to accompany Japan 's growing carrier fleet , Haruna was reclassified as a fast battleship . During the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War , Haruna transported Imperial Japanese Army troops to mainland China before being redeployed to the Third Battleship Division in 1941 . On the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , she sailed as part of the Southern Force in preparation for the Battle of Singapore . 
 Haruna fought in almost every major naval action of the Pacific Theater during World War II . She covered the Japanese landings in Malaya ( in present @-@ day Malaysia ) and the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) in 1942 before engaging American forces at the Battle of Midway and during the Guadalcanal Campaign . Throughout 1943 , Haruna primarily remained at Truk Lagoon ( Micronesia ) , Kure Naval Base ( near Hiroshima ) , Sasebo Naval Base ( near Nagasaki ) , and the Lingga Islands ( in present @-@ day Indonesia ) , and deployed on several occasions in response to American carrier airstrikes on Japanese island bases . Haruna participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944 , engaging American vessels in the latter . In 1945 , Haruna was transferred to Kure Naval Base , where she was sunk by aircraft of Task Force 38 on 28 July 1945 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Haruna was the fourth and last of the Imperial Japanese Navy 's Kongō @-@ class battlecruisers , a line of capital ships designed by the British naval engineer George Thurston . The class was ordered in 1910 in the Japanese Emergency Naval Expansion Bill after the commissioning of HMS Invincible in 1908 . The four battlecruisers of the Kongo @-@ class were designed to match the naval capabilities of the other major powers at the time ; they have been called the battlecruiser versions of the British ( formerly Turkish ) battleship HMS Erin . Their heavy armament and armor protection ( which contributed 23 @.@ 3 percent of their displacement ) were greatly superior to those of any other Japanese capital ship afloat at the time . 
 The keel of Haruna was laid down at Kobe by Kawasaki on 16 March 1912 , with most of the parts used in her construction manufactured in Japan . Due to a shortage of available slipways , Haruna and her sister ship Kirishima were the first two capital ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy to be built in private shipyards . Launched on 14 December 1913 , Haruna 's fitting @-@ out began in early 1914 . She was completed on 19 April 1915 . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Haruna 's main battery consisted of eight 14 in ( 36 cm ) heavy @-@ caliber main guns in four twin turrets ( two forward , two aft ) . The turrets were noted by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence to be " similar to the British 15 @-@ inch turrets " , with improvements made in flash @-@ tightness . Each of her main guns could fire high @-@ explosive or armor @-@ piercing shells a maximum of 38 @,@ 770 yd ( 19 @.@ 14 nmi ; 35 @.@ 45 km ) at a firing rate of two shells per minute . In keeping with the Japanese doctrine of deploying more powerful vessels before their opponents , Haruna and her sister ships were the first vessels in the world equipped with 14 in ( 36 cm ) guns . The main guns carried ammunition for 90 salvoes , and had an approximate barrel life of 250 to 280 rounds . In 1941 , separate dyes ( used to distinguish between shells fired from multiple ships ) were introduced for the armor @-@ piercing shells of the four Kongo @-@ class battleships , with Haruna 's armor @-@ piercing shells using black dye . 
 Her secondary battery was originally sixteen 6 in ( 15 cm ) 50 @-@ caliber medium guns in single casemates ( all located amidships ) , eight 3 in ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) guns and eight submerged 21 in ( 53 cm ) torpedo tubes . The six @-@ inch guns could fire five to six rounds per minute , with a barrel life of 500 rounds . The 6 " / 50 caliber gun was capable of firing both anti @-@ aircraft and anti @-@ ship shells , though the positioning of the guns on Haruna made antiaircraft firing impractical . During her second reconstruction , the older 3 @-@ inch guns were removed and replaced with eight 5 in ( 13 cm ) dual @-@ purpose guns . These 5 " / 40 caliber guns could fire between 8 and 14 rounds per minute , with a barrel life of 800 to 1 @,@ 500 rounds . The 5 " / 40 had the widest variety of shot types of Haruna 's guns , being designed to fire antiaircraft , antiship , and illumination shells . She was also armed with a large number of 1 in ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) antiaircraft machine guns . In 1943 , her secondary armament was reconfigured to eight 6 in ( 15 cm ) guns , twelve 5 in ( 13 cm ) guns , and finally by the end of 1944 one hundred and eight Type 96 antiaircraft autocannon in 30 triples and 18 single mounts .

 On 19 April 1915 , Haruna was formally commissioned at Kobe . On 13 December 1915 , after eight months of trials , she was assigned to the Third Battleship Division of the Second Fleet . On 9 April 1916 , she departed Sasebo Naval Base for operations in the East China Sea , returning to Japan 10 days later . On 1 December 1916 , Captain Saburo Hyakutake assumed command of Haruna until 15 September 1917 , when Captain Naomi Taniguchi replaced him . On 1 December 1917 , she was placed in reserve , as hostilities in the Pacific theatre of World War I concluded . 
 On 12 September 1920 , Haruna was involved in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No. 1 turret , killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret . A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the breech , detonating the shell while still in the barrel . The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal , where the elevation of her 14 @-@ inch guns was also increased by seven degrees . Three months later , she was once again placed in reserve . 
 With the conclusion of World War I and the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty , the size of the Imperial Japanese Navy was significantly lessened , with a ratio of 5 : 5 : 3 required between the capital ships of the United Kingdom , the United States , and Japan . The treaty also banned Japan from building any new capital ships until 1931 , with no capital ship permitted to exceed 35 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 000 t ) . Provided that new additions did not exceed 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) , existing capital ships were allowed to be upgraded with improved anti @-@ torpedo bulges and deck armor . By the time the Washington Treaty had been fully implemented in Japan , only three classes of World War I @-@ era capital ships remained active : the Ise @-@ class battleships , the Kongō @-@ class battlecruisers , and one of the Fusō @-@ class battleships ( Yamashiro ) . 
 = = = 1926 – 1933 : Reconstruction into battleship = = = 
 Unable to construct new capital ships until 1931 , Japan resorted to upgrading battleships and battlecruisers . In July 1926 , Haruna became the first of Japan 's vessels to undergo extensive modernization and modification , in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal . Over the next two years , her horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened , and the machinery spaces within the hull were increased . Anti @-@ torpedo bulges were added along the waterline , as permitted by the Washington Treaty . She was refitted to accommodate three Type 90 Model 0 floatplanes . To increase her speed and power capacities , all 36 Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with 16 newer boilers , and Brown @-@ Curtis direct @-@ drive turbines were installed . Haruna 's forward funnel was removed , and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened . The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6 @,@ 502 to 10 @,@ 313 long tons , directly violating the terms of the Washington Treaty . In July 1928 , Haruna — now capable of speeds of 29 kn ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) — was reclassified as a battleship . 
 Following new sea trials , Haruna was assigned on 10 December 1928 to the Fourth Battleship Division of the Second Fleet as the Emperor 's special ship . For the next 12 months , she operated between Sasebo , Port Arthur , and the East China Sea . On 1 February 1929 , Prince Takamatsu , the younger brother of Emperor Hirohito , was assigned to the crew . On 20 November 1929 , she was reassigned to the First Battleship Division . She was placed in reserve on 1 December 1930 . 
 On 22 April 1930 , Japan signed the London Naval Treaty , placing further restrictions on her maritime forces . In addition to the scrapping of several older battleships , Japan would not be permitted to construct new capital ships until 1937 . After minor fitting @-@ out work , her reconstruction begun in 1926 was declared complete on 1 October 1931 . On 8 November 1931 , she served as the Emperor 's ship during his official visit to Kumamoto prefecture . 
 In September 1931 , Japan invaded Manchuria . On 25 February 1933 , based on the report by the Lytton Commission , the League of Nations agreed that Japan 's invasion had violated Chinese sovereignty . Refusing to accept the organization 's judgment , Japan withdrew from the League of Nations the same day . Immediately following , Japan also withdrew from the Washington and London Naval Treaties , thus removing all restrictions on the number and size of her capital ships . Haruna was reactivated and assigned to the First Battleship Division on 20 May 1933 . 
 = = = 1933 – 1941 : Fast battleship = = = 
 On 1 August 1933 , Haruna was drydocked at Kure Naval Arsenal in preparation for upgrades that would enable her to escort Japan 's growing fleet of aircraft carriers . Her stern was lengthened by 26 ft ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) , and her bridge was completely reconstructed according to Japan 's pagoda mast style of forward superstructure . Her 16 older boilers were removed and replaced with 11 oil @-@ fired Kampon Boilers and newer geared turbines . Catapults and rails were added to support three Nakajima E8N or Kawanishi E7K reconnaissance and spotter floatplanes . 
 Haruna 's armor was also extensively upgraded . Her main belt was strengthened to a uniform thickness of 8 inches ( up from varying thicknesses of 6 to 8 inches ) , while diagonal bulkheads of depths ranging from 5 to 8 in ( 127 to 203 mm ) now reinforced the main armored belt . The turret armor was strengthened to 10 inches ( 254 mm ) , while 4 in ( 102 mm ) were added to portions of the deck armor . Her ammunition magazine protection was also strengthened to 4 @.@ 0 inches ( 10 cm ) . The reconstruction was finished on 30 September 1934 . Capable of more than 30 kn ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) despite the significant increase in hull displacement , Haruna was now reclassified as a fast battleship . 
 On 28 October 1935 , Captain Jisaburō Ozawa assumed command of Haruna . On 1 June 1936 , she was assigned to the Third Battleship Division of the First Fleet . Throughout 1937 , Haruna conducted extensive gunnery drills and patrols off the coast of China , primarily in the vicinity of Tsingtao . On 7 July 1937 , Japan officially declared war on China , thus beginning the Sino @-@ Japanese War . One month later , Haruna transported Japanese Army forces to mainland China in preparation for campaigns into Chinese Nationalist territory . On 1 December 1937 , she was again placed in reserve . On 2 April 1940 , she was transferred from Sasebo to Taiwan . She was redesignated as a " special service ship " on 15 November 1940 , and five months later was attached to the Third Battleship Division of the First Fleet , based in Hashirajima . 
 = = = 1941 – 1942 : Early war service = = = 
 Haruna and Kongō departed the Hashirajima fleet anchorage on 29 November 1941 , to participate in the opening stage of the Pacific War as part of the Southern ( Malay ) Force 's Main Body , under the overall command of Vice @-@ Admiral Nobutake Kondō . On 4 December 1941 , the Main Body arrived off the coast of Southern Siam and Northern Malaya , in preparation for the invasion of Siam and the Malayan Peninsula four days later . When Britain 's " Force Z " – consisting of the battleship HMS Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser HMS Repulse – was quickly defeated by Japan 's land @-@ based and carrier aircraft , Haruna 's battlegroup withdrew from Malayan waters . The battlegroup subsequently sortied from Indochina for three days in mid @-@ December to protect a reinforcement convoy traveling to Malaya and again on 18 December to cover the Army 's landing at Lingayen Gulf in the Philippines . The Main Body departed Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina on 23 December bound for Taiwan , arriving two days later . 
 On 13 December 1941 , an erroneous report was published in the U.S. media that an American B @-@ 17 heavy bomber had bombed and mortally damaged Haruna during battle off Lingayen Gulf off the Philippines . No Japanese battleships were present , and Haruna was 1 @,@ 500 nmi ( 2 @,@ 800 km ; 1 @,@ 700 mi ) away in the Gulf of Siam at the time . 
 On 18 January 1942 , Kondō 's Main Force arrived in Palau alongside two fast carriers , with the intention of covering Japan 's invasion of Borneo and the Dutch East Indies . Haruna , Maya , and the fleet carriers Hiryū and Sōryū operated to the east of Mindanao until 18 February 1942 , when the Main Body departed Palau in preparation for " Operation J " , Japan 's invasion of the Dutch East Indies . On 25 February , the Third Battleship Division provided cover for air attacks on Java . Haruna bombarded Christmas Island on 7 March 1942 , then returned to Staring @-@ baai for 15 days of maintenance and rest . In April 1942 , Haruna joined five fleet carriers in attacks on Colombo in Ceylon . Following the destruction of HMS Dorsetshire on 5 April 1942 , Haruna was sent southwest to locate the remainder of the British Eastern Fleet , under the command of Admiral James Somerville . On 9 April , one of her floatplanes spotted the carrier HMS Hermes south of Trincomalee ; Japanese airstrikes sank the carrier the same day . Having crippled the offensive capability of Britain 's Eastern Fleet , the Third Battleship Division returned to Japan on 23 April . Haruna was drydocked throughout May 1942 for general repairs and refits . 
 On 29 May 1942 , Haruna joined her sister ship Kirishima as part of Vice @-@ Admiral Chūichi Nagumo 's carrier strike force during the Battle of Midway . On 4 June , she was attacked in multiple airstrikes by American torpedo bombers , but she took no hits and succeeded in shooting down five American aircraft . On 5 June , she took on survivors from the four destroyed Japanese aircraft carriers before returning to Japan . She remained in Japan until September 1942 , undergoing minor refits in August of that year . On 6 September , Haruna transferred to Truk Lagoon alongside the rest of the Third Battleship Division , and on 10 September the ship sortied as part of Admiral Kondō 's Second Fleet into the Solomon Islands . On 20 September , the fleet was ordered to return to Truk . 
 In the aftermath of the Battle of Cape Esperance , the Japanese Army opted to reinforce their positions on Guadalcanal . To protect their transport convoy from enemy air attack , Admiral Yamamoto sent Haruna and Kongō , escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers , to bombard Henderson Field . Because of their high speed , the two battleships could bombard the field and withdraw before being subjected to air attack from aircraft carriers . On the night of 13 – 14 October , the two battleships shelled Henderson Field from a distance of 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) , firing 973 14 @-@ inch shells . In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war , the bombardment heavily damaged both runways , destroyed almost all available aviation fuel , incapacitated 48 of the airfield 's 90 aircraft , and killed 41 men . The Japanese troop convoy reached the island the next day . 
 During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942 , Haruna was attacked by a PBY Catalina flying boat but received no damage . In mid @-@ November , the battleship and other warships provided distant cover for the ultimately unsuccessful efforts to bombard Henderson Field again and land reinforcements on Guadalcanal . On 15 November 1942 , following the Japanese defeat and loss of Hiei and Kirishima during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , the Third Battleship Division returned to Truk , where it remained for the rest of 1942 .

 Haruna engaged no enemy targets during 1943 . In late January 1943 , she participated in " Operation Ke " , as part of a diversionary force and distant cover supporting Japanese destroyers that were evacuating personnel from Guadalcanal . During 15 – 20 February 1943 , the Third Battleship Division transferred from Truk to Kure Naval Base . From 23 February to 31 March 1943 , Haruna was drydocked in Kure Naval Arsenal for upgrades , receiving additional Type 96 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) antiaircraft guns and armor . On 17 May 1943 , in response to the American invasion of Attu Island , Haruna sortied alongside Musashi , the Third Battleship Division , two fleet carriers , two cruisers and nine destroyers . Three days later , the submarine USS Sawfish discovered the task group , but was unable to attack . On 22 May 1943 , the task force arrived in Yokosuka , where it was joined by an additional three fleet carriers and two light cruisers ; the force was disbanded when Attu fell before the necessary preparations were finished . Throughout June 1943 , Haruna was refitted at Yokosuka . On 18 September 1943 , Haruna left Truk as part of a counterattack force in response to American raids on the Brown Islands in Micronesia , but no contact was made and the ship returned to the base . 
 On 17 October 1943 , Haruna again left Truk as part of an even larger force — five battleships , three fleet carriers , eight heavy cruisers , three light cruisers and numerous destroyers — in response to American raids on Wake Island . When no contact was made the force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943 . On 16 December 1943 , she arrived at Sasebo for refits and inland @-@ sea training . 
 = = = 1944 : Final combat actions = = = 
 On 25 January 1944 , Captain Kazu <unk> assumed command of Haruna while the ship was stationed at Kure . The Third Battleship Division departed Kure on 8 March 1944 . Arriving at Lingga on 14 March 1944 , the division remained for training until 11 May 1944 . On 11 May 1944 , Haruna and Admiral Ozawa 's Mobile Fleet departed Lingga for Tawitawi , where they were joined by Vice @-@ Admiral Takeo Kurita 's " Force C " . On 13 June , Ozawa 's Mobile Fleet departed Tawitawi for the Mariana Islands . During the Battle of the Philippine Sea , Haruna escorted Japanese fast carriers , and was hit by two 500 lb ( 230 kg ) armor @-@ piercing bombs on 20 June 1944 from U.S. carrier aircraft . On 24 June , she was drydocked in Kure for repairs and refitting . In August 1944 she transferred to Lingga . 
 In October 1944 , Haruna departed Lingga in preparation for " Operation Sho @-@ 1 " , Japan 's counterattack during the Battle of Leyte Gulf , the largest naval engagement in history . On 24 October , Haruna was lightly damaged by fragments from near misses by American carrier aircraft in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea . On 25 October , during the Battle off Samar , Haruna — as part of Admiral Kurita 's Centre Force — engaged escort carriers and destroyers of the U.S. 7th Fleet 's " Taffy 3 " . Her 14 in ( 36 cm ) shells straddled ( but did not hit ) two American escort carriers , before she dodged torpedoes launched by American destroyers . After a fierce defensive action by the American ships , Admiral Kurita elected to withdraw , ending the battle . 
 Following the Japanese Navy 's defeat at Leyte Gulf , Haruna returned to Brunei and Lingga for repairs . On 22 November 1944 , she ran aground on a coral reef near Lingga , suffering serious damage to her watertight compartments and forcing her to return to Sasebo , where the hull was patched and repaired . On 2 December 1944 , while returning to Japan from Southeast Asia as part of a task group , she evaded torpedoes fired by an American submarine . On 9 December , three more American submarines intercepted the task group ; USS Sea Devil , Plaice , and Redfish damaged the carrier Junyō and multiple destroyers with torpedoes . <unk> , Haruna arrived at Sasebo the following day . At the end of 1944 , she transferred to Kure for full repairs and upgrading , having survived a year in which four other Japanese battleships had been lost . 
 = = = 1945 : Loss = = = 
 On 1 January 1945 , Haruna was removed from the deactivated Third Battleship Division and transferred to the First Battleship Division of the Second Fleet . On 10 February , Haruna was assigned to the Kure Naval District . On 19 March 1945 , American carrier aircraft attacked the remainder of the Japanese Navy at Kure . The base was defended by veteran Japanese fighter instructors flying Kawanishi <unk> @-@ J " Shiden " or " George " fighters , led by the man who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor , Minoru <unk> . These fighter planes were superior in some respects to America 's main fighter , the F6F Hellcat . They surprised the attackers , destroyed several American aircraft , and defended the base from the brunt of the attack . Haruna sustained light damage from a single bomb on the starboard side , and remained at Kure . 
 On 24 July 1945 , the U.S. Navy 's Task Force 38 began a series of aerial attacks on Kure Naval Base to destroy the last remnants of Japan 's navy . The same day , the battleship Hyūga was sunk , and Haruna was hit by a single bomb which caused light damage . Four days later , she sustained eight bomb hits from Task Force 38 's aircraft and sank at her moorings at 16 : 15 . In two days of attacks , 65 officers and men of Haruna were killed . Her remnants were raised from the sea floor in 1946 and broken up over the course of two months .

 Carl Eytel ( September 12 , 1862 – September 17 , 1925 ) was a German American artist who built his reputation for paintings and drawings of desert subjects in the American Southwest . <unk> to the United States in 1885 , he eventually settled in Palm Springs , California in 1903 . With an extensive knowledge of the Sonoran Desert , Eytel traveled with author George Wharton James as he wrote the successful Wonders of the Colorado Desert , and contributed over 300 drawings to the 1908 work . While he enjoyed success as an artist , he lived as an ascetic and eventually died in poverty .

 Carl Eytel was born as Karl Adolf Wilhelm Eytel in <unk> , Böblingen to <unk> ( née Schmid ) and <unk> Hermann Eytel , a Lutheran minister in the Kingdom of Württemberg ( now the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg , near Stuttgart ) , Germany . As a boy , he became a ward of his grandfather when his father died . Eytel was well educated in the German gymnasium and became enamored of the American West while reading the works of Prussian natural science writer and explorer Alexander von Humboldt , which he found in the Stuttgart Royal Library . From 1880 to 1884 he studied forestry in Tübingen and then was drafted into the German Army . He first traveled to the United States in 1885 aboard the Suevia and worked as a ranch hand in Kansas . Later he worked at a slaughterhouse for 18 months to earn his living and to study cattle . In 1891 , he read an article about the Palm Springs area in the San Francisco Call and was " incited " to visit the California desert .

 Eytel returned to Germany to study art for 18 months ( 1897 – 1898 ) at the Royal Art School Stuttgart and then re @-@ immigrated to the United States . Wanting to be a cowboy , he worked as a <unk> in the San Joaquin Valley and he eventually settled in Palm Springs in 1903 . Living in small cabins he built himself , Palm Springs remained his home . Eytel often walked on his travels , covering 400 miles in the Colorado Desert on foot . On one of his travels he was nearly lynched as a horse thief and in 1918 , during a trip to northern Arizona , he was threatened with lynching as a German spy .

 While living for the most part as a " desert rat " and starving artist , he both traveled alone throughout the American Southwest and accompanied author J. Smeaton Chase and painter Jimmy Swinnerton on their travels . Serving as George Wharton James ' guide to " every obvious and obscure location of importance " , he illustrated James ' two volume The Wonders of the Colorado Desert . The work was successful and received generally favorable reviews . The collaboration on the book lasted from 1903 to 1907 . Eytel 's illustrations were also used by James in his 1906 article " The Colorado Desert : As General Kearney Saw It " .

 By 1908 Eytel was exhibiting works in Pasadena and enjoying the patronage of socialite Martha M. <unk> . He was also planning to build a bungalow in Beaumont , California . And , in 1909 , his work was being exhibited in major art venues and the <unk> gallery in Los Angeles . Later , in 1911 , after traveling with Chase on horseback , he contributed 21 realistic line art drawings to Chase 's book , Cone @-@ bearing Trees of the California Mountains . 
 Besides his work in Wonders of the Colorado Desert and Cone @-@ bearing Trees , Eytel contributed ( both drawings and articles ) to the best periodicals , including the Los Angeles Times and , for nearly 14 years , the New Yorker Staats @-@ Zeitung . ( During his travels in the southwest he became friends with Los Angeles Times city editor Charles Lummis . ) A stone wall in the dining room of Dr. <unk> Murray 's early hotel was covered with an Eytel mural of Palm Canyon .

The men lived near each other ( like Eytel , Jaeger built his own cabin ) , traveled together throughout the Southwest , helped with each other 's works , and exchanged photographs which appeared in their various books . 
 The Brotherhood lasted from 1915 when Jaeger , who was the teacher in the Palm Springs one @-@ room school house , met Eytel and Chase . It ended in 1923 when Chase died . ( In 1924 , after completing his studies at Occidental College in Los Angeles , Jaeger began a 30 @-@ year teaching career at Riverside Junior College in Riverside , California . ) Jaeger wrote the initial eulogy for Eytel upon his death and in 1948 , recalling his time with him , Jaeger said : 
 As an artist Eytel was largely self @-@ taught .... Not widely schooled , but widely read . Eytel possessed a knowledge not only of the Greek and Roman classics but of the best literature of England , America and his native Germany . I never knew Eytel to sleep indoors . Trying to inure himself to hardships in the belief it would toughen his constitution .... 
 Over the years it was Eytel who served as their " spiritual figurehead " . Even after Jaeger left to complete his studies and Chase married the wealthy Isabel White ( 1917 ) , the three , plus Saunders , often exchanged letters . Suffering from a " hacking and persistent cough " , Eytel remained in Palm Springs , impoverished , and Swinnerton would buy art supplies for him . Later Eytel became a recluse .

 Journalist Ann <unk> has characterized Eytel 's work as " Smoketree School " – a school which is named after a favorite desert art subject , the <unk> . The school has origins with <unk> S. Clark and Jack Frost , who were influenced by French impressionist Claude Monet . Other Smoketree artists include Carl Bray , Fred <unk> , Maynard Dixon , Clyde Forsythe , Sam Hyde Harris , John Hilton , R. Brownell McGrew , Agnes Pelton , Hanson <unk> and Swinnerton . 
 = = = Style and subjects = = = 
 Like many artists of the desert southwest , Eytel 's style was impressionistic . His subjects were varied and included the Mission San José de <unk> , in the <unk> National Historical Park near Nogales , Arizona ( pre @-@ restoration ) , and California Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission San Juan Capistrano Spanish missions . His drawings for Cone @-@ bearing Trees of the California Mountains and Wonders of the Colorado Desert were especially detailed and included Desert Bighorn Sheep , desert reptiles , and cattle . ( His Mirage in the Desert ( 1905 ) , painted for Wonders , depicts cattle and cowboys . ) 
 Eytel depicted the life of Navajo , Hopi , Cahuilla , Serrano and <unk> peoples , including landscapes of the New Mexico Eight Northern Pueblos in San Ildefonso , Laguna , <unk> and Taos Pueblo . The <unk> Pueblo on First Mesa , Hopi Reservation , Arizona , and Cocopah people near Calexico , California were drawn as well . 
 Prospectors working the Anaconda ( Dale District ) and Manana ( Colorado River ) mines in Arizona and the famous Picacho gold mine were drawn , as were the Rancho Guajome Adobe near Encinitas , California , the Sierra Bonita Ranch near Fort Grant , Arizona , turn of the century Tucson , Arizona , and the Yuma Territorial Prison , Yuma , Arizona . 
 His scenes from early Palm Springs included the stagecoach station and William Pester – " The Hermit of Palm Springs " . 
 Eytel 's landscapes and mountain scenes in Wonders included : 
 Ehrenberg , Arizona 
 Algodones , including the Pilot Knob landmark , Imperial County , California 
 Palo Verde , Arizona 
 San Jacinto National Forest , California 
 Oak Creek Canyon , within Coconino National Forest , Arizona

 Eytel was a friend of the Cahuilla people and they allowed him to be buried in their cemetery in Palm Springs after he died of tuberculosis in a Banning , California sanatorium . His funeral and burial were arranged by Nellie Coffman , who had established the original Desert Inn in the Palm Springs village in 1909 . 
 Eytel received the following eulogy from Saunders writing in August 1926 : 
 But to Carl Eytel , pioneer of Palm Springs artists , working there long before the world of fashion had heard of the place , Palm Springs was his home , and the desert his life . He knew it in all seasons , in all moods , and he painted it with a sort of religious ardor springing from unfailing love , in season and out . Others have been better draughtsmen than he , but when you look at a canvas by Eytel at his best you are looking into what seems the desert ’ s heart . 
 His painting Desert near Palm Springs ( 1914 ) is displayed in the California History Room of the California State Library . The Palm Springs Art Museum has a set of Eytel 's sketches and displays various of his paintings . 
 The desert shrub <unk> <unk> was given the common name " <unk> " in his honor . The short " Via Eytel " in Palm Springs is named in his honor , as is the short " Eytel Road " in nearby Cathedral City .

 = Copernicium = 
 Copernicium is a chemical element with symbol Cn and atomic number 112 . It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element that can only be created in a laboratory . The most stable known isotope , copernicium @-@ 285 , has a half @-@ life of approximately 29 seconds , but it is possible that this copernicium isotope may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half @-@ life , 8 @.@ 9 min . Copernicium was first created in 1996 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt , Germany . It is named after the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus . 
 In the periodic table of the elements , it is a d @-@ block transactinide element . During reactions with gold , it has been shown to be an extremely volatile metal and a group 12 element , and it may even be a gas at standard temperature and pressure . Copernicium is calculated to have several properties that differ between it and its lighter homologues , zinc , cadmium and mercury ; the most notable of them is withdrawing two 6d @-@ electrons before 7s ones due to relativistic effects , which confirm copernicium as an undisputed transition metal . Copernicium is also calculated to show a predominance of the oxidation state + 4 , while mercury shows it in only one compound at extreme conditions and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all . It has also been predicted to be more difficult to oxidise copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements . 
 In total , approximately 75 atoms of copernicium have been detected using various nuclear reactions . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Official discovery = = = 
 Copernicium was first created on February 9 , 1996 , at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung ( GSI ) in Darmstadt , Germany , by Sigurd Hofmann , Victor Ninov et al . This element was created by firing accelerated zinc @-@ 70 nuclei at a target made of lead @-@ 208 nuclei in a heavy ion accelerator . A single atom ( the second was subsequently dismissed ) of copernicium was produced with a mass number of 277 .

 30Zn → 278 
 112Cn * → 277 
 112Cn + 1 
 0n 
 In May 2000 , the GSI successfully repeated the experiment to synthesize a further atom of copernicium @-@ 277 . This reaction was repeated at RIKEN using the Search for a Super @-@ Heavy Element Using a Gas @-@ Filled Recoil Separator set @-@ up in 2004 and 2013 to synthesize three further atoms and confirm the decay data reported by the GSI team . 
 The IUPAC / IUPAP Joint Working Party ( JWP ) assessed the claim of discovery by the GSI team in 2001 and 2003 . In both cases , they found that there was insufficient evidence to support their claim . This was primarily related to the contradicting decay data for the known nuclide rutherfordium @-@ 261 . However , between 2001 and 2005 , the GSI team studied the reaction 248Cm ( 26Mg , 5n ) 269Hs , and were able to confirm the decay data for hassium @-@ 269 and rutherfordium @-@ 261 . It was found that the existing data on rutherfordium @-@ 261 was for an isomer , now designated rutherfordium @-@ <unk> . 
 In May 2009 , the JWP reported on the claims of discovery of element 112 again and officially recognized the GSI team as the discoverers of element 112 . This decision was based on the confirmation of the decay properties of daughter nuclei as well as the confirmatory experiments at RIKEN . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Using Mendeleev 's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements , copernicium should be known as eka @-@ mercury . In 1979 , IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called <unk> ( with the corresponding symbol of <unk> ) , a systematic element name as a placeholder , until the element was discovered ( and the discovery then confirmed ) and a permanent name was decided on . Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels , from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks , the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field , who either called it " element 112 " , with the symbol of ( 112 ) or even simply 112 . 
 After acknowledging the GSI team 's discovery , the IUPAC asked them to suggest a permanent name for element 112 . On 14 July 2009 , they proposed copernicium with the element symbol Cp , after Nicolaus Copernicus " to honor an outstanding scientist , who changed our view of the world " . 
 During the standard six @-@ month discussion period among the scientific community about the naming , it was pointed out that the symbol Cp was previously associated with the name cassiopeium ( <unk> ) , now known as lutetium ( Lu ) . For this reason , the IUPAC disallowed the use of Cp as a future symbol , prompting the GSI team to put forward the symbol Cn as an alternative . On 19 February 2010 , the 537th anniversary of Copernicus ' birth , IUPAC officially accepted the proposed name and symbol . 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 Copernicium has no stable or naturally @-@ occurring isotopes . Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory , either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements . Six different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 281 to 285 , and 277 , two of which , copernicium @-@ 283 and copernicium @-@ 285 , have known metastable states . Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay , but some undergo spontaneous fission . 
 The isotope copernicium @-@ 283 was instrumental in the confirmation of the discoveries of the elements flerovium and livermorium . 
 = = = Half @-@ lives = = = 
 All copernicium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive ; in general , heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter . The most stable isotope , <unk> , has a half @-@ life of 29 seconds , although it is suspected that this isotope has an isomer with a half @-@ life of 8 @.@ 9 minutes , and 283Cn may have an isomer with a half @-@ life of about 5 minutes . Other isotopes have half @-@ lives shorter than 0 @.@ 1 seconds . <unk> and <unk> both have half @-@ lives of 97 ms , and the other two isotopes have half @-@ lives slightly under one millisecond . It is predicted that the heavy isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn may have half @-@ lives of around 1200 years , and may have been produced in the r @-@ process and be detectable in cosmic rays , though they would be about 10 − 12 times as abundant as lead . 
 The lightest isotopes were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products ( except for 277Cn , which is not known to be a decay product ) , while the heavier isotopes are only known to be produced by decay of heavier nuclei . The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 283Cn ; the two heavier isotopes , <unk> and <unk> have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers . In 1999 , American scientists at the University of California , Berkeley , announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Uuo . These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted three alpha particles to form copernicium @-@ 281 nuclei , which were claimed to have undergone an alpha decay , emitting an alpha particle with decay energy of 10 @.@ 68 MeV and half @-@ life 0 @.@ 90 ms , but their claim was retracted in 2001 . The isotope , however , was produced in 2010 by the same team . The new data contradicted the previous ( fabricated ) data . 
 = = Predicted properties = = 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 Copernicium is the last member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest group 12 element in the periodic table , below zinc , cadmium and mercury . It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group 12 elements . Due to stabilization of 7s electronic orbitals and destabilization of 6d ones caused by relativistic effects , Cn2 + is likely to have a [ Rn ] <unk> electronic configuration , using the 6d orbitals before the 7s one , unlike its homologues . The fact that the 6d electrons participate readily in chemical bonding mean that copernicium should behave more like a transition metal than its lighter homologues , especially in the + 4 oxidation state . In water solutions , copernicium is likely to form the + 2 and + 4 oxidation states , with the latter one being more stable . Among the lighter group 12 members , for which the + 2 oxidation state is the most common , only mercury can show the + 4 oxidation state , but it is highly uncommon , existing at only one compound ( mercury ( IV ) fluoride , HgF4 ) at extreme conditions . The analogous compound for copernicium , copernicium ( IV ) fluoride ( <unk> ) , is predicted to be more stable . The diatomic ion Hg2 + 
 2 , featuring mercury in the + 1 oxidation state , is well @-@ known , but the Cn2 + 
 2 ion is predicted to be unstable or even non @-@ existent . Oxidation of copernicium from its neutral state is also likely to be more difficult than those of previous group 12 members . Copernicium ( II ) fluoride , <unk> , should be more unstable than the analogous mercury compound , mercury ( II ) fluoride ( <unk> ) , and may even decompose spontaneously into its constituent elements . In polar solvents , copernicium is predicted to preferentially form the <unk> − 
 5 and <unk> − 
 3 anions rather than the analogous neutral fluorides ( <unk> and <unk> , respectively ) , although the analogous bromide or iodide ions may be more stable towards hydrolysis in aqueous solution . The anions <unk> − 
 4 and <unk> − 
 4 should also be able to exist in aqueous solution . 
 The valence s @-@ subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium . This and the closed @-@ shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal . Its metallic bonds should also be very weak , possibly making it extremely volatile , like the noble gases , and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature . However , it should be able to form metal – metal bonds with copper , palladium , platinum , silver , and gold ; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15 – 20 kJ / mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury . 
 = = = Physical and atomic = = = 
 Copernicium should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23 @.@ 7 g / cm3 in the solid state ; in comparison , the most dense known element that has had its density measured , osmium , has a density of only 22 @.@ 61 g / cm3 . This results from copernicium 's high atomic weight , the lanthanide and actinide contractions , and relativistic effects , although production of enough copernicium to measure this quantity would be impractical , and the sample would quickly decay . However , some calculations predict copernicium to be a gas at room temperature , the first gaseous metal in the periodic table ( the second being flerovium ) , due to the closed @-@ shell electron configurations of copernicium and flerovium . The atomic radius of copernicium is expected to be around 147 pm . Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital , the Cn + and Cn2 + ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons , which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues . 
 In addition to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell , the 6d5 / 2 orbital is expected to be destabilized due to spin @-@ orbit coupling , making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size , shape , and energy . Hence copernicium may not be a noble transition metal , but rather a semiconductor with a band gap of around 0 @.@ 2 eV . Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close @-@ packed crystal structure , with lattice parameters a 
 = 332 pm and c = 
 540 pm . The c / a ratio of 1 @.@ 63 is the ideal value , establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases , though its cohesive energy ( enthalpy of crystallization ) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases . 
 = = Experimental atomic gas phase chemistry = = 
 Interest in copernicium 's chemistry was sparked by predictions that it would have the largest relativistic effects in the whole of period 7 and group 12 . Copernicium has the ground state electron configuration [ Rn ] <unk> and thus should belong to group 12 of the periodic table , according to the Aufbau principle . As such , it should behave as the heavier homologue of mercury and form strong binary compounds with noble metals like gold . Experiments probing the reactivity of copernicium have focused on the adsorption of atoms of element 112 onto a gold surface held at varying temperatures , in order to calculate an adsorption enthalpy . Owing to relativistic stabilization of the 7s electrons , copernicium shows radon @-@ like properties . Experiments were performed with the simultaneous formation of mercury and radon radioisotopes , allowing a comparison of adsorption characteristics . 
 The first experiments were conducted using the 238U ( 48Ca , 3n ) 283Cn reaction . Detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half @-@ life of 5 minutes . Analysis of the data indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties . However , the confusion regarding the synthesis of copernicium @-@ 283 has cast some doubt on these experimental results . Given this uncertainty , between April – May 2006 at the JINR , a FLNR – PSI team conducted experiments probing the synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction 242Pu ( 48Ca , 3n ) 287Fl . In this experiment , two atoms of copernicium @-@ 283 were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties indicated that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury , due to formation of a weak metal @-@ metal bond with gold , placing it firmly in group 12 . 
 In April 2007 , this experiment was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium @-@ 283 were positively identified . The adsorption property was confirmed and indicated that copernicium has adsorption properties completely in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12 . These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium 's boiling point : 84 + 112

 The 2011 Guerrero earthquake struck with a moment magnitude of 5 @.@ 7 in southern Mexico at 08 : 24 local time on Thursday , 5 May . It was positioned west of Ometepec , Guerrero , with a focal depth of 24 km ( 14 @.@ 9 mi ) , and was lightly felt in many adjacent areas . 
 Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City , prompting evacuations and causing panic among many . Following the quake , police patrolled city streets for safety reasons and damage assessments were carried out across the affected region . There were no casualties , though two local police stations suffered slight damage . A number of light aftershocks succeeded the main event , of which the strongest measured a magnitude of 4 @.@ 1 ( ML ) . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The magnitude 5 @.@ 7 ( Mw ) earthquake occurred inland near the southern coast of Mexico at a depth of 24 km ( 14 @.@ 9 mi ) , with a duration of nearly one minute and an epicenter about 55 km ( 34 mi ) west of Ometepec , Guerrero . In the region , the Cocos , North American , and Caribbean Plates converge and create a tectonic zone of continuous seismic activity . The quake struck near the eastern periphery of the Guerrero seismic gap , which extends from Acapulco to Ixtapa – Zihuatanejo and contains enough seismic energy to generate an earthquake of up to magnitude 7 @.@ 5 , but it did not cause the gap to rupture . Initial estimates from the USGS placed its intensity at a magnitude of 5 @.@ 8 ( Mw ) ; the National Seismological Service registered the earthquake at magnitude 5 @.@ 5 ( ML ) . 
 Owing to the moderate magnitude of the quake , significant shaking was felt only in localized parts of Costa Chica , registering strongest at VI ( strong ) on the Mercalli scale in <unk> and V ( moderate ) in populous areas around the epicenter . Lighter ground motions ( MM IV – III ) were perceived in much of Guerrero , including Acapulco and Chilpancingo , with weak tremors ( MM II ) reported as far away as in Mexico City , about 300 km ( 187 mi ) from the epicenter . The capital city rests on a former lakebed of largely unconsolidated sedimentary layers , so earthquake shaking in its vicinity is generally amplified . 
 = = Aftershocks = = 
 By 6 May , a total of five light aftershocks had occurred near the earthquake 's epicenter . Of the five , the first registered a magnitude of 3 @.@ 7 ( ML ) and struck about 15 minutes after the main shock , and was succeeded by a magnitude 3 @.@ 9 ( ML ) tremor at 10 : 09 local time . Two similar quakes of minor intensity struck the region the next day ; however , the strongest and final aftershock registered a magnitude of 4 @.@ 1 ( ML ) and occurred at 04 : 00 in the morning . 
 = = Impact and response = = 
 Despite relatively strong ground motions , damage to the area was very limited ; structures around the epicenter were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking . Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City , causing panic among many citizens and prompting some to evacuate . Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated as a safety precaution . The earthquake and its aftershock sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco ; more than 40 @,@ 000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day . There were no reports of major losses or fatalities in the wake of the tremor , though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage . Elsewhere , some fallen roof tiles and small landslides occurred east of the epicenter in <unk> . 
 Prior to the arrival of seismic waves in Mexico City , seven of twelve earthquake sensors near the coast of Guerrero detected a " potentially significant quake " . Alert systems were subsequently activated in the area , giving locals at least 50 seconds to secure themselves . Shortly after impact , authorities dispatched five helicopters to ascertain any damage in the wake of the quake . SSP officials , along with over 3 @,@ 000 police officers , patrolled the city streets as a safety measure . In response to the earthquake 's occurrence , the Federal District announced the installation of 50 @,@ 000 seismic alarms in local schools , hospitals , and offices . <unk> of structural conditions — particularly in earthquake @-@ prone parts of the state — were scheduled , and about 1 @,@ 817 @,@ 000 government workers partook in an earthquake simulation exercise the following day . 
 = = = Scientific reaction = = = 
 Although the intensity of the quake was fairly significant , specialists reported that earthquakes of such magnitude do not release nearly enough seismic energy to prevent a major earthquake from occurring in the region . In reality , roughly 900 earthquakes of similar intensities to that of the Guerrero earthquake are required per year to total the energy unleashed by a magnitude 7 @.@ 5 event . Many locals perceived an apparent increase in recent earthquake occurrences , though at the time seismologists registered normal levels of seismic activity in the area . In 2009 , a similar magnitude 5 @.@ 8 Mw earthquake struck Guerrero near Acapulco at a depth of 35 km ( 22 mi ) , killing at least two people .

 Alan Moore ( 1 August 1914 – 24 September 2015 ) was an Australian war artist during World War II . He is best known for his images of the Bergen @-@ Belsen concentration camp . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Moore was born in Melbourne in 1914 . He began life drawing art classes at age 16 , but was forbidden by his father from continuing because the subjects were nude . He took up his studies again when he turned 18 , at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School , this time completing his studies to obtain a degree . He also studied under J.S. Watkins in Sydney . 
 He won several art and drawing prizes in Melbourne , including the Grace Joel scholarship prize in 1942 for a nude painting . 
 On 14 July 1939 Moore married this first wife , Maria . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = During the war = = = 
 Moore enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in 1942 , where he was tasked with drawing airplane diagrams . A problem with one leg prevented him from being aircrew . In late 1943 , following recommendations from artists William Dargie and Harold Herbert , he was commissioned as an official war artist attached to the army , and given the rank of lieutenant . 
 Moore 's first deployment as an artist was with the RAAF in Papua New Guinea in early 1944 . His earlier watercolour paintings , made in Milne Bay and Goodenough Island , were destroyed by wet weather and humidity ; he subsequently changed to working with oils , which were more suitable for the tropical environment . 
 During his time in Papua New Guinea he flew in several bombing raids to make sketches from the air . 
 Towards the end of World War II , he recorded war scenes from Papua New Guinea , the Middle East , Italy , England and Germany . 
 In 1945 Moore accompanied the British 11th Armoured Division when they liberated the Bergen @-@ Belsen concentration camp in Germany . He spent three days sketching and painting the state of the camp , its prisoners and their captors , including Fritz Klein . It was suggested by one soldier that nobody would believe the portrayals , prompting Moore to also photograph the scenes as proof . 
 = = = After the war = = = 
 After the war , Moore returned to Melbourne , where he painted images from his Belsen sketches and photographs . They were exhibited commercially , but failed to sell . The Australian War Memorial initially rejected the material because it did not depict Australian soldiers ; however it accepted them in 1969 when they were donated by Moore . In 2013 – 14 the Belsen images formed the basis of a year @-@ long exhibition at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra , which Moore himself visited at the invitation of the Memorial . 
 The War Memorial also commissioned Moore to paint several large portraits , including of Generals Douglas MacArthur and Arthur Samuel Allen . As of 2015 the War Memorial holds more than 200 of his works . 
 After the war Moore spent some years in Europe . 
 He taught painting at Swinburne Technical College from c . 1963 .

 = Bond Street = 
 Bond Street in the West End of London , connects Piccadilly in the south to Oxford Street in the north . The street , consisting of two sections , has been a popular shopping area since the 18th century and is the home of many fashion outlets that sell prestigious and expensive items . The southern section is Old Bond Street and the longer northern section New Bond Street — a distinction not generally made in everyday usage . 
 The street was originally fields surrounding Clarendon House on Piccadilly , which were developed by Sir Thomas Bond . It was built up in the 1720s , and by the end of the 18th century was a popular place for the upper @-@ class residents of Mayfair to socialise . Prestigious and expensive shops were established along the street but it declined as a centre of social activity in the 19th century , although it held its reputation as a fashionable place for retail , and is home to the auction houses Sotheby 's and Bonhams ( formerly Phillips ) and the department stores Fenwick and Tiffany 's . It is one of the most expensive and sought after strips of real estate in Europe . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Bond Street is the only street that runs between Oxford Street and Piccadilly . Old Bond Street is at the southern end between Piccadilly and Burlington Gardens . The northern section , New Bond Street , extends as far as Oxford Street . The whole street combined is around 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) long . The street is narrow , and many of the shops along its front are less than 20 feet ( 6 m ) wide . 
 The nearest tube stations are Green Park on Piccadilly , and Bond Street station on Oxford Street . Despite its name , the station does not directly connect to either New or Old Bond Street . No bus routes use the street , though the C2 service crosses New Bond Street . Part of New Bond Street is classified <unk> ; the remainder and all of Old Bond Street has no number . New Bond Street is pedestrianised between Grafton Street and Clifford Street to prevent through traffic and to stop the road being used as a rat run . 
 = = History = = 
 There has been evidence of Roman settlement around what is now Bond Street . In 1894 , a culvert made from brick and stone was discovered in the area . The street was named after Sir Thomas Bond , the head of a syndicate of developers who purchased a Piccadilly mansion called Clarendon House , from Christopher Monck , 2nd Duke of Albemarle in 1686 , and proceeded to demolish the house and develop the area . At that time , the house backed onto open fields , known as Albemarle Ground , and the development of various estates in Mayfair had just begun . 
 New Bond Street was added during a second phase of construction 14 years after Bond 's syndicate began developing the area . Most of the building along the street occurred in the 1720s , on what was the Conduit Mead Estate . John Rocque 's map of London , published in 1746 , shows properties along the entire length of Bond Street , including the fully constructed side streets . The two parts of the street have always had separate names , and a plan by the council to merge the two into a singular " Bond Street " in the 1920s were rejected by locals . 
 During the 18th century , the street began to become popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair . Shop owners let out the upstairs for residential purposes , attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift , George Selwyn , William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Stern . In 1784 , Georgiana Cavendish , Duchess of Devonshire , an active socialite , demanded that people boycotted Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox , causing him to lose his seat in parliament and dissolve the Fox – North Coalition . She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets , and encouraged people to go to Bond Street . Consequently , the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair . By the end of the century , an upper class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared , wearing expensive wigs and parading up and down the street in a pretentious manner . 
 Lord Nelson stayed at temporary lodgings on New Bond Street between 1797 – 8 , and again in 1811 – 13 . Thomas Pitt , 2nd Baron Camelford lived on Bond Street and was unhappy about the presence of the Bond Street Loungers . Already notorious for a violent and abusive temper , on 7 October 1801 , he refused invitations to join in celebrations of peace between Britain and France ( which led to the Treaty of Amiens ) , resulting in an altercation with several Loungers at his doorstep . Camelford retreated upstairs and fired upon the crowd with a pistol . 
 During the 19th century , Bond Street became less known for its social atmosphere and increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping . The auctioneer Phillips was established in 1796 at No. 101 Bond Street , specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music . The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos. 165 – 169 New Bond Street . The Jewish practice of Kabbalah has been associated with the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No. 50 New Bond Street in 1856 and immediately became profitable , albeit through exaggerated and questionable product claims . Levenson was twice taken to court and prosecuted for fraud , each resulting in a five @-@ year prison sentence . She died mid @-@ way through the second . Nevertheless , the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street . 
 The Royal Arcade links Old Bond Street with Albemarle Street . It was originally proposed in 1864 as a longer link between Old Bond Street and Regent Street , but this was rejected due to the scale of proposed demolition and restricting access to existing properties . It was subsequently redesigned to its current layout , opening in 1879 and replacing the Clarendon Hotel , which had been demolished in 1870 . 
 The street has maintained its reputation for luxury shopping into the 21st century , and has on occasions been regarded as the best retail location in Europe . In 2011 , Bloomberg Business reported that New Bond Street was the most expensive retail street in Europe after the Champs @-@ Élysées in Paris . As a consequence , though , the street has suffered from armed robbery on numerous occasions , with thieves being attracted by the high value of goods that can be stolen in raids . The Graff Diamonds robbery in Bond Street in 2009 resulted in an estimated loss of £ 40 million .

 Westminster City Council have said that Bond Street has the highest density of haute couture stores anywhere in the world , attracting " the rich , the famous , and the simply curious " . The entire length of Bond Street has been part of the Mayfair Conservation Area controlled by Westminster City Council since 1969 . Building alterations and constructions are tightly controlled to ensure the street 's appearance and upkeep are unaltered . Many buildings are listed . The council regulates the style and materials used on shop front advertising . 
 At one time , Bond Street was best known for top @-@ end art dealers and antique shops that were clustered around the London office of Sotheby 's auction house — which has been at Nos. 34 – 35 Bond Street since 1917 and the Fine Art Society , founded in 1876 . The sculpture over the entrance to Sotheby 's is from Ancient Egypt and is believed to date from around <unk> . It is the oldest outdoor sculpture in London . 
 Some dealers and antique shops remain , but many of the shops became occupied by fashion boutiques , some of which are branches of global designer brands . The street still has a reputation as a fashionable place for shopping , including the flagship stores for Ralph Lauren and Cartier . Fenwick have had a department store on Bond Street since 1891 . The Phillips building at No. 101 is still used for auctions ; the company was bought by Bonhams in 2001 and subsequently spent £ 30 million expanding and refurbishing the premises . In 2015 , Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street . 
 The street features " Allies " , a statue of Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt , who are portrayed sitting on a park bench in conversation , sculpted by Lawrence Holofcener . The statue , popular with tourists , was unveiled in May 1995 by Princess Margaret and was erected by the Bond Street Association to commemorate 50 years since the end of World War II . In 2013 , maquettes of the sculpture ( which are replicas , as Holofcener did not make any as part of the original artwork or design ) were sold at Bonhams . 
 The construction of Crossrail , part of which runs between Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road stations , involved demolition of property in nearby Hanover Square , some of which backs onto New Bond Street . This affected Nos. 64 – 72 , which required refurbishment . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Bond Street has been mentioned in several works of literature , including Jane Austen 's novel Sense and Sensibility and Virginia Woolf 's 1925 novel Mrs Dalloway . The plot of the 1948 film Bond Street centres around items purchased from shops on the street . In Suzanna Clarke 's novel Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell , Bond Street is described as having " the most fashionable shops in all the kingdom " . 
 Bond Street is also a square on the British Monopoly board , and is the most expensive of the green @-@ coloured set that also includes Regent and Oxford Streets . The three streets are grouped together because of their shared history in shopping and retail . 
 = Gateshead International Stadium = 
 Gateshead International Stadium is a multi @-@ purpose , all @-@ seater venue in Gateshead , Tyne and Wear , England . Originally known as the Gateshead Youth Stadium , the venue was built in 1955 at a cost of £ 30 @,@ 000 . It has since been extensively re @-@ developed on three occasions . Its capacity of around 11 @,@ 800 is the greatest in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead , the third @-@ largest in Tyne and Wear ( behind only St James ' Park and the Stadium of Light ) and the sixth @-@ largest in North East England . 
 The main arena is principally used for athletics . The inaugural athletics competition at the redeveloped venue , the 1974 " Gateshead Games " , was instigated by Brendan Foster , a Gateshead Council employee at that time . By breaking the world record in the men 's 3 @,@ 000 m , Foster brought international publicity to the new stadium and began a tradition of athletics competitions at the venue , which has since hosted the British Grand Prix ( 2003 – 10 ) and the European Team Championships in 1989 , 2000 and 2013 . It is the only venue to have hosted the latter event three times . Five world records have been set at the stadium , including two by pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva and a tied 100 metres record by Asafa Powell in 2006 . 
 Although the venue primarily caters for athletics , it is the current or former home to teams in several sports . Gateshead football club have played their home games at the stadium since 1970 . Gateshead International Stadium was home to the Gateshead Thunder rugby league club during their spell in the Super League and the replacement Gateshead Thunder club played home games in the main arena , which was known as the Thunderdome when used by that team until the club relocated to Newcastle in 2015 . Gateshead Harriers Athletic Club , which includes Foster and Jonathan Edwards among its life members , are the oldest tenants , having used the site since 1956 . The stadium has also been used as a concert venue by numerous musical artists including Bon Jovi , Bryan Adams and Tina Turner .

 The Stadium is built on the site of two large chemical works opened in 1827 and 1834 . These works initially thrived , but by the early part of the 20th century both were in terminal decline , and were demolished in 1932 to leave behind a 2 @-@ million @-@ tonne heap of spoil . This land , approximately 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of the centre of Gateshead , was cleared in 1942 but continued to lie derelict until the mid @-@ 1950s . 
 In early 1955 , Gateshead Council began work on transforming this land . The Gateshead Youth Stadium , built on the site of the old chemical works , was opened by Jim Peters on 27 August 1955 . Costing £ 30 @,@ 000 , the original venue contained little more than a cinder running track and an asphalt cycling track , though floodlights and a seating area were added soon after . On 1 July 1961 , the arena hosted its first major competition — the Vaux Breweries International Athletics Meet — but according to sportswriter John Gibson , the Youth Stadium remained " little more than a minor track with a tiny grandstand and open terraces " . 
 According to author Thomas Telfer , by the turn of the 1970s , the town of Gateshead was suffering from " the classic symptoms of decay in its inner @-@ city areas " . The response during the 1960s had been a programme of systematic derelict land reclamation and environmental improvement . While these measures did not have an immediate positive impact on the perception of the town , Gateshead Council pressed ahead by looking to develop existing infrastructure with a view to overall regeneration . One such opportunity was identified at the Gateshead Youth Stadium , where the council believed that investment might raise the region 's profile and bring international recognition . In April 1974 , Gateshead Council inaugurated a " Sport and Recreation " department . In July 1974 , the council appointed Brendan Foster — a former schoolteacher turned athlete and a native of Tyne and Wear — as the Council 's sport and recreation manager . Foster , who according to Gibson became " the father of Gateshead athletics " , had been forced to train in Edinburgh during 1973 as a result of the poor condition of the Youth Stadium track . In December 1973 , he had been invited to a civic reception to celebrate his breaking of the two @-@ mile world record earlier that year at Crystal Palace . At this reception , Foster was told that a new synthetic track was being laid at Gateshead Youth Stadium . His response was a promise that , if the Council was serious , he would run at the stadium and break a world record ( Foster later offered an explanation of that promise : " You know how it is when you 've had a few drinks — you promise the world ! " ) . When the track was laid in early 1974 , Foster became convinced of the Council 's sincerity . He was interviewed for the managerial position and , upon appointment , became the " driving force " behind the programme of improvements to the Youth Stadium , which included the building of the main , covered Tyne and Wear stand in 1981 and three accompanying stands ; the venue was renamed the Gateshead International Stadium . This first tranche of improvements cost around £ 8 million , and Foster 's proposal to commemorate the re @-@ opening with an athletic event was approved , allowing for the first " Gateshead Games " to be held in 1974 . 
 The success of the first Gateshead Games , and their subsequent annual renewal , raised the profile of the stadium and caused Gateshead Council to further their financial investment . During the 1980s , additions were made to the site infrastructure , including the building of an indoor sports hall , outdoor football pitches and a gymnasium . In 1989 the running track was again relayed and Gateshead confirmed its reputation as a top @-@ class athletics venue by hosting the Europa Cup ( forerunner to the European Team Championships ) . In the 21st century , the site has been the subject of two major re @-@ development projects . The first was completed in 2006 , when two artificial outdoor football pitches , indoor athletic training facilities , sports science provisions and conferencing rooms were added at a cost of £ 15 million . The revamped stadium , funded by collaboration between One NorthEast , Sport England and Gateshead College among others , was opened on 12 May 2006 by Sebastian Coe . 
 A second tranche of development , undertaken in two stages , was approved in November 2009 . This included a general refurbishment and improvement of the existing facilities at the stadium , adding cover , better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand , improving wheelchair access , adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre . This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council , local development funds and Gateshead College . The covering of the 4 @,@ 000 @-@ seat East Stand with a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010 , immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a Diamond League event . The second stage of the re @-@ development — the building of the corporate and media facilities — commenced on 6 September 2010 and was completed on time in summer 2011 . The total cost of the work was estimated to be £ 7 @.@ 6 million . 
 A third programme of expansion was initially mooted in 2008 . The aim of this programme was to expand the stadium into an all @-@ embracing " sports village " , replete with an ice rink , indoor golf course , restaurants and shops . Gateshead Council invited tenders in August 2008 from commercial organisations interested in undertaking the development . A formal draft development brief was compiled and published in November 2009 . A report to Council in December 2009 noted that there had been " a reasonable level of interest at the preliminary stage " from private investors , but that only one detailed proposal had been submitted , which had been declined by the Council on financial grounds . The report also noted concerns that the original centrepiece of the proposed village , the ice rink , may have been deterring investors and that a similar proposal to redevelop land at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland was detracting from what councillors had hoped to be a unique feature of the proposed village . The result was that a fresh proposal was raised to remove the ice rink from the brief in an attempt to " stimulate the market " . A public consultation was undertaken and in May 2010 the council reported that 327 of the 375 responses received were in favour of the amended proposal . As a result , notice was given to developers that the council intended to market the site and ten responses were received .

 Gateshead International Stadium and its facilities occupy 24 @.@ 4 hectares ( 60 acres ) of land . The main athletics arena at Gateshead International Stadium is an all @-@ seater , bowl @-@ shaped arena consisting of four stands of seats . The precise capacity of the venue is uncertain ; some sources claim it to be 11 @,@ 750 , others 11 @,@ 762 and some provide a figure of 11 @,@ 800 . The main stand is the Tyne and Wear Stand , a steep , cantilevered structure seating 3 @,@ 300 spectators . This stand contains toilet and catering facilities and a bar area . Opposite is the East Stand , a 4 @,@ 000 @-@ seat structure that was uncovered until 2010 , when a cantilevered canopy roof was added . A bespoke design by Fabric Architecture , the roof is a 30 metres ( 98 ft ) structure incorporating five barrel vault forms . Part of the same improvement plan added toilet and catering facilities to the East Stand . The South Terrace , sometimes referred to as simply the South Stand , consists of a continuous , uncovered bank of seating in eight blocks with access through four turnstiles . The North Terrace is opposite and consists of two blocks of uncovered seating separated by a large scoreboard . 
 The athletics track in the main arena was laid in 2003 and is an International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) standard 400m eight @-@ lane oval . It is a polymer synthetic tartan track with a depth of 3 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 18 in ) . The sprint straight consists of eight lanes and is situated in front of the Tyne and Wear Stand , adjacent to the long and triple jump area . A height @-@ adjustable water jump , for use in steeplechase racing , is located on the inside of the track . Floodlights allow athletics events to be held at night . The inner track area , which is floodlit , is an IAAF standard @-@ sized grass surface used for athletics field events , rugby and football . When used for the latter , the pitch dimensions are 100 by 64 metres ( 109 @.@ 4 yd × 70 @.@ 0 yd ) . 
 The main arena is supplemented by other facilities . To the rear of the North Terrace are two third generation artificial pitches that are UEFA licensed , fully floodlit and full @-@ sized for use in competitive rugby , football and American football . Alongside them are two grassed and one sand @-@ dressed playing areas , which are also floodlit . Behind the Tyne and Wear Stand is an indoor sports hall , which contains a 33 by 44 metres ( 36 @.@ 1 yd × 48 @.@ 1 yd ) playing area marked out for various sports including badminton , netball and tennis . A retractable indoor athletics facility was previously housed alongside the sports hall , consisting of a 50 metres ( 55 yd ) long synthetic sprint straight and areas for throwing and jumping events , but its mechanical operation proved problematic and a more modern structure replaced it in 2006 . This facility has a 60 metres ( 66 yd ) sprint straight in an 82 metres ( 90 yd ) hall , throwing and jumping facilities , a weights room and gymnasium . 
 = = Athletics = = 
 The first major athletic event held at the stadium was the Vaux Breweries International Athletics meet in July 1961 . According to its sponsors , the highlight of this meet was the team three @-@ mile race , won by the Blackpool and Fylde Athletic club who were awarded a gold tankard as their prize . Attracted by a prize fund of £ 500 and the imminent AAA Championships in London , the event attracted several athletes from New Zealand , including reigning 5000m metre Olympic champion Murray Halberg and Peter Snell , the reigning 800m Olympic champion . Watched by a capacity crowd of 10 @,@ 000 spectators , the men won their respective races ; Halberg placed first in the mile with a time of 4 : 03 : 70 and Snell led a New Zealand one @-@ two in the 880 @-@ yard event , finishing ahead of teammate Gary Philpott in 1 : 50 : 40 . 
 When the comprehensive refurbishment of the stadium was completed more than a decade later , Brendan Foster ( by this time a Gateshead Council employee ) proposed an international athletics meet . On 3 August 1974 , the first " Gateshead Games " were staged in front of around 10 @,@ 000 spectators . Four weeks before he won the European 5000m title at the 1974 European Athletics Championships in Rome , Foster kept his earlier promise to run in the men 's 3000m and won the race in a new world @-@ record time of 7 : 35 : 20 . According to journalist John Gibson , Foster 's performance gave the meet , broadcast live by Tyne Tees Television , " landmark status " . A plaque commemorating the record was later placed at the entrance to the stadium . 
 The Gateshead Games became an annual event , which gave the stadium credibility as a major sporting venue . In his managerial capacity with Gateshead Council , Foster was increasingly able to attract athletes to the games . In 1977 , Foster had to intervene when BBC Radio Newcastle provided the wrong Ethiopian national anthem which , when played , offended <unk> Yifter sufficiently that he and his teammates started off towards Newcastle International Airport . The intervention worked — in the end , Foster asked Yifter and his teammates if they would sing the anthem themselves , which they did in the middle of the stadium — and Yifter returned to outclass a field including Steve <unk> over 5000m . The track was resurfaced by <unk> in 1982 and the venues ' profile was further raised in the summer of 1983 , when Gateshead @-@ born athlete Steve Cram faced Sebastian Coe over 800m in the Gateshead Games . In front of a reported crowd of 15 @,@ 000 who were " shoehorned into the bowl " and millions more watching on BBC 's Sunday Grandstand , Cram prevailed to spark " pandemonium " in his final race before winning the gold medal at the 1983 World Athletics Championships in Helsinki . 
 In 1989 , Gateshead hosted the Europa Cup . The men 's competition was won for the first time by a Great Britain team captained by Linford Christie and which included Kriss <unk> and Jack Buckner ; the event was described a decade later as having had an " invigorating effect " on those who were in attendance . Four years later , on 30 July 1993 , a stadium @-@ record crowd of 14 @,@ 797 watched Christie , by this time the reigning 100m Olympic champion , in action again – this time against his old rival Carl Lewis in a race where both men were reportedly paid £ 100 @,@ 000 irrespective of the result . Christie won in a time of 10 @.@ 07 seconds , ahead of Jon Drummond in second and Lewis , who finished " a distant third " . The 100m race was the highlight of the " high profile " Vauxhall Invitational meet , which was televised in the UK by ITV and watched by around 10 million viewers . Michael Johnson , John Regis and Steve Cram competed in various events at the Vauxhall Invitational . 
 In August 1998 , Gateshead was selected to host the 2000 Europa Cup after the European Athletic Association switched the event from original host venue Martinique to avoid athletes travelling long distances in an Olympic year . This made Gateshead the first venue to host the event twice . On 16 – 17 July 2000 , spectators at Gateshead once again saw Great Britain 's men 's team take the title , this time by half a point from Germany in second place ; the British victory came despite missing ten first @-@ choice team members . The women 's event was won by Russia , who defeated second @-@ placed Germany by thirteen points . 
 Foster 's " Gateshead Games " had become the British Grand Prix by 2003 , and on 13 July 21 @-@ year @-@ old Yelena Isinbayeva set a new world record of <unk> in the women 's pole vault event . Isinbayeva 's achievement in the last event of the meet was so unexpected that only 1 @,@ 000 of the 10 @,@ 000 spectators witnessed it , the rest having left early . For her achievement , she was given a bonus cheque for $ 50 @,@ 000 . On 27 June 2004 , Isinbayeva returned to Gateshead . This time the event organisers decided to schedule the pole vault event earlier and were rewarded when Isinbayeva defied extremely windy conditions to post a new record mark of <unk> Isinbayeva was the second woman to set a world record in the pole vault at Gateshead ; Daniela <unk> did so in 1995 . In 2006 , a crowd of 8 @,@ 500 saw Asafa Powell equal the world record of 9 @.@ 77 seconds in the men 's 100m . The official , un @-@ rounded time of 9 @.@ 762 seconds was then the fastest time ever recorded . The meet was also notable for the return to competition of Dwain Chambers after his ban for using performance @-@ enhancing drugs , and for Eliud Kipchoge breaking Foster 's stadium record over 3000m that had stood for more than three decades . 
 In 2010 , the British Grand Prix at Gateshead was chosen as one of the inaugural fourteen Diamond League events , but although competitors included Tyson Gay , Powell , Jessica Ennis and Vincent <unk> , the attendance was unusually poor , causing the local press to wonder whether Gateshead 's contract for the marquee event would be renewed . Those fears were to prove well @-@ founded when UK Athletics agreed to a three @-@ year contract to stage the event at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham . The move prompted one reporter to lament that " the switch is a major blow to both Gateshead International Stadium and North @-@ East sport in general , but can hardly be regarded as a major surprise given the dwindling support for major athletics events in the region . " 
 This loss was mitigated somewhat by the European Athletic Association 's decision to award Gateshead the 2013 European Team Championships , the successor to the Europa Cup . In doing so , Gateshead became the only stadium to host the European Team Championships on three occasions . The championships were held on 22 – 23 June 2013 amid very wet and windy conditions . On the first day of competition , Mo Farah ran a 50 @.@ 89 second final lap in winning the men 's 5000m to help the home team into third place on 181 points , behind Russia ( 194 points ) and Germany ( 195 points ) . Despite a strong start , the Great Britain team were unable to make up the deficit on the second day of competition and finished in third place overall on 338 points , behind runners @-@ up Germany ( 347 @.@ 5 points ) and the champions Russia ( 354 @.@ 5 points ) .

 Gateshead Harriers are an athletic club based at Gateshead International Stadium . Founded in 1904 as Gateshead St Mary 's Church Running Club , they were initially a men @-@ only club until allowing the admission of women in 1951 . The club moved to the Gateshead Youth Stadium in 1956 , making the Harriers the stadium 's oldest tenant . In 2006 they won promotion to the first division of the British Athletics League and were the only club from the north @-@ east of England to compete at that level . After a six @-@ year stay in the division , the Harriers were relegated to division two in August 2012 after failing to win enough points at the final meet of the season at Eton to prevent a bottom @-@ two league finish . Club officials received over 100 new applications for membership in the aftermath of the 2012 London Olympics . 
 At least one Gateshead Harrier has taken part in every Olympics and Paralympics held since 1972 .

 In 1998 , Gateshead was awarded a rugby league franchise after a three @-@ way contest with Cardiff and Swansea . The result was Gateshead Thunder , who played in Super League IV in 1999 . The Thunder played at Gateshead International Stadium and the club had , according to sports journalist Andy Wilson , " an enjoyable and surprisingly successful season " which included home and away wins against St Helens and a sixth @-@ place finish in the table – missing out on the playoffs by two points . Despite these performances , which attracted an average crowd of 3 @,@ 895 to Gateshead Stadium , the franchise lost £ 700 @,@ 000 in its first year and in November 1999 the Rugby Football League ( RFL ) approved a merger with the Hull Sharks . The result was the formation of Hull F.C. , and when the authorities refused permission for the merged clubs to enter a Hull @-@ based team into the RFL 's second tier , the franchise moved almost in its entirety to Hull , ending Gateshead 's Super League participation after a single season ; according to Wilson , the Thunder was " left to die , provoking bitter resentment " from supporters . 
 According to journalist Richard Bott , since the demise of the original Thunder side the club has " struggled for their very existence . " There have been some highlights , including winning Championship 1 in 2008 and a run to the quarter @-@ final of the Challenge Cup in 2009 which ended in a 66 – 6 defeat to Super League side St Helens in front of 4 @,@ 325 fans at Gateshead International Stadium . However , the Thunder went through a 64 @-@ game losing streak spanning two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years before winning against Workington Town on 29 August 2012 . 
 Relations between the Thunder and Gateshead Council were strained at times , with a possible move to Kingston Park Newcastle upon Tyne , first mooted , and rejected , in 2006 . In 2008 , the club committed itself again to Gateshead Stadium for the immediate future , however , in March 2014 The Journal reported that talks had begun between Thunder 's managing director Keith Christie and representatives of Newcastle Falcons with a view to the Falcons taking over the rugby league club . Falcons ' owner <unk> <unk> confirmed that a bid had been made to purchase Gateshead Thunder on 20 March 2014 , though he refused to elaborate on whether he intended to relocate the club if that bid was accepted . The takeover was confirmed on 23 May 2014 , though it was announced that the club would continue to play at the International Stadium . In January 2015 Gateshead Thunder were officially renamed Newcastle Thunder and relocated to Kingston Park . Keith Christie told the BBC that the move was " a business decision " designed to build a new fan base for the club .

 The episode was originally called " Up on the <unk> " , referencing the episode 's theme of roofies , before being changed to the final title of " A Trip to the Dentist " . " A Trip to the Dentist " has the return of several guest stars from a previous single episode , including Luke ( Sam Huntington ) from " You Think You Know Somebody " , Cole ( Daniel Bess ) from " Like a Virgin " , Casey Gant ( Jonathan Bennett ) from " Drinking the Kool @-@ Aid " , Sean Friedrich ( Kevin Sheridan ) from " An Echolls Family Christmas " , and Carrie Bishop ( Leighton Meester ) from " Mars vs. Mars " . Within the context of the episode , these characters reappeared so that Veronica could ask them what they knew about the party where she was raped . 
 This episode reintroduces and resolves Veronica 's rape , introduced earlier in the season . However , it had been largely ignored until this point in the series . The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega , after " Drinking the Kool @-@ Aid " and " Mars vs. Mars " . In addition , the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero 's sixth writing credit for the show . After the episode aired , Rob Thomas called the episode " our high @-@ water mark " . Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode , he stated , " She was really my right hand writing the series , and it felt good to have someone who knew the voices as well as I did . We were both in a comfort zone , both writing this show and writing with each other . " 
 In one scene of " A Trip to the Dentist " , Weevil ( Francis Capra ) accuses Logan ( Jason Dohring ) of having hit Lilly during their relationship . The series ' writers were planning to develop that plot strand into a storyline , with it eventually being revealed that Duncan had hit Lilly in an epileptic fit . However , the storyline was abandoned in order to make time for other story arcs . Thomas commented , " At the end of the day , I don 't want people thinking that Logan hit Lilly . I did , however , want Weevil to believe it . " Although Veronica concludes in this episode that she had consensual sex with Duncan while they were both under the influence of roofies , more information about the night is later revealed in the show 's second season finale , " Not Pictured " , in which it is revealed that Cassidy " Beaver " Casablancas raped her . When asked whether the writers knew that Beaver would be eventually revealed as the rapist when writing " A Trip to the Dentist " , Thomas responded , " I wish I could claim that we were that clever . " The writers realized that there was a moment in the episode 's script where Beaver could have raped Veronica roughly a month after its airing . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The episode , and particularly its treatment of rape , has been discussed in books of essays on Veronica Mars and elsewhere . Victoria E. Thomas , writing for In Media Res , opined that Veronica frequently distances herself from her rape , noting a scene in the pilot in which she states , " I 'm no longer that girl . " She regarded " A Trip to the Dentist " as a way for Veronica to heal from her rape , writing " Her healing is tied to finding out who raped her ; a simple solution to a complex issue . This choice could mirror our present day stigma and lack of support for survivors of sexual assault , or it could simply allow the producers to erase her identity as a sexual assault survivor , leading the audience to believe that the strength of the character is not tied to her rape . " 
 Sarah Whitney , in Investigating Veronica Mars : Essays on the Teen Detective Series , found the episode 's portrayal of rape " troubling " . She wrote , " On of the reasons this ending has always been problematic for me as a viewer is that it is a too @-@ familiar script . Women are frequently told ( or tell themselves ) that they have " misinterpreted " sexual situations by missing cues ( " leading men on " ) or by being " unclear " about their lack of consent . Furthermore , the episode leaves us bereft of a villain that can be nailed to the wall for forcible rape . " The writer went on to state that instead of placing the blame on a single person , " A Trip to the Dentist " blamed several people for Veronica 's rape . Whitney also wrote that despite that the " official resolution of the rape narrative denies a traditional ' whodunit ' ending , " it makes a statement that she was raped by an " unfeeling class of people . " 
 James and Mona Rocha argued that while " Veronica showed poor judgment in the episode , the blame for her rape should not be put on her — instead , Dick , Logan , Sean , Dick , and Cassidy ( Beaver ) should take the blame . Responsibility and blame aren 't zero @-@ sum reckonings , such that adding to one person 's blame automatically subtracts it from someone else 's . " Regarding Logan , they stated that " she wouldn 't have been raped , if not for Logan 's buying the GHB . " On Dick , they wrote that " Dick didn 't intend to drug Veronica , but he did intend to drug someone . " The pair argued that Veronica made some choices that were causally related to her rape , but they concluded that she did not deserve blame . " If someone like Veronica makes a bad prudential choice that causes her harm , then maybe she should blame herself , but we can 't blame her for any moral wrong done to her as a result . She may have acted foolishly , but that was within her rights . "

 The episode received critical acclaim . Kenneth Nguyen from The Age commented " ' A Trip to the Dentist ' , is perhaps the most complex , confronting installment thus far of a series that prides itself on being complex and confronting . " The reporter went on to praise the " expertly scripted " reveal and thought Diane Ruggiero 's " command of the tightrope high @-@ school milieu seems pretty much spot @-@ on . It is Ruggiero 's resolution of the mystery , however , that will keep fans talking . Like the best resolutions , I suppose , it raises more questions than it answers . " 
 Complex gave the episode a positive review , writing that it was overshadowed by " Leave It to Beaver " , but that it was also a good episode by itself as well . " [ The date rape mystery ] all comes to a head in the penultimate episode , which puts Veronica on the emotional rollercoaster until she gets to the uncomfortable truth . " The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars : " what really makes the episode special is the way it trots out every supporting player and case @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week guest star . " IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes , saying that " ' A Trip to the Dentist ' " is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation . The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful . It 's made even more sad when you realize that the version she believed to be the truth actually wasn 't . " 
 Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a positive review , stating that the reveal was " an effective narrative , and one which creates a " satisfying " resolution for the viewer as well as the character . Veronica Mars has done a good job of subverting expectations on a regular basis , but it ’ s still a TV show , with requirements for satisfying resolutions . [ ... ] Which is my roundabout way of saying that while I wasn ’ t surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane , I was impressed by how well it worked up to that point . It had to be Duncan or someone totally irrelevant and shocking . " Television Without Pity gave the episode an " A + " , its fourth such rating for the series , after " An Echolls Family Christmas " , " Clash of the Tritons " , and " M.A.D. " . 
 Conversely , Price Peterson , writing for TV.com , gave a more mixed review , heavily criticizing the resolution to Veronica 's rape case . While calling it an " entertaining episode " , he said that it had an " appalling message . " He explained by writing that " [ r ] <unk> of Duncan having been drugged , Veronica could not give consent to him any more than she could to the dudes who were playing puppet @-@ girl with her during the party . Regardless of the retroactive comfort of knowing that she 'd lost her virginity to someone she liked , Veronica did not remember it ... That kind of psychological trauma goes away immediately ? " Kimberly Roots of TV Line called the episode " cathartic " and that " we get a huge reveal from Duncan , some unintentionally very public <unk> PDA and a say @-@ it @-@ ain ’ t @-@ so @-@ Logan ! cliffhanger that swings us right into the season finale . " 
 Buzzfeed ranked the episode 3rd on its complete ranking of Veronica Mars episodes , comparing it to Buffy the Vampire Slayer — " both these shows have always managed a perfect balance between high school drama ( gossip , futile betrayals , and short @-@ lived romances ) and extremely powerful and dark themes ( sexism , rape , harassment , addiction , and domestic violence ) . " TV Line ranked the episode 2nd on a similar list , only below " Pilot " .

 The music video for " You Rock My World " was directed by Paul Hunter , and was released in 2001 . The video , which is over thirteen minutes long , was described as being a short film . The dance performed during the video consists of fragments from the canceled " Dangerous " music video . The video consists of Jackson 's and Tucker 's characters trying to gain a woman 's ( <unk> Dudley ) affection by subsequently following her around the neighborhood . The video for " You Rock My World " was thought to be the last music video to feature any participation from Jackson before the video for " One More Chance " was unearthed ( his following videos would consist of archive footage of himself and others ) . The video has been compared to Jackson 's previous 1980s music videos for his singles , " Smooth Criminal " ( 1987 ) , " Bad " ( 1987 ) , and " The Way You Make Me Feel " ( 1987 ) , all from his 1987 studio album , Bad . In the video , Jackson can be seen wearing a Blazer and his traditional hat . The video features appearances from Marlon Brando , Michael Madsen and Billy Drago . The video won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Music Video at the award shows 2002 ceremony . In several instances in the video , Tucker 's character makes several references to previous songs by Michael Jackson , such as " Beat It " , " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " , " The Girl Is Mine " , " Bad " and " Dangerous " . The short version of the music video appears on Number Ones , and the long version appears on Michael Jackson 's Vision .

 = Autism = 
 Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction , verbal and non @-@ verbal communication , and restricted and repetitive behavior . Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child 's life . These signs often develop gradually , though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress . The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood , typically before age three . 
 While autism is highly heritable , researchers suspect both environmental and genetic factors as causes . In rare cases , autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects . Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes ; for example , the vaccine hypotheses have been disproven . Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize ; how this occurs is not well understood . In the DSM V it is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum ( ASDs ) , the other two being Asperger syndrome , which lacks delays in cognitive development and language , and pervasive developmental disorder , not otherwise specified ( commonly abbreviated as PDD @-@ NOS ) , which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met . 
 Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self @-@ care , social , and communication skills . Although there is no known cure , there have been reported cases of children who recovered . Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood , though some become successful . An autistic culture has developed , with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder . 
 Globally , autism is estimated to affect 21 @.@ 7 million people as of 2013 . As of 2010 , the number of people affected is estimated at about 1 – 2 per 1 @,@ 000 worldwide . It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls . About 1 @.@ 5 % of children in the United States ( one in 68 ) are diagnosed with ASD as of 2014 , a 30 % increase from one in 88 in 2012 . The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1 @.@ 1 % . The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s , partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government @-@ subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses ; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood , and generally follows a steady course without remission . People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal , or even superior , in others . Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years , and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form . It is distinguished not by a single symptom , but by a characteristic triad of symptoms : impairments in social interaction ; impairments in communication ; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior . Other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis . Autism 's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits . 
 = = = Social development = = = 
 Social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ; see Classification ) from other developmental disorders . People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted . Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of <unk> , or people with normal neural development , as leaving her feeling " like an anthropologist on Mars " . 
 Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood . Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name . Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms ; for example , they have less eye contact and turn @-@ taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things . <unk> to five @-@ year @-@ old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding , approach others spontaneously , imitate and respond to emotions , communicate nonverbally , and take turns with others . However , they do form attachments to their primary caregivers . Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children , although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD . Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person 's own emotions . 
 Children with high @-@ functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non @-@ autistic peers , despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone . Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism . For them , the quality of friendships , not the number of friends , predicts how lonely they feel . Functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply . 
 There are many anecdotal reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD . The limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and tantrums . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs . Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life , and may include delayed onset of babbling , unusual gestures , diminished responsiveness , and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver . In the second and third years , children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling , consonants , words , and word combinations ; their gestures are less often integrated with words . Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences , and are more likely to simply repeat others ' words ( echolalia ) or reverse pronouns . Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech , and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD : for example , they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed @-@ at object , and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience . Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language . 
 In a pair of studies , high @-@ functioning children with autism aged 8 – 15 performed equally well as , and adults better than , individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling . Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension and inference . As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends . 
 = = = Repetitive behavior = = = 
 Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior , which the Repetitive Behavior Scale @-@ Revised ( RBS @-@ R ) categorizes as follows . 
 <unk> behaviors : Repetitive movements , such as hand flapping , head rolling , or body rocking . 
 Compulsive behaviors : Time @-@ consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules , such as placing objects in a specific order , checking things , or hand washing . 
 <unk> is resistance to change ; for example , insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted . 
 Ritualistic behavior involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities , such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual . This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors . 
 Restricted behavior is limited in focus , interest , or activity , such as preoccupation with a single television program , toy or game . 
 Self @-@ injury includes movements that injure or can injure the person , such as eye @-@ poking , skin @-@ picking , hand @-@ biting and head @-@ banging . 
 No single repetitive or self @-@ injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism , but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors . 
 = = = Other symptoms = = = 
 Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family . An estimated 0 @.@ 5 % to 10 % of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities , ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants . Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention , relative to the general population . Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 % of those with autism , and are considered core features by some , although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders . Differences are greater for under @-@ <unk> ( for example , walking into things ) than for over @-@ <unk> ( for example , distress from loud noises ) or for sensation seeking ( for example , rhythmic movements ) . An estimated 60 % – 80 % of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone , poor motor planning , and toe walking ; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper . 
 Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three @-@ quarters of children with ASD , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator . Selectivity is the most common problem , although eating rituals and food refusal also occur ; this does not appear to result in malnutrition . Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms , there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual ; studies report conflicting results , and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear . 
 Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress . Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship . However , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome ; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well @-@ being and poorer sibling relationships as adults . 
 = = Causes = = 
 It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autism 's characteristic triad of symptoms . However , there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co @-@ occur . 
 Autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants . Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes , the environment , and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression . Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents . 
 Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0 @.@ 7 for autism and as high as 0 @.@ 9 for ASD , and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population . However , most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified . Typically , autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian ( single @-@ gene ) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality , and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD . Numerous candidate genes have been located , with only small effects attributable to any particular gene . Most loci individually explain less than 1 % of cases of autism . The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation — such as deletions , duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis . Hence , a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited : that is , the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome . 
 Several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism . Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways , such as those involved with cell adhesion . Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity @-@ dependent changes . All known teratogens ( agents that cause birth defects ) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later , there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development . 
 Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and particulates , may increase the risk of autism . Environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvents , diesel exhaust , PCBs , <unk> and phenols used in plastic products , pesticides , brominated flame retardants , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines , and prenatal stress , but no evidence has been found for these claims , and some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven . 
 Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination . This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine " overload " , a vaccine preservative , or the MMR vaccine for causing autism . The latter theory was supported by a litigation @-@ funded study that has since been shown to have been " an elaborate fraud " . Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations , outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the preventable deaths of several children . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 Autism 's symptoms result from maturation @-@ related changes in various systems of the brain . How autism occurs is not well understood . Its mechanism can be divided into two areas : the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism , and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors . The behaviors appear to have multiple <unk> . 
 = = = Pathophysiology = = = 
 Unlike many other brain disorders , such as Parkinson 's , autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular , cellular , or systems level ; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways , or is ( like intellectual disability ) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms . Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems , and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product . <unk> studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism 's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception . This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors . Just after birth , the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual , followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood . It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism . It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization . Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following : 
 An excess of neurons that causes local <unk> in key brain regions . 
 Disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation . 
 Unbalanced excitatory – inhibitory networks . 
 Abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines , for example , by modulation of the <unk> – <unk> cell @-@ adhesion system , or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins . Disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy , which may explain why the two conditions are associated . 
 The immune system is thought to play an important role in autism . Children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro @-@ inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia . <unk> of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication . Interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life , and successful <unk> depends on a balanced immune response . It is thought that activation of a pregnant mother 's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development . This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism . 
 The relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood ; several have been investigated , with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport . The role of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors ( <unk> ) in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome , the most common identified genetic cause of autism , has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway . Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors . Also , some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism , but probably account for less than 5 % of cases . 
 The mirror neuron system ( MNS ) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism 's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties . The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action . The MNS may contribute to an individual 's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions , intentions , and emotions . Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD , delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome , and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD . However , individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object . 
 ASD @-@ related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks . In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network , a large @-@ scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing , with intact connectivity of the task @-@ positive network , used in sustained attention and goal @-@ directed thinking . In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time , suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks , possibly reflecting a disturbance of self @-@ referential thought . 
 The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by <unk> high @-@ level neural connections and synchronization , along with an excess of low @-@ level processes . Evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local <unk> in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex . Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex . 
 From studies based on event @-@ related potentials , transient changes to the brain 's electrical activity in response to stimuli , there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention , orientation to auditory and visual stimuli , novelty detection , language and face processing , and information storage ; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli . For example , magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain 's processing of auditory signals . 
 In the genetic area , relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes ; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q21.1 deletion syndrome . Research on autism / schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 ( <unk> ) , chromosome 16 ( <unk> ) and chromosome 17 ( <unk> ) are inconclusive . 
 Functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and hyper @-@ connectivity in brains of people with autism . <unk> @-@ connectivity seems to dominate , especially for <unk> and <unk> @-@ cortical functional connectivity . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior . 
 The first category focuses on deficits in social cognition . Simon Baron @-@ Cohen 's empathizing – systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can <unk> — that is , they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain — but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents . An extension , the extreme male brain theory , hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain , defined <unk> as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing . These theories are somewhat related to Baron @-@ Cohen 's earlier theory of mind approach , which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others . The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the Sally – Anne test for reasoning about others ' motivations , and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in Pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis . However , most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ' ability to understand other people 's basic intentions or goals ; instead , data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others ' viewpoints . 
 The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing : the executive functions such as working memory , planning , inhibition . In his review , Kenworthy states that " the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial " , however , " it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism " . Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence , but performance never reaches typical adult levels . A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests ; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism . 
 Weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism . One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people . A related theory — enhanced perceptual functioning — focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals . These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism . 
 Neither category is satisfactory on its own ; social cognition theories poorly address autism 's rigid and repetitive behaviors , while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties . A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Diagnosis is based on behavior , not cause or mechanism . Under the DSM @-@ 5 , autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts , as well as restricted , repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities . These deficits are present in early childhood , typically before age three , and lead to clinically significant functional impairment . Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity , stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language , and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects . The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome , intellectual disability or global developmental delay . ICD @-@ 10 uses essentially the same definition . 
 Several diagnostic instruments are available . Two are commonly used in autism research : the Autism Diagnostic Interview @-@ Revised ( ADI @-@ R ) is a <unk> parent interview , and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( <unk> ) uses observation and interaction with the child . The Childhood Autism Rating Scale ( CARS ) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children . 
 A pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child . If warranted , diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists , observing and assessing cognitive , communication , family , and other factors using standardized tools , and taking into account any associated medical conditions . A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills , both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions . A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability , hearing impairment , and a specific language impairment such as Landau – <unk> syndrome . The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression . 
 Clinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause . Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 % of cases to genetic causes , consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high @-@ resolution chromosome and fragile X testing . A genotype @-@ first model of diagnosis has been proposed , which would routinely assess the genome 's copy number variations . As new genetic tests are developed several ethical , legal , and social issues will emerge . Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results , given the complexity of autism 's genetics . Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful , but are not routine . 
 ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months , although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life : for example , a one @-@ year @-@ old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three @-@ year @-@ old to continue to do so a few years later . In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment , though few cases are handled that quickly in practice . Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood , they are sometimes missed ; years later , adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves , to help their employers make adjustments , or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits . 
 <unk> and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases , and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices . The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD , resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms . Conversely , the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis . It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired , partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision , and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or <unk> . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 Autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders ( PDD ) , which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication , and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior . These symptoms do not imply sickness , fragility , or emotional disturbance . 
 Of the five PDD forms , Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes ; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism , but may have unrelated causes ; PDD not otherwise specified ( PDD @-@ NOS ; also called atypical autism ) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder . Unlike with autism , people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development . The terminology of autism can be bewildering , with autism , Asperger syndrome and PDD @-@ NOS often called the autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) or sometimes the autistic disorders , whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder , childhood autism , or infantile autism . In this article , autism refers to the classic autistic disorder ; in clinical practice , though , autism , ASD , and PDD are often used interchangeably . ASD , in turn , is a subset of the broader autism phenotype , which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic @-@ like traits , such as avoiding eye contact . 
 The manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairments — who may be silent , developmentally disabled , and locked into hand flapping and rocking — to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches , narrowly focused interests , and verbose , pedantic communication . Because the behavior spectrum is continuous , boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary . Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low- , medium- or high @-@ functioning autism ( LFA , MFA , and HFA ) , based on IQ thresholds , or on how much support the individual requires in daily life ; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial . Autism can also be divided into syndromal and non @-@ syndromal autism ; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms , such as tuberous sclerosis . Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism , the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome , HFA , and non @-@ syndromal autism is unclear . 
 Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills , as opposed to a failure to make progress , typically from 15 to 30 months of age . The validity of this distinction remains controversial ; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype , or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression . 
 Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry , psychology , neurology and pediatrics . Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes ( observable traits ) that can be viewed on brain scans , to help further <unk> studies of autism ; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain , which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects . It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior . 
 = = Screening = = 
 About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child 's unusual behaviors by age 18 months , and about four @-@ fifths notice by age 24 months . According to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones " is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations . Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long @-@ term outcome " . 
 No babbling by 12 months . 
 No gesturing ( pointing , waving , etc . ) by 12 months . 
 No single words by 16 months . 
 No two @-@ word ( spontaneous , not just <unk> ) phrases by 24 months . 
 Any loss of any language or social skills , at any age . 
 The United States Preventative Services Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns . The Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months , using autism @-@ specific formal screening tests . In contrast , in the UK , children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened . It is not known which approach is more effective . Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers ( M @-@ CHAT ) , the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire , and the First Year Inventory ; initial data on M @-@ CHAT and its predecessor , the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers ( CHAT ) , on children aged 18 – 30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity ( many false @-@ negatives ) but good specificity ( few false @-@ positives ) . It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders . Screening tools designed for one culture 's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture . Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical , it can be considered in some cases , such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1 % of cases of autism ; vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases . 
 = = Management = = 
 The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress , and to increase quality of life and functional independence . In general , higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes . No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child 's needs . Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment . Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy , however the development of evidence @-@ based interventions has advanced in recent years . Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence , suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment , the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor , their clinical results are mostly tentative , and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options . Intensive , sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self @-@ care , social , and job skills , and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors ; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated . Available approaches include applied behavior analysis ( ABA ) , developmental models , structured teaching , speech and language therapy , social skills therapy , and occupational therapy . Among these approaches , interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively , or <unk> treatment on a specific area of deficit . There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention ( <unk> ) , an early intervention model based on ABA for 20 to 40 hours a week for multiple years , is an effective treatment for some children with ASD . Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis ( ABA ) and developmental social pragmatic models ( DSP ) . One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model , which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques , allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves . Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at @-@ home parent implementation . Despite the recent development of parent training models , these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies , being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children : intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well @-@ established for improving intellectual performance of young children . Similarly , teacher @-@ implemented intervention that utilizes an ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well @-@ established treatment in improving social @-@ communication skills in young children , although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms . Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators , resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided . It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up , and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results . The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers . 
 = = = Medication = = = 
 Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails . More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants , with the most common drug classes being antidepressants , stimulants , and antipsychotics . Antipsychotics , such as risperidone and <unk> , have been found to be useful for treating irritability , repetitive behavior , and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism , however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits , and people with autism may respond atypically . There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD . No known medication relieves autism 's core symptoms of social and communication impairments . Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function , suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism . 
 = = = Alternative medicine = = = 
 Although many alternative therapies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies . Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality @-@ of @-@ life contexts , and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real @-@ world relevance . Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing , training availability , and parent requests . Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk . A 2008 study found that compared to their peers , autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein @-@ free diets ; in 2005 , botched chelation therapy killed a five @-@ year @-@ old child with autism . There has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism . 
 Although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism , there is no good evidence that a gluten @-@ free diet is of benefit . In the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviours . 
 = = = Cost = = = 
 Treatment is expensive ; indirect costs are more so . For someone born in 2000 , a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ 4 @.@ 07 million ( net present value in 2016 dollars , inflation @-@ adjusted from 2003 estimate ) , with about 10 % medical care , 30 % extra education and other care , and 60 % lost economic productivity . Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child , and <unk> out @-@ of @-@ pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems ; one 2008 US study found a 14 % average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD , and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment . US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services , shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance . After childhood , key treatment issues include residential care , job training and placement , sexuality , social skills , and estate planning . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism . Through this movement , people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease . Proponents of this movement wish to seek “ acceptance , not cures . ” There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as World Autism Awareness Day , Light It Up Blue , Autism Sunday , Autistic Pride Day , <unk> , and others . There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone ’ s life . These organizations include Autism Speaks , Autism National Committee , Autism Society of America , and many others . Social @-@ science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about “ autism as a culture , <unk> comparisons … and research on social movements . ” Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism . Rain Man , a film that won 4 Oscars including Best Picture , depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities . While many <unk> don 't have these special abilities , there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 There is no known cure . Children recover occasionally , so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD ; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not . It is not known how often recovery happens ; reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3 % to 25 % . Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger , though a few have developed communication skills in later years . Most children with autism lack social support , meaningful relationships , future employment opportunities or self @-@ determination . Although core difficulties tend to persist , symptoms often become less severe with age . 
 Few high @-@ quality studies address long @-@ term prognosis . Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills , but a few decline ; no study has focused on autism after midlife . Acquiring language before age six , having an IQ above 50 , and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes ; independent living is unlikely with severe autism . Most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1 – 2 per 1 @,@ 000 for autism and close to 6 per 1 @,@ 000 for ASD , and 11 per 1 @,@ 000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008 ; because of inadequate data , these numbers may underestimate ASD 's true rate . Globally , autism affects an estimated 21 @.@ 7 million people as of 2013 , while Asperger syndrome affects a further 31 @.@ 1 million . In 2012 , the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1 @.@ 1 % . Rates of PDD @-@ NOS 's has been estimated at 3 @.@ 7 per 1 @,@ 000 , Asperger syndrome at roughly 0 @.@ 6 per 1 @,@ 000 , and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0 @.@ 02 per 1 @,@ 000 . CDC 's most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children , or 14 @.@ 7 per 1 @,@ 000 , has an ASD as of 2010 . 
 The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s . This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices , referral patterns , availability of services , age at diagnosis , and public awareness , though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out . The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism 's true prevalence has increased ; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics . 
 Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls . The sex ratio averages 4 @.@ 3 : 1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment : it may be close to 2 : 1 with intellectual disability and more than 5 @.@ 5 : 1 without . Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated , but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed ; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed . 
 Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy @-@ related risk factor as a cause of autism , the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent , and with diabetes , bleeding , and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy . The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers ; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm , and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism . Most professionals believe that race , ethnicity , and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism . 
 Several other conditions are common in children with autism . They include : 
 Genetic disorders . About 10 – 15 % of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian ( single @-@ gene ) condition , chromosome abnormality , or other genetic syndrome , and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders . 
 Intellectual disability . The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25 % to 70 % , a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence . In comparison , for PDD @-@ NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker , and by definition , the diagnosis of Asperger 's excludes intellectual disability . 
 Anxiety disorders are common among children with ASD ; there are no firm data , but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11 % to 84 % . Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself , or are hard to distinguish from ASD 's symptoms . 
 Epilepsy , with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age , cognitive level , and type of language disorder . 
 Several metabolic defects , such as phenylketonuria , are associated with autistic symptoms . 
 Minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population . 
 <unk> diagnoses . Although the DSM @-@ IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism , the full criteria for Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , Tourette syndrome , and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted . 
 Sleep problems affect about two @-@ thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood . These most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep , frequent nocturnal awakenings , and early morning awakenings . Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress , and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis . 
 = = History = = 
 A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named . The Table Talk of Martin Luther , compiled by his <unk> , <unk> , contains the story of a 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy who may have been severely autistic . Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil , and suggested that he be suffocated , although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report . The earliest well @-@ documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of <unk> , as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair 's marriage to gain Blair 's inheritance . The Wild Boy of Aveyron , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation . 
 The New Latin word <unk> ( English translation autism ) was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia . He derived it from the Greek word <unk> ( <unk> , meaning " self " ) , and used it to mean morbid self @-@ admiration , referring to " autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance " . 
 The word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler 's terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in German about child psychology . Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 . Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used autism in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities . Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner 's first paper on the subject , notably " autistic aloneness " and " insistence on sameness " , are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders . It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger . 
 Kanner 's reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia , and child psychiatry 's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant 's response to " refrigerator mothers " . Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong , distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders , and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy . As late as the mid @-@ 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism ; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions . Although the rise of parent organizations and the <unk> of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD , parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child 's autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others , and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research . 
 The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely . Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being .

 State Route 844 ( SR 844 ) is a 2 @.@ 395 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 854 km ) state route that runs between Beavercreek and Wright @-@ Patterson Air Force Base in the US state of Ohio . The north – south signed route is a spur freeway which mainly passes through government @-@ owned properties . For some of its path , SR 844 passes through Wright State University . The highway was first signed in 1995 on the same alignment as today . SR 844 replaced the SR <unk> designation of the highway , which dated back to 1989 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 844 begins at a partial interchange with Interstate 675 ( I @-@ 675 ) . The route heads northeast as a four @-@ lane controlled @-@ access highway , passing under North Fairfield Road . The road has a partial interchange with Colonel Glenn Highway , before passing on the southeast and east sides of Wright State University . The highway curves due north , having an interchange with University Boulevard . After the interchange with University Boulevard , the road curves northwest , passing over SR 444 . Followed by an interchange with SR 444 , SR 844 ends at Gate 15A of Wright @-@ Patterson Air Force Base . 
 SR 844 is signed as " McClernon Memorial Skyway " , after the late Brigadier General Glen J. McClernon . McClernon had been base commander during the time the university was being established — partially on land deeded to it by the Air Force base — and also had been a two @-@ term mayor of Fairborn . 
 The entire length of SR 844 is part of the National Highway System , a system of routes important to the nation 's economy , mobility and defense . The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation ( ODOT ) . 
 = = History = = 
 SR 844 was originally SR <unk> , which opened by 1989 . After a public comment period in 1994 , ODOT changed the number to " 844 " by 1995 . Although legally designated as " McClernon @-@ Skyway Memorial Drive " on September 22 , 1989 , SR 844 is both signed and recognized by the state as " McClernon Memorial Skyway " .
