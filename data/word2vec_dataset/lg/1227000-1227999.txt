 Numerous video game journalists and enthusiasts including Thomas , Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack , GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer , and 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish , refer to the fourth installment as a turning point for the quality of titles in the Mega Man series . Nutt and Speer admitted that the series was beginning to deteriorate with this game , likely due to the growing reputation of the more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System at the time of its release . Parrish proclaimed , " Here 's where the series starts to go off the rails a bit -- the Dr. Wily fake out was silly , the music was terrible , the bosses and weapons were uninspired , and the ability to charge up the Mega Buster is often cited as a game @-@ breaking innovation . " Thomas identified the chargeable Mega Buster as disrupting the balance of the game and rendering many of the Master Weapons useless , one of the concepts that set the Mega Man games apart from other action @-@ platformers . 
 Mega Man 4 was re @-@ released for the PlayStation as part of the Rockman Complete Works series in 1999 . This version of the game features a special " navi mode " that guides players through each level and has arranged music remixes . A port of the Complete Works edition was released on the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube in 2004 and the Xbox in 2005 , as part of the North American @-@ exclusive Mega Man Anniversary Collection . The NES version has also been re @-@ released on Japanese i @-@ mode mobile phones in 2005 , worldwide on the Wii 's downloadable Virtual Console service in 2010 , and on the Japanese PlayStation Network in 2011 . 
 Elements from the game were included in the Archie Comics Mega Man series , with Pharaoh Man , Dr. Cossack , and Kalinka being introduced in the fourth story arc , " Spiritus Ex Machina " rather than in an adaptation of the game . Bright Man was later introduced early as well , with the Cossacks and the Robot Masters making recurring appearances through the series prior to it going on hiatus . The final issues of the series led up into the events of the game , with Proto Man reluctantly aiding Dr. Wily in kidnapping Kalinka and Dr. Cossack launching his Robot Master attack and making his declaration of war . Issue 55 @-@ the last issue before the hiatus @-@ also featured Dr. Light experiencing a vision of future events , including the conflict between Mega Man and Cossack 's Robot Masters . 
 = Lithium = 
 Lithium ( from Greek : <unk> lithos , " stone " ) is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3 . It is a soft , silver @-@ white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements . Under standard conditions , it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element . Like all alkali metals , lithium is highly reactive and flammable . For this reason , it is typically stored in mineral oil . When cut open , it exhibits a metallic luster , but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray , then black tarnish . Because of its high reactivity , lithium never occurs freely in nature , and instead , appears only in compounds , which are usually ionic . Lithium occurs in a number of <unk> minerals , but due to its solubility as an ion , is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays . On a commercial scale , lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride . 
 The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability , since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides . Because of its relative nuclear instability , lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though the nuclei are very light in atomic weight . For related reasons , lithium has important links to nuclear physics . The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man @-@ made nuclear reaction , and lithium @-@ 6 deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons . 
 Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications , including heat @-@ resistant glass and ceramics , lithium grease lubricants , flux additives for iron , steel and aluminium production , lithium batteries , and lithium @-@ ion batteries . These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production . 
 Trace amounts of lithium are present in all organisms . The element serves no apparent vital biological function , since animals and plants survive in good health without it , though non @-@ vital functions have not been ruled out . The lithium ion Li + administered as any of several lithium salts has proved to be useful as a mood @-@ stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder in humans .

 = = = Atomic and physical = = = 
 Like the other alkali metals , lithium has a single valence electron that is easily given up to form a cation . Because of this , lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element , though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals . Lithium 's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus ( the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital , much lower in energy , and do not participate in chemical bonds ) . 
 Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife . When cut , it possesses a silvery @-@ white color that quickly changes to gray as it oxidizes to lithium oxide . While it has one of the lowest melting points among all metals ( 180 ° C ) , it has the highest melting and boiling points of the alkali metals . 
 Lithium has a very low density ( 0 @.@ 534 g / cm3 ) , comparable with pine wood . It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature ; the next lightest solid element ( potassium , at 0 @.@ 862 g / cm3 ) is more than 60 % denser . Furthermore , apart from helium and hydrogen , it is less dense than any liquid element , being only 2 / 3 as dense as liquid nitrogen ( 0 @.@ 808 g / cm3 ) . Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water , the other two being sodium and potassium . 
 Lithium 's coefficient of thermal expansion is twice that of aluminium and almost four times that of iron . Lithium is superconductive below 400 <unk> at standard pressure and at higher temperatures ( more than 9 K ) at very high pressures ( > 20 GPa ) . At temperatures below 70 K , lithium , like sodium , undergoes <unk> phase change transformations . At 4 @.@ 2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system ( with a nine @-@ layer repeat spacing ) ; at higher temperatures it transforms to face @-@ centered cubic and then body @-@ centered cubic . At liquid @-@ helium temperatures ( 4 K ) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent . Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures . 
 Lithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3 @.@ 58 kilojoules per kilogram @-@ kelvin , the highest of all solids . Because of this , lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications .

 Lithium reacts with water easily , but with noticeably less energy than other alkali metals . The reaction forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution . Because of its reactivity with water , lithium is usually stored in a hydrocarbon sealant , often petroleum jelly . Though the heavier alkali metals can be stored in more dense substances , such as mineral oil , lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids . In moist air , lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide ( LiOH and LiOH · H2O ) , lithium nitride ( Li3N ) and lithium carbonate ( Li2CO3 , the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2 ) . 
 When placed over a flame , lithium compounds give off a striking crimson color , but when it burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver . Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors . Lithium is flammable , and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water , though less so than the other alkali metals . The lithium @-@ water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own . As with all alkali metals , lithium fires are difficult to extinguish , requiring dry powder fire extinguishers ( Class D type ) . Lithium is the only metal which reacts with nitrogen under normal conditions . 
 Lithium has a diagonal relationship with magnesium , an element of similar atomic and ionic radius . Chemical resemblances between the two metals include the formation of a nitride by reaction with N2 , the formation of an oxide ( Li 
 2O ) and peroxide ( Li 
 2O 
 2 ) when burnt in O2 , salts with similar solubilities , and thermal instability of the carbonates and nitrides . The metal reacts with hydrogen gas at high temperatures to produce lithium hydride ( <unk> ) . 
 Other known binary compounds include halides ( LiF , LiCl , <unk> , <unk> ) , sulfide ( Li 
 2S ) , superoxide ( <unk> 
 2 ) , and carbide ( Li 
 2C 
 2 ) . Many other inorganic compounds are known in which lithium combines with anions to form salts : borates , amides , carbonate , nitrate , or borohydride ( <unk> 
 4 ) . Lithium aluminium hydride ( <unk> 
 4 ) is commonly used as a reducing agent in organic synthesis . 
 Multiple organolithium reagents are known in which there is a direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms , effectively creating a carbanion . These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles . In many of these organolithium compounds , the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high @-@ symmetry clusters by themselves , which is relatively common for alkali cations . <unk> , a very weakly interacting van der Waals compound , has been detected at very low temperatures . 
 = = = <unk> in Lithium @-@ 6 as a cryogenic gas = = = 
 Experimental evidence suggests that , in its gaseous form at temperatures of about 150 <unk> , lithium @-@ 6 exhibits ferromagnetism ; if fully confirmed , this is the first example of ferromagnetism observed in any gas under any conditions . Reservations on the reality of the demonstration are tenuous however , largely the desirability of direct observation that the spins of the atoms were parallel . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes , 6Li and 7Li , the latter being the more abundant ( 92 @.@ 5 % natural abundance ) . Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon ( compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table , helium and beryllium ) ; lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission . The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium @-@ 3 . As a result of this , though very light in atomic weight , lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements . Seven radioisotopes have been characterized , the most stable being <unk> with a half @-@ life of 838 ms and <unk> with a half @-@ life of 178 ms . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives that are shorter than 8 @.@ 6 ms . The shortest @-@ lived isotope of lithium is <unk> , which decays through proton emission and has a half @-@ life of 7 @.@ 6 × 10 − 23 s . 
 7Li is one of the primordial elements ( or , more properly , primordial nuclides ) produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis . A small amount of both 6Li and 7Li are produced in stars , but are thought to be " burned " as fast as produced . Additional small amounts of lithium of both 6Li and 7Li may be generated from solar wind , cosmic rays hitting heavier atoms , and from early solar system 7Be and 10Be radioactive decay . While lithium is created in stars during stellar nucleosynthesis , it is further burned . 7Li can also be generated in carbon stars . 
 Lithium isotopes <unk> substantially during a wide variety of natural processes , including mineral formation ( chemical precipitation ) , metabolism , and ion exchange . Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals , where 6Li is preferred to 7Li , resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of <unk> and rock alteration . The exotic <unk> is known to exhibit a nuclear halo . The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes , in particular 7Li from 6Li . 
 Nuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics applications are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation , with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent that it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources , such as rivers . This has led to unusual uncertainty in the standardized atomic weight of lithium , since this quantity depends on the natural abundance ratios of these naturally @-@ occurring stable lithium isotopes , as they are available in commercial lithium mineral sources . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 = = = Astronomical = = = 
 According to modern cosmological theory , lithium — in both stable isotopes ( lithium @-@ 6 and lithium @-@ 7 ) — was one of the 3 elements synthesized in the Big Bang . Though the amount of lithium generated in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is dependent upon the number of photons per baryon , for accepted values the lithium abundance can be calculated , and there is a " cosmological lithium discrepancy " in the Universe : older stars seem to have less lithium than they should , and some younger stars have much more . The lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the " mixing " of lithium into the interior of stars , where it is destroyed , while lithium is produced in younger stars . Though it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above 2 @.@ 4 million degrees Celsius ( most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors ) , lithium is more abundant than current computations would predict in later @-@ generation stars . 
 Though it was one of the three first elements to be synthesized in the Big Bang , lithium , together with beryllium and boron are markedly less abundant than other elements . This is a result of the low temperature necessary to destroy lithium , and a lack of common processes to produce it . 
 Lithium is also found in brown dwarf substellar objects and certain anomalous orange stars . Because lithium is present in cooler , less @-@ massive brown dwarfs , but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars , its presence in the stars ' spectra can be used in the " lithium test " to differentiate the two , as both are smaller than the Sun . Certain orange stars can also contain a high concentration of lithium . Those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium ( such as Centaurus X @-@ 4 ) orbit massive objects — neutron stars or black holes — whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen @-@ helium star , causing more lithium to be observed . 
 = = = Terrestrial = = = 
 Although lithium is widely distributed on Earth , it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity . The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes , where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0 @.@ 14 to 0 @.@ 25 parts per million ( ppm ) , or 25 micromolar ; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents . 
 Estimates for the Earth 's crustal content range from 20 to 70 ppm by weight . In keeping with its name , lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks , with the largest concentrations in granites . <unk> pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium @-@ containing minerals , with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources . Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite . A newer source for lithium is <unk> clay , the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States . At 20 mg lithium per kg of Earth 's crust , lithium is the 25th most abundant element . 
 According to the Handbook of Lithium and Natural Calcium , " Lithium is a comparatively rare element , although it is found in many rocks and some brines , but always in very low concentrations . There are a fairly large number of both lithium mineral and brine deposits but only comparatively few of them are of actual or potential commercial value . Many are very small , others are too low in grade . " 
 The US Geological Survey estimates that in 2010 , Chile had the largest reserves by far ( 7 @.@ 5 million tonnes ) and the highest annual production ( 8 @,@ 800 tonnes ) . One of the largest reserve bases of lithium is in the Salar de Uyuni area of Bolivia , which has 5 @.@ 4 million tonnes . Other major suppliers include Australia , Argentina and China . 
 In June 2010 , the New York Times reported that American geologists were conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan believing that large deposits of lithium are located there . " Pentagon officials said that their initial analysis at one location in Ghazni Province showed the potential for lithium deposits as large as those of Bolivia , which now has the world 's largest known lithium reserves . " These estimates are " based principally on old data , which was gathered mainly by the Soviets during their occupation of Afghanistan from 1979 – 1989 " . Stephen Peters , the head of the USGS 's Afghanistan Minerals Project , said that he was unaware of USGS involvement in any new surveying for minerals in Afghanistan in the past two years . ' We are not aware of any discoveries of lithium , ' he said . "

 Lithium is found in trace amount in numerous plants , plankton , and invertebrates , at concentrations of 69 to 5 @,@ 760 parts per billion ( ppb ) . In vertebrates the concentration is slightly lower , and nearly all vertebrate tissue and body fluids contain lithium ranging from 21 to 763 ppb . Marine organisms tend to bioaccumulate lithium more than terrestrial organisms . Whether lithium has a physiological role in any of these organisms is unknown . 
 = = History = = 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist and statesman José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva in a mine on the island of Utö , Sweden . However , it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson , then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius , detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore . This element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium , though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline . Berzelius gave the alkaline material the name " <unk> / <unk> " , from the Greek word <unk> ( transliterated as lithos , meaning " stone " ) , to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral , as opposed to potassium , which had been discovered in plant ashes , and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood . He named the metal inside the material " lithium " . 
 Arfwedson later showed that this same element was present in the minerals spodumene and lepidolite . In 1818 , Christian Gmelin was the first to observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame . However , both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts . It was not isolated until 1821 , when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide , a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium . Brande also described some pure salts of lithium , such as the chloride , and , estimating that lithia ( lithium oxide ) contained about 55 % metal , estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9 @.@ 8 g / mol ( modern value ~ 6 @.@ 94 g / mol ) . In 1855 , larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen . The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company <unk> AG , which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride . 
 The production and use of lithium underwent several drastic changes in history . The first major application of lithium was in high @-@ temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after . This use was supported by the fact that lithium @-@ based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps , and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps . The small market for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations mostly in the United States . 
 The demand for lithium increased dramatically during the Cold War with the production of nuclear fusion weapons . Both lithium @-@ 6 and lithium @-@ 7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons , and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself , as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride . The United States became the prime producer of lithium in the period between the late 1950s and the mid @-@ 1980s . At the end , the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42 @,@ 000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide . The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium @-@ 6 by 75 % , which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals , and even the atomic weight of lithium in some " natural sources " of lithium ion which had been " contaminated " by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities , which had found its way into ground water . 
 Lithium was used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall @-@ Héroult process . These two uses dominated the market until the middle of the 1990s . After the end of the nuclear arms race , the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices . But in the mid @-@ 1990s , several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive method than underground or even open @-@ pit mining . Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price . For example , the US mines near Kings Mountain , North Carolina closed before the turn of the 21st century . 
 The development of lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in 2007 . With the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the 2000s , new companies have expanded brine extraction efforts to meet the rising demand . 
 = = Production = = 
 Lithium production has greatly increased since the end of World War II . The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals . Lithium salts are extracted from water in mineral springs , brine pools and brine deposits . The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55 % lithium chloride and 45 % potassium chloride at about 450 ° C. In 1998 it was about 95 USD / kg ( or 43 USD / lb ) . 
 = = = Reserves = = = 
 Worldwide identified reserves in 2008 were estimated by the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) as 13 million tonnes , though it is difficult to accurately estimate the world 's lithium reserves . 
 Deposits are found in South America throughout the Andes mountain chain . Chile is the leading producer , followed by Argentina . Both countries recover lithium from brine pools . In the United States lithium is recovered from brine pools in Nevada . However , half the world 's known reserves are located in Bolivia , along the central eastern slope of the Andes . In 2009 , Bolivia negotiated with Japanese , French and Korean firms to begin extraction . According to USGS , Bolivia 's Uyuni Desert has 5 @.@ 4 million tonnes of lithium . A newly discovered deposit in Wyoming 's Rock Springs Uplift is estimated at 228 @,@ 000 tons . Additional deposits in the same formation were extrapolated to be as much as 18 million tons . 
 Opinions differ about potential growth . A 2008 study concluded that " realistically achievable lithium carbonate production will be sufficient for only a small fraction of future PHEV and EV global market requirements " , that " demand from the portable electronics sector will absorb much of the planned production increases in the next decade " , and that " mass production of lithium carbonate is not environmentally sound , it will cause irreparable ecological damage to ecosystems that should be protected and that <unk> propulsion is incompatible with the notion of the ' Green Car ' " . 
 However , according to a 2011 study conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California , Berkeley , the currently estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large @-@ scale battery production for electric vehicles because an estimated 1 billion 40 kWh Li @-@ based batteries could be built with current reserves - about 10 kg of lithium per car . Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found sufficient resources to support global demand until 2100 , including the lithium required for the potential widespread transportation use . The study estimated global reserves at 39 million tons , and total demand for lithium during the 90 @-@ year period analyzed at 12 – 20 million tons , depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates . 
 On June 9 , 2014 , the <unk> stated that demand for lithium was growing at more than 12 percent a year ; according to Credit Suisse , this rate exceeds projected availability by 25 percent . The publication compared the 2014 lithium situation with oil , whereby " higher oil prices spurred investment in expensive deepwater and oil sands production techniques " ; that is , the price of lithium will continue to rise until more expensive production methods that can boost total output receive the attention of investors . 
 = = = Pricing = = = 
 After the 2007 financial crisis , major suppliers such as Sociedad <unk> y Minera ( <unk> ) dropped lithium carbonate pricing by 20 % . Prices rose in 2012 . A 2012 Business Week article outlined the oligopoly in the lithium space : " <unk> , controlled by billionaire Julio Ponce , is the second @-@ largest , followed by Rockwood , which is backed by Henry Kravis ’ s KKR & Co . , and Philadelphia @-@ based <unk> " . Global consumption may jump to 300 @,@ 000 metric tons a year by 2020 from about 150 @,@ 000 tons in 2012 , to match demand for lithium batteries that has been growing at about 25 percent a year , outpacing the 4 percent to 5 percent overall gain in lithium .

 Lithium peroxide ( Li2O2 ) in presence of moisture not only reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate , but also releases oxygen . The reaction is as follows : 
 2 Li2O2 + 2 CO2 → 2 Li2CO3 + O2 .

Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes . 
 The high non @-@ linearity of lithium niobate also makes it useful in non @-@ linear optics applications .

 Lithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb .

In addition , 7Li , Be , and F are among the few nuclides with low enough thermal neutron capture cross @-@ sections not to poison the fission reactions inside a nuclear fission reactor . 
 In conceptualized ( hypothetical ) nuclear fusion power plants , lithium will be used to produce tritium in magnetically confined reactors using deuterium and tritium as the fuel . Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare , and must be synthetically produced by surrounding the reacting plasma with a ' blanket ' containing lithium where neutrons from the deuterium @-@ tritium reaction in the plasma will fission the lithium to produce more tritium : 
 6Li + n → 4He + 3T . 
 Lithium is also used as a source for alpha particles , or helium nuclei . When 7Li is bombarded by accelerated protons 8Be is formed , which undergoes fission to form two alpha particles . This feat , called " splitting the atom " at the time , was the first fully man @-@ made nuclear reaction . It was produced by Cockroft and Walton in 1932 . 
 In 2013 , the US Government Accountability Office said a shortage of lithium @-@ 7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “ places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk ” . The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure . The equipment needed to separate lithium @-@ 6 from lithium @-@ 7 is mostly a cold war leftover . The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963 , when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium , mostly consumed during the twentieth century . The report said it would take five years and $ 10 million to $ 12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium @-@ 6 from lithium @-@ 7 . 
 Reactors that use lithium @-@ 7 heat water under high pressure and transfer heat through heat exchangers that are prone to corrosion . The reactors use lithium to counteract the corrosive effects of boric acid , which is added to the water to absorb excess neutrons .

 Lithium is useful in the treatment of bipolar disorder . Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses , such as schizoaffective disorder and cyclic major depression . The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li + . They may increase the risk of developing <unk> 's cardiac anomaly in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy . 
 Lithium has also been researched as a possible treatment for cluster headaches . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Lithium is corrosive and requires special handling to avoid skin contact . Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds ( which are often alkaline ) initially irritate the nose and throat , while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs , leading to pulmonary edema . The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide . Lithium is safely stored in non @-@ reactive compounds such as naphtha . 
 = = = Regulation = = = 
 Some jurisdictions limit the sale of lithium batteries , which are the most readily available source of lithium for ordinary consumers . Lithium can be used to reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method , which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia . 
 Carriage and shipment of some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation ( particularly aircraft ) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short @-@ circuited , leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway . Most consumer lithium batteries have built @-@ in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident , or are otherwise designed to limit short @-@ circuit currents . Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway .

 Key is a Japanese visual novel studio which formed on July 21 , 1998 as a brand under the publisher VisualArt 's and is located in Kita , Osaka , Japan . Key released their debut visual novel Kanon in June 1999 , which combined an elaborate storyline , an up @-@ to @-@ date anime @-@ style drawing style , and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game . Key 's second game Air released in September 2000 had a similar if not more complex storyline to Kanon and a more thorough gameplay . Both Kanon and Air were originally produced as adult games , but Key broke this trend with their third title Clannad which was released in April 2004 for all ages . Key has worked in the past with Interchannel and Prototype for the consumer port releases of the brand 's games . Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Angel Beats ! ( 2010 ) and Charlotte ( 2015 ) . The brand 's ninth game Rewrite was released in June 2011 , and a fan disc for the game titled Rewrite Harvest festa ! was released in July 2012 . The first volume in the six @-@ part Angel Beats ! episodic visual novel was released in June 2015 . Key will release the kinetic novel Harmonia in 2016 . 
 Co @-@ founder Jun Maeda is a prominent figure in the brand , having contributed to the planning , scenario , and music composition in the majority of Key 's visual novels . Itaru Hinoue , also a co @-@ founder , is Key 's main artist and was the art director for Key 's first three games . Na @-@ Ga , another prominent artist in the brand , mainly worked with background art in earlier games , but with Key 's sixth game Little Busters ! was given the position of co @-@ art director with Hinoue . Shinji Orito , Key 's main composer and another co @-@ founder , has composed music for the majority of Key 's titles . Yūto Tonokawa , a scenario writer , first worked on the scenario in Little Busters ! . 
 Key has been an active participant at the Comiket convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999 , where they sold Kanon @-@ related products ; Key 's latest appearance at Comiket was at Comiket 89 in December 2015 . In 2001 , VisualArt 's created the record label Key Sounds Label to release music albums and singles with music related to Key 's visual novels . Between December 2007 and August 2010 , Key produced an Internet radio show called Key Net Radio in regards to the brand . 
 = = History = = 
 Before forming Key , the founding members worked for another visual novel development company called Nexton under the brand Tactics . At the time of Dōsei 's production , Tactics ' first game , four of Key 's original staff worked on the game : Itaru Hinoue as art director , Shinji Orito as musical composer , and Miracle Mikipon and Shinory contributing to the computer graphics . After Dōsei , the rest of Key 's founding staff — Naoki Hisaya , Jun Maeda and OdiakeS — joined Tactics and contributed to two more games : Moon released on November 21 , 1997 , and One : Kagayaku Kisetsu e released on May 29 , 1998 . Due to differing opinions between Nexton and most of the production staff in Tactics on how to produce the brand 's next game , most of Tactics ' staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game . 
 Itaru Hinoue , who had previously worked at VisualArt 's once before , introduced Key 's founding members to the president of VisualArt 's , Takahiro Baba . Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired , and they officially transferred to VisualArt 's where they formed Key on July 21 , 1998 . With the production of Key 's debut title Kanon still in its early stages , a brand name had still not been decided on by the developers . The tentative brand name was Azurite ( <unk> , <unk> ) at first , but Jun Maeda was not pleased with this and wanted a name that would capture the image of the brand . Maeda came upon the name Key when he saw it on a sign for a musical instrument store he would always pass on his way to work and instantly liked the name . The name Key for the studio was ultimately decided by majority rule . Key released Kanon on June 4 , 1999 as an adult game , though the scenes containing adult content were kept to a minimum . This gave the player more of a focus on the characters ' stories and on the visuals and music , especially for a visual novel at the time of its release . A year later , on September 8 , 2000 , Key released their second game Air , which was also an adult game and similar in storytelling to Kanon . 
 Key 's third game Clannad is a visual novel similar to Key 's previous games , but contains no adult content . Clannad was meant to be released in 2002 , but was delayed , leading to the game finally being released on April 28 , 2004 . Seven months after Clannad 's release , Key released their shortest game , Planetarian : The Reverie of a Little Planet , on November 29 , 2004 with a rating for all ages . Planetarian , in contrast to Key 's past games , is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make choices during gameplay ; this is what is referred to as a kinetic novel . The brand 's fifth game is Tomoyo After : It 's a Wonderful Life , an adult game and spin @-@ off to Clannad released on November 25 , 2005 , which expanded on the scenario of the heroine Tomoyo Sakagami from Clannad . Key released their sixth game , Little Busters ! , on July 27 , 2007 with no adult content , but released another version of the game entitled Little Busters ! Ecstasy on July 25 , 2008 with added adult content , story , and visuals . 
 In commemoration of Key 's ten @-@ year anniversary , Key and VisualArt 's held a two @-@ day event between February 28 and March 1 , 2009 called " Key 10th Memorial Fes : Ano Hi kara <unk> Bokura no Toki o Kizamu Uta " ( ～ <unk> ～ ) . Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Angel Beats ! that aired between April and June 2010 . Key 's eighth game Kud Wafter was released on June 25 , 2010 as an adult spin @-@ off of Little Busters ! , which expanded on the scenario of the heroine Kudryavka Noumi from Little Busters ! and Ecstasy . Key released their ninth game Rewrite on June 24 , 2011 with a rating for all ages , and an all ages fan disc to Rewrite titled Rewrite Harvest festa ! was released on July 27 , 2012 . In commemoration of Key 's 15 @-@ year anniversary , the first volume in the six @-@ part Angel Beats ! episodic visual novel , Angel Beats ! -1st beat- , was released on June 26 , 2015 . Key again collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Charlotte that aired between July and September 2015 . Key is aiming to release the kinetic novel Harmonia in 2016 , and it will be released on Steam in English before it is released in Japan . 
 = = = Key Sounds Label = = = 
 In 2001 , VisualArt 's created the record label Key Sounds Label ( KSL ) . The music albums and singles released by Key after this were put under this label , meaning that this does not include the first two albums and one single which were released before it was officially formed . The first album on this label was Humanity ... , though the only direct connection to Key 's works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening theme to Air . The albums under the label are mainly composed by Key 's signature composers : Jun Maeda , Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi . Three of the singles feature songs sung by Lia and one album , Love Song , features the singer Riya from Eufonius . Three drama CDs have been released as well . 
 To celebrate Key 's ten @-@ year anniversary , Key hosted a concert called KSL Live World 2008 : Way to the Little Busters ! EX on May 10 , 2008 in Tokyo , Japan , and again on May 17 , 2008 in Osaka , Japan . Each time , the concert lasted for two and a half hours and featured songs sung by Lia , Rita , Chata , and Tomoe Tamiyasu who have previously sung songs for singles and albums released under Key Sounds Label . Another concert called KSL Live World 2010 : Way to the Kud @-@ Wafter was held in Tokyo between May 21 – 22 , 2010 . A third content called KSL Live World 2013 : Way to the Little Busters ! Refrain was held in Koto , Tokyo on September 16 , 2013 . A fourth concert called KSL Live World : Way to the Angel Beats ! -1st- was held in Akihabara , Tokyo on April 11 and April 12 , 2015 . A fifth concert called KSL Live World 2016 : The Animation Charlotte & Rewrite was held in Toyosu , Tokyo on April 30 , 2016 . 
 = = = Key Net Radio = = = 
 Key produced 30 episodes of an Internet radio show called Key Net Radio ( <unk> , Key Raji ) in regards to the brand between December 13 , 2007 and August 30 , 2010 . It was hosted by Shinji Orito and Itaru Hinoue of Key , and another woman named Chiro who works for Pekoe , another visual novel studio under VisualArt 's . Listeners could submit thoughts about the show and any requests they may have for the show , along with submitting questions to the host trio . The broadcasts were available via download on Key 's official website and were available for download on the radio show 's official blog for the first nine broadcasts . The broadcasts could also be listened to on VisualArt 's ' YouTube channel named Visual Channel . 
 For the first six episodes , the show had five corners , or parts , which started with opening greetings from the hosts and went on to thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show . This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts , followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts . The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners , and the final corner had Orito playing the flute ; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play . Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast . The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves , or read from submissions by listeners , and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories . The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character , and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together . During the broadcasts , tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background . 
 = = = Comiket involvement = = = 
 Comiket , short for Comic Market , is a large comic convention held twice a year in Tokyo , Japan during August and December , which are referred to as the summer and winter Comic Markets , respectively . Key has been an active participant in the convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999 , where they sold Kanon @-@ related products ( as Kanon was their only release at the time ) ; one such product was a Zippo lighter . The first Air @-@ related products Key sold at the convention were at Comiket 59 in December 2000 . Typical products include : postcards , telephone cards , calendars , posters , and albums . The products Key sells at Comiket are all related to the visual novels the brand produces . 
 Key , through VisualArt 's , generally participates at the winter Comiket in conjunction with other brands under VisualArt 's , but has been known to appear at the summer Comiket too , such as with Comiket 70 in August 2006 where they sold Planetarian : The Reverie of a Little Planet related products . The combined total of the products Key sells at a given Comiket range in price between 3 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 yen . This includes the selling of music albums released under Key 's record label Key Sounds Label which has been releasing albums since Comiket 60 in August 2001 with the release of the label 's first two albums , Humanity ... and " Natsukage / Nostalgia " . If there are any unsold products by the end of a given Comiket , VisualArt 's has been known to set up an online mail order to sell the remaining goods from all the brands under VisualArt 's that participated at Comiket . After Comiket 73 in December 2007 , VisualArt 's started taking mail orders on March 4 , 2008 , and only six days later on March 10 , 2008 , Key reported that all of Key 's goods sold at Comiket 73 were now sold out . At the end of the second day of Comiket 75 in December 2008 , all of Key 's goods at the convention were sold out .

 = = = Main = = = 
 Key 's main staff members are attached to the visual novel studio , and therefore VisualArt 's . One of the founding members of Key , Jun Maeda , has worked on the planning for the individual projects and was one of the main scenario writers ; he has also composed music for the majority of Key 's games . Maeda stepped down as the main scenario writer after Little Busters ! Ecstasy , but continues to work on the music for Key 's games . Itaru Hinoue , another founding member , is Key 's main artist and was the sole art director and character designer for four of Key 's games . Na @-@ Ga , another prominent artist in the brand , mainly worked with background art in earlier games , but was first given the position of co @-@ art director with Hinoue with Little Busters ! . Further computer graphics have been provided in the past by Shinory and Mochisuke , two graphic artists in Key . Shinji Orito , another founding member and Key 's main composer , has composed music for the majority of Key 's games . With Maeda no longer contributing to the scenario , scenario writer Yūto Tonokawa joined Key and first worked on the scenario in Little Busters ! . 
 = = = Former and outsourced = = = 
 Many of Key 's staff have left the brand over time , or have been employed as outsourced contributors . Naoki Hisaya had worked as one of the main scenario writers for Kanon , but once the project was complete , he left the brand ; Hisaya later provided the original concept for Sola . Another member of the staff that made Kanon was OdiakeS , an outsourced composer who has since helped Key with two music albums , one each released for Air and Clannad , but has done nothing with Key since 2004 . Three staff members only worked with Key on Air : Takashi Ishikawa as one of the scenario writers , Kazuki Fujii as a scenario assistant , and Din as a background artist . Air and Clannad had Tōya Okano and Kai who contributed as scenario writers ; Kai later headed the planning and design of Kud Wafter . One of the original computer graphics artists , Miracle Mikipon , left after Clannad . Two other outsourced graphic artists , Minimo Tayama and Torino , have often contributed on Key 's games . 
 Scenario writer Yūichi Suzumoto worked with Key between Air and Planetarian . Eeji Komatsu worked as the art director for Planetarian , and another artist , Fumio , worked as the art director for Tomoyo After . Leo Kashida worked as an outsourced writer with Key on Tomoyo After and Little Busters ! . Chika Shirokiri , another outsourced writer who worked with Key on Little Busters ! , also wrote the scenario for Kud Wafter . Manack and members of PMMK composed music in Little Busters ! , and members of MintJam helped with arrangement . Magome Togoshi had been with Key since before Kanon 's release , working as one of the signature composers , but left the brand in October 2006 after contributing to the soundtrack of Little Busters ! . Jun 'ichi Shimizu composed all the music in Kud Wafter . Two outsourced writers worked on the scenario for Rewrite : Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion , and Romeo Tanaka . Rewrite also featured three outsourced musical composers : Maiko Iuchi of I 've Sound , Sōshi Hosoi , and Ryō Mizutsuki . 
 = = Impact = = 
 According to Satoshi <unk> 's work , A History of Adult Games , Key 's impact on the visual novel ( primarily the adult game variant ) world stems from before Key was formed and most of the founding members of Key worked for Tactics under Nexton . Due to an influence by Leaf 's visual novel To Heart released in 1997 , the developers at Tactics created a simple formula for a game : a comedic first half with a heart @-@ warming romantic middle followed by a tragic separation and finally an emotional reunion formed what is known as a " crying game " or " nakige " . The main purpose of such a game is to make the player feel for the characters and make them cry due to emotional scenarios which serves to leave a bigger impact on the player after the game is over . Tactics ' second title One : Kagayaku Kisetsu e was created based on this formula . 
 After One was complete , the development team quit Tactics to form Key where they developed their first title Kanon also based upon this formula . Kanon was " heavily hyped [ and ] had gamers impatient until its release . It was only one game released by Key so far , and yet [ it ] had already sent major shockwaves around the industry . And yet another game [ Air ] , two years later , sent even more shockwaves . Air was equally hyped and well received . " The success of One and Kanon on Key 's formula to create a " crying game " was later adopted by other visual novel developing companies which were influenced by this formula . Examples of this include : Kana : Little Sister by Digital Object , the Memories Off series by KID , D.C. : Da Capo by Circus , Snow by Studio Mebius ( also under VisualArt 's ) , and Wind : A Breath of Heart by Minori . 
 Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion wrote in 2004 how he was influenced by Key 's works during the planning of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni . Ryukishi07 played Key 's games as a reference , among other visual novels , and analyzed them to figure out the reason why they were found to be so popular . He figured that the secret was due to how the stories would start with ordinary , enjoyable days , but then a sudden occurrence would happen leading the player to cry due to the shock value . He used a similar model for the basis of Higurashi but instead of leading the player to cry , Ryukishi07 wanted to scare the player with the addition of horror elements . In this way , Ryukishi07 wished to be in some way associated with Key who he described as a " masterpiece maker " . 
 Key is one of 17 brands under VisualArt 's with games included in the Lycèe Trading Card Game published by Broccoli . Characters from Key 's first five games through Tomoyo After were included in the first three out of four VisualArt 's card sets , and characters from Little Busters ! through Rewrite were featured in the fifth through seventh VisualArt 's card sets . There are also numerous rare promotional cards with characters from Key titles . Other big @-@ name visual novel companies included in the card game include : <unk> , August , Leaf , Navel , and Type @-@ Moon . 
 = = = Leaf , Key BBS = = = 
 A bulletin board system ( BBS ) based on the interface of the large Japanese Internet forum 2channel ( 2ch ) was formed on January 26 , 2000 named " Leaf , Key BBS " ( leaf , <unk> , leaf , key <unk> ) , otherwise nicknamed as " Leaf @-@ Key Board " ( <unk> , Ha @-@ Kagi Ita ) . The board originated from 2ch 's video game discussion board due to a dispute involving the game Kizuato in December 1999 ; Kizuato was an early game of another visual novel producing brand named Leaf . Ultimately , fans of the game moved to 2ch 's adult game board , but there was not much resolution , and at the time Key fans on the board were being shunned for discussions on Kanon and , at the time , Key 's upcoming game Air . This resulted finally with the Leaf and Key fans moving away from 2ch and forming again on the <unk> Internet forum . The board serves as a discussion board for anything related to Leaf and Key . This includes the games the companies produce , but also the companies themselves and the staff that make up those companies . The BBS gets approximately 900 posts per day as of March 2010 . Like 2ch , the board has a default anonymous posting setting , and the default name is " <unk> @-@ san <unk> " ( <unk> , lit . " Mr. Nameless @-@ <unk> " ) , a reference to the heroine Mizuka Nagamori from One : Kagayaku Kisetsu e who uses the words " dayo " and " mon " frequently . 
 = Darejan Dadiani = 
 Darejan Dadiani ( Georgian : <unk> ) , also known as Daria ( <unk> ; Russian : <unk> <unk> , Darya <unk> ) ( 20 July 1738 – 8 November 1807 ) , was Queen Consort of Kakheti , and later Kartli @-@ Kakheti in Eastern Georgia , as the third wife of King <unk> II ( also known as Heraclius II ) . She was a daughter of <unk> @-@ Giorgi Dadiani , a member of the princely house of Mingrelia . <unk> married Heraclius in 1750 and their marriage lasted 48 years until his death in 1798 ; the union produced 23 children . In the final years of her husband 's reign , Darejan exerted significant influence on politics and court affairs . She was skeptical of the pro @-@ Russian policies of Heraclius II and his successor , her step @-@ son , George XII , whose progeny she tried to prevent from succeeding to the throne of Georgia . After the Russian annexation of Georgia , Queen Dowager Darejan was deported to Russia proper in 1803 . She died in St. Petersburg at the age of 69 and was buried at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra . 
 = = Early life and marriage = = 
 Darejan was a daughter of <unk> @-@ Giorgi Dadiani , a younger son of <unk> Dadiani , Prince of Mingrelia in western Georgia . She was only 12 years old in 1750 , when Heraclius , then reigning in Kakheti , chose her as his third wife , a year after his second wife , Ana <unk> , died . The marriage was negotiated on Heraclius 's behalf by his relative , Princess Khoreshan , daughter of the late King of Kartli Jesse and wife of Prince Jesse <unk> . The bride was brought by Khoreshan and Saba , Bishop of <unk> , to <unk> , where Heraclius met her . The wedding was then lavishly celebrated at the court of Heraclius 's father , Teimuraz II , King of Kartli , in Tbilisi . In 1762 , Heraclius of Kakheti succeeded on his father 's death as king of Kartli , thus uniting both eastern Georgian kingdoms into a single state . 
 = = Issue of succession = = 
 The couple 's first better documented child , Princess <unk> , was born in 1753 , followed by 22 more between 1755 and 1782 . As her sons grew up , Darejan 's desire to secure the right of succession for her offspring against Heraclius 's eldest surviving son of his second marriage to Anna <unk> , the Crown Prince George , became the cornerstone of Darejan 's involvement in the politics of Georgia . In the last years of Heraclius II 's life , she became more involved and influential . In 1791 , Darejan persuaded her husband to overturn the principle of primogeniture in favor of fraternal inheritance , mandating in his will that after his death , his eldest son George would become king , but that after George 's death , the throne would pass to the next surviving son of Heraclius , rather than to George 's offspring . The surviving sons of Heraclius and Darejan — Iulon , Vakhtang , Mirian , Alexander , and Parnaoz — thus , emerged in the line of succession . After Heraclius 's death in 1798 , the now King George XII , reneged on the will of the late king , declaring it invalid on account of it being forced upon his father . This occasioned a further breakdown in already strained relations between George XII and Darejan and his half @-@ brothers . 
 = = Relations with Russia = = 
 Another conflicting issue between Darejan and her reigning step @-@ son was Georgia 's relations with the Russian Empire . Darejan had been skeptical of Georgia 's rapprochement with its northern neighbour already in Heraclius 's lifetime , especially after the Russians , bound by the 1783 treaty of Georgievsk to protect Heraclius 's kingdom from external threat , had left the Georgians to their own devices in the face of a disastrous invasion from Iran in 1795 . The queen had repeatedly maintained that the relationship with Russia had brought no benefit to Georgia . 
 Darejan and her party were resolutely opposed to George XII 's renewed quest for the Russian protection . In 1800 , one of Darejan 's sons , Alexander , openly broke with his half @-@ brother and attempted a coup with the help of his Avar and Iranian allies . The relations in the royal family hit the nadir in July 1800 , when George XII forced Queen Dowager Darejan into confinement at her palace in <unk> , prompting Darejan 's sons to mobilize their loyal forces around Tbilisi . 
 = = Downfall and exile = = 
 After the death of George XII in December 1800 , the Russian general Ivan Lazarev issued the Tsar Paul I 's order to all the members of the royal family , beginning with Darejan , forbidding the nomination of any heir to the throne . After Paul 's death in March 1801 , Darejan applied to the new tsar , Alexander I , to confirm her eldest son , Iulon , as the new king and protect her and her kin from harassment from George XII 's heir Prince David and his supporters . However , the Russian government proceeded with the outright annexation of the Georgian kingdom , bringing the millennium of the Bagratid rule in Georgia to an end . 
 The Queen Dowager and her sons withdrew into opposition to the new regime ; Iulon , Alexander , and Parnaoz were now in open rebellion . Darejan 's every trip outside Tbilisi was closely watched by the Russian military . Eventually , Tsar Alexander ordered the commander in Georgia , General Karl Knorring , to deport all members of the royal family from Georgia for resettlement in Russia proper on 20 August 1802 . The State Council confirmed the decision and instructed Knorring to " strengthen all measures for the transport of Queen Darejan and other members of the royal family to Russia , because their presence in Georgia will always be a cause and reason [ for the development of ] parties hostile " to the Russian hegemony . Darejan 's relations with Knorring were particularly tense . Once , the general angered her by wearing his hat and coat at her house and interrupting an interview at noon , declaring it was time for his vodka . 
 The task of deportation was to be fulfilled by Knorring 's successor , General Pavel Tsitsianov , himself of Georgian origin . In vain Darejan cited her illness to avoid exile . Tsitsianov responded that no reason would postpone her departure . She was further accused of " treasonous " correspondence with Russia 's enemies and removing the venerated icon of <unk> from a church in Tbilisi . The Russian military had Darejan escorted on 25 October 1803 out of the estate of her grandson in <unk> to her exile in Russia . 
 Darejan , known to the Russians as the tsaritsa Darya <unk> , was allowed to settle down in St. Petersburg , where she lived in a rented house in the parish of the Church of St. Simon and Anna . Later , the ailing queen was permitted to have a house church , which was consecrated on 22 July 1804 and closed following the death of Darejan on 8 November 1807 . Darejan , Queen Dowager of Georgia and Lady of the Russian Order of St. Catherine , Grand Cross , was buried at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra .

 This widely distributed <unk> snail species occurs from Europe to Central Asia . It has a thick shell with a calcified operculum . The coloration pattern on the shell is very variable . Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in brackish water , in rivers and lakes on stones . It feeds mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms . 
 Some of the populations of this species are spreading , and these can reach densities up to thousands of snails per square meter . Females lay egg capsules , each of which contains a large number of eggs , but only one snail hatches from the capsule . The snails reach sexual maturity in a year , and the total lifespan is 2 or 3 years .

 Theodoxus fluviatilis was originally described under the name Nerita fluviatilis by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 . Linnaeus ' original text ( the type description ) in Latin was very short , and reads as follows : 
 Which means in English : " Nerita fluviatilis , number 632 : the shell is wrinkled , there are no teeth in the aperture . It inhabits rivers in Europe . " Later , this species was moved to the genus Theodoxus Montfort , 1810 . Theodoxus fluviatilis is in fact the type species of the genus Theodoxus . Anistratenko and colleagues designated the lectotype for Theodoxus fluviatilis in 1999 ( an English translation was published by Anistratenko in 2005 ) . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Several subspecies of Theodoxus fluviatilis were described and ( inconsistently ) recognized by various authors : 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis fluviatilis ( Linnaeus , 1789 ) – was described from a freshwater environment 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis fluviatilis f. <unk> <unk> , 1815 – is sometimes considered as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis ( Linnaeus , 1789 ) – was described from brackish water by Linnaeus as a separate species , originally named Nerita littoralis . A study by Zettler ( 2008 ) proved that its status as a subspecies is unjustified , being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis . Although these so @-@ called forms ( form fluviatilis and form littoralis ) differ in morphology , ecology , reproductive strategy and behaviour , they are probably just ecomorphs .

 = = = Cladogram = = = 
 A cladogram shows the phylogenic relationships within the genus Theodoxus : 
 This cladogram shows that the sister group to clade B is clade C. They split in 5 – 11 @.@ 5 Ma , when Lake <unk> existed . Theodoxus species living in brackish water include Theodoxus fluviatilis and Theodoxus jordani , but they are apparently not closely related . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The exact type locality for this species is unknown , but it is probably the Main river in Southern Germany . Glöer ( 2002 ) considered the type locality sensu Linnaeus as " Habitat in <unk> , <unk> ad <unk> <unk> & alibi " , but this would suggest a brackish water environment . The distribution of this species was considered to be European , but in reality the species occurs in the western to central Palaearctic . Its occurrence is scattered throughout Europe and in Western Asia except for the Alps and the regions immediately north of the Alps . This species does not live in Norway or Siberia . Theodoxus fluviatilis has the most widespread distribution of all of the species in the genus Theodoxus . It is in fact one of the most widely distributed species in the entire family Neritidae . 
 This species is threatened mainly by river engineering and water pollution in densely populated regions . The species ' population trend is overall stable , but is declining in some areas ( Germany ) , while in other areas it is expanding ( for example in the Danube river ) . In the Rhine river during the 1970s , Theodoxus fluviatilis came close to local extinction because of water pollution . Subsequently , the water quality improved for more than two decades , leading to a recovery . Even so , the species became extinct in the Rhine for an unknown reason in the late 1990s . Since 2006 , Theodoxus fluviatilis recolonized the Rhine , probably via ship transport through the Main @-@ Danube Canal . An analysis based on cytochrome @-@ c oxidase I ( COI ) gene has shown that the recolonization probably originated in the Danube . 
 = = = Europe = = = 
 The species occurs widely in Western Europe , and it is also widespread in the north of Ireland , living in 10 % of Irish streams and rivers . It lives in Great Britain , including the isle of Orkney , as well as in the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg , Liechtenstein , and Monaco . It also is found in France and Switzerland , where it is considered to be critically endangered . More to the south , it occurs in Spain and Portugal , although the species is restricted to karst springs in Central Portugal . 
 In central Europe , this species lives as <unk> in the Austrian Danube , where it was first recorded in Tulln , Lower Austria in 2001 . In the Czech Republic , it is now extinct in Bohemia ; the only findings were in the Elbe river near <unk> in 1917 , and the most recent findings of empty shells took place in 1943 . Theodoxus fluviatilis also occurs in Poland , in Slovakia where it is non @-@ indigenous since 2002 , and in Hungary . Zettler ( 2008 ) provided a detailed bibliography of the distribution of T. fluviatilis in Germany . The indigenous distribution of T. fluviatilis included all of the large rivers : Rhine , Main , Moselle , Neckar , Weser , Elbe and Oder . However , this species is now highly endangered in Germany ( Stark <unk> ) . 
 In Northern Europe , this species is found in Denmark , in Sweden as far north as 58 ° N. It can also be found on the coasts of Finland , in the Åland Islands , and is known to be found alive there since 1994 . No other Theodoxus species reaches the Baltic Sea . It has the northernmost distribution of the genus Theodoxus and it is also the northernmost species of all Neritidae . In Eastern Europe this snail occurs in Estonia , Lithuania , and Latvia , as well as Belarus , and in Russia from western Russia to Caucasus . Since 1997 it has been found in the Gulf of Odessa , Ukraine . In Ukraine and in Crimea it is non @-@ indigenous , and was first recorded in the area in 1955 . It also occurs in Moldova . In Southern Europe , Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Romania , Bulgaria , Slovenia , and Croatia . In Macedonia and Albania it occurs in Lake Ohrid ( which spans the border of the two countries ) as the subspecies Theodoxus fluviatilis dalmaticus . It is found on the mainland of Greece and also on Crete . It is known to occur in the mainland of Italy and also in Sardinia . It occurs in Montenegro , and in Serbia . 
 = = = Asia and Africa = = = 
 In Asia , Theodoxus fluviatilis is found in Turkey . It can also be found in Iran , in the provinces of Kerman , Gilan , Mazandaran , Fars , <unk> , Lorestan and Khorasan . However , until 2012 , all the records from Iran were listed as Theodoxus <unk> . In Africa this species occurs in Algeria , and possibly ( or probably ) in Morocco , where there are records which some authors consider to be reliable . However , instead of one species , Theodoxus fluviatilis , Brown ( 1994 ) recognized three species in northwestern Africa : Theodoxus <unk> , Theodoxus <unk> , Theodoxus meridionalis . 
 = = = Prehistoric biogeography = = = 
 Shells of Theodoxus fluviatilis have been found in an Upper Paleolithic archaeological site in the cave <unk> , Pedreira ( Tomar ) , Tomar Municipality , Portugal , and also in a site from about 6000 years B.P. of <unk> age on the Åland Islands . Shells from the Late Neolithic have been found in <unk> Šárka , Czech Republic . Bunje ( 2005 ) hypothetized that the ancestral range of Theodoxus fluviatilis was the Ponto @-@ Pannonian region ( southern Ukraine , Romania and Hungary ) . Bunje suggested that the species first colonized northern Italy , Greece and Turkey ; in the second phase it colonized Spain , France and Germany ; and finally in the Holocene it colonized the British Isles , Sweden and the Baltic Sea . In 2002 , German malacologist Peter Glöer summarized the distribution of this species during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs . 
 = = Description = = 
 The shell of Theodoxus fluviatilis is somewhat depressed ( with an usually low spire ) , strongly calcified , and has 3 – 3 @.@ 5 whorls ( including the protoconch ) . Larger specimens are usually eroded . The width of an adult shell is usually 5 – 9 mm , but can reach up to 11 – 13 mm . The height of the shell is 4 – 6 @.@ 5 mm , or up to 7 mm . These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment : the maximum width of the shell of brackish water populations is 9 @.@ 3 mm . Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter , reaching up to 5 @.@ 8 mm , and the maximum weight of the shell is 124 mg . In freshwater populations , the maximum recorded shell width is 13 @.@ 1 mm , and maximum height is 9 @.@ 3 mm . The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343 mg . 
 The exterior of the shell is basically whitish or yellowish , with a net @-@ like dark reddish or violet pattern . This pattern is very variable ( depending on environmental factors ) , sometimes partly presenting bands , and even occasionally being evenly dark . The shell is very variable in color and color patterns , showing great polymorphism . Shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of the genus Theodoxus and these qualities may be influenced by factors like ionic composition of water , type of substratum and nutrition of individuals in various habitats . Zettler and colleagues ( 2004 ) showed that in the outer coastal waters of the Baltic Sea , the nearly black and often corroded shell form of Theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant , whereas in the inner ( sheltered ) parts of coastal waters , yellowish @-@ green forms prevail . Glöer and <unk> ( 2015 ) observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown . Shells of specimens of Theodoxus fluviatilis from Northern Europe are ornamented with a pattern of white , drop @-@ like spots on a dark or red background . Specimens from South France and Spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes , while specimens from the Balkans show all possible combinations of white drop @-@ like spots and zigzag stripes . Animals from lacustrine habitats show dark or light bands on the shell . 
 Images showing variability in the color patterns of shells of Theodoxus fluviatilis : 
 The shell shape of Theodoxus fluviatilis is similar to that of Theodoxus transversalis . The shell shape of Theodoxus <unk> is more spherical . The shape of the aperture of Theodoxus <unk> is usually descending . However , all of these species display a large morphological plasticity , which makes them difficult to differentiate . The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent <unk> literature . Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens , <unk> characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis . The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D @-@ shaped , light reddish with a red margin , bearing a broad rib ( also called a ridge ) on its inner surface . The <unk> muscle is attached to the rib . The rib is long and thin , attenuated at the base , while the callus is thin ; a peg is lacking . The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles . There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum , which is straight in females , but curved in males . 
 <unk> in the shape of operculum have been observed . In a specimen from <unk> in France , and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro , a double rib was present , but the rib shield was reduced ; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake , only the rib shield was reduced . Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit , which is formed by the rib and the rib shield . The rib shield , and consequently a rib pit , are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis , Theodoxus <unk> and Theodoxus <unk> . These three species differs in having , in addition to a rib , a peg , which is absent in T. fluviatilis . The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head . The tentacles are greyish and long . The eyes are large and black ; the foot is whitish . 
 = = = Radula = = = 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis , like all other species in the family Neritidae , has a radula which is of the rhipidoglossan type ( a radula with many small marginal teeth which help " brush " food particles into the gullet ) . Zettler and colleagues ( 2004 ) and Zettler ( 2008 ) made SEM micrographs of the radula of this species . 
 = = = Reproductive system = = = 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis has separate sexes ( i.e. these snails are dioecious ) . The diploid number of chromosomes ( 2n ) is 25 in males and 26 in females . There is X0 sex @-@ determination system in Neritidae , and it was confirmed for this species too . 
 Females have two openings located under the edge of the mantle in the mantle cavity : the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs . The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation . The vagina is connected to the bursa <unk> and to the spermatheca ( for storing sperm ) . The other opening is for laying eggs . Egg cells originate in the ovary . Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber , where fertilization occur . Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus . A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus . The eggs are then laid . 
 In males , the semen is forming in the testis . The sperm structure of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius . Then semen travels through the prostate , where it mixes with prostatic fluid . Finally it goes through the vas deferens to the penis . The penis is located on the inner side of the right tentacle . The following illustrations show the reproductive system in the female and in the male : 
 = = = Various organ systems = = = 
 Circulatory system : The osmotic pressure of the hemolymph of Theodoxus fluviatilis is 95 <unk> . That is much lower value than in marine snails in the subfamily <unk> . The osmotic pressure and the <unk> of <unk> of the hemolymph of the subfamily <unk> ( where does the Theodoxus belong to ) is similar to the hemolymph of the land snail family <unk> .

 = = = Habitat = = = 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis prefers lowland habitats ( in Switzerland it occurs up to 275 m a.s.l. ) and calcium @-@ rich waters . This small snail inhabits the central and lower parts of rivers ( up to 13 m deep ) , including in brackish water in tidal rivers of estuaries . It sometimes lives in lakes on unvegetated bottoms . Rarely , it lives in springs ( <unk> ) , in ground water , and in caves . For example , in the Åland Islands , Theodoxus fluviatilis was found living in lakes with a pH of 7 @.@ 8 – 8 @.@ 9 . In streams and rivers in Ireland , the species lived in water with a pH of 7 @.@ 0 – 8 @.@ 4 . 
 The species easily attaches itself to stones , which allows it to live in fast @-@ running waters and in wave zone in lakes . The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species . This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters . Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15 % in the Baltic Sea or up to 18 % in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea . Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater . Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of <unk> @-@ positive substances in the foot . 
 This species lives on hard benthic substrates , typically rocks . It lives on pebbles , sometimes on boulders , and rarely on dead wood . It tolerates mild organic pollution , low oxygen content ( down to below 2 mg / liter ) but it does not tolerate long periods of droughts , or ice . It lives in mesotrophic waters , and sometimes in oligotrophic waters . 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis serves an indicator species for river monitoring ( in Germany ) ; however the spreading populations also have a high tolerance for degraded habitats . Theodoxus fluviatilis has a large phenotypic plasticity : it was found living on stones and on dead wood in freshwater environments ; whereas it lives on stones and on Fucus vesiculosus , Potamogeton spp. and Zostera marina in brackish water in the Baltic Sea . The species can also be found on aggregates of Mytilus . 
 This species , together with the isopod <unk> <unk> , have been found to be a dominant part of the fauna biomass in the central and northern Baltic Sea . Brackish water populations can reach densities up to 200 – 1000 snails per m ² . Theodoxus fluviatilis dalmaticus in Lake Ohrid can reach population densities up to <unk> snails per m ² . The species was found in population densities of up to 9000 snails per m ² in a spring of the <unk> river in Central Portugal , where there is a stable temperature of 15 @.@ 3 – 16 @.@ 6 ° C , which allows continuous reproduction in Theodoxus fluviatilis . At <unk> port , in September 2003 , a density of 34 @,@ 932 juvenile snails per m ² was recorded . 
 = = = Feeding habits = = = 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis feeds mainly on diatoms living on stones , scraping biofilms and also consuming detritus . It can also consume Cyanobacteria and green algae as a poor @-@ quality food supply . Cyanobacteria contain toxins and indigestible mucopolysaccharides , and green algae have cellulose in their cell walls ( Theodoxus species have no cellulase enzymes to digest cellulose ) . They also graze on zygotes and <unk> of brown alga Fucus vesiculosus , when the alga is small up to 1 mm . Peters and <unk> ( 2012 ) studied the effect of the grazing of Theodoxus fluviatilis on <unk> <unk> and algae . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 Theodoxus fluviatilis is gonochoristic , which means that each individual animal is distinctly male or female , and cross @-@ fertilization can occur . The sex ratio is 1 : 1 . The structure of the flagellum of the spermatozoon is unique : the flagellum is divided into two parts . 
 T. fluviatilis eggs are usually laid in from mid @-@ April to October , in temperatures above 10 ° C. Eggs are laid in egg capsules deposited on stones and sometimes on shells of conspecific individuals . Females usually lay a cluster containing 4 – 5 capsules . A single female will usually lay about 40 capsules during summer , and about 20 capsules during autumn . Fresh capsules are white , but older capsules become yellow or brown and may bear an epiphytic outer layer . The capsules are around 1 mm in diameter ( 0 @.@ 9 – 1 @.@ 1 mm ) , but in brackish water they are usually smaller ( about 0 @.@ 8 mm ) . Empty ( sterile ) small capsules ( 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 8 mm in diameter ) can also be laid . The number of eggs per egg capsule changes depending on the environment . There are 100 – 200 eggs in each capsule in freshwater , as opposed to 55 – 80 eggs in each capsule in brackish water . Usually , only one egg develops , with the remaining eggs serving as nutrition for the embryo , which results in a single juvenile snail hatching from each capsule . 
 Juveniles with a shell length of 0 @.@ 5 – 1 mm hatch after 30 days ( in 25 ° C ) , or after 65 days ( in 20 ° C ) . The ash @-@ free dry weight of newly hatched snails is 0 @.@ 012 mg . The protoconch has one whorl . Capsules laid in spring hatch after 2 – 3 months , in August – September . Capsules from late summer overwinter because embryonic development ceases in temperatures below 10 ° C , thus these capsules hatch in spring after 7 – 8 months . The shell grows mainly from May to August ; there is no shell growth in winter . The snails reach sexual maturity in less than 1 year , when the shell length is 5 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 7 mm . 
 The life span of T. fluviatilis is 2 – 3 years . The age of a few snails was estimated to be 3 @.@ 5 years . The mortality rate is low in summer . However , it is higher in winter because ice and storms can dislocate the substrate , which can result in mechanical damage to the snails .

 Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis include several species of trematodes . The snail serves as first intermediate host to <unk> <unk> and as second intermediate host to <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> is also found in this small snail , as is <unk> <unk> . This small snail is also parasitized by several species of ciliates . It is the main host for the ciliate <unk> <unk> ; the snails are usually 100 % infected in the mantle cavity Another ciliate found in the mantle cavity is a species of <unk> . Two other parasitic ciliate species found in this snail are <unk> <unk> , and <unk> quatuor . Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach ( a freshwater fish ) , <unk> rutilus . Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds .

 One Night Stand ( 2007 ) was the third annual One Night Stand professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and presented by <unk> . It took place on June 3 , 2007 , at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville , Florida and featured talent from the Raw , SmackDown ! , and ECW brands . The event was the final to announce each individual brand as co @-@ promoters of the event during the introductory graphics . 
 The main match on the Raw brand was John Cena versus The Great Khali in a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match for the WWE Championship . Cena won the match and retained the WWE Championship after pinning Khali following an FU off a crane onto the arena floor . The featured match on the SmackDown ! brand was Edge versus Batista in a Steel Cage match for the World Heavyweight Championship , which Edge won after escaping the cage . 
 The primary match on the ECW brand was Vince McMahon versus Bobby Lashley in a Street Fight for the ECW Championship , which Lashley won by pinfall after performing a spear . The featured matches on the undercard included Rob Van Dam versus Randy Orton in a Stretcher match and a Ladder match for the World Tag Team Championship between The Hardys ( Matt and Jeff ) and The World 's Greatest Tag Team ( Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas ) .

 The main feud heading into One Night Stand on the Raw brand was between John Cena and The Great Khali , with the two battling over the WWE Championship . This was a rematch of their encounter at Judgment Day , the pay @-@ per @-@ view two weeks before One Night Stand . At the event , Cena defeated Khali by forcing him to submit to the STFU . When Khali submitted to the STFU , however , his feet were underneath the bottom rope , meaning Cena should have broken the submission hold . Referee Mike Chioda was focusing on Khali 's arm and did not see Khali 's feet underneath the bottom rope . The following night on Raw , believing he should not have lost the match , Khali challenged Cena to a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match . Following Cena 's acceptance , Khali performed a Chokebomb on Cena . Heading into One Night Stand , Khali used the Chokebomb again to win a non @-@ title match against Cena on the June 2 edition of Saturday Night 's Main Event . 
 The predominant feud on the SmackDown ! brand heading into the pay @-@ per @-@ view was between Edge and Batista , with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship . The two fought each other at Judgment Day for the title , and Edge won the bout with a school boy pin . On the May 25 episode of SmackDown ! , General Manager Theodore Long announced that Edge would defend the World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage match at One Night Stand . Batista won a Fatal Four @-@ Way match against Finlay , Kane , and Mark Henry to earn the spot of the challenger at the pay @-@ per @-@ view . Batista was a guest on Edge 's talk show The Cutting Edge on the June 1 episode of SmackDown ! . Towards the end of the segment , Batista punched Edge and sent him to the floor . The following night , on Saturday Night 's Main Event , Batista and Chris Benoit defeated Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter ( MVP ) in a tag team match . During the match , Edge walked out , leaving MVP on his own against Batista and Benoit . Benoit gained the pinfall after performing a flying headbutt on MVP . 
 The other primary feud featured on the One Night Stand card consisted of both Raw and ECW superstars . ECW 's Bobby Lashley battled Raw 's Vince McMahon for the ECW World Championship . Lashley faced Team McMahon ( ECW World Champion Vince McMahon , Shane , and Umaga ) in a 3 @-@ on @-@ 1 tag team Handicap match at Judgment Day , with the ECW World Championship on the line . Lashley won the match , pinning Shane after a Dominator powerslam . After the match , however , Vince declared that Lashley had not won the title and that he was still the ECW World Champion , as he had not been pinned . In the match , Lashley could have won the title , but not a member of Team McMahon . The following night , on the May 21 edition of Raw , Lashley was put into a Gauntlet match by Vince McMahon , with the stipulation that if he won all four of the matches in the gauntlet , he would face Vince at One Night Stand . Lashley won all four matches , defeating Chris Masters , Viscera , Umaga and Shane McMahon in succession . As a result , Lashley gained a title shot at One Night Stand in a Street Fight . On the May 28 edition of Raw , Lashley teamed with WWE Champion John Cena to take on Umaga , Shane McMahon and The Great Khali in a Handicap match . Shane won the match , pinning Lashley after an elbow drop . Vince was scheduled to face Lashley in an arm wrestling contest on the June 2 edition of Saturday Night 's Main Event . Moments before the contest began , however , Vince booked Mark Henry as Lashley 's opponent instead . During the contest , Vince attacked Lashley , hitting him with a steel chair .

 The first match that aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam , in which the object is to place your opponent on a stretcher and wheel the stretcher across a finish line . The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton , but Orton moved out of the way . Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the finishing line . Van Dam , however , managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher . Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win . After the match , Orton attacked Van Dam , executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor . Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher . 
 Next was a Tables match , as CM Punk and The ECW Originals ( Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman ) faced The New Breed ( Elijah Burke , Matt Striker and Marcus Cor Von ) . In order to win the match , one team must put a member of the other team through a table . Towards the end of the contest , Cor Von attempted to put Punk through the table with an Alpha Bomb , but Sandman hit Cor Von with a Singapore cane . With Burke on the table , Punk performed a suplex on Striker off the top rope and through the table and Burke , thus winning the contest . 
 The third match was a Ladder match for the World Tag Team Championship , as The Hardys ( Matt and Jeff ) faced The World 's Greatest Tag Team ( Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas ) . The object of the match is to climb a ladder and retrieve the title belts suspended above the ring . The Hardys had the advantage for most of the contest , but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try and grab the belts , Benjamin botched a springboard attempt . Benjamin managed to kick the ladder from underneath Jeff , however , to gain control . The Hardys managed to regain the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World 's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it , which in turn caused Benjamin to fall to the arena floor . Jeff performed a Swanton bomb on Haas as Matt climbed up the ladder to get the belts and win the match . 
 Next on the card was Mark Henry versus Kane in a Lumberjack match with twelve lumberjacks at ringside ; Chris Benoit , Val Venis , Santino Marella , Balls Mahoney , Stevie Richards , The Miz , Kevin Thorn , Chris Masters , Johnny Nitro , Chavo Guerrero , Kenny Dykstra and Carlito . Kane <unk> Henry towards the end of the contest and attempted to pin Henry . Chavo Guerrero and Kenny Dykstra interfered , however , and attacked Kane . Kane fought back and chokeslammed Dykstra , but Henry locked Kane in a bear hug . The referee stopped the contest after Kane kayfabe passed out .

Shane and Umaga interfered in the match , helping Vince gain the advantage . Shane performed a flying elbow drop , sending Lashley through the announce table at ringside . Back inside the ring , as Umaga was holding a trash can in front of Lashley 's face in the corner , Shane attempted to execute the Coast @-@ to @-@ Coast dropkick ; however , Lashley moved out of the way , and Shane dropkicked the trash can into Umaga 's face . Team McMahon kept the upper hand , as Umaga performed a Samoan Drop onto Lashley , which was followed by a spear from Vince . Lashley , however , gained the upper hand by hitting Vince several times with a steel chair . Lashley performed a spear on Shane and followed with a spear to Vince before pinning Vince to gain the victory and become the new ECW World Champion . 
 A Pudding match was next , as Candice Michelle faced WWE Women 's Champion Melina . Candice forced Melina to submit by holding her head under the pudding . 
 This was followed by Edge versus Batista in a Steel Cage match for the World Heavyweight Championship , which could be won by either pinfall , submission , or escaping the cage . During the first few minutes of the contest , Edge attempted to escape the cage several times but was stopped by Batista . Batista gained the advantage after a suplex to Edge off the top rope . Edge gained the upper hand late in the contest , performing a spear to Batista , but failed to get the pinfall . Batista regained the advantage and attempted to perform the Batista Bomb , but Edge reversed the move . Edge climbed over the top of the cage while Batista crawled towards the door . Edge 's feet hit the arena floor first , and he was declared the winner and retained his title . 
 The final match was a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match for the WWE Championship , as John Cena defended against The Great Khali . Khali had control for most of the contest , performing a spin kick and a leg drop onto Cena . The contest went into the crowd , as Khali hit Cena with a television monitor . Cena gained the advantage , swinging the boom camera by the crew set into Khali . Cena attempted to perform the FU , but Khali blocked it with his elbow . Khali regained the upper hand , scoop slamming Cena onto a crane . Cena fought back while on the crane and performed an FU to Khali off the crane onto the arena floor . Cena got the pinfall and the victory . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 A storyline involving Vince McMahon 's " death " began the following night on Raw . He appeared traumatized from losing the ECW World Championship , acting strangely as a result . This behavior continued in McMahon 's appearances on all brands and culminated in a segment on the June 11 edition of Raw with McMahon entering a limousine moments before it exploded . On the June 25 edition of Raw , Vince McMahon revealed that his death was part of a storyline , and that Chris Benoit and his family were legitimately dead .

 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a 2007 British @-@ American fantasy film directed by David Yates and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures . It is based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling . The film , which is the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter film series , was written by Michael Goldenberg ( making this the only film in the series not to be scripted by Steve Kloves ) and produced by David Heyman and David Barron .

 The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter , alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry 's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger . It is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and is followed by Harry Potter and the Half @-@ Blood Prince . 
 Live @-@ action filming took place in England and Scotland for exterior locations and Leavesden Film Studios in Watford for interior locations from February to November 2006 , with a one @-@ month break in June . Post @-@ production on the film continued for several months afterwards to add in visual effects . The film 's budget was reportedly between £ 75 and 100 million ( $ 150 – 200 million ) .

 = = Plot = = 
 The Order of the Phoenix , a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore , informs Harry Potter that the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort 's return . While at the Order 's headquarters , Harry 's godfather , Sirius Black , mentions that Voldemort is after an object he did not have during his previous attack . 
 Upon arrival at Hogwarts , Harry learns that Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor : Dolores Umbridge . She and Harry immediately clash , and she punishes Harry for his " lies " by forcing him to write a message with a magic quill , scarring his hand . When Ron and Hermione notice Harry 's scars , they are outraged but he refuses to go to Dumbledore , who has distanced himself from Harry since the summer . As Umbridge 's control over the school increases , Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret group to train students in defensive spells , calling themselves " Dumbledore 's Army " . The Slytherin students are recruited by Umbridge to expose the group . Meanwhile , Harry and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other . 
 Harry has a vision involving an attack upon Arthur Weasley , from the point of view of Arthur 's attacker . Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry , Dumbledore instructs Severus Snape to give Harry Occlumency lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort 's influence . The connection between Harry and Voldemort leads Harry to further isolate himself from his friends . Meanwhile , Bellatrix Lestrange , Sirius ' deranged cousin , escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters . At Hogwarts , Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore 's Army . Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest . Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress . Harry 's relationship with Cho falls apart , as he believes she betrayed Dumbledore 's Army to Umbridge . Harry discovers through Snape 's memories why Snape hated Harry 's father James , who often ridiculed him . 
 Harry has another vision , this one of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort . Harry , Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge 's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network , since hers is the only fireplace not being monitored , but Umbridge stops them before they can do so . As Umbridge tortures Harry , Hermione tricks Umbridge into entering the Forbidden Forest in search of Dumbledore 's " secret weapon " . She and Harry lead her to the hiding place of Hagrid 's giant half @-@ brother , Grawp , only to be confronted by centaurs who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks and insults them . Harry , Hermione , Ron , Luna , Neville and Ginny fly to the Ministry of Magic on <unk> in an attempt to save Sirius . 
 The six enter the Department of Mysteries where they uncover a bottled prophecy , the object Voldemort was after . However , they are ambushed by Death Eaters including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange . Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured ; it was simply a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters ' grasp . Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy , and a fight between Dumbledore 's Army and the Death Eaters ensues . The Death Eaters take everyone except Harry as hostages , threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy . 
 Harry obliges just as Sirius and Remus Lupin arrive with Order members Nymphadora Tonks , Kingsley <unk> and Mad @-@ Eye Moody . As they attack the Death Eaters , Lucius drops the prophecy , destroying it . Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius , Bellatrix kills Sirius . Voldemort appears , but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before Voldemort can kill Harry . 
 A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues , destroying much of the Atrium , while Bellatrix escapes . After the two prove evenly matched , Voldemort possesses Harry to try to get Dumbledore to sacrifice Harry , but the love Harry feels for his friends and Sirius makes it impossible for Voldemort to remain in his body . Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort <unk> ; Fudge is forced to admit that Voldemort has returned and resigns as Minister in disgrace . Umbridge is removed from Hogwarts and Dumbledore returns as headmaster . Dumbledore explains he distanced himself from Harry throughout the year hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort using their connection . Harry comes to terms with the prophecy ; " Neither can live while the other survives . " 
 As the school year finally comes towards the end , everyone begins to head to the train station to head back home . Ron and Hermione meet up with Harry as they board the train , while others walk swiftly towards the train . Harry realizes one more idea that Voldemort can not survive on . Not only must one survive while the other dies but that Voldemort can never achieve what Ron , Hermione and Harry have been searching for ; true friendship .

 = = = Casting = = = 
 Casting began as early as May 2005 , when Radcliffe announced he would reprise his role as Harry . Across the media frenzy that took place during the release of Goblet of Fire , most of the main returning actors announced their return to the series , including Grint , Watson , Lewis , Wright , Leung , and Fiennes . 
 The announcements of the casting of the rest of the new characters to the series was spanned across 2006 . Evanna Lynch won the role of Luna Lovegood over 15 @,@ 000 other girls who attended the open casting call , waiting in a line of hopefuls that stretched a mile long . Saoirse Ronan was considered for the role . 
 Persistent rumours linked Elizabeth Hurley to the role of Bellatrix Lestrange , although Warner Bros. asserted there was " no truth whatsoever " to reports that she had been cast . As early as August 2005 , rumours began linking Helen McCrory to the role . On 2 February 2006 it was announced that McCrory had indeed been cast as Bellatrix . However , in April 2006 she revealed that she was three months pregnant and withdrew from the film because she would not have been able to perform the intense battle sequences in the Ministry of Magic in September and October 2006 . The announcement that Bonham Carter had been recast in the role was made on 25 May 2006 . McCrory was subsequently cast as Narcissa Malfoy from Harry Potter and the Half @-@ Blood Prince onwards . 
 The inclusion or cutting of some characters sparked speculation from fans as to the importance of the characters in the final book of the series , which was released just ten days after the film . In April 2006 , representatives of Jim McManus said he would be playing Aberforth Dumbledore , Albus ' brother and the barman of the Hog 's Head , in which Harry and his friends found Dumbledore 's Army . A week later WB announced that the role was " very minor " , allaying some of the speculation to the significance of the role , which , before the final book , was not even a speaking part . MTV reported in October 2006 that Dobby the house elf , who appeared in the second film , Chamber of Secrets , and in the fifth book , would be cut , opening up " plot questions " as to how the role of the elf would be filled . MTV also reported about a month before the release of the final book that Kreacher , the Black family 's house @-@ elf , was cut from the film in one draft of the script . However , after Rowling prodded the filmmakers to include him , saying , " You know , I wouldn 't [ cut him ] if I were you . Or you can , but if you get to make a seventh film , you 'll be tied in knots " , he was added back into the script . 
 Other minor roles were cut with subsequent drafts of the script . At the US premiere of Goblet of Fire , series producer David Heyman said that former Hogwarts professor Gilderoy Lockhart , played by Kenneth Branagh in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , was in the first draft of the script for Phoenix . However , neither Branagh nor the character of Lockhart appears in the final version . Tiana Benjamin was scheduled to return for the film in the role of Angelina Johnson , the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team , but she had to withdraw due to a commitment to playing Chelsea Fox in EastEnders . The character , as well as the entire Quidditch subplot , was ultimately cut from the film . She did , however , record sound clips for the Order of the Phoenix video game . 
 The family of footballer Theo Walcott made a cameo appearance in the film . They were signed on by director David Yates , who is the partner of Yvonne Walcott , Theo 's aunt . Theo himself was due to appear alongside his family , though his commitments to Arsenal Football Club forced him to pull out . 
 = = Production = = 
 British television director David Yates was chosen to direct the film after Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire director Mike Newell , as well as Jean @-@ Pierre Jeunet , Guillermo del Toro , Matthew Vaughn and Mira Nair , turned down offers . Yates believed he was approached because the studio saw him fit to handle an " edgy and emotional " film with a " political backstory " , which some of his previous television projects including State of Play , Sex Traffic and The Girl in the Café demonstrated . Producer David Heyman supported Yates ' comments about the film 's political theme , stating that " [ Order of the Phoenix ] is a political film , not with a capital P , but it 's about teen rebellion and the abuse of power . David has made films in the UK about politics without being heavy handed . " On the film 's political and social aspects , Emma Watson stated that " somehow it talks about life after 7 July , the way people behave when they ’ re scared , the way truth is often denied and all the things our society has to face . Facing the fact that the authority is corrupted means having a non @-@ conformist approach to reality and power . " 
 Steve Kloves , the screenwriter of the first four Potter films , had other commitments . Michael Goldenberg , who was considered to pen the first film in the series , filled in and wrote the script . 
 Rehearsals for Order of the Phoenix began on 27 January 2006 , filming began on 7 February 2006 and finished at the start of December 2006 . Filming was put on a two @-@ month hiatus starting in May 2006 so Radcliffe could sit his A / S Levels and Watson could sit her GCSE exams . The film 's budget was reportedly between GB £ 75 and 100 million ( US $ 150 – 200 million ) . The largest budget of the other films in the series has been the £ 75 million it cost to make Goblet of Fire . 
 Mark Day was the film editor , Sławomir <unk> was the cinematographer , and Jany Temime was the costume designer . Choreographer Paul Harris , who has previously worked with David Yates several times , created a physical language for wand combat to choreograph the wand fighting scenes . 
 = = = Set design = = = 
 Stuart Craig returned as set designer , having designed the first four films ' sets . There were a number of notable new sets in this film . The atrium in the Ministry of Magic is over 200 feet in length , making it the largest and most expensive set built for the Potter film series to date . Craig 's design was inspired by early London Underground stations , where , he said , architects " tried to imitate classical architecture but they used ceramic tile " , as well as a Burger King on Tottenham Court Road in London , where " there 's a fantastic Victorian façade which just embodies the age " . The set of Number Twelve , Grimmauld Place contains the Black family tapestry spread across three walls ; when the producers told Rowling they wanted to visualise the details of each name and birth year , she faxed them a complete copy of the entire tree . The set of the Hall of Prophecies was entirely digitally built . During a fight scene which occurs there , prophecies crash to the ground and break ; had it been an actual physical set , the reset time would have been weeks . 
 The set used for Igor <unk> 's trial scene in Goblet of Fire was doubled in size for Harry 's trial in this film , while still protecting its symmetry . New professor Dolores Umbridge , though she teaches in a classroom that has appeared in films two through four , inhabits an office vastly different from those of her predecessors . The set was redressed with " fluffy , pink filigree " and a number of plates upon which moving kittens were animated in post @-@ production . A 24 @-@ hour photo shoot was held to photograph and film the kittens for use on these plates . The quill which Umbridge gives Harry to write lines is designed by the set designers . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Though the producers explored options to film outside of the UK , Leavesden Film Studios in Watford was again the location on which many of the interior scenes , including the Great Hall , Privet Drive and Number Twelve , Grimmauld Place were shot . 
 Locations in England included the River Thames , for the flight of the Order of the Phoenix to Number Twelve , Grimmauld Place , and the flight of Dumbledore 's Army to the Ministry of Magic . This sequence also includes such landmarks as the London Eye , Canary Wharf , Big Ben , Buckingham Palace , and the HMS Belfast . Filming at Platform 9 ¾ took place at King 's Cross Station , as it has in the past . A telephone booth near Scotland Yard was used as Harry and Arthur Weasley enter the Ministry , while the crew closed the Westminster tube station on 22 October 2006 to allow for filming of Arthur Weasley accompanying Harry to his trial at the Ministry of Magic . Other scenes were filmed in and around Oxford , specifically at nearby Blenheim Palace in Woodstock . 
 In Glenfinnan , the Hogwarts Express crosses a viaduct , as it has in the past films . Aerial scenes were shot in Glen Coe , in <unk> Gully , and Glen Etive , which , at the time of filming , was one of the few places in Scotland without snow , making it ideal for a backdrop . 
 Director David Yates stated in an interview that he had originally shot a three @-@ hour film of Order of the Phoenix . However , some material had to be cut out in the final edit , as the movie was 45 minutes too long . Therefore , several locations which were used for various scenes do not appear in the final cut of the film . In Virginia Water , scenes were shot where Professor McGonagall recovers from Stunning Spells , and Burnham Beeches was used for filming the scene where Hagrid introduces his fifth @-@ year Care of Magical Creatures class to <unk> . Harry skips stones in front of the Glenfinnan Monument in Glenfinnan in another cut scene . 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 The film required over 1 @,@ 400 visual effects shots , and the London @-@ based company Double Negative created more than 950 of them . Working for six months on previsualisation starting in September 2005 , Double Negative was largely responsible for sequences in the Room of Requirement , the Forbidden Forest , the Hall of Prophecies , and the Death Chamber . 
 A new character in the film , Grawp , Hagrid 's giant half @-@ brother , came to life by a new technology called Soul Capturing , developed by Image Metrics . Instead of building the character from scratch , the movements and facial expressions of actor Tony Maudsley were used to model Grawp 's actions . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Nicholas Hooper was the composer for the soundtrack of the film , following John Williams , who scored the first three films , and Patrick Doyle , who did the fourth . In the new score , Hooper incorporated variations on " Hedwig 's Theme " , the series ' theme originally written by Williams for the first film and heard in all subsequent ones . In March and April 2007 , Hooper and the London Chamber Orchestra recorded nearly two hours of music at Abbey Road Studios in London . The score , like the film and book , is darker than previous instalments in the series . To emphasise this , the two new main themes reflect the sinister new character Dolores Umbridge , and Lord Voldemort 's invasion of Harry 's mind . A Japanese Taiko drum was used for a deeper sound in the percussion . The soundtrack was released on 10 July 2007 , the eve of the film 's release . For his work on the film , Hooper was nominated for a World Soundtrack Discovery Award . The trailer prominently features the cues " Divine Crusade " by X @-@ Ray Dog and " DNA Reactor " by Pfeifer Broz . Music . 
 The film also featured the song " Boys Will Be Boys " by The Ordinary Boys . 
 = = Differences from the book = = 
 At 766 pages in the British edition and 870 in the American edition , Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the Harry Potter series . Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg described his task to cut down the novel as searching for " the best equivalent way to tell the story . My job was to stay true to the spirit of the book , rather than to the letter " . Goldenberg said that Rowling told him , the producers , and Yates that " she just wanted to see a great movie , and gave [ them ] permission to take whatever liberties [ they ] felt [ they ] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love " . Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film , Goldenberg explained , became " clearer when [ he ] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry 's emotional journey " . He and Yates " looked for every opportunity to get everything [ they ] could in there . And where [ they ] couldn 't , to sort of pay homage to it , to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off @-@ screen " . 
 One cut Goldenberg had to make , which he " hated " to do , was the absence of Quidditch , the Wizarding sport . " The truth is that any movie made of this book , whoever made it , that had included the Quidditch subplot would have been a lesser film " , he said . In the book , Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team . " Ron facing challenges and coming into his own in the same way that Harry is , we tried to get that into the film in other ways , as much as possible . So , you feel like , if not the details of that story , at least the spirit of it is present in the film " . The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been " quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff " . 
 In a significant scene in the book , Harry sees a memory of his own father humiliating Snape in their school days , and Snape insulting his mother after she stood up for him . In the film , it is abbreviated to an " idea " , in Goldenberg 's words . " It 's an iconic moment when you realise your parents are normal , flawed human beings . ... Things get trimmed out , but I kept the meat of that in there – and that was what really gave me the coming @-@ of @-@ age story . " Young Lily Potter did not appear at all , but promotional screenshots show unknown teenager Susie <unk> in the role . 
 The scene at St Mungo 's , the hospital where Harry and friends run into classmate Neville Longbottom and learn that his parents were tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange , was cut because it required the construction of a new set . The main purpose of the action of the scene was relocated to the Room of Requirement after one of Dumbledore 's Army 's lessons . Also , to speed up the film 's climax , several events in the Ministry leading up to Harry 's battle with Voldemort were removed , including the brain room . Mrs. Weasley 's encounter with a <unk> at Grimmauld Place , Ron , Hermione and Malfoy becoming prefects , the appearance of <unk> Fletcher ( member of the Order , and the thief who eventually steals Slytherin 's locket discarded in Grimmauld Place ) , and Firenze teaching Divination followed suit . 
 The character of Kreacher the house @-@ elf , who was included in the script only at Rowling 's request , has a larger part in the book than the film . In the novel , he is seen saving some of the Black family 's artefacts which the Order of the Phoenix throw away , one of which is a locket which becomes extremely important in the seventh book . " It was kind of tricky to raise that in our story , because it 's for so much later " , Yates said . " We figured we can probably introduce it later , and that 's the approach we took " . Whilst Kreacher remained , all scenes involving Dobby were cut , and his important actions given to other characters . 
 Rita Skeeter , the journalist played by Miranda Richardson in Goblet of Fire , was also removed . In the book , Hermione blackmails her into writing an article that supports Harry as the rest of the Wizarding world denies his claims . Richardson noted that " it 's never gonna be the book on film , exactly . ... They 'll take certain aspects from the book and make it something that they hope is going to be commercial and that people want to see " .

According to estimates in March 2007 , by Warner Bros. , the film would debut on over 10 @,@ 000 theatre screens during the summer . 
 The film was released in most countries in a two @-@ week period starting 11 July 2007 . WB has tried to stick with day @-@ and @-@ date releases for most countries , except the Middle East and a few minor markets which were to be in holidays at that point . The set of summer releases , even though the films are typically released in the winter , " really maximises our opportunity " , said a representative for WB . 
 Previews of the film began in March 2007 in the Chicago area . Under tight security to prevent piracy , WB had security guards patrol the aisles , looking for cell phone cameras or small recording devices , at a preview in Japan . The world premiere took place in Tokyo , Japan on 28 June 2007 . MySpace users could bring copies of their online profiles to gain free admission to sneak previews in eight different cities across the country on 28 June 2007 .

After the premiere , the three young stars of the film series , Radcliffe , Grint , and Watson , were honoured with a ceremony where their handprints , footprints , and " <unk> " were placed in the cement in front of Grauman 's Chinese Theatre . 
 Originally , Warner Bros. set the Australian release date as 6 September 2007 , nearly two months after the majority of other release dates . However , after complaints from the Australian community , including a petition garnering 2 @,@ 000 signatures the date was pulled back to 11 July 2007 . The release dates of the film in the UK and US were also moved back , both from 13 July , to 12 and 11 July , respectively . 
 Even though the book is the longest in the series ( over 700 pages ) , the film is 138 minutes long ( 2 hours and 18 minutes ) , the second shortest in the entire film series .

 The film received mostly positive reviews . The film holds a 79 % " Certified Fresh " approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes , making it the second lowest @-@ rated film in the series on the site . The site 's general consensus states that " It 's not easy to take the longest Harry Potter book and streamline it into the shortest HP movie , but director David Yates does a bang up job of it , creating an Order of the Phoenix that 's entertaining and action @-@ packed " . It also has a score of 71 out of 100 on Metacritic , the fifth highest rated after Deathly Hallows – Part 2 , Prisoner of Azkaban , Goblet of Fire and Half @-@ Blood Prince . Charles Frederick of The Telegraph headlined their review " Potter film is the best and darkest yet " . Colin Bertram of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars , calling it the best Potter film yet and wrote that " die @-@ hard Potter addicts will rejoice that Yates has distilled J. K. Rowling 's broad universe with care and reverence " . Mark Adams of The Sunday Mirror , while giving the film four out of five stars , called it " a dark and delicious delight [ and ] a must @-@ see movie " . Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that the film " is the first instalment in the soon @-@ to @-@ be series @-@ of @-@ seven that doesn 't seem like just another spinoff capitalising on the money @-@ minting Harry Potter brand name . Instead , Phoenix feels like a real ' movie ' " . 
 Imelda Staunton 's performance as Dolores Umbridge and Helena Bonham Carter 's as Bellatrix Lestrange were widely acclaimed ; Staunton was described as the " perfect choice for the part " and " one of the film 's greatest pleasures " , " coming close to stealing the show " . The Daily Mail described Staunton 's portrayal of Umbridge as a " refreshing addition " , with the character herself described as " a cross between Margaret Thatcher and Hyacinth Bucket " . Bonham Carter was said to be a " shining but underused talent " . Variety praised Alan Rickman 's portrayal of Severus Snape , writing that he " may have outdone himself ; seldom has an actor done more with less than he does here " . Newcomer Evanna Lynch , playing Luna Lovegood , also received good word from a number of reviewers including the New York Times who declared her " spellbinding " . 
 Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also lauded the three principal actors ' achievements , especially Radcliffe : " One of the joys of this film is watching Daniel Radcliffe grow so impressively into the role of Harry . He digs deep into the character and into Harry 's nightmares . It 's a sensational performance , touching all the bases from tender to fearful " . Rolling Stone 's review also classified the film as better than the previous four instalments in the series , by losing the " candy @-@ ass aspect " of the first two and " raising the bar " from the " heat and resonance " of the third and fourth . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called the film " the best of the series so far , [ with ] the laughs , the jitters and the juice to make even nonbelievers wild about Harry " . 
 Leo Lewis of The Times ( London ) expressed disappointment that the three main actors were not able to fully advance the emotional sides of their respective characters , weakening the film . The San Francisco Chronicle complained about a " lousy " storyline , alleging that the first twenty minutes of the film , when Harry is put on trial for performing magic outside of school and threatened with expulsion , but is cleared of all charges , did not advance the plot . Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Phoenix is " quite possibly the least enjoyable of the [ series ] so far " , and that despite " several eye @-@ catching moments " , " the magic – movie magic , that is – is mostly missing " . The review also criticised the under use of the " cream of British acting " , noting the brief appearances of Helena Bonham Carter , Maggie Smith , Emma Thompson , David Thewlis , Richard Griffiths , and Julie Walters .

 = Charles T. Hinde = 
 Charles T. Hinde ( July 12 , 1832 – March 10 , 1915 ) was an American industrialist , tycoon , riverboat captain , businessman , and entrepreneur . He managed many businesses and invested in numerous business ventures over the course of his life . Hinde served in executive leadership positions in the river navigation , shipping , railroad , and hotel businesses . By his late forties , Hinde had already amassed a great fortune from his work in the steamboat and railroad industries . 
 In the late 1880s Hinde was invited to San Diego by his close friend E. S. Babcock to invest in and run several businesses , including the Hotel del Coronado and the Spreckels Brothers Commercial Company with John D. Spreckels . Hinde vastly increased his personal fortune during his time in southern California , and he helped spur the economy of the region . Towards the end of his life he donated much of his wealth to further various projects in the Californian city of Coronado and its surrounding area , some dedicated to the memory of his daughter Camilla , who died in Evansville , Indiana , at the age of 13 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Hinde was born in Urbana , Ohio , on July 12 , 1832 . He was one of six children born to Thomas S. Hinde ( 1785 – 1846 ) and Sara Cavileer Hinde ( 1791 – 1847 ) . His grandfather was Dr. Thomas Hinde ( 1737 – 1828 ) who had distinguished himself during the American Revolutionary War and during his service to General James Wolfe . During the early years of Hinde 's life the family was constantly on the move , because his father was a circuit preacher of the Methodist faith and was speculating in military real estate in the territories purchased from the Native Americans by Willam Henry Harrison . Eventually , Hinde 's father purchased a large tract of land in southern Illinois where he founded a town and settled with his family . 
 Hinde attended elementary and middle school in Mount Carmel , Illinois , a town his father founded in 1815 . The Hinde family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County , Illinois . A portion of the family land was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock and the Grand Rapids Dam . Hinde attended Indiana Asbury University ( now DePauw University ) in Greencastle for a year and a half before dropping out following the deaths of his father and mother . Hinde , his brother Edmund C. Hinde , and his sister Belinda Hinde were forced to live with other relatives or fend for themselves . For a short time in the 1850s , Hinde and his younger sister Belinda lived with their older sister , Martha , and her husband , Judge Charles H. Constable , in Mount Carmel and in Marshall , Illinois . As a college dropout , Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel . Even though these were low @-@ paying jobs , Hinde was able to support himself because he had inherited large land holdings from his father . 
 = = Employment in river navigation = = 
 Hinde 's first employment in river transportation was as a clerk on a boat that operated between St. Louis , Missouri , and St. Paul , Minnesota . After about a year , he joined the Galena , Dubuque and St. Paul Packet Company , which became one of the largest transportation companies in that part of the country . At one point during his employment there , he contracted cholera and almost died . Hinde made rapid advancement and was promoted to the position of captain in his mid @-@ twenties , an unusually young age . In 1862 , he went to Louisville , Kentucky , to take command of a steamer running from there to Memphis , Tennessee He returned to St. Louis in 1864 to serve as captain of the steamer Davenport , which ran from St. Louis to St. Paul , before resigning that position to organize a branch of the Halliday Brothers Corporation in Cairo , Illinois , which was engaged in the river transportation and shipping businesses . He subsequently established his own business and became the shipping agent at the Cairo wharf for all the steamboat lines passing through Cairo , on both the Ohio River and Mississippi River and their tributaries . Hinde sold his interests in the business shortly after its creation and moved his family to Evansville , Indiana , where he became acquainted with E. S. Babcock and the Reid Brothers . 
 = = Railroad business = = 
 Steamboats began to see strong competition from the railroads after the post @-@ Civil War replacement of the rail lines , and after a brief episode of poor health in 1870 , Hinde sold his interests in the river navigation business and turned his attention to railroads . He went to Louisville , Kentucky , to rest , and by chance became a shipping agent for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company through his close relationship with several company executives . Hinde secured various contracts for hauling grain , a business he may have gained some insight into from his brother Edmund C. Hinde ( 1830 – 1909 ) , who was then active in the grain business in their hometown of Mount Carmel . But the endeavor was unsuccessful , and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad went into receivership ; Hinde arranged to have all his shipments transferred to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company . Shortly before he received an invitation from E. S. Babcock to move to Coronado , California , Hinde 's only child , Camilla , died in Evansville at the age of 13 . Babcock had founded the Hotel del Coronado and several large companies , and invited Hinde to invest and help manage his business interests . Hinde had been engaged in the railroad business for a little under a decade when he left for southern California to invest with John Diedrich Spreckels and E.S. Babcock in the real estate and hotel businesses . In the following years , Hinde and Spreckels launched numerous successful business ventures together and became good friends . 
 = = Southern California = = 
 In Evansville , Hinde had become acquainted with the Reid Brothers , who designed many notable structures there , including the Willard Library . When Hinde and Babcock left Evansville and relocated to Coronado , they took the Reid Brothers with them , and hired them to design many structures including the Hotel del Coronado . Hinde also used the Reid brothers for personal projects , such as his home in Coronado and the church and rectory he built in the town . All three structures still stand today . Hinde may have used his friendship with the Reid Brothers to get them to design the Grand Rapids Hotel , which was owned by his nephew , Frederick Hinde Zimmerman . The building burned down in 1929 . 
 In California , Hinde again became involved in various businesses and investments . Initially , he was the commercial agent and manager for the Santa Fe Wharf , working with Spreckels and Babcock . Later , he was one of the founders of the Spreckels Brothers Commercial Company , owning a one @-@ third interest . The company imported coal , cement , and general merchandise . Hinde 's most important and lasting investment was the Hotel del Coronado on Rancho San Diego Island , which was owned by the Coronado Beach Company , originally capitalized with US $ 3 million . At the time of capitalization the company directors were Babcock , Spreckels , Hinde , H.W. Mallett , and Giles Kellogg . They formed the company on April 7 , 1886 , and started construction on the hotel . The company also undertook numerous other investments in the Coronado area , but their plans were interrupted by the Panic of 1893 , a severe recession and bank run caused by a bubble in the railroad business . The economy did not begin to recover until 1897 , and after a multiple year slump the property market in southern California began to recover . As with his original switch from the navigation to railroad business , Hinde 's move from railroads to hotels dramatically increased his personal fortune . From its founding until his death in 1915 , Hinde remained vice president and treasurer of the Coronado Beach Company and the Spreckels Brothers Commercial Company . 
 = = Later life and legacy = = 
 At the age of 72 , Hinde began to invest in property and mines in New Mexico as a hobby . Primarily , Hinde used his nephews , Harry Hinde and Frederick Hinde Zimmerman , to alert him to new business opportunities . The local newspapers reported on his investments , but he only experienced modest profits . 
 Hinde bought the most expensive car on offer at the 1910 California Auto Show , a mammoth 72 @-@ horse power Thomas Flyer manufactured by the Thomas Motor Company . He tendered a check for $ 6 @,@ 200 and drove the car back to one of his residences in San Diego , California . 
 Hinde was well connected among the elite businessmen and politicians of the time , owing to his extensive business interests . One of his closest friends was James J. Hill of the Pacific Railroad , with whom he became acquainted while working in the railroad business . Hinde was politically neutral , but towards the end of his life he began to support Republican political candidates , at the urging of his nephew , Harry Hinde , a Republican politician . During the 1912 Presidential Election , Hinde entertained President William Howard Taft , a Republican , at his home in Coronado ; Taft was at the time campaigning for re @-@ election for the Presidency of the United States against Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson . Taft and his host went hunting and horse riding , and Hinde introduced Taft to many of his friends and business acquaintances . President Taft lost the election . 
 Towards the end of his life , Hinde gave to many charities in southern California , and he was particularly generous to Coronado and San Diego .. He funded the construction of Christ Episcopal Church in Coronado , together with its parish center and rectory , all dedicated to his deceased daughter , Camilla . Even though Hinde was generous in his gifts , he remained modest and low @-@ key throughout his life . He did not like receiving credit for his philanthropy , perhaps the reason his contributions were overlooked in the years following his death . Hinde bequeathed a large part of his estate to his sister Belinda 's son , Frederick Hinde Zimmerman , who used the money to build the Grand Rapids Hotel on the Hinde family farm in Mount Carmel . Hinde left an even larger portion of his estate and his house in Coronado to his nephew , Harry Hinde . 
 Hinde died in Coronado on March 10 , 1915 , aged 82 . In accordance with his wishes , the funeral service held in the Episcopal Church that he built for the residents of Coronado was modest . Hinde is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery , San Diego , California . His estate papers show that in addition to his other businesses , Hinde was a part @-@ owner of the Los Angeles @-@ based Global Grain & Milling Company , founded in 1898 and run by Will E. Keller . 
 = Hurricane Ione = 
 Hurricane Ione / <unk> / was a strong , Category 4 hurricane that affected North Carolina in September 1955 , bringing high winds and significant rainfall . It came on the heels of Hurricanes Connie and Diane , and compounded problems already caused by the two earlier hurricanes . Spawned by a tropical wave which left the African coast on September 6 , the system became a tropical depression in the tropical North Atlantic , before turning northwest and developing into a hurricane . After turning back to the west east of the Bahamas , Ione turned northwest and northward , moving across eastern North Carolina before moving east @-@ northeastward out to sea . Ione caused $ 600 million ( 2005 USD ) in damage , much of it to crops across North Carolina . As a result of Ione 's impacts seven people lost their lives . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved through Cape Verde on September 6 and on September 11 Ione developed into a tropical depression . Ione remained weak for the next few days , and then began to steadily intensify as it moved north of the Lesser Antilles , reaching hurricane strength on September 15 . Conditions were favorable for additional development , and Ione peaked with winds of 140 miles per hour ( 230 km / h ) on September 18 while north of the Bahamas . 
 Drier and cooler air gradually became entrained in Ione 's circulation , and the storm weakened into a Category 2 hurricane at the time of its Wilmington , North Carolina , landfall on September 19 , which made Ione the third hurricane to hit the state in six weeks and fourth in 11 months . Ione was the first tropical cyclone to be observed on the Cape Hatteras radar during landfall and was one of the first observed to make small @-@ scale oscillations within its track . The storm weakened to a tropical storm over land but restrengthened to a Category 2 hurricane over the northwestern Atlantic . Ione continued northeastward and became an extratropical cyclone on September 21 . The extratropical storm crossed over Newfoundland and was last seen on September 24 moving across the North Atlantic . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Hurricane warnings were in effect from the Virginia Capes to Morehead , North Carolina and a Hurricane alert was issued northward to Atlantic City , New Jersey . Dump trucks loaded with dirt were ready to make earthen dikes around the Riegel paper mill , due to the severe damage caused to it by hurricanes earlier that year which caused the 1955 Delaware River flood . Recent flooding , from Hurricane Diane , along the Delaware River kept residents along its banks alert should the storm strike , business owners were also ready to move their merchandise if the need arose . New York City officials prepared for the worst , with police officers filling gas tanks of their patrol cars and extra patrol men being called to duty in advance of the hurricane . Flights were canceled in New York , firemen stood at the ready in Staten Island , and the Coast Guard warned shipping companies of the impending storm . A boxing match between Rocky Marciano and Archie Moore was delayed , which allowed the promoters to sell an additional $ 150 @,@ 000 ( 1955 ) in tickets , which is $ 1 @.@ 33 million in present @-@ day figures .

 September 18 was a gloomy day in Swan Quarter , North Carolina and winds did not significantly increase until between 2 and 3 p.m. By 9 : 30 p.m. , strong winds buffeted the area from the east @-@ northeast and the electricity went out at around 10 : 50 p.m. Area homes flooded for the first time since Barbara of the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season and the tides increased until 8 : 45 a.m. on September 19 before rapidly rising between 2 : 00 and 2 : 30 p.m. The Lake Causeway was partially washed out towards New Holland . The Diamond Shoals lightship was reported to have broken loose during the hurricane . Tides did not fully recede at Swan Quarter until 3 a.m. on September 20 , with winds finally dying down after 7 a.m. the same day . Cherry Point recorded a maximum sustained wind of 75 miles per hour ( 121 km / h ) , with gusts to 107 miles per hour ( 172 km / h ) . Prolonged easterly winds forced the tide to increase to levels 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) to 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above normal , which resulted in one of the largest inundations in North Carolina history . The storm surge from Ione was recorded at 3 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) at Morehead City , North Carolina , while a storm tide of 5 @.@ 3 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) was measured at Wrightsville Beach , North Carolina . It was reported that the storm lasted for nearly two days in North Carolina . <unk> Monarch , which had departed from Newfoundland , was laying telephone cable across the Atlantic ocean when Ione crossed its path . The ship weathered the storm , and managed to reach Scotland to complete its mission by September 26 . 
 Ione caused $ 600 million ( 2005 USD ) in damage , much of it to crops across North Carolina . The rest came from flooding in an area already devastated by Hurricanes Connie and Diane six weeks earlier . Along the Trent River near Trent and the New River near Gum Branch , North Carolina , the river stage reached heights not seen again until Hurricane Floyd of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season . Ione caused seven deaths in North Carolina , a low number attributed to well @-@ executed warnings and effectiveness of relief groups such as the Red Cross . 
 Ione made landfall in Newfoundland , Canada during the evening of September 21 as a tropical storm and as a result cause wind and rain damage . That day the storm became extratropical , yet still had negative effects on Canada . In <unk> a boy broke his leg after being blown into a car and thousands of dollars in damage , as well as broken polls , uprooted trees , interrupted telephone service , damaged chimneys and power outages were reported in St. John 's , Canada . There were also reports of roof damage and a trailer being torn for its foundation . Three flights were cancelled , schools were closed and the ferry service between Bell Island and Portugal Cove was disrupted . On September 23 there were reports of boats that had been lost and in Harbour Grace and Harbour Main . There was also a report of a garage being flipped with a car still in it . There were also reports of a street and two mines being flooded in Corner Brook and it was reported that there was $ 2 million damage to the province . There was extensive damage to waterfront property on the southern coast of Newfoundland . On September 24 there were reports of fishermen losing gear , a house being blown off its foundation in <unk> , damage to the phone company , a washed out road in Swift Current and damage to the power company . On September 27 it was reported that buoys were destroyed in Harbour Grace , Fortune and Stag Harbour . There was also damage done to a freighter in Conception Bay . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Due to the damage , the name Ione was retired and will never be used for an Atlantic hurricane again . This was before the formal lists were created , as a result it was not replaced with any particular name . As a result of this , this is the only time the name Ione was used for the Atlantic Basin since hurricane naming began in 1950 . When one of the first tropical cyclone forecast models was developed , Ione was chosen as one of the candidates to test out its reliability . The errors associated with Ione were significant , as the model did not forecast Ione to make landfall in North Carolina , forcing the storm eastward to the south of the state . 
 = Short @-@ beaked echidna = 
 The short @-@ beaked echidna ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ) is one of four living species of echidna and the only member of the genus Tachyglossus . It is covered in fur and spines and has a distinctive snout and a specialized tongue , which it uses to catch its insect prey at a great speed . Like the other extant monotremes , the short @-@ beaked echidna lays eggs ; the monotremes are the only group of mammals to do so . 
 The short @-@ beaked echidna has extremely strong front limbs and claws , which allow it to burrow quickly with great power . As it needs to be able to survive underground , it has a significant tolerance to high levels of carbon dioxide and low levels of oxygen . It has no weapons or fighting ability but repels predators by curling into a ball and deterring them with its spines . It lacks the ability to sweat and cannot deal with heat well , so it tends to avoid daytime activity in hot weather . It can swim if needed . The snout has mechanoreceptors and electroreceptors that help the echidna to detect its surroundings . 
 During the Australian winter , it goes into deep torpor and hibernation , reducing its metabolism to save energy . As the temperature increases , it emerges to mate . Female echidnas lay one egg a year and the mating period is the only time the otherwise solitary animals meet one another ; the male has no further contact with the female or his offspring after mating . A young echidna is the size of a grape but grows rapidly on its mother 's milk , which is very rich in nutrients . Baby echidnas eventually grow too large and spiky to stay in the pouch and , at around six months of age , they leave the burrow and have no more contact with their mothers . 
 The species is found throughout Australia , where it is the most widespread native mammal , and in coastal and highland regions of southwestern New Guinea , where it is known as the <unk> in the <unk> and Chimbu languages . It is not threatened with extinction , but human activities , such as hunting , habitat destruction , and the introduction of foreign predatory species and parasites , have reduced its distribution in Australia . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The short @-@ beaked echidna was first described by George Shaw in 1792 . He named the species Myrmecophaga aculeata , thinking that it might be related to the giant anteater . Since Shaw first described the species , its name has undergone four revisions : from M. aculeata to Ornithorhynchus hystrix , Echidna hystrix , Echidna aculeata and finally , Tachyglossus aculeatus . The name Tachyglossus means " quick tongue " , in reference to the speed with which the echidna uses its tongue to catch ants and termites , and aculeatus means " spiny " or " equipped with spines " . 
 The short @-@ beaked echidna is the only member of its genus , sharing the family <unk> with the extant species of the genus Zaglossus that occur in New Guinea . Zaglossus species , which include the western long @-@ beaked , Sir David 's long @-@ beaked and eastern long @-@ beaked echidnas , are all significantly larger than T. aculeatus , and their diets consist mostly of worms and grubs rather than ants and termites . Species of the <unk> are egg @-@ laying mammals ; together with the related family <unk> , they are the only extant monotremes in the world . 
 The five subspecies of the short @-@ beaked echidna are each found in different geographical locations . The subspecies also differ from one another in their hairiness , spine length and width , and the size of the grooming claws on their hind feet . 
 T. a. <unk> is found in Northern Territory and Western Australia . 
 T. a. aculeatus is found in Queensland , New South Wales , South Australia and Victoria . 
 T. a. <unk> is found in coastal regions and the highlands of New Guinea , and possibly in the rainforests of Northeast Queensland . 
 T. a. <unk> is found on Kangaroo Island . 
 T. a. setosus is found on Tasmania and some islands in Bass Strait . 
 The earliest fossils of the short @-@ beaked echidna date back around 15 million years ago to the Pleistocene era , and the oldest specimens were found in caves in South Australia , often with fossils of the long @-@ beaked echidna from the same period . The ancient short @-@ beaked echidnas are considered to be identical to their contemporary descendants except the ancestors are around 10 % smaller . This " post @-@ Pleistocene dwarfing " affects many Australian mammals . Part of the last radiation of monotreme mammals , echidnas are believed to have <unk> diverged from the platypus around 66 million years ago , between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods . However , the echidna 's pre @-@ Pleistocene heritage has not been traced yet , and the lack of teeth on the fossils found thus far have made it impossible to use dental evidence . 
 The short @-@ beaked echidna was commonly called the spiny anteater in older books , though this term has fallen out of fashion since the echidna bears no relation to the true anteaters . It has a variety of names in the indigenous languages of the regions where it is found . The Noongar people from southwestern Western Australia call it the <unk> . In Central Australia southwest of Alice Springs , the Pitjantjatjara term is <unk> or <unk> , from the word <unk> for spike of porcupine grass ( Triodia irritans ) . The word can also mean <unk> . In central Cape York Peninsula , it is called ( minha ) <unk> in Pakanh , where minha is a qualifier meaning ' meat ' or ' animal ' , ( inh- ) <unk> in Uw Oykangand and ( inh- ) <unk> in Uw Olkola , where inh- is a qualifier meaning ' meat ' or ' animal ' . In the highland regions of southwestern New Guinea , it is known as the <unk> in the <unk> and Chimbu languages . 
 = = Description = = 
 Short @-@ beaked echidnas are typically 30 to 45 cm ( 12 to 18 in ) in length , with 75 mm ( 3 in ) of snout , and weigh between 2 and 7 kg ( 4 @.@ 4 and 15 @.@ 4 lb ) . However , the Tasmanian subspecies , T. a. setosus , is smaller than its Australian mainland counterparts . Because the neck is not externally visible , the head and body appear to merge . The <unk> are on either side of the head , with no external pinnae . The eyes are small , about 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter and at the base of the wedge @-@ shaped snout . The nostrils and the mouth are at the distal end of the snout ; the mouth cannot open wider than 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) . The body of the short @-@ beaked echidna is , with the exception of the underside , face and legs , covered with cream @-@ coloured spines . The spines , which may be up to 50 mm ( 2 in ) long , are modified hairs , mostly made of keratin . Insulation is provided by fur between the spines , which ranges in colour from honey to a dark reddish @-@ brown and even black ; the underside and short tail are also covered in fur . Colouration of the fur and spines varies with geographic location . The echidna 's fur may be infested with what is said to be the world 's largest flea , <unk> <unk> , which is about 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) long . 
 The limbs of the short @-@ beaked echidna are adapted for rapid digging ; they are short and have strong claws . Their strong and stout limbs allow it to tear apart large logs and move paving stones , and one has been recorded moving a 13 @.@ 5 @-@ kg ( 30 @-@ lb ) stone ; a scientist also reported that a captive echidna moved a refrigerator around the room in his home . The power of the limbs is based on strong musculature , particularly around the shoulder and torso areas . The mechanical advantage of its arm is greater than that of humans , as its biceps connects the shoulder to the forearm at a point further down than for humans , and the chunky humerus allows more muscle to form . 
 The claws on the hind feet are elongated and curved backward to enable cleaning and grooming between the spines . Like the platypus , the echidna has a low body temperature — between 30 and 32 ° C ( 86 and 90 ° F ) — but , unlike the platypus , which shows no evidence of torpor or hibernation , the body temperature of the echidna may fall as low as 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) . The echidna does not pant or sweat and normally seeks shelter in hot conditions . Despite their inability to sweat , echidnas still lose water as they exhale . The snout is believed to be crucial in restricting this loss to sustainable levels , through a bony labyrinth that has a refrigerator effect and helps to condense water vapour in the breath . The echidna does not have highly concentrated urine , and around half of the estimated daily water loss of 120 g ( 4 @.@ 2 oz ) occurs in this manner , while most of the rest is through the skin and respiratory system . Most of this is replenished by its substantial eating of termites — one laboratory study reported ingestion of around 147 g ( 5 @.@ 2 oz ) a day , most of which was water . This can be supplemented by drinking water , if available , or licking morning dew from flora . 
 In the Australian autumn and winter , the echidna enters periods of torpor or deep hibernation . Because of its low body temperature , it becomes sluggish in very hot and very cold weather . 
 Like all monotremes , it has one orifice , the cloaca , for the passage of faeces , urine and reproductive products . The male has internal testes , no external scrotum and a highly unusual penis with four knobs on the tip , which is nearly a quarter of his body length when erect . The gestating female develops a pouch on her underside , where she raises her young . 
 The musculature of the short @-@ beaked echidna has a number of unusual aspects . The panniculus <unk> , an enormous muscle just beneath the skin , covers the entire body . By contraction of various parts of the panniculus <unk> , the short @-@ beaked echidna can change shape , the most characteristic shape change being achieved by rolling itself into a ball when threatened , so protecting its belly and presenting a defensive array of sharp spines . It has one of the shortest spinal cords of any mammal , extending only as far as the thorax . Whereas the human spinal cord ends at the first or second lumbar vertebra , for the echidna it occurs at the seventh thoracic vertebra . The shorter spinal cord is thought to allow flexibility to enable wrapping into a ball . 
 The musculature of the face , jaw and tongue is specialised for feeding . The tongue is the animal 's sole means of catching prey , and can protrude up to 180 mm ( 7 in ) outside the snout . The snout 's shape , resembling a double wedge , gives it a significant mechanical advantage in generating a large moment , so makes it efficient for digging to reach prey or to build a shelter . The tongue is sticky because of the presence of glycoprotein @-@ rich mucus , which both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites , which adhere to it . The tongue is protruded by contracting circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forwards and contracting two <unk> muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the mandible . The protruded tongue is stiffened by a rapid flow of blood , which allows it to penetrate wood and soil . Retraction requires the contraction of two internal longitudinal muscles , known as the <unk> . When the tongue is retracted , the prey is caught on backward @-@ facing keratinous " teeth " , located along the roof of the buccal cavity , allowing the animal both to capture and grind food . The tongue moves with great speed , and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute . This is partly achieved through the elasticity of the tongue and the conversion of elastic potential energy into kinetic energy . The tongue is very flexible , particularly at the end , allowing it to bend in U @-@ turns and catch insects attempting to flee in their twisty nests or mounds . The tongue also has an ability to avoid picking up splinters while foraging in logs ; the reason for this ability is unknown . It can eat quickly ; a specimen of around 3 kg ( 6 @.@ 6 lb ) can ingest 200 g ( 7 @.@ 1 oz ) of termites in 10 minutes . 
 The echidna 's stomach is quite different from other mammals . It is devoid of secretory glands and has a cornified stratified epithelium , which resembles horny skin . Unlike other mammals , which typically have highly acidic stomachs , the echidna has low levels of acidity , almost neutral , with pH in the 6 @.@ 2 – 7 @.@ 4 range . The stomach is elastic , and gastric peristalsis grinds soil particulates and shredded insects together . Digestion occurs in the small intestine , which is around 3 @.@ 4 m ( 11 ft ) in length . The insect exoskeletons and soil are not digested , being ejected in the waste . 
 Numerous physiological adaptations aid the lifestyle of the short @-@ beaked echidna . Because the animal burrows , it must tolerate very high levels of carbon dioxide in inspired air , and will voluntarily remain in situations where carbon dioxide concentrations are high . It can dig up to a metre into the ground to retrieve ants or evade predators , and can survive with low oxygen when the area is engulfed by bushfires . The echidna can also dive underwater , which can help it to survive sudden floods . During these situations , the heart rate drops to around 12 beats per minute , around one @-@ fifth of the rate at rest . This process is believed to save oxygen for the heart and brain , which are the most sensitive organs to such a shortage ; laboratory testing has revealed the echidna 's cardiovascular system is similar to that of the seal . 
 The echidna 's optical system is an uncommon hybrid of both mammalian and reptilian characteristics . The cartilaginous layer beneath the sclera of the eyeball is similar to that of reptiles and avians . The small corneal surface is keratinised and hardened , possibly to protect it from chemicals secreted by prey insects or self @-@ impalement when it rolls itself up , which has been observed . The echidna has the flattest lens of any animal , giving it the longest focal length . This similarity to primates and humans allows it to see distant objects clearly . Unlike placental mammals , including humans , the echidna does not have a ciliary muscle to distort the geometry of the lens and thereby change the focal length and allow objects at different distances to be viewed clearly ; the whole eye is believed to distort , so the distance between the lens and retina instead changes to allow focusing . The visual ability of an echidna is not great , and it is not known whether it can perceive colour ; however , it can distinguish between black and white , and horizontal and vertical stripes . Eyesight is not a crucial factor in the animal 's ability to survive , as blind echidnas are able to live healthily . Its ears are sensitive to low @-@ frequency sound , which may be ideal for detecting sounds emitted by termites and ants underground . The pinnae are obscured and covered by hair , so predators can not grab them in an attack , and prey or foreign material cannot enter , although ticks are known to reside there . The macula of the ear is very large compared to other animals , and is used as a gravity sensor to orient the echidna . The large size may be important for burrowing downwards . 
 The leathery snout is keratinised and covered in <unk> and <unk> , which provide information about the surrounding environment . These nerves protrude through microscopic holes at the end of the snout , which also has mucus glands on the end that act as electroreceptors . Echidnas can detect electric fields of 1 @.@ 8 mV / cm — 1000 times more sensitive than humans — and dig up buried batteries . A series of push rods protrude from the snout . These are columns of flattened , spinous cells , with roughly an average diameter of 50 micrometres and a length of 300 micrometres . The number of push rods per square millimetre of skin is estimated to be 30 to 40 . Longitudinal waves are believed to be picked up and transmitted through the rods , acting as mechanical sensors , to allow prey detection . 
 A well @-@ developed olfactory system may be used to detect mates and prey . A highly sensitive optic nerve has been shown to have visual discrimination and spatial memory comparable to those of a rat . The brain and central nervous system have been extensively studied for evolutionary comparison with placental mammals , particularly with its fellow monotreme , the platypus . The average brain volume is 25 ml , similar to a cat of approximately the same size ; while the platypus has a largely smooth brain , the echidna has a heavily folded and fissured , <unk> brain similar to humans , which is seen as a sign of a highly neurologically advanced animal . The cerebral cortex is thinner , and the brain cells are larger and more densely packed and organised in the echidna than the platypus , suggesting evolutionary divergence must have occurred long ago . Almost half of the sensory area in the brain is devoted to the snout and tongue , and the part devoted to smell is relatively large compared to other animals . 
 The short @-@ beaked echidna has the largest prefrontal cortex relative to body size of any mammal , taking up 50 % of the volume in comparison to 29 % for humans . This part of the brain in humans is thought to be used for planning and analytical behaviour , leading to debate as to whether the echidna has reasoning and <unk> ability . Experiments in a simple maze and with a test on opening a trap door to access food , and the echidna 's ability to remember what it has learnt for over a month , has led scientists to conclude its learning ability is similar to that of a cat or a rat . 
 The echidna shows rapid eye movement during sleep , usually around its thermoneutral temperature of 25 ° C , and this effect is suppressed at other temperatures . Its brain has been shown to contain a <unk> similar to that of placental mammals , so linking this structure to their common ancestor . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 No systematic study of the ecology of the short @-@ beaked echidna has been published , but studies of several aspects of their ecological behaviour have been conducted . They live alone , and , apart from the burrow created for rearing young , they have no fixed shelter or nest site . They do not have a home territory they defend against other echidnas , but range over a wide area . The range area has been observed to be between 21 and 93 ha , although one study in Kangaroo Island found the animals there covered an area between 9 and 192 ha . Overall , the mean range areas across the various regions of Australia were 40 – 60 ha . There was no correlation between gender and range area , but a weak one with size . Echidnas can share home ranges without incident , and sometimes share shelter sites if not enough are available for each animal to have one individually . 
 Short @-@ beaked echidnas are typically active in the daytime , though they are ill @-@ equipped to deal with heat because they have no sweat glands and do not pant . Therefore , in warm weather , they change their patterns of activity , becoming crepuscular or nocturnal . Body temperatures above 34 ° C ( 93 ° F ) are believed to be fatal , and in addition to avoiding heat , the animal adjusts its circulation to maintain a sustainable temperature by moving blood to and from the skin to increase or lower heat loss . In areas where water is present , they can also swim to keep their body temperatures low . The " thermoneutral zone " for the environment is around 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) , at which point the metabolism needed to maintain body temperature is minimized . The echidna is endothermic , and can maintain body temperatures of around 32 ° C. It can also reduce its metabolism and heart rate and body temperature . In addition to brief and light bouts of torpor throughout the year , the echidna enters periods during the Australian winter when it hibernates , both in cold regions and in regions with more temperate climates . During hibernation , the body temperature drops to as low as 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) . The heart rate falls to four to seven beats per minute — down from 50 – 68 at rest — and the echidna can breathe as infrequently as once every three minutes , 80 to 90 % slower than when it is active . Metabolism can drop to one @-@ eighth of the normal rate . Echidnas begin to prepare for hibernation between February and April , when they reduce their consumption and enter brief periods of torpor . Males begin hibernating first , while females that have reproduced start later . During periods of hibernation , the animals average 13 separate bouts of torpor , which are broken up by periods of arousal lasting 1 @.@ 2 days on average . These interruptions tend to coincide with warmer periods . Males end their hibernation period in mid @-@ June , while reproductive females return to full activity in July and August ; <unk> females and immature echidnas may not end hibernation until two months later . During <unk> , the body temperature can vary by 4 ° C per day . The metabolic rate is around 30 % of that of placental mammals , making it the lowest energy @-@ consuming mammal . This figure is similar to that of other animals that eat ants and termites ; burrowing animals also tend to have low metabolism generally . 
 Echidnas hibernate even though it is seemingly unnecessary for survival ; they begin their hibernation period while the weather is still warm , and food is generally always plentiful . One explanation is that echidnas maximize their foraging productivity by exercising caution with their energy reserves . Another hypothesis is that they are descended from ectothermic ancestors , but have taken to periodic endothermy for reproductive reasons , so that the young can develop more quickly . Supporters of this theory argue that males hibernate earlier than females because they finish their contribution to reproduction first , and they awake earlier to undergo spermatogenesis in preparation for mating , while females and young lag in their annual cycle . During the hibernation period , the animals stay in entirely covered shelter . 
 Short @-@ beaked echidnas can live anywhere with a good supply of food , and regularly feast on ants and termites . They are believed to locate food by smell , using sensors in the tips of their snouts , by shuffling around seemingly arbitrarily , and using their snout in a probing manner . A study of echidnas in New England ( New South Wales ) has shown that they tend to dig up scarab beetle larvae in spring when the prey are active , but eschew this prey when it is inactive , leading to the conjecture that echidnas detect prey using hearing . Vision is not believed to be significant in hunting , as blind animals have been observed to survive in the wild . 
 Echidnas use their strong claws to pull apart nests and rotting logs to gain access to their prey . They avoid ants and termites that secrete repulsive liquids , and have a preference for the eggs , pupae and winged phases of the insects . Echidnas hunt most vigorously towards the end of the southern winter and early in spring , when their fat reserves have been depleted after hibernation and nursing . At this time , ants have high body fat , and the echidna targets their mounds . The animal also hunts beetles and earthworms , providing they are small enough to fit in a 5 @-@ mm gap . The proportion of ants and termites in their diets depends on the availability of prey , and termites make up a larger part in drier areas where they are more plentiful . However , termites are preferred , if available , as their bodies contain a smaller proportion of indigestible exoskeleton . Termites from the <unk> family are avoided due to their chemical defences . Scarab beetle larvae are also a large part of the diet when and where available . In the New England study , 37 % of the food intake consisted of beetle larvae , although the echidna had to squash the prey in its snout as it ingested it , due to size . 
 Echidnas are powerful diggers , using their clawed front paws to dig out prey and create burrows for shelter . They may rapidly dig themselves into the ground if they cannot find cover when in danger . They bend their belly together to shield the soft , unprotected part , and can also urinate , giving off a pungent liquid , in an attempt to deter attackers . Males also have single small spurs on each rear leg , believed to be a defensive weapon that has since been lost through evolution . Echidnas typically try to avoid confrontation with predators . Instead , they use the colour of their spines , which is similar to the vegetation of the dry Australian environment , to avoid detection . They have good hearing and tend to become stationary if sound is detected . 
 In Australia , they are most common in forested areas with abundant , termite @-@ filled , fallen logs . In agricultural areas , they are most likely to be found in uncleared scrub ; they may be found in grassland , arid areas , and in the outer suburbs of the capital cities . Little is known about their distribution in New Guinea . They have been found in southern New Guinea between Merauke in the west and the Kelp Welsh River , east of Port Moresby , in the east , where they may be found in open woodland . 
 Echidnas have the ability to swim , and have been seen cooling off near dams during high temperatures . They have also been seen crossing streams and swimming for brief periods in seas off Kangaroo Island . They swim with only the snout above water , using it as a snorkel . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 The solitary short @-@ beaked echidna looks for a mate between May and September ; the precise timing of the mating season varies with geographic location . In the months before the mating season , the size of the male 's testes increases by a factor of three or more before spermatogenesis occurs . Both males and females give off a strong , musky odour during the mating season , by turning their cloacas inside out and wiping them on the ground , secreting a <unk> liquid believed to be an aphrodisiac . During courtship — observed for the first time in 1989 — males locate and pursue females . Trains of up to 10 males , often with the youngest and smallest male at the end of the queue , may follow a single female in a courtship ritual that may last for up to four weeks ; the duration of the courtship period varies with location . During this time , they forage for food together , and the train often changes composition , as some males leave and other join the pursuit . In cooler parts of their range , such as Tasmania , females may mate within a few hours of arousal from hibernation . 
 Before mating , the male smells the female , paying particular attention to the cloaca . This process can take a few hours , and the female can reject the suitor by rolling herself into a ball . After prodding and sniffing her back , the male is often observed to roll the female onto her side and then assume a similar position himself so the two animals are abdomen to abdomen , having dug a small crater in which to lie . They can lie with heads facing one another , or head to rear . If more than one male is in the vicinity , fighting over the female may occur . Each side of the bilaterally symmetrical , rosette @-@ like , four @-@ headed penis ( similar to that of reptiles and 7 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) in length ) is used alternately , with the other half being shut down between <unk> . Sperm bundles of around 100 each appear to confer increased sperm motility , which may provide the potential for sperm competition between males . This process takes between a half and three hours . Each mating results in the production of a single egg , and females are known to mate only once during the breeding season ; each mating is successful . 
 Fertilisation occurs in the oviduct . Gestation takes between 21 and 28 days after copulation , during which time the female constructs a nursery burrow . Following the gestation period , a single , rubbery @-@ skinned egg between 13 and 17 mm ( 0 @.@ 5 and 0 @.@ 7 in ) in diameter and 1 @.@ 5 and 2 @.@ 0 g ( 0 @.@ 053 and 0 @.@ 071 oz ) in weight is laid from her cloaca directly into a small , backward @-@ facing pouch that has developed on her abdomen . The egg is ovoid , leathery , soft , and cream @-@ coloured . Between laying and hatching , some females continue to forage for food , while others dig burrows and rest there until hatching . Ten days after it is laid , the egg hatches within the pouch . The embryo develops an " egg tooth " during incubation , which it uses to tear open the egg ; the tooth disappears soon after hatching . 
 Hatchlings are about 1 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) long and weigh between 0 @.@ 3 and 0 @.@ 4 grams ( 0 @.@ 011 and 0 @.@ 014 oz ) . After hatching , young echidnas are known as " <unk> " . Although newborns are still semitranslucent and still surrounded by the remains of the egg yolk , and the eyes are still barely developed , they already have well @-@ defined front limbs and digits that allow them to climb on their mothers ' bodies . Hatchlings attach themselves to their mothers ' milk areolae , specialised patches on the skin that secrete milk — monotremes lack nipples — through about 100 – 150 pores . The <unk> were thought to have imbibed the milk by licking the mother 's skin , but they are now thought to feed by sucking the areolae . 
 They have been observed ingesting large amounts during each feeding period , and mothers may leave them unattended in the burrow for between five and ten days to find food . Studies of captives have shown they can ingest milk once every two or three days and then increase their mass by 20 % in one milk @-@ drinking session lasting between one and two hours . Around 40 % of the milk weight is converted into body mass , and as such , a high proportion of milk is converted into growth ; a correlation with the growth of the <unk> and its mother 's size has been observed . By the time the <unk> is around 200 g ( 7 @.@ 1 oz ) , it is left in the burrow while the mother forages for food , and it reaches around 400 g ( 14 oz ) after around two months . Juveniles are eventually ejected from the pouch at around two to three months of age , because of the continuing growth in the length of their spines . During this period , the young are left in covered burrows while the mothers forage , and the young are often preyed upon . Suckling gradually decreases until juveniles are weaned at about six months of age . The duration of lactation is about 200 days , and the young leave the burrow after 180 to 205 days , usually in January or February , at which time they weigh around 800 and 1 @,@ 300 g ( 28 and 46 oz ) . There is no contact between the mother and young after this point . 
 The composition of the milk secreted by the mother changes over time . At the moment of birth , the solution is dilute and contains 1 @.@ 25 % fat , 7 @.@ 85 % protein , and 2 @.@ 85 % carbohydrates and minerals . Mature milk has much more concentrated nutrients , with 31 @.@ 0 , 12 @.@ 4 and 2 @.@ 8 % of the aforementioned nutrients , respectively . Near weaning , the protein level continues to increase ; this may be due to the need for keratin synthesis for hair and spines , to provide defences against the cold weather and predators . 
 The principal carbohydrate components of the milk are <unk> and <unk> ; it has a high iron content , which gives it a pink colour . The high iron content and low levels of free lactose differ from eutherian mammals . Lactose production is believed to proceed along the same lines as in the platypus . 
 The age of sexual maturity is uncertain , but may be four to five years . A 12 @-@ year field study found the short @-@ beaked echidna reaches sexual maturity between five and 12 years of age , and the frequency of reproduction varies from once every two years to once every six years . In the wild , the short @-@ beaked echidna has an average lifespan of 10 years , though they can live as long as 40 . The longest @-@ lived specimen reached 49 years of age in a zoo in Philadelphia . In contrast to other mammals , echidna rates of reproduction and metabolism are lower , and they live longer , as though in slow motion , something caused , at least in part , by their low body temperature , which rarely exceeds 33 ° C , even when they are not hibernating . 
 Like its fellow monotreme the platypus , the short @-@ beaked echidna has a system of multiple sex chromosomes , in which males have four Y chromosomes and five X chromosomes . Males appear to be <unk> ( figure ) , while females are <unk> . Weak identity between chromosomes results in meiotic pairing that yields only two possible genotypes of sperm , <unk> or <unk> , thus preserving this complex system . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The short @-@ beaked echidna is common throughout most of temperate Australia and lowland New Guinea , and is not listed as endangered . In Australia , it remains widespread across a wide range of conditions , including urban outskirts , coastal forests and dry inland areas , and is especially widespread in Tasmania and on Kangaroo Island . 
 The most common threats to the animal in Australia are motor vehicles and habitat destruction , which have led to localized extinctions . In Australia , the number of short @-@ beaked echidnas has been less affected by land clearance than have some other species , since they do not require a specialized habitat beyond a good supply of ants and termites . As a result , they can survive in cleared land if the cut @-@ down wood is left in the area , as the logs can be used as shelters and sources of insects . However , areas where the land has been completely cleared for single crops that can be mechanically harvested , such as wheat fields , have seen extinctions . Over a decade @-@ long period , around one @-@ third of echidna deaths reported to wildlife authorities in Victoria were due to motor vehicles , and the majority of wounded animals handed in were traffic accident victims . Studies have shown they often choose to traverse drainage culverts under roads , so this is seen as a viable means of reducing deaths on busy roads in rural areas or national parks where the animals are more common . 
 Despite their spines , they are preyed on by birds of prey , the Tasmanian devil , dingoes , snakes , lizards , goannas , cats , and foxes , although almost all victims are young . <unk> are known for their digging abilities and strong sense of smell , and are believed to have been the main predators of the echidna before the introduction of eutherian mammals . Dingoes are known to kill echidnas by rolling them over onto their backs and attacking their underbellies . A tracking study of a small number of echidnas on Kangaroo Island concluded that goannas and cats were the main predators , although foxes — absent in Kangaroo Island — would be expected to be a major threat . 
 They were eaten by indigenous Australians and the early European settlers of Australia . Hunting and eating of the echidna in New Guinea has increased over time and caused a decline in the population and distribution areas ; it is now believed to have disappeared from highland areas . The killing of echidnas was a taboo in traditional culture , but since the tribespeople have become increasingly Westernised , hunting has increased , and the animals have been more easily tracked down due to the use of dogs . 
 Infection with the introduced parasitic tapeworm <unk> <unk> is considered fatal for the echidna . This waterborne infection is contracted through sharing drinking areas with infected dogs , foxes , cats , and dingos , which do not die from the parasite . The infection is seen as being more dangerous in drier areas , where more animals are sharing fewer bodies of water , increasing the chance of transmission . The Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland runs an Australia @-@ wide survey , called Echidna Watch , to monitor the species . Echidnas are also known to be affected by other tapeworms , protozoans and herpes @-@ like viral infections , but little is known of how the infections affect the health of the animals or the populations . 
 Although it is considered easy to keep echidnas healthy in captivity , breeding is difficult , partly due to the relatively infrequent cycle . In 2009 , Perth Zoo managed to breed some captive short @-@ beaked echidnas . Until 2006 , only five zoos have managed to breed short @-@ beaked echidnas , but no captive @-@ bred young have survived to maturity . Of these five institutions , only one in Australia — Sydney 's Taronga Zoo — managed to breed echidnas , in 1977 . The other four cases occurred in the Northern Hemisphere , two in the United States and the others in western Europe . In these cases , breeding occurred six months out of phase compared to Australia , after the animals had adapted to Northern Hemisphere seasons . The failure of captive breeding programs has conservation implications for the endangered species of echidna from the genus Zaglossus , and to a lesser extent for the short @-@ beaked echidna . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Short @-@ beaked echidnas feature in the animistic culture of indigenous Australians , including their visual arts and stories . The species was a totem for some groups , including the Noongar people from Western Australia . Many groups have myths about the animal ; one myth explains it was created when a group of hungry young men went hunting at night and stumbled across a wombat . They threw spears at the wombat , but lost sight of it in the darkness . The wombat adapted the spears for its own defence and turned into an echidna . 
 The short @-@ beaked echidna is an iconic animal in contemporary Australia , notably appearing on the Australian five @-@ cent coin ( the smallest denomination ) , and on a A $ 200 commemorative coin released in 1992 . The anthropomorphic echidna Millie was a mascot for the 2000 Summer Olympics .

 = Unification of Germany = 
 The unification of Germany into a politically and administratively integrated nation state officially occurred on 18 January 1871 at the Versailles Palace in the Hall of Mirrors in France . Princes of the German states gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco @-@ Prussian War . Unofficially , the de facto transition of most of the German @-@ speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulers — but in fits and starts , as self @-@ interests of parties hampered the process over nearly a century of aristocratic experimentation from the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire ( 1806 ) and the subsequent rise of nationalism over the span of the Napoleonic Wars era . 
 Unification exposed tensions due to religious , linguistic , social , and cultural differences among the inhabitants of the new nation , suggesting that 1871 only represented one moment in a continuum of the larger unification processes . The Holy Roman Emperor had been often called " Emperor of all the Germanies " ; contemporary news accounts frequently referred to " The Germanies " , and in the empire , its members of higher nobility were referred to as " Princes of Germany " or " Princes of the Germanies " — for the lands once called East Francia had been organized and governed as pocket kingdoms since times before the rise of Charlemagne ( 800 AD ) . Given the mountainous terrains of much of the territory , it is obvious that isolated peoples would develop cultural , educational , linguistic , and religious differences over such a lengthy time period . Germany , or the Germanies , of the nineteenth century enjoyed transportation and communications improvements tying the peoples into a greater , tighter culture , as has the entire world under the influence of better communications and transportation infrastructures . 
 The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation , which had included more than 500 independent states , was effectively dissolved when Emperor Francis II abdicated ( 6 August 1806 ) during the War of the Third Coalition . Despite the legal , administrative , and political disruption associated with the end of the Empire , the people of the German @-@ speaking areas of the old Empire had a common linguistic , cultural , and legal tradition further enhanced by their shared experience in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars . European liberalism offered an intellectual basis for unification by challenging dynastic and absolutist models of social and political organization ; its German manifestation emphasized the importance of tradition , education , and linguistic unity of peoples in a geographic region . Economically , the creation of the Prussian Zollverein ( customs union ) in 1818 , and its subsequent expansion to include other states of the German Confederation , reduced competition between and within states . Emerging modes of transportation facilitated business and recreational travel , leading to contact and sometimes conflict among German speakers from throughout Central Europe . 
 The model of diplomatic spheres of influence resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1814 – 15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe . However , the negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia 's growing strength within and among the German states and so failed to foresee that Prussia would rise up to challenge Austria for leadership . This German dualism presented two solutions to the problem of unification : <unk> Lösung , the small Germany solution ( Germany without Austria ) , or <unk> Lösung , the greater Germany solution ( Germany with Austria ) . 
 Historians debate whether Otto von Bismarck — Minister President of Prussia — had a master plan to expand the North German Confederation of 1866 to include the remaining independent German states into a single entity or simply to expand the power of the Kingdom of Prussia . They conclude that factors in addition to the strength of Bismarck 's Realpolitik led a collection of early modern polities to reorganize political , economic , military , and diplomatic relationships in the 19th century . Reaction to Danish and French nationalism provided foci for expressions of German unity . Military successes — especially those of Prussia — in three regional wars generated enthusiasm and pride that politicians could harness to promote unification . This experience echoed the memory of mutual accomplishment in the Napoleonic Wars , particularly in the War of Liberation of 1813 – 14 . By establishing a Germany without Austria , the political and administrative unification in 1871 at least temporarily solved the problem of dualism .

 1848 : Revolts across the German Confederation , such as in Berlin , Dresden and Frankfurt , forced King Frederick William IV of Prussia to grant a constitution to the Confederation . In the meantime , the Frankfurt Parliament was set up in 1848 and attempted to proclaim a united Germany , but this was refused by William IV . The question of a united Germany under the <unk> solution ( to exclude Austria ) or the so @-@ called <unk> ( to include Austria ) began to surface . 
 1861 @-@ 62 : King Wilhelm I became King of Prussia and he appointed Otto von Bismarck on 23 September 1862 , Minister President and Foreign Minister , who favoured a ' blood @-@ and @-@ iron ' policy to create a united Germany under the leadership of Prussia . 
 1864 : The Danish @-@ Prussian War started as Prussia protested against Danish incorporation of Schleswig into the Kingdom of Denmark . The Austrian Empire was deliberately drawn into this war by Otto von Bismarck , Chancellor of Prussia . The Austro @-@ Prussian victory led to Schleswig , the northern part , being governed by Prussia and Holstein , the southern part , being governed by Austria , as per the Treaty of Vienna ( 1864 ) . 
 1866 : Bismarck accused the Austrian Empire of stirring up troubles in Prussian @-@ held Schleswig . Prussian troops drove into Austrian @-@ held Holstein and took control of the entire state of Schleswig @-@ Holstein . Austria declared war on Prussia and , after fighting the Austro @-@ Prussian War ( Seven Weeks ' War ) , was swiftly defeated . The Treaty of Prague ( 1866 ) formally dissolved the German Confederation and Prussia created the North German Confederation to include all Germanic states except the pro @-@ French , southern kingdoms of Bavaria , Baden and Württemberg . 
 1870 : When the French emperor , Napoleon III , demanded territories of the Rhineland in return for his neutrality amid the Austro @-@ Prussian War , Bismarck used the Spanish Succession Question ( 1868 ) and Ems Telegram ( 1870 ) as an opportunity to incorporate the southern kingdoms . Napoleon III declared war against Prussia . 
 1871 : The Franco @-@ Prussian War ended with Prussian troops capturing Paris , the capital of the Second French Empire . Bavaria , Baden , and Württemberg were incorporated into the North German Confederation in the Treaty of Frankfurt ( 1871 ) . Bismarck then proclaimed King Wilhelm I , now Kaiser Wilhelm I , as leader of the new , united Germany ( German Reich ) . With the German troops remaining in Paris , Napoleon III dissolved the French Empire and a new republic , the Third French Republic , was created under Adolphe Thiers . 
 = = German @-@ speaking Central Europe in the early nineteenth century = = 
 Prior to 1806 , German @-@ speaking Central Europe included more than 300 political entities , most of which were part of the Holy Roman Empire or the extensive Habsburg hereditary dominions . They ranged in size from the small and complex territories of the princely Hohenlohe family branches to sizable , well @-@ defined territories such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Prussia . Their governance varied : they included free imperial cities , also of different sizes , such as the powerful Augsburg and the minuscule Weil der Stadt ; ecclesiastical territories , also of varying sizes and influence , such as the wealthy Abbey of Reichenau and the powerful Archbishopric of Cologne ; and dynastic states such as Württemberg . These lands ( or parts of them — both the Habsburg domains and Hohenzollern Prussia also included territories outside the Empire structures ) made up the territory of the Holy Roman Empire , which at times included more than 1 @,@ 000 entities . Since the 15th century , with few exceptions , the Empire 's Prince @-@ electors had chosen successive heads of the House of Habsburg to hold the title of Holy Roman Emperor . Among the German @-@ speaking states , the Holy Roman Empire administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords , between jurisdictions , and within jurisdictions . Through the organization of imperial circles ( <unk> ) , groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests , including economic cooperation and military protection . 
 The War of the Second Coalition ( 1799 – 1802 ) resulted in the defeat of the imperial and allied forces by Napoleon Bonaparte . The treaties of Lunéville ( 1801 ) and Amiens ( 1802 ) and the <unk> of 1803 transferred large portions of the Holy Roman Empire to the dynastic states and secularized ecclesiastical territories . Most of the imperial cities disappeared from the political and legal landscape , and the populations living in these territories acquired new allegiances to dukes and kings . This transfer particularly enhanced the territories of Württemberg and Baden . In 1806 , after a successful invasion of Prussia and the defeat of Prussia and Russia at the joint battles of Jena @-@ Auerstedt , Napoleon dictated the Treaty of Pressburg , in which the Emperor dissolved the Holy Roman Empire . 
 = = = Rise of German nationalism under the Napoleonic System = = = 
 Under the hegemony of the French Empire ( 1804 – 1814 ) , popular German nationalism thrived in the reorganized German states . Due in part to the shared experience , albeit under French dominance , various justifications emerged to identify " Germany " as a single state . For the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte , 
 The first , original , and truly natural boundaries of states are beyond doubt their internal boundaries . Those who speak the same language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself , long before any human art begins ; they understand each other and have the power of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly ; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole . 
 A common language may have been seen to serve as the basis of a nation , but as contemporary historians of 19th @-@ century Germany noted , it took more than linguistic similarity to unify these several hundred polities . The experience of German @-@ speaking Central Europe during the years of French hegemony contributed to a sense of common cause to remove the French invaders and reassert control over their own lands . The exigencies of Napoleon 's campaigns in Poland ( 1806 – 07 ) , the Iberian Peninsula , western Germany , and his disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 disillusioned many Germans , princes and peasants alike . Napoleon 's Continental System nearly ruined the Central European economy . The invasion of Russia included nearly 125 @,@ 000 troops from German lands , and the loss of that army encouraged many Germans , both high- and low @-@ born , to envision a Central Europe free of Napoleon 's influence . The creation of such student militias as the Lützow Free Corps exemplified this tendency . 
 The debacle in Russia loosened the French grip on the German princes . In 1813 , Napoleon mounted a campaign in the German states to bring them back into the French orbit ; the subsequent War of Liberation culminated in the great Battle of Leipzig , also known as the Battle of Nations . In October 1813 , more than 500 @,@ 000 combatants engaged in ferocious fighting over three days , making it the largest European land battle of the 19th century . The engagement resulted in a decisive victory for the Coalition of Austria , Prussia , Russia , Saxony , and Sweden , and it ended French power east of the Rhine . Success encouraged the Coalition forces to pursue Napoleon across the Rhine ; his army and his government collapsed , and the victorious Coalition incarcerated Napoleon on Elba . During the brief Napoleonic restoration known as the 100 Days of 1815 , forces of the Seventh Coalition , including an Anglo @-@ Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard von Blücher , were victorious at Waterloo ( 18 June 1815 ) . The critical role played by Blücher 's troops , especially after having to retreat from the field at Ligny the day before , helped to turn the tide of combat against the French . The Prussian cavalry pursued the defeated French in the evening of 18 June , sealing the allied victory . From the German perspective , the actions of Blücher 's troops at Waterloo , and the combined efforts at Leipzig , offered a rallying point of pride and enthusiasm . This interpretation became a key building block of the Borussian myth expounded by the pro @-@ Prussian nationalist historians later in the 19th century . 
 = = = Reorganization of Central Europe and the rise of German dualism = = = 
 After Napoleon 's defeat , the Congress of Vienna established a new European political @-@ diplomatic system based on the balance of power . This system reorganized Europe into spheres of influence , which , in some cases , suppressed the aspirations of the various nationalities , including the Germans and Italians . Generally , an enlarged Prussia and the 38 other states consolidated from the mediatized territories of 1803 were confederated within the Austrian Empire 's sphere of influence . The Congress established a loose German Confederation ( 1815 – 1866 ) , headed by Austria , with a " Federal Diet " ( called the Bundestag or <unk> , an assembly of appointed leaders ) that met in the city of Frankfurt am Main . In recognition of the imperial position traditionally held by the Habsburgs , the emperors of Austria became the titular presidents of this parliament . Problematically , the built @-@ in Austrian dominance failed to take into account Prussia 's 18th century emergence in Imperial politics . Ever since the Prince @-@ Elector of Brandenburg had made himself King in Prussia at the beginning of that century , their domains had steadily increased through war and inheritance . Prussia 's consolidated strength had become especially apparent during the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years ' War under Frederick the Great . As Maria Theresa and Joseph tried to restore Habsburg hegemony in the Holy Roman Empire , Frederick countered with the creation of the <unk> ( Union of Princes ) in 1785 . Austrian @-@ Prussian dualism lay firmly rooted in old Imperial politics . Those balance of power manoeuvers were epitomized by the War of the Bavarian Succession , or " Potato War " among common folk . Even after the end of the Holy Roman Empire , this competition influenced the growth and development of nationalist movements in the 19th century . 
 = = = Problems of reorganization = = = 
 Despite the nomenclature of Diet ( Assembly or Parliament ) , this institution should in no way be construed as a broadly , or popularly , elected group of representatives . Many of the states did not have constitutions , and those that did , such as the Duchy of Baden , based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to a small portion of the male population . Furthermore , this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme . Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena @-@ Auerstedt , it had made a spectacular come @-@ back at Waterloo . Consequently , Prussian leaders expected to play a pivotal role in German politics . 
 The surge of German nationalism , stimulated by the experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with liberalism , shifted political , social , and cultural relationships within the German states . In this context , one can detect its roots in the experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period . The Burschenschaft student organizations and popular demonstrations , such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817 , contributed to a growing sense of unity among German speakers of Central Europe . Furthermore , implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered an expectation of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process , promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved . Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel , Prince von Metternich , to fear the rise of national sentiment ; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees , which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement . 
 Metternich was able to harness conservative outrage at the assassination to consolidate legislation that would further limit the press and constrain the rising liberal and nationalist movements . Consequently , these decrees drove the Burschenschaften underground , restricted the publication of nationalist materials , expanded censorship of the press and private correspondence , and limited academic speech by prohibiting university professors from encouraging nationalist discussion . The decrees were the subject of Johann Joseph von <unk> 's pamphlet <unk> [ archaic : Deutschland ] und die Revolution ( Germany and the Revolution ) ( 1820 ) , in which he concluded that it was both impossible and undesirable to repress the free utterance of public opinion by reactionary measures . 
 = = Economic collaboration : the customs union = = 
 Another institution key to unifying the German states , the Zollverein , helped to create a larger sense of economic unification . Initially conceived by the Prussian Finance Minister Hans , Count von Bülow , as a Prussian customs union in 1818 , the Zollverein linked the many Prussian and Hohenzollern territories . Over the ensuing thirty years ( and more ) other German states joined . The Union helped to reduce protectionist barriers among the German states , especially improving the transport of raw materials and finished goods , making it both easier to move goods across territorial borders and less costly to buy , transport , and sell raw materials . This was particularly important for the emerging industrial centers , most of which were located in the Rhineland , the Saar , and the Ruhr valleys . 
 = = = Roads and railways = = = 
 By the early 19th century , German roads had deteriorated to an appalling extent . Travelers , both foreign and local , complained bitterly about the state of the <unk> , the military roads previously maintained for the ease of moving troops . As German states ceased to be a military crossroads , however , the roads improved ; the length of hard – surfaced roads in Prussia increased from 3 @,@ 800 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 400 mi ) in 1816 to 16 @,@ 600 kilometres ( 10 @,@ 300 mi ) in 1852 , helped in part by the invention of macadam . By 1835 , Heinrich von <unk> wrote that roads were the " veins and arteries of the body politic ... " and predicted that they would promote freedom , independence and prosperity . As people moved around , they came into contact with others , on trains , at hotels , in restaurants , and for some , at fashionable resorts such as the spa in Baden @-@ Baden . Water transportation also improved . The blockades on the Rhine had been removed by Napoleon 's orders , but by the 1820s , steam engines freed riverboats from the cumbersome system of men and animals that towed them upstream . By 1846 , 180 steamers plied German rivers and Lake Constance , and a network of canals extended from the Danube , the Weser , and the Elbe rivers . 
 As important as these improvements were , they could not compete with the impact of the railway . German economist Friedrich List called the railways and the Customs Union " Siamese Twins " , emphasizing their important relationship to one another . He was not alone : the poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote a poem in which he extolled the virtues of the Zollverein , which he began with a list of commodities that had contributed more to German unity than politics or diplomacy . Historians of the Second Empire later regarded the railways as the first indicator of a unified state ; the patriotic novelist , Wilhelm Raabe , wrote : " The German empire was founded with the construction of the first railway ... " Not everyone greeted the iron monster with enthusiasm . The Prussian king Frederick William III saw no advantage in traveling from Berlin to Potsdam a few hours faster , and Metternich refused to ride in one at all . Others wondered if the railways were an " evil " that threatened the landscape : Nikolaus Lenau 's 1838 poem An den <unk> ( To Spring ) bemoaned the way trains destroyed the pristine quietude of German forests . 
 The Bavarian Ludwig Railway , which was the first passenger or freight rail line in the German lands , connected Nuremberg and Fürth in 1835 . Although it was 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) long and only operated in daylight , it proved both profitable and popular . Within three years , 141 kilometres ( 88 mi ) of track had been laid , by 1840 , 462 kilometres ( 287 mi ) , and by 1860 , 11 @,@ 157 kilometres ( 6 @,@ 933 mi ) . Lacking a geographically central organizing feature ( such as a national capital ) , the rails were laid in webs , linking towns and markets within regions , regions within larger regions , and so on . As the rail network expanded , it became cheaper to transport goods : in 1840 , 18 <unk> per ton per kilometer and in 1870 , five <unk> . The effects of the railway were immediate . For example , raw materials could travel up and down the Ruhr Valley without having to unload and reload . Railway lines encouraged economic activity by creating demand for commodities and by facilitating commerce . In 1850 , inland shipping carried three times more freight than railroads ; by 1870 , the situation was reversed , and railroads carried four times more . Rail travel changed how cities looked and how people traveled . Its impact reached throughout the social order , affecting the highest born to the lowest . Although some of the outlying German provinces were not serviced by rail until the 1890s , the majority of the population , manufacturing centers , and production centers were linked to the rail network by 1865 . 
 = = = Geography , patriotism and language = = = 
 As travel became easier , faster , and less expensive , Germans started to see unity in factors other than their language . The Brothers Grimm , who compiled a massive dictionary known as The Grimm , also assembled a compendium of folk tales and fables , which highlighted the story @-@ telling parallels between different regions . Karl Baedeker wrote guidebooks to different cities and regions of Central Europe , indicating places to stay , sites to visit , and giving a short history of castles , battlefields , famous buildings , and famous people . His guides also included distances , roads to avoid , and hiking paths to follow . 
 The words of August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben expressed not only the linguistic unity of the German people but also their geographic unity . In Deutschland , Deutschland über Alles , officially called Das Lied der Deutschen ( " The Song of the Germans " ) , Fallersleben called upon sovereigns throughout the German states to recognize the unifying characteristics of the German people . Such other patriotic songs as " Die Wacht am Rhein " ( " The Watch on the Rhine " ) by Max <unk> began to focus attention on geographic space , not limiting " German @-@ ness " to a common language . <unk> wrote " The Watch on the Rhine " in a specific patriotic response to French assertions that the Rhine was France 's " natural " eastern boundary . In the refrain , " Dear fatherland , dear fatherland , put your mind to rest / The watch stands true on the Rhine " , and in such other patriotic poetry as Nicholaus Becker 's " Das <unk> " ( " The Rhine " ) , Germans were called upon to defend their territorial homeland . In 1807 , Alexander von Humboldt argued that national character reflected geographic influence , linking landscape to people . Concurrent with this idea , movements to preserve old fortresses and historic sites emerged , and these particularly focused on the Rhineland , the site of so many confrontations with France and Spain . 
 = = Vormärz and nineteenth century liberalism = = 
 The period of Austrian and Prussian police @-@ states and vast censorship before the Revolutions of 1848 in Germany later became widely known as the Vormärz , the " before March " , referring to March 1848 . During this period , European liberalism gained momentum ; the agenda included economic , social , and political issues . Most European liberals in the Vormärz sought unification under nationalist principles , promoted the transition to capitalism , sought the expansion of male suffrage , among other issues . Their " <unk> " depended upon where they stood on the spectrum of male suffrage : the wider the definition of suffrage , the more radical . 
 = = = Hambach Festival : liberal nationalism and conservative response = = = 
 Despite considerable conservative reaction , ideas of unity joined with notions of popular sovereignty in German @-@ speaking lands . The Hambach Festival ( <unk> Fest ) in May 1832 was attended by a crowd of more than 30 @,@ 000 . Promoted as a county fair , its participants celebrated fraternity , liberty , and national unity . <unk> gathered in the town below and marched to the ruins of Hambach Castle on the heights above the small town of Hambach , in the Palatinate province of Bavaria . Carrying flags , beating drums , and singing , the participants took the better part of the morning and mid @-@ day to arrive at the castle grounds , where they listened to speeches by nationalist orators from across the conservative to radical political spectrum . The overall content of the speeches suggested a fundamental difference between the German nationalism of the 1830s and the French nationalism of the July Revolution : the focus of German nationalism lay in the education of the people ; once the populace was educated as to what was needed , they would accomplish it . The Hambach rhetoric emphasized the overall peaceable nature of German nationalism : the point was not to build barricades , a very " French " form of nationalism , but to build emotional bridges between groups . 
 As he had done in 1819 , after the Kotzebue assassination , Metternich used the popular demonstration at Hambach to push conservative social policy . The " Six Articles " of 28 June 1832 primarily reaffirmed the principle of monarchical authority . On 5 July , the Frankfurt Diet voted for an additional 10 articles , which reiterated existing rules on censorship , restricted political organizations , and limited other public activity . Furthermore , the member states agreed to send military assistance to any government threatened by unrest . Prince Wrede led half of the Bavarian army to the Palatinate to " subdue " the province . Several hapless Hambach speakers were arrested , tried and imprisoned ; one , Karl Heinrich Brüggemann ( 1810 – 1887 ) , a law student and representative of the secretive Burschenschaft , was sent to Prussia , where he was first condemned to death , but later pardoned . 
 = = = Liberalism and the response to economic problems = = = 
 Several other factors complicated the rise of nationalism in the German states . The man @-@ made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation , particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians , and socio @-@ economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land @-@ owning and aristocratic interests . Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s , and again in the 1840s , and a food crisis in the 1840s . Further complications emerged as a result of a shift in industrialization and manufacturing ; as people sought jobs , they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities , returning for a day and a half on weekends . 
 The economic , social and cultural dislocation of ordinary people , the economic hardship of an economy in transition , and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe . The failure of most of the governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid @-@ 1840s , caused by the potato blight ( related to the Great Irish Famine ) and several seasons of bad weather , encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems . Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest , political and social agitation among the working classes , and the disaffection of the intelligentsia . No amount of censorship , fines , imprisonment , or banishment , it seemed , could stem the criticism . Furthermore , it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification ; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification . 
 = = First efforts at unification = = 
 Crucially , both the Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any clear @-@ cut program of unification . At Hambach , the positions of the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas . Held together only by the idea of unification , their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk ( the people ) , if properly educated , would bring about unification on their own . Grand speeches , flags , exuberant students , and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political , bureaucratic , or administrative apparatus . While many spoke about the need for a constitution , no such document appeared from the discussions . In 1848 , nationalists sought to remedy that problem . 
 = = = German revolutions of 1848 and the Frankfurt Parliament = = = 
 The widespread – mainly German – revolutions of 1848 – 49 sought unification of Germany under a single constitution . The revolutionaries pressured various state governments , particularly those in the Rhineland , for a parliamentary assembly that would have the responsibility to draft a constitution . Ultimately , many of the left @-@ wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish universal male suffrage , a permanent national parliament , and a unified Germany , possibly under the leadership of the Prussian king . This seemed to be the most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states , as well as the largest in geographic size . Generally , center @-@ right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and potentially , a form of loose unification . Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections , based on different voting qualifications , such as the Prussian three @-@ class franchise , which granted to some electoral groups — chiefly the wealthier , landed ones — greater representative power . 
 On 27 March 1849 , the Frankfurt Parliament passed the <unk> ( Constitution of St. Paul 's Church ) and offered the title of Kaiser ( Emperor ) to the Prussian king Frederick William IV the next month . He refused for a variety of reasons . Publicly , he replied that he could not accept a crown without the consent of the actual states , by which he meant the princes . Privately , he feared opposition from the other German princes and military intervention from Austria or Russia . He also held a fundamental distaste for the idea of accepting a crown from a popularly elected parliament : he would not accept a crown of " clay " . Despite franchise requirements that often perpetuated many of the problems of sovereignty and political participation liberals sought to overcome , the Frankfurt Parliament did manage to draft a constitution and reach an agreement on the <unk> solution . While the liberals failed to achieve the unification they sought , they did manage to gain a partial victory by working with the German princes on many constitutional issues and collaborating with them on reforms . 
 = = = 1848 and the Frankfurt Parliament in retrospective analysis = = = 
 Scholars of German history have engaged in decades of debate over how the successes and failures of the Frankfurt Parliament contribute to the historiographical explanations of German nation building . One school of thought , which emerged after The Great War and gained momentum in the aftermath of World War II , maintains that the failure of German liberals in the Frankfurt Parliament led to bourgeoisie compromise with conservatives ( especially the conservative Junker landholders ) , which subsequently led to the so @-@ called Sonderweg ( distinctive path ) of 20th @-@ century German history . Failure to achieve unification in 1848 , this argument holds , resulted in the late formation of the nation @-@ state in 1871 , which in turn delayed the development of positive national values . Hitler often called on the German public to sacrifice all for the cause of their great nation , but his regime did not create German nationalism : it merely capitalized on an intrinsic cultural value of German society that still remains prevalent even to this day . Furthermore , this argument maintains , the " failure " of 1848 reaffirmed latent aristocratic longings among the German middle class ; consequently , this group never developed a self @-@ conscious program of modernization . 
 More recent scholarship has rejected this idea , claiming that Germany did not have an actual " distinctive path " any more than any other nation , a historiographic idea known as exceptionalism . Instead , modern historians claim 1848 saw specific achievements by the liberal politicians . Many of their ideas and programs were later incorporated into Bismarck 's social programs ( e.g. , social insurance , education programs , and wider definitions of suffrage ) . In addition , the notion of a distinctive path relies upon the underlying assumption that some other nation 's path ( in this case , the United Kingdom 's ) is the accepted norm . This new argument further challenges the norms of the British @-@ centric model of development : studies of national development in Britain and other " normal " states ( e.g. , France or the United States ) have suggested that even in these cases , the modern nation @-@ state did not develop evenly . Nor did it develop particularly early , being rather a largely mid @-@ to @-@ late @-@ 19th @-@ century phenomenon . Since the end of the 1990s , this view has become widely accepted , although some historians still find the Sonderweg analysis helpful in understanding the period of National Socialism . 
 = = = Problem of spheres of influence : The Erfurt Union and the Punctation of Olmütz = = = 
 After the Frankfurt Parliament disbanded , Frederick William IV , under the influence of General Joseph Maria von <unk> , supported the establishment of the Erfurt Union — a federation of German states , excluding Austria — by the free agreement of the German princes . This limited union under Prussia would have almost entirely eliminated Austrian influence on the other German states . Combined diplomatic pressure from Austria and Russia ( a guarantor of the 1815 agreements that established European spheres of influence ) forced Prussia to relinquish the idea of the Erfurt Union at a meeting in the small town of Olmütz in Moravia . In November 1850 , the Prussians — specifically <unk> and Frederick William — agreed to the restoration of the German Confederation under Austrian leadership . This became known as the Punctation of Olmütz , but among Prussians it was known as the " <unk> of Olmütz . " 
 Although seemingly minor events , the Erfurt Union proposal and the Punctation of Olmütz brought the problems of influence in the German states into sharp focus . The question became not a matter of if but rather when unification would occur , and when was contingent upon strength . One of the former Frankfurt Parliament members , Johann Gustav <unk> , summed up the problem : 
 We cannot conceal the fact that the whole German question is a simple alternative between Prussia and Austria . In these states , German life has its positive and negative poles — in the former , all the interests [ that ] are national and <unk> , in the latter , all that are dynastic and destructive . The German question is not a constitutional question but a question of power ; and the Prussian monarchy is now wholly German , while that of Austria cannot be . 
 Unification under these conditions raised a basic diplomatic problem . The possibility of German ( or Italian ) unification would overturn the overlapping spheres of influence system created in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna . The principal architects of this convention , Metternich , Castlereagh , and Tsar Alexander ( with his foreign secretary Count Karl Nesselrode ) , had conceived of and organized a Europe balanced and guaranteed by four " great powers " : Great Britain , France , Russia , and Austria , with each power having a geographic sphere of influence . France 's sphere included the Iberian Peninsula and a share of influence in the Italian states . Russia 's included the eastern regions of Central Europe and a balancing influence in the Balkans . Austria 's sphere expanded throughout much of the Central European territories formerly held by the Holy Roman Empire . Britain 's sphere was the rest of the world , especially the seas . 
 This sphere of influence system depended upon the fragmentation of the German and Italian states , not their consolidation . Consequently , a German nation united under one banner presented significant questions . There was no readily applicable definition for who the German people would be or how far the borders of a German nation would stretch . There was also uncertainty as to who would best lead and defend " Germany " , however it was defined . Different groups offered different solutions to this problem . In the <unk> ( " Lesser Germany " ) solution , the German states would be united under the leadership of the Prussian Hohenzollerns ; in the Grossdeutschland ( " Greater Germany " ) solution , the German states would be united under the leadership of the Austrian Habsburgs . This controversy , the latest phase of the German dualism debate that had dominated the politics of the German states and Austro @-@ Prussian diplomacy since the 1701 creation of the Kingdom of Prussia , would come to a head during the following twenty years . 
 = = = External expectations of a unified Germany = = = 
 Other nationalists had high hopes for the German unification movement , and the frustration with lasting German unification after 1850 seemed to set the national movement back . Revolutionaries associated national unification with progress . As Giuseppe Garibaldi wrote to German revolutionary Karl Blind on 10 April 1865 , " The progress of humanity seems to have come to a halt , and you with your superior intelligence will know why . The reason is that the world lacks a nation [ that ] possesses true leadership . Such leadership , of course , is required not to dominate other peoples but to lead them along the path of duty , to lead them toward the brotherhood of nations where all the barriers erected by egoism will be destroyed . " Garibaldi looked to Germany for the " kind of leadership [ that ] , in the true tradition of medieval chivalry , would devote itself to redressing wrongs , supporting the weak , sacrificing momentary gains and material advantage for the much finer and more satisfying achievement of relieving the suffering of our fellow men . We need a nation courageous enough to give us a lead in this direction . It would rally to its cause all those who are suffering wrong or who aspire to a better life and all those who are now enduring foreign oppression . " 
 German unification had also been viewed as a prerequisite for the creation of a European federation , which Giuseppe Mazzini and other European patriots had been promoting for more than three decades : 
 In the spring of 1834 , while at Berne , Mazzini and a dozen refugees from Italy , Poland and Germany founded a new association with the grandiose name of Young Europe . Its basic , and equally grandiose idea , was that , as the French Revolution of 1789 had enlarged the concept of individual liberty , another revolution would now be needed for national liberty ; and his vision went further because he hoped that in the no doubt distant future free nations might combine to form a loosely federal Europe with some kind of federal assembly to regulate their common interests . [ ... ] His intention was nothing less than to overturn the European settlement agreed [ to ] in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna , which had reestablished an oppressive hegemony of a few great powers and blocked the emergence of smaller nations . [ ... ] Mazzini hoped , but without much confidence , that his vision of a league or society of independent nations would be realized in his own lifetime . In practice Young Europe lacked the money and popular support for more than a short @-@ term existence . Nevertheless he always remained faithful to the ideal of a united continent for which the creation of individual nations would be an indispensable preliminary . 
 = = = Prussia 's growing strength : Realpolitik = = = 
 King Frederick William IV suffered a stroke in 1857 and could no longer rule . This led to his brother William becoming Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1858 . Meanwhile , Helmuth von Moltke had become chief of the Prussian General Staff in 1857 , and Albrecht von Roon would become Prussian Minister of War in 1859 . This shuffling of authority within the Prussian military establishment would have important consequences . Von Roon and William ( who took an active interest in military structures ) began reorganizing the Prussian army , while Moltke redesigned the strategic defense of Prussia by streamlining operational command . Prussian army reforms ( especially how to pay for them ) caused a constitutional crisis beginning in 1860 because both parliament and William — via his minister of war — wanted control over the military budget . William , crowned King Wilhelm I in 1861 , appointed Otto von Bismarck to the position of Minister @-@ President of Prussia in 1862 . Bismarck resolved the crisis in favor of the war minister . 
 The Crimean War of 1854 – 55 and the Italian War of 1859 disrupted relations among Great Britain , France , Austria , and Russia . In the aftermath of this disarray , the convergence of von Moltke 's operational redesign , von Roon and Wilhelm 's army restructure , and Bismarck 's diplomacy influenced the realignment of the European balance of power . Their combined agendas established Prussia as the leading German power through a combination of foreign diplomatic triumphs — backed up by the possible use of Prussian military might — and an internal <unk> tempered by pragmatism , which came to be known as Realpolitik . 
 Bismarck expressed the essence of Realpolitik in his subsequently famous " Blood and Iron " speech to the Budget Committee of the Prussian Chamber of Deputies on 30 September 1862 , shortly after he became Minister President : " The great questions of the time will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions — that was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849 — but by iron and blood . " Bismarck 's words , " iron and blood " ( or " blood and iron " , as often attributed ) , have often been misappropriated as evidence of a German lust for blood and power . First , the phrase from his speech " the great questions of time will not be resolved by speeches and majority decisions " is often interpreted as a repudiation of the political process — a repudiation Bismarck did not himself advocate . Second , his emphasis on blood and iron did not imply simply the unrivaled military might of the Prussian army but rather two important aspects : the ability of the assorted German states to produce iron and other related war materials and the willingness to use those war materials if necessary . 
 = = Founding a unified state = = 
 There is , in political geography , no Germany proper to speak of . There are Kingdoms and Grand Duchies , and Duchies and Principalities , inhabited by Germans , and each [ is ] separately ruled by an independent sovereign with all the machinery of State . Yet there is a natural undercurrent tending to a national feeling and toward a union of the Germans into one great nation , ruled by one common head as a national unit . 
 – article from The New York Times published in July 1 , 1866 
 The need for both iron and blood soon became apparent . By 1862 , when Bismarck made his speech , the idea of a German nation @-@ state in the peaceful spirit of Pan @-@ Germanism had shifted from the liberal and democratic character of 1848 to accommodate Bismarck 's more conservative Realpolitik . Ever the pragmatist , Bismarck understood the possibilities , obstacles , and advantages of a unified state . He also understood the importance of linking that state to the Hohenzollern dynasty , which for some historians remains one of Bismarck 's primary contributions to the creation of the German Empire in 1871 . While the conditions of the treaties binding the various German states to one another prohibited Bismarck from taking unilateral action , the politician and diplomat in him realized the impracticality of such an action . In order to get the German states to unify , Bismarck needed a single , outside enemy that would declare war on one of the German states first , thus providing a casus belli to rally all Germans behind . This opportunity arose with the outbreak of the Franco @-@ Prussian War in 1870 . Historians have long debated Bismarck 's role in the events leading up to the war . The traditional view , promulgated in large part by late 19th and early 20th century pro @-@ Prussian historians , maintains that Bismarck 's intent was always German unification . Post @-@ 1945 historians , however , see more short @-@ term opportunism and cynicism in Bismarck 's manipulation of the circumstances to create a war , rather than a grand scheme to unify a nation @-@ state . Regardless , Bismarck was neither villain nor saint : by manipulating events of 1866 and 1870 , he demonstrated the political and diplomatic skill that had caused Wilhelm to turn to him in 1862 . 
 Three episodes proved fundamental to the administrative and political unification of Germany . First , the death without male heirs of Frederick VII of Denmark led to the Second War of Schleswig in 1864 . Second , the unification of Italy provided Prussia an ally against Austria in the Austro @-@ Prussian War of 1866 . Finally , France — fearing Hohenzollern encirclement — declared war on Prussia in 1870 , resulting in the Franco @-@ Prussian War . Through a combination of Bismarck 's diplomacy and political leadership , von Roon 's military reorganization , and von Moltke 's military strategy , Prussia demonstrated that none of the European signatories of the 1815 peace treaty could guarantee Austria 's sphere of influence in Central Europe , thus achieving Prussian hegemony in Germany and ending the dualism debate . 
 = = = The Schleswig @-@ Holstein Question = = = 
 The first episode in the saga of German unification under Bismarck came with the Schleswig @-@ Holstein Question . On 15 November 1863 , King Christian IX of Denmark became king of Denmark and duke of Schleswig and Holstein . On 18 November 1863 , he signed the Danish November Constitution and declared the Duchy of Schleswig a part of Denmark . The German Confederation saw this act as a violation of the London Protocol of 1852 , which emphasized the status of the kingdom of Denmark as distinct from the independent duchies of Schleswig and Holstein . The populations of Schleswig and Holstein , furthermore , greatly valued this separate status . The German Confederation could use the ethnicities of these duchies as a rallying cry : large portions of both Schleswig and Holstein were of German origin and spoke German in everyday life ( though Schleswig had a sizable Danish minority ) . Diplomatic attempts to have the November Constitution repealed collapsed , and fighting began when Prussian and Austrian troops crossed the border into Schleswig on 1 February 1864 . Initially , the Danes attempted to defend their country using an ancient earthen wall known as the Danevirke , but this proved futile . The Danes were no match for the combined Prussian and Austrian forces , and they could not rely on help from their allies in the other Scandinavian states because Denmark had nullified its alliance rights by violating the London Protocol . The Needle Gun , one of the first bolt action rifles to be used in conflict , aided the Prussians in both this war and the Austro @-@ Prussian War two years later . The rifle enabled a Prussian soldier to fire five shots while lying prone , while its muzzle @-@ loading counterpart could only fire one shot and had to be reloaded while standing . The Second Schleswig War resulted in victory for the combined armies of Prussia and Austria , and the two countries won control of Schleswig and Holstein in the concluding peace of Vienna , signed on 30 October 1864 . 
 = = = War between Austria and Prussia , 1866 = = = 
 The second episode in Bismarck 's unification efforts occurred in 1866 . In concert with the newly formed Italy , Bismarck created a diplomatic environment in which Austria declared war on Prussia . The dramatic prelude to the war occurred largely in Frankfurt , where the two powers claimed to speak for all the German states in the parliament . In April 1866 , the Prussian representative in Florence signed a secret agreement with the Italian government , committing each state to assist the other in a war against Austria . The next day , the Prussian delegate to the Frankfurt assembly presented a plan calling for a national constitution , a directly elected national Diet , and universal suffrage . German liberals were justifiably skeptical of this plan , having witnessed Bismarck 's difficult and ambiguous relationship with the Prussian Landtag ( State Parliament ) , a relationship characterized by Bismarck 's cajoling and riding roughshod over the representatives . These skeptics saw the proposal as a ploy to enhance Prussian power rather than a progressive agenda of reform . 
 = = = = Choosing sides = = = = 
 The debate over the proposed national constitution became moot when news of Italian troop movements in Tyrol and near the Venetian border reached Vienna in April 1866 . The Austrian government ordered partial mobilization in the southern regions ; the Italians responded by ordering full mobilization . Despite calls for rational thought and action , Italy , Prussia , and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict . On 1 May , Wilhelm gave von Moltke command over the Prussian armed forces , and the next day he began full @-@ scale mobilization . 
 In the Diet , the group of middle @-@ sized states , known as <unk> ( Bavaria , Württemberg , the grand duchies of Baden and Hesse , and the duchies of Saxony – Weimar , Saxony – Meiningen , Saxony – Coburg , and Nassau ) , supported complete demobilization within the Confederation . These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises and subtle ( or outright ) threats Bismarck used to try to gain their support against the Habsburgs . The Prussian war cabinet understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout : the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg @-@ Schwerin and Mecklenburg @-@ Strelitz . They also understood that Prussia 's only ally abroad was Italy . 
 Opposition to Prussia 's strong @-@ armed tactics surfaced in other social and political groups . Throughout the German states , city councils , liberal parliamentary members who favored a unified state , and chambers of commerce — which would see great benefits from unification — opposed any war between Prussia and Austria . They believed any such conflict would only serve the interests of royal dynasties . Their own interests , which they understood as " civil " or " bourgeois " , seemed irrelevant . Public opinion also opposed Prussian domination . Catholic populations along the Rhine — especially in such cosmopolitan regions as Cologne and in the heavily populated Ruhr Valley — continued to support Austria . By late spring , most important states opposed Berlin 's effort to reorganize the German states by force . The Prussian cabinet saw German unity as an issue of power and a question of who had the strength and will to wield that power . Meanwhile , the liberals in the Frankfurt assembly saw German unity as a process of negotiation that would lead to the distribution of power among the many parties . 
 = = = = Austria isolated = = = = 
 Although several German states initially sided with Austria , they stayed on the defensive and failed to take effective initiatives against Prussian troops . The Austrian army therefore faced the technologically superior Prussian army with support only from Saxony . France promised aid , but it came late and was insufficient . Complicating the situation for Austria , the Italian mobilization on Austria 's southern border required a diversion of forces away from battle with Prussia to fight the Third Italian War of Independence on a second front in Venetia and on the Adriatic sea . The day @-@ long Battle of Königgrätz , near the village of Sadová , gave Prussia an uncontested and decisive victory . 
 = = = Realpolitik and the North German Confederation = = = 
 A quick peace was essential to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria 's side . Prussia annexed Hanover , Hesse @-@ Kassel , Nassau , and the city of Frankfurt . Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty . The states south of the Main River ( Baden , Württemberg , and Bavaria ) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia 's sphere of influence . Austria , and most of its allies , were excluded from the North German Confederation . 
 The end of Austrian dominance of the German states shifted Austria 's attention to the Balkans . In 1867 , the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph accepted a settlement ( the Austro @-@ Hungarian Compromise of 1867 ) in which he gave his Hungarian holdings equal status with his Austrian domains , creating the Dual Monarchy of Austria @-@ Hungary . The Peace of Prague ( 1866 ) offered lenient terms to Austria , in which Austria 's relationship with the new nation @-@ state of Italy underwent major restructuring ; although the Austrians were far more successful in the military field against Italian troops , the monarchy lost the important province of Venetia . The Habsburgs ceded Venetia to France , which then formally transferred control to Italy . The French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded Revanche pour Sadová ( " Revenge for <unk> " ) , illustrating anti @-@ Prussian sentiment in France — a problem that would accelerate in the months leading up to the Franco @-@ Prussian War . The Austro @-@ Prussian War also damaged relations with the French government . At a meeting in Biarritz in September 1865 with Napoleon III , Bismarck had let it be understood ( or Napoleon had thought he understood ) that France might annex parts of Belgium and Luxembourg in exchange for its neutrality in the war . These annexations did not happen , resulting in animosity from Napoleon towards Bismarck . 
 The reality of defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of internal divisions , local autonomy , and liberalism . The new North German Confederation had its own constitution , flag , and governmental and administrative structures . Through military victory , Prussia under Bismarck 's influence had overcome Austria 's active resistance to the idea of a unified Germany . Austria 's influence over the German states may have been broken , but the war also splintered the spirit of pan @-@ German unity : most of the German states resented Prussian power politics . 
 = = War with France = = 
 By 1870 three of the important lessons of the Austro @-@ Prussian war had become apparent . The first lesson was that , through force of arms , a powerful state could challenge the old alliances and spheres of influence established in 1815 . Second , through diplomatic maneuvering , a skillful leader could create an environment in which a rival state would declare war first , thus forcing states allied with the " victim " of external aggression to come to the leader 's aid . Finally , as Prussian military capacity far exceeded that of Austria , Prussia was clearly the only state within the Confederation ( or among the German states generally ) capable of protecting all of them from potential interference or aggression . In 1866 , most mid @-@ sized German states had opposed Prussia , but by 1870 these states had been coerced and coaxed into mutually protective alliances with Prussia . In the event that a European state declared war on one of their members , they all would come to the defense of the attacked state . With skillful manipulation of European politics , Bismarck created a situation in which France would play the role of aggressor in German affairs , while Prussia would play that of the protector of German rights and liberties . 
 = = = Spheres of influence fall apart in Spain = = = 
 At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 , Metternich and his conservative allies had reestablished the Spanish monarchy under King Ferdinand VII . Over the following forty years , the great powers supported the Spanish monarchy , but events in 1868 would further test the old system . A revolution in Spain overthrew Queen Isabella II , and the throne remained empty while Isabella lived in sumptuous exile in Paris . The Spanish , looking for a suitable Catholic successor , had offered the post to three European princes , each of whom was rejected by Napoleon III , who served as regional power @-@ broker . Finally , in 1870 the Regency offered the crown to Leopold of Hohenzollern @-@ Sigmaringen , a prince of the Catholic cadet Hohenzollern line . The ensuing furor has been dubbed by historians as the Hohenzollern candidature . 
 Over the next few weeks , the Spanish offer turned into the talk of Europe . Bismarck encouraged Leopold to accept the offer . A successful installment of a Hohenzollern @-@ Sigmaringen king in Spain would mean that two countries on either side of France would both have German kings of Hohenzollern descent . This may have been a pleasing prospect for Bismarck , but it was unacceptable to either Napoleon III or to Agenor , duc de Gramont , his minister of foreign affairs . Gramont wrote a sharply formulated ultimatum to Wilhelm , as head of the Hohenzollern family , stating that if any Hohenzollern prince should accept the crown of Spain , the French government would respond — although he left ambiguous the nature of such response . The prince withdrew as a candidate , thus defusing the crisis , but the French ambassador to Berlin would not let the issue lie . He approached the Prussian king directly while Wilhelm was vacationing in Ems Spa , demanding that the King release a statement saying he would never support the installation of a Hohenzollern on the throne of Spain . Wilhelm refused to give such an encompassing statement , and he sent Bismarck a dispatch by telegram describing the French demands . Bismarck used the king 's telegram , called the Ems Dispatch , as a template for a short statement to the press . With its wording shortened and sharpened by Bismarck — and further alterations made in the course of its translation by the French agency Havas — the Ems Dispatch raised an angry furor in France . The French public , still aggravated over the defeat at Sadová , demanded war . 
 = = = Military operations = = = 
 Napoleon III had tried to secure territorial concessions from both sides before and after the Austro @-@ Prussian War , but despite his role as mediator during the peace negotiations , he ended up with nothing . He then hoped that Austria would join in a war of revenge and that its former allies — particularly the southern German states of Baden , Württemberg , and Bavaria — would join in the cause . This hope would prove futile since the 1866 treaty came into effect and united all German states militarily — if not happily — to fight against France . Instead of a war of revenge against Prussia , supported by various German allies , France engaged in a war against all of the German states without any allies of its own . The reorganization of the military by von Roon and the operational strategy of Moltke combined against France to great effect . The speed of Prussian mobilization astonished the French , and the Prussian ability to concentrate power at specific points — reminiscent of Napoleon I 's strategies seventy years earlier — overwhelmed French mobilization . Utilizing their efficiently laid rail grid , Prussian troops were delivered to battle areas rested and prepared to fight , whereas French troops had to march for considerable distances to reach combat zones . After a number of battles , notably <unk> , Wörth , Mars la Tour , and <unk> , the Prussians defeated the main French armies and advanced on the primary city of Metz and the French capital of Paris . They captured Napoleon III and took an entire army as prisoners at Sedan on 1 September 1870 . 
 = = = Proclamation of the German Empire = = = 
 The humiliating capture of the French emperor and the loss of the French army itself , which marched into captivity at a makeshift camp in the Saarland ( " Camp Misery " ) , threw the French government into turmoil ; Napoleon 's energetic opponents overthrew his government and proclaimed the Third Republic . The German High Command expected an overture of peace from the French , but the new republic refused to surrender . The Prussian army invested Paris and held it under siege until mid @-@ January , with the city being " ineffectually bombarded " . On 18 January 1871 , the German princes and senior military commanders proclaimed Wilhelm " German Emperor " in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles . Under the subsequent Treaty of Frankfurt , France relinquished most of its traditionally German regions ( Alsace and the German @-@ speaking part of Lorraine ) ; paid an indemnity , calculated ( on the basis of population ) as the precise equivalent of the indemnity that Napoleon Bonaparte imposed on Prussia in 1807 ; and accepted German administration of Paris and most of northern France , with " German troops to be withdrawn stage by stage with each installment of the indemnity payment " . 
 = = = Importance in the unification process = = = 
 Victory in the Franco @-@ Prussian War proved the capstone of the nationalist issue . In the first half of the 1860s , Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states ; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home . In responding to the Schleswig @-@ Holstein Question , they both proved equally diligent in doing so . After the victory over Austria in 1866 , Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests , while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans . The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level . With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser , Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire . The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 ( signed 26 February 1871 ; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871 ) , which formally ended the war . Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state , he had not done it alone . Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein . The difficulties of the Vormärz , the impact of the 1848 liberals , the importance of von Roon 's military reorganization , and von Moltke 's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification .

 The new German Empire included 25 states , three of them Hanseatic cities . It realized the <unk> Lösung ( " Lesser German Solution " , with the exclusion of Austria ) as opposed to a <unk> Lösung or " Greater German Solution " , which would have included Austria . Unifying various states into one nation required more than some military victories , however much these might have boosted morale . It also required a rethinking of political , social , and cultural behaviors and the construction of new metaphors about " us " and " them " . Who were the new members of this new nation ? What did they stand for ? How were they to be organized ? 
 = = = Constituent states of the Empire = = = 
 Though often characterized as a federation of monarchs , the German Empire , strictly speaking , federated a group of 26 states . 
 = = = Political structure of the Empire = = = 
 The 1866 North German Constitution became ( with some semantic adjustments ) the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire . With this constitution , the new Germany acquired some democratic features : notably the Imperial Diet , which — in contrast to the parliament of Prussia — gave citizens representation on the basis of elections by direct and equal suffrage of all males who had reached the age of 25 . Furthermore , elections were generally free of chicanery , engendering pride in the national parliament . However , legislation required the consent of the Bundesrat , the federal council of deputies from the states , in and over which Prussia had a powerful influence ; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto . Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies , with executive power vested in the Prussian King as Kaiser , who appointed the federal chancellor . The chancellor was accountable solely to , and served entirely at the discretion of , the Emperor . Officially , the chancellor functioned as a one @-@ man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs ; in practice , the State Secretaries ( bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance , war , foreign affairs , etc . ) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers . With the exception of the years 1872 – 1873 and 1892 – 1894 , the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty 's hegemonic home @-@ kingdom , Prussia . The Imperial Diet had the power to pass , amend , or reject bills , but it could not initiate legislation . ( The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor . ) The other states retained their own governments , but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control . The militaries of the larger states ( such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony ) retained some autonomy , but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime . 
 = = = Historical arguments and the Empire 's social anatomy = = = 
 The Sonderweg hypothesis attributed Germany 's difficult 20th century to the weak political , legal , and economic basis of the new empire . The Prussian landed elites , the Junkers , retained a substantial share of political power in the unified state . The Sonderweg hypothesis attributed their power to the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the middle classes , or by peasants in combination with the urban workers , in 1848 and again in 1871 . Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie — which included bankers , merchants , industrialists , and entrepreneurs — in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the Junkers as a social group . This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the Hanseatic cities and the industrial leadership ( the latter particularly important in the Rhineland ) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire . 
 Additional studies of different groups in Wilhelmine Germany have all contributed to a new view of the period . Although the Junkers did , indeed , continue to control the officer corps , they did not dominate social , political , and economic matters as much as the Sonderweg theorists had hypothesized . Eastern Junker power had a counterweight in the western provinces in the form of the Grand Bourgeoisie and in the growing professional class of bureaucrats , teachers , professors , doctors , lawyers , scientists , etc . 
 = = Beyond the political mechanism : forming a nation = = 
 If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had lacked a constitution and administrative apparatus , that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871 . Yet , as Germans discovered , grand speeches , flags , and enthusiastic crowds , a constitution , a political reorganization , and the provision of an imperial superstructure ; and the revised Customs Union of 1867 – 68 , still did not make a nation . 
 A key element of the nation @-@ state is the creation of a national culture , frequently — although not necessarily — through deliberate national policy . In the new German nation , a Kulturkampf ( 1872 – 78 ) that followed political , economic , and administrative unification attempted to address , with a remarkable lack of success , some of the contradictions in German society . In particular , it involved a struggle over language , education , and religion . A policy of Germanization of non @-@ German people of the empire 's population , including the Polish and Danish minorities , started with language , in particular , the German language , compulsory schooling ( Germanization ) , and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past . Finally , it extended to the religion of the new Empire 's population . 
 = = = Kulturkampf = = = 
 For some Germans , the definition of nation did not include pluralism , and Catholics in particular came under scrutiny ; some Germans , and especially Bismarck , feared that the Catholics ' connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation . As chancellor , Bismarck tried without much success to limit the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and of its party @-@ political arm , the Catholic Center Party , in schools and education and language @-@ related policies . The Catholic Center Party remained particularly well entrenched in the Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden , and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry , and sought to protect the rights not only of Catholics , but other minorities , including the Poles , and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands . The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests , and their education , under the control of the state , resulting in the closure of many seminaries , and a shortage of priests . The Congregations Law of 1875 abolished religious orders , ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church , and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution . 
 = = = Integrating the Jewish community = = = 
 The Germanized Jews remained another vulnerable population in the new German nation @-@ state . Since 1780 , after emancipation by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II , Jews in the former Habsburg territories had enjoyed considerable economic and legal privileges that their counterparts in other German @-@ speaking territories did not : they could own land , for example , and they did not have to live in a Jewish quarter ( also called the <unk> , or " Jews ' alley " ) . They could also attend universities and enter the professions . During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras , many of the previously strong barriers between Jews and Christians broke down . Napoleon had ordered the emancipation of Jews throughout territories under French hegemony . Like their French counterparts , wealthy German Jews sponsored salons ; in particular , several Jewish <unk> held important gatherings in Frankfurt and Berlin during which German intellectuals developed their own form of republican intellectualism . Throughout the subsequent decades , beginning almost immediately after the defeat of the French , reaction against the mixing of Jews and Christians limited the intellectual impact of these salons . Beyond the salons , Jews continued a process of Germanization in which they intentionally adopted German modes of dress and speech , working to insert themselves into the emerging 19th @-@ century German public sphere . The religious reform movement among German Jews reflected this effort . 
 By the years of unification , German Jews played an important role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional , intellectual , and social life . The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere . Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands ; considerably less educated and less affluent , their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews . Many of the problems related to poverty ( such as illness , overcrowded housing , unemployment , school absenteeism , refusal to learn German , etc . ) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans , but for the local Jewish populations as well . 
 = = = Writing the story of the nation = = = 
 Another important element in nation @-@ building , the story of the heroic past , fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann ( 1785 – 1860 ) , his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke ( 1834 – 1896 ) , and others less conservative , such as Theodor Mommsen ( 1817 – 1903 ) and Heinrich von <unk> ( 1817 – 1895 ) , to name two . Dahlmann himself died before unification , but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions , by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation , and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification . 
 Heinrich von Treitschke 's History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century , published in 1879 , has perhaps a misleading title : it privileges the history of Prussia over the history of other German states , and it tells the story of the German @-@ speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia 's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership . The creation of this Borussian myth ( Borussia is the Latin name for Prussia ) established Prussia as Germany 's savior ; it was the destiny of all Germans to be united , this myth maintains , and it was Prussia 's destiny to accomplish this . According to this story , Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation @-@ state ; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence . The story continues by drawing on Prussia 's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon 's power in 1815 , at Waterloo , creating some semblance of economic unity , and uniting Germans under one proud flag after 1871 . It is the role of the nationalist historian to write the history of the nation ; this means viewing that nation 's past with the goal of a nationalist history in mind . The process of writing history , or histories , is a process of remembering and forgetting : of selecting certain elements to be remembered , that is , emphasized , and ignoring , or forgetting , other elements and events . 
 Mommsen 's contributions to the <unk> <unk> Historica laid the groundwork for additional scholarship on the study of the German nation , expanding the notion of " Germany " to mean other areas beyond Prussia . A liberal professor , historian , and theologian , and generally a titan among late 19th @-@ century scholars , Mommsen served as a delegate to the Prussian House of Representatives from 1863 – 1866 and 1873 – 1879 ; he also served as a delegate to the Reichstag from 1881 – 1884 , for the liberal German Progress Party ( Deutsche <unk> ) and later for the National Liberal Party . He opposed the antisemitic programs of Bismarck 's Kulturkampf and the vitriolic text that Treitschke often employed in the publication of his Studien über die Judenfrage ( Studies of the Jewish Question ) , which encouraged assimilation and Germanization of Jews .

 The Joint Agency Coordination Centre ( JACC ) is an Australian government agency which was established on 30 March 2014 to coordinate search and recovery operations for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , which disappeared on 8 March 2014 and was soon thereafter determined to have ended in the Southern Indian Ocean , within Australia 's concurrent aeronautical and maritime search and rescue regions . The JACC is an agency within Australia 's Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development , headed by Judith Zielke . It does not perform any search , recovery , or investigation activities , but coordinates the search effort and serves as a primary point of contact for information about the search for media and families of Flight 370 passengers . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 8 March 2014 , Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia to Beijing , China with 239 persons aboard ; a search in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand was promptly initiated near the aircraft 's last voice contact with air traffic control and final contact with secondary radar ( the type of radar used by air traffic control ) . A week after the disappearance , Malaysia announced that military radar determined that the aircraft had traveled west across the Malay Peninsula after being lost by air traffic control . They also announced that communications with a satellite indicated that the aircraft continued to fly for several hours and was last located along one of two corridors — arcing northwest and southwest from Malaysia . 
 The northern corridor was soon discounted and the focus of the search shifted to the Southern Indian Ocean , west of Australia and within Australia 's concurrent aeronautical and maritime Search and Rescue ( SAR ) regions that extend to 75 ° E longitude . On 17 March , Australia agreed to lead the search in the southern locus from Sumatra to the southern Indian Ocean ; the Australian Maritime Safety Authority ( AMSA ) , Australia 's search and rescue agency , initially coordinated the search within Australia 's SAR region , correlating information with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau ( ATSB ) and officials in Malaysia .

The sonar survey finished on 28 May and found nil debris from the aircraft . 
 After the initial search efforts through May , active searching ceased as plans and preparations were made for a new phase , called the " underwater search , " which would be preceded by a bathymetric survey . Plans for the new phase were announced in late June and the underwater search commenced in October 2014 .

 The JACC is a division of the Australian government 's Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development . The Australian government has budgeted A $ 2 million over two years to the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development for costs related to the JACC . 
 At the time of its establishment , retired Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston — former head of Australia 's military ( 2005 @-@ 2011 ) — was appointed to head the JACC by Prime Minister Abbott . After the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 , in July 2014 , Houston left the agency when he was appointed as Australia 's special envoy in Ukraine to recover and repatriate bodies of Australian victims , assist relatives of Australian victims , and ensure that a proper investigation of the crash was initiated in accordance with international standards . In January 2015 , Houston was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia for his military service and for his " continued commitment to serve the nation in leadership roles , particularly the national responses to the [ Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ] and [ Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 ] disasters . " As of March 2015 , Judith Zielke is the Chief Coordinator of the JACC . Zielke is also the Executive Director of the JACC 's parent division , the Surface Transport Policy division , within the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development .

 The JACC does not perform any search , recovery , or investigation activities , but provides a single point of contact for affected parties , including relatives of the missing passengers and crew , and communication between agencies and organisations involved in the search . The JACC also provides information to the public about the latest developments in the search and recovery operation . 
 = = = Search coordination = = = 
 The JACC is responsible for coordinating the search efforts for Flight 370 within Australian waters . At the time of the agency 's creation , the search effort involved China , Japan , Malaysia , New Zealand , South Korea , United Kingdom , and the United States as well as several agencies of the Australian government : the Australian Maritime Safety Authority ( AMSA ) , the Australian Transport Safety Bureau ( ATSB ) , the Department of Defence , and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade . The search activities also involved analysis of the flight 's satellite communications by Inmarsat , the AAIB ( UK ) , the NTSB ( US ) , and other organisations . 
 After the initial search efforts through May , the agency has worked primarily with Australian government agencies , Malaysia , and China to plan and carry out the bathymetric survey and underwater search . The JACC works closely with the ATSB , which is the agency responsible for defining the search area and carrying out the tenders for the underwater search and , if possible pieces of Flight 370 are located , the recovery effort . Geoscience Australia works closely with the ATSB to perform the bathymetric survey and underwater search . The JACC also works with Malaysia and China , which have both sent representatives to work at the JACC offices .

 = Alsos Mission = 
 The Alsos Mission was an organized effort by a team of United States military , scientific , and intelligence personnel to discover enemy scientific developments during World War II . Its chief focus was on the German nuclear energy project , but it also investigated both chemical and biological weapons and the means to deliver them . 
 The Alsos Mission was created following the September 1943 Allied invasion of Italy with a twofold assignment : search for personnel , records , material , and sites to evaluate the above programs and prevent their capture by the Soviet Union . It was established as part of the Manhattan Project 's mission to coordinate foreign intelligence related to enemy nuclear activity . Alsos personnel followed close behind the front lines in Italy , France , and Germany , occasionally crossing into enemy @-@ held territory to secure valuable resources before they could be destroyed or scientists escape or fall into rival hands . 
 The Alsos Mission was commanded by Colonel Boris Pash , a former Manhattan Project security officer , with Samuel Goudsmit as chief scientific advisor . It was jointly staffed by the Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) , the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) , the Manhattan Project , and Army Intelligence ( G @-@ 2 ) , with field assistance from combat engineers assigned to specific task forces . 
 Alsos teams were successful in locating and removing a substantial portion of the German research effort 's surviving records and equipment . They also took most of the senior German research personnel into custody , including Otto Hahn , Max von Laue , Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The Manhattan Project was a research @-@ and @-@ development program , operated during and immediately after World War II . Led by the United States with contributions principally from the United Kingdom and Canada , it aimed to produce an atomic bomb . Brigadier General Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers became its director in September 1942 . The project operated under a tight blanket of security lest its discovery induce Axis powers , particularly Germany , to accelerate their own nuclear projects or to undertake covert operations against the project . 
 The Manhattan Project intelligence staff believed that the Japanese atomic program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore , the industrial effort required exceeded Japan 's capacity , and , according to American physicists at the University of California , Berkeley , who knew the leading Japanese physicists personally , there were too few Japanese qualified to work in the area . Oppositely , German scientists had reputations as leaders in the field , and the fear of Germany developing nuclear weapons first was one of the reasons for the establishment of the Manhattan Project . The Chancellor of Germany , Adolf Hitler , frequently claimed that Germany was developing secret weapons , and it was feared that these might include nuclear weapons . Reports of German nuclear activity were taken very seriously . At the instigation of the Manhattan Project , Norwegian saboteurs and Allied bombers attacked heavy @-@ water infrastructure in German @-@ occupied Norway in late 1942 and early 1943 . 
 Following the September 1943 Allied invasion of Italy , Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer , Chief of Staff of Army Service Forces , was concerned intelligence activities related to foreign nuclear energy programs were not being properly coordinated . He feared that important items might be overlooked unless those responsible were properly briefed , yet at the same time wished to minimize the number of personnel with access to such secret information . Having the Manhattan Project itself take over responsibility for coordinating these efforts would address both these concerns . Accordingly , he approached Groves on behalf of General George Marshall , the Chief of Staff of the Army , with that recommendation . 
 In response , Groves created the Alsos Mission , a small team jointly staffed by the Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) , the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) , the Manhattan Project , and Army Intelligence ( G @-@ 2 ) . Its assignment was to investigate enemy scientific developments , including nuclear weapons research . Groves was not pleased with the codename , the Greek word for " grove " , but decided that changing it would only draw unwanted attention . 
 The Chief of Army Intelligence , Major General George V. Strong , appointed Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to command the unit . Pash had served as the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the Western Defense Command , where he had investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley . Pash 's command comprised his executive officer Captain Wayne B. <unk> , four Counter Intelligence Corps ( CIC ) agents , four interpreters , and four scientists : Dr. James B. Fisk from the Bell Telephone Company , Dr. John R. Johnson from Cornell University , Commander Bruce Olds from the Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , and Major William Allis , originally from MIT although then serving on the War Department scientific staff . 
 = = Italy = = 
 In December 1943 , the Alsos Mission reached Algiers , where Pash reported to the Chief of Staff at Allied Force Headquarters ( AFHQ ) , Major General Walter B. Smith , and his British Chief of Intelligence , Brigadier Kenneth Strong . This was awkward as Pash 's instructions were not to give the British information about the Alsos Mission , but it turned out that Strong was already fully aware of it . It was arranged that Pash would deal with Strong 's American deputy , Colonel Thomas E. Roderick . The Alsos Mission then moved on to Italy , where it was assigned to Major General Kenyon A. Joyce 's Allied Control Commission . Pash met with Marshal of Italy Pietro Badoglio , the man who had negotiated Italy 's surrender to the Allies , and was now head of the Italian Provisional Military Government , who gave him a letter of introduction addressed to Italian civil and military authorities . 
 Alsos interviewed the Italian Minister for Communications , the Chief of Naval Ordnance , the staff of the Italian Naval Academy , and Italian scientists at the University of Naples , and examined what captured technical documents could be found . There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany . The Alsos Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith 's S @-@ Force . Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars , this unit contained American , British , French , and Italian technical specialists of various kinds who would enter Rome on the heels of the advancing Allied forces . The expectation that Rome would soon be captured proved premature , and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States . The Alsos Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters , but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles . 
 Rome fell on 4 June 1944 . When the news came that its fall was imminent , Pash was ordered from London to Italy . He flew back to Italy and entered the city with S @-@ Force on 5 June . Pash took key scientists into custody and arranged for sites targeted by Alsos , including the University of Rome and the Consiglio Nazionale delle <unk> , to be secured . The Alsos Mission to Italy was reconstituted under the command of Pash 's deputy , Major Richard C. Ham , and Johnson and Major Robert R. Furman were sent from the United States to join him . They reached Rome on 19 June , and over the next weeks interviewed scientists including Edoardo Amaldi , Gian @-@ Carlo Wick , and Francesco Giordani . The picture that the Alsos Mission built up indicated that the German effort was not far advanced .

 = = = Britain = = = 
 In December 1943 , Groves sent Furman to Britain to discuss the establishment of a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project with the British government , and to confer over coordinating the intelligence effort . Lieutenant Commander Eric Welsh , the head of the Norwegian Section of MI6 , was unimpressed with Furman 's grasp of the subject matter . Groves selected the head of the Manhattan District 's security activities , Captain Horace K. Calvert , as head of the London Liaison Office , with the title of Assistant Military Attaché . Working in cooperation with Eric Welsh and Michael Perrin from Tube Alloys , the London Liaison Office consisted of Calvert , Captain George C. Davis , two Women 's Army Corps clerks and three CIC agents . 
 The Liaison Office interviewed European refugee scientists and studied German physics journals . It compiled lists of German scientists of interest and possible locations of nuclear research and industrial facilities , and the mining and stockpiling of uranium and thorium ores . Little thorium was available in Germany or German @-@ occupied Europe , and attention soon centered on the mines at Joachimsthal in Czechoslovakia . Aerial reconnaissance was carried out periodically , and production was measured by assessing the size of the piles of tailings . 
 Groves warned General Dwight D. Eisenhower of the possibility that the Germans might disrupt the Normandy landings with radioactive poisons , and sent Major Arthur V. Peterson to brief his chief of staff , Lieutenant General Walter B. Smith . Under the codename Operation Peppermint , special equipment was prepared and Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use . The British forces made similar preparations for their beaches . The precautions were unnecessary . 
 Meanwhile , the new head of G @-@ 2 , Major General Clayton L. Bissell , at the urging of Groves and Furman , decided to create a new , even larger Alsos Mission for western Europe in March 1944 . Pash assumed command of the new unit upon its official creation by the Secretary of War , Henry L. Stimson , on 4 April . The military staff for the new mission were selected by Bissell on Pash 's advice . Lieutenant Colonel George R. Eckman became the deputy commander . Captain Henry A. Schade was appointed as the head of the naval contingent . Groves and Vannevar Bush , the head of OSRD , selected the scientific staff , and appointed Samuel Goudsmit , a University of Michigan physicist with a good command of several western European languages , as its head . Goudsmit had not been working on the Manhattan Project , and therefore could not reveal any of its secrets if captured . The British considered creating their own rival mission , but in the end agreed to participate as a junior partner . Three Dutch and one Norwegian officer also served with the Alsos Mission . By the end of August it had seven officers and 33 scientists .
