 During the French Revolutionary Wars , from 1793 to 1804 , the abbey was abandoned by the monks and the principality extinguished . Stavelot was incorporated into the French Republic by a decree of 2 March 1793 , along with <unk> and Logne . Despite opposition from local notables , Malmedy was similarly incorporated by decree of 9 Vendémiaire of the Year IV ( 1 October 1795 ) . Stavelot abbey itself was sacked and the church sold and demolished ; of the church just the western doorway remains , as a free @-@ standing tower . Two cloisters — one secular , one for the monks — survive as the courtyards of the brick @-@ and @-@ stone 17th @-@ century domestic ranges . The foundations of the abbey church are presented as a footprint , with walls and column bases that enable the visitor to visualize the scale of the Romanesque abbey . 
 = = Geography and administration = = 
 Based largely in the <unk> and Ourthe river valleys , the principality took up a substantial proportion of what is now the arrondissement of Verviers in the province of Liège . By the time of the French Revolution , the principality was bounded to the north by the duchy of Limburg , to the south and east by the duchy of Luxembourg and to the north @-@ west by the marquisate of <unk> and the <unk> . The principality was divided into three administrative districts : the postellerie of Stavelot , the postellerie of Malmedy and the county of Logne , totalling around 28 @,@ 000 inhabitants . The postellerie of Stavelot contained 14 communities and that of Malmedy contained the town itself and the bans of <unk> and Francorchamps . The county of Logne was divided into four quartiers : <unk> ( 7 communities ) , <unk> ( 6 ) , <unk> ( 5 ) and <unk> ( 2 ) , with public assemblies being based in <unk> . In addition , six other communities were exclaves , plus the seigneuries of <unk> and Vien , in the <unk> . In 1768 , these two seigneuries were exchanged with Liège for <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Several sources note that there were disputes between the two abbeys , with Stavelot assuming primacy over Malmedy , to the latter 's discontent ; though new abbots were invested in Stavelot on behalf of both abbeys . Whilst an absolute principality , in some matters the prince @-@ abbot could consult a general assembly or <unk> of clergy , dignitaries , prince 's officers , mayors and aldermen , whose main role was to vote for taxes . Each of the three districts had its own provincial assembly and court , with a Princely Council for highly contested cases ; as a court of last resort , citizens could appeal to the Reichskammergericht ( Imperial Chamber Court ) , created by Emperor Maximilian I ( reigned 1508 – 19 ) on the model of the parliaments in Paris and Mechelen and headquartered in Frankfurt ( 1495 – 1527 ) , Speyer ( 1527 – 1693 ) and Wetzlar ( 1693 – 1806 ) . 
 Shortly before the principality 's extinction , it contributed just over 81 Reichsthaler per session to the Imperial economy ( for the maintenance of the Imperial Chamber Court ) , with annual revenues of around 25 000 Rhenish guilder . 
 = = Art = = 
 The abbeys at Stavelot and Malmedy commissioned some of the finest surviving works of Mosan art , one of the leading schools of Romanesque art , especially in goldsmith metalwork , which was still the most prestigious form of art . Their collections were dispersed by wars and finally the French Revolution , and works from the abbeys are now in museums across the world . The illuminated manuscript Stavelot Bible ( now in the British Library ) was probably the abbey 's main bible , and created there by several hands over a four @-@ year period ending in 1097 , and other works can be identified from the same scriptorium . The bible has been described as " a perfect microcosm of the influences and interests that gave rise to the first Romanesque painting " . A group of manuscripts from the less productive scriptorium at Malmedy were donated to the Vatican Library in 1816 by Pope Pius VII , including the Malmedy Bible and two <unk> from about 1300 . Malmedy illuminations show particular closeness with metalwork styles . 
 Abbot Wibald ( ruled 1130 – 58 ) was an important Imperial minister and diplomat , and regarded as one of the greatest patrons of Mosan art in its best period , although much of the evidence for this is circumstantial . Some of his surviving letters discuss works which may be identifiable with existing pieces , and an " <unk> G " who some have identified with Godefroid de Claire / of Huy , a shadowy figure to whom many masterpieces are attributed . Several important commissions were certainly placed by Wibald with Mosan workshops of goldsmiths and metalworkers , and other works later connected with Stavelot are also presumed to have been commissioned by him . The works , mostly including champlevé enamels of very high quality , include the Stavelot Triptych , a portable altar reliquary for two fragments of the True Cross , c . 1156 , ( now in te Morgan Library & Museum in New York ) , the " Stavelot Portable Altar " of 1146 and a head @-@ shaped reliquary of Pope Alexander II , c . 1150 , possibly by Godefroid ( both now Cinquantenaire Museum , Brussels ) . A gold relief retable of the Pentecost ( 1160 – 70 ) is in the Musée national du <unk> Âge in Paris , but an important and more elaborate retable of Saint Remaclus , of about 1150 and extending about nine square metres , was broken up at the French Revolution , and only two round enamel plaques survive , in Berlin and Frankfurt , though a 17th @-@ century drawing survives in Liège .

 The coat of arms , granted to the town of Stavelot in 1819 , is also the coat of arms of the abbey — parted <unk> between an image of St Remaclus and the wolf , which in Stavelot 's founding legend carried bricks for the building of the abbey after having killed Remaclus 's donkey . 
 = Dubstep = 
 Dubstep / <unk> / is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London , England . It emerged in the late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related styles such as 2 @-@ step garage , dub , techno , drum and bass , broken beat , jungle , and reggae . In the UK the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s . The music generally features sparse , syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies . 
 The earliest dubstep releases date back to 1998 , and were usually featured as B @-@ sides of 2 @-@ step garage single releases . These tracks were darker , more experimental remixes with less emphasis on vocals , and attempted to incorporate elements of breakbeat and drum and bass into 2 @-@ step . In 2001 , this and other strains of dark garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London 's night club Plastic People , at the " Forward " night ( sometimes stylised as FWD > > ) , which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep . The term " dubstep " in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple , Ammunition , and Tempa , by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2 @-@ step and grime . 
 A very early supporter of the sound was BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel , who started playing it from 2003 onwards . In 2004 , the last year of his show , his listeners voted Distance , Digital Mystikz , and Plastician in their top 50 for the year . Dubstep started to spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006 ; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the Internet and aided the growth of the scene , such as <unk> , the download site <unk> and blogs such as <unk> . Simultaneously , the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork , with a regular feature entitled The Month In : Grime / Dubstep . Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre , beginning with a show devoted to it ( entitled " Dubstep <unk> " ) in January 2006 . 
 Towards the end of the 2000s and into the early 2010s , the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK , with more singles and remixes entering the music charts . Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists ' work . Around this time , producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences , creating fusion genres including future garage , the slower and more experimental post @-@ dubstep , and the harsher electro house and heavy metal influenced brostep , the latter of which greatly contributed to dubstep 's rising mainstream popularity in the United States . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The music website Allmusic has described Dubstep 's overall sound as " tightly coiled productions with overwhelming bass lines and reverberant drum patterns , clipped samples , and occasional vocals . " According to Simon Reynolds , Dubstep 's constituents originally came from " different points in the 1989 — 99 UK lineage : bleep ' n ' bass , jungle , <unk> , Photek @-@ style <unk> , speed garage , [ and ] 2 step . " Reynolds comments that the traces of pre @-@ existing styles " worked through their intrinsic sonic effects but also as signifiers , <unk> @-@ back addressed to those who know " . 
 Dubstep 's early roots are in the more experimental releases of UK garage producers , seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the South London @-@ based 2 @-@ step garage sound . These experiments often ended up on the B @-@ side of a white label or commercial garage release . Dubstep is generally instrumental . Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre 's feel is commonly dark ; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff . Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples , a propulsive , sparse rhythm , and an almost omnipresent sub @-@ bass . Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences , from dub @-@ influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal . 
 = = = Rhythm = = = 
 Dubstep rhythms are usually syncopated , and often shuffled or incorporating <unk> . The tempo is nearly always in the range of 138 – 142 beats per minute , with a clap or snare usually inserted every third beat in a bar . In its early stages , dubstep was often more percussive , with more influences from 2 ‑ step drum patterns . A lot of producers were also experimenting with tribal drum samples , such as Loefah 's early release " Truly Dread " and Mala 's " Anti @-@ War Dub " . 
 In an Invisible Jukebox interview with The Wire , Kode9 commented on a <unk> track , observing that listeners " have internalized the double @-@ time rhythm " and the " track is so empty it makes [ the listener ] nervous , and you almost fill in the double time yourself , physically , to compensate " . 
 = = = Wobble bass = = = 
 One characteristic of certain strands of dubstep is the wobble bass , often referred to as the " wub " , where an extended bass note is manipulated rhythmically . This style of bass is typically produced by using a low @-@ frequency oscillator to manipulate certain parameters of a synthesiser such as volume , distortion or filter cutoff . The resulting sound is a timbre that is punctuated by rhythmic variations in volume , filter cutoff , or distortion . This style of bass is a driving factor in some variations of dubstep , particularly at the more club @-@ friendly end of the spectrum . 
 = = = Structure , bass drops , rewinds , and MCs = = = 
 Originally , dubstep releases had some structural similarities to other genres like drum and bass and UK garage . Typically this would comprise an intro , a main section ( often incorporating a bass drop ) , a midsection , a second main section similar to the first ( often with another drop ) , and an outro . 
 Many early dubstep tracks incorporate one or more " bass drops " , a characteristic inherited from drum and bass . Typically , the percussion will pause , often reducing the track to silence , and then resume with more intensity , accompanied by a dominant sub @-@ bass ( often passing portamento through an entire octave or more , as in the audio example ) . It is very common for the bass to drop at or very close to 55 seconds into the song , because 55 seconds is just over 32 measures at the common tempo of 140 bpm . However , this ( or the existence of a bass drop in general ) is by no means a completely rigid characteristic , rather a trope ; a large portion of seminal tunes from producers like Kode9 and Horsepower Productions have more experimental song structures which do not rely on a drop for a dynamic peak – and in some instances do not feature a bass drop at all . 
 <unk> ( or reloads ) are another technique used by dubstep DJs . If a song seems to be especially popular , the DJ will " spin back " the record by hand without lifting the stylus , and play the track in question again . <unk> are also an important live element in many of dubstep 's precursors ; the technique originates in dub reggae <unk> , is widely employed by pirate radio stations and is also used at UK garage and jungle nights . 
 Taking direct cues from Jamaica 's lyrically sparse deejay and toasting mic styles in the vein of reggae pioneers like U @-@ Roy , the MC 's role in dubstep 's live experience is critically important to its impact . 
 Notable mainstays in the live experience of the sound are MC Sgt Pokes and MC Crazy D from London , and <unk> from Trinidad . Production in a studio environment seems to lend itself to more experimentation . Kode9 has collaborated extensively with the <unk> , who MCs in a dread poet style . Kevin Martin 's experiments with the genre are almost exclusively collaborations with MCs such as Warrior Queen , <unk> , and <unk> Irie . Skream has also featured Warrior Queen and grime artist JME on his debut album , Skream ! . Plastician , who was one of the first DJ 's to mix the sound of grime and dubstep together , has worked with notable grime setup Boy Better Know as well as renowned Grime MC 's such as Wiley , Dizzee Rascal and Lethal <unk> . He has also released tracks with a dubstep foundation and grime verses over the beats . Dubstep artist and label co @-@ owner Sam Shackleton has moved toward productions which fall outside the usual dubstep tempo , and sometimes entirely lack most of the common tropes of the genre .

 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> the history of dubstep since it was in the underground it has served as a dominant sonic and social force in the establishment of a sub cultural identity . The culture surrounding Dubstep today is reminiscent of the hippies of the 60 's with raves starting as early as the 50 's @-@ the term rave is used to describe wild bohemian <unk> they have always been the most raucous and hectic parties . 
 = = = Drug use = = = 
 As with every major scene in music there is heavy drug use associated with this kind of music . According to the FBI some of these " club drugs " include MDMA ( commonly known as Molly or Ecstasy ) , Amphetamine ( referred to as " Speed " ) , GHB and Rohypnol ( known as the " date rape " drugs ) , Ketamine ( known as " Special K " ) , Methamphetamine ( known as " Tina " or " Ice " ) , and LSD ( referred to as " Lucy " or " Acid " ) . Poppers ' is the street name for alkyl nitrites ( the most well @-@ known being amyl nitrite ) , which are inhaled for their intoxicating effects . <unk> originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open , which led to the nickname " poppers " . Most of these drugs had already been popular in earlier years during the disco scene in the 70s and 80s and when Raves started happening they followed the crowd . To some outsiders this sub @-@ culture is viewed as a drug centered culture . Since so many people do drugs most of the bigger events have tents just to reduce the harm someone can do to themselves while taking or on them , one of the companies is called <unk> . 
 = = = Dancing = = = 
 Participation in the Dubstep scene can be in many ways but the most accepted and easiest way to do it is just to experience the music and dance . The Dubstep scene has a feeling of freedom added to it so there is no wrong way to dance but the one way that comes naturally to most people is the two @-@ <unk> there are also harder more intricate dances one can do like the <unk> and <unk> one can move freely throughout the floor at an Dubstep show but some people come prepared with choreography so these dance styles are practiced professionally as well as the amateur use .

 = = = 1999 – 2002 : origins = = = 
 The early sounds of proto @-@ dubstep originally came out of productions during 1999 – 2000 by producers such as Oris Jay , El @-@ B , Steve Gurley and Zed Bias . Ammunition Promotions , who run the influential club night Forward > > and have managed many proto @-@ dubstep record labels ( including Tempa , Soulja , Road , Vehicle , <unk> , Texture , Lifestyle and Bingo ) , began to use the term " dubstep " to describe this style of music in around 2002 . The term 's use in a 2002 XLR8R cover story ( featuring Horsepower Productions on the cover ) contributed to it becoming established as the name of the genre . 
 Forward > > was originally held at the Velvet Rooms in London 's Soho and is now running every Thursday at Plastic People in Shoreditch , east London . Founded in 2001 , Forward > > was critical to the development of dubstep , providing the first venue devoted to the sound and an environment in which dubstep producers could premier new music . Around this time , Forward > > was also incubating several other strains of dark garage hybrids , so much so that in the early days of the club the coming together of these strains was referred to as the " Forward > > sound " . An online flyer from around this time encapsulated the Forward > > sound as " b @-@ lines to make your chest cavity shudder . " 
 Forward > > also ran a radio show on east London pirate station Rinse FM , hosted by Kode9 . The original Forward > > line ups included Hatcha , Youngsta , Kode 9 , Zed Bias , Oris Jay , Slaughter Mob , Jay Da Flex , DJ <unk> , and others , plus regular guests . The line up of residents has changed over the years to include Youngsta , Hatcha , <unk> , and Plastician , with Crazy D as MC / host . Producers including D1 , Skream and Benga make regular appearances . 
 Another crucial element in the early development of dubstep was the Big Apple Records record shop in Croydon . Key artists such as Hatcha and later Skream worked in the shop ( which initially sold early UK Hardcore / Rave , Techno and House and later , garage and drum and bass , but evolved with the emerging dubstep scene in the area ) , while Digital Mystikz were frequent visitors . El @-@ B , Zed Bias , Horsepower Productions , Plastician , N Type , Walsh and a young Loefah regularly visited the shop as well . The shop and its record label have since closed . 
 = = = 2002 – 05 : evolution = = = 
 All throughout 2003 , DJ Hatcha pioneered a new direction for dubstep on Rinse FM and through his sets at Forward > > . Playing sets cut to 10 " one @-@ off reggae @-@ style <unk> , he drew exclusively from a pool of new South London producers — first Benga and Skream , then also Digital Mystikz and Loefah — to begin a dark , clipped and minimal new direction in dubstep . 
 At the end of 2003 , running independently from the pioneering FWD night , an event called Filthy Dub , co promoted by Plastician , and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly . It was there that Skream , Benga , N Type , Walsh , Chef , Loefah , and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs . South London collective Digital Mystikz ( Mala and Coki ) , along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own , bringing sound system thinking , dub values , and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene . Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre , most prominently reggae and dub , as well as orchestral melodies . 
 After releasing 12 @-@ inch singles on Big Apple , they founded DMZ Records , which has released fourteen 12 " s to date . They also began their night DMZ , held every two months in Brixton , a part of London already strongly associated with reggae . DMZ has showcased new dubstep artists such as Skream , Kode 9 , Benga , Pinch , DJ Youngsta , <unk> , Joe Nice , and Vex 'd . DMZ 's first anniversary event ( at the Mass venue , a converted church ) saw fans attending from places as far away as Sweden , the United States , and Australia , leading to a queue of 600 people at the event . This forced the club to move from its regular 400 @-@ capacity space to Mass ' main room , an event cited as a pivotal moment in dubstep 's history . 
 In 2004 , Richard James ' label , Rephlex , released two compilations that included dubstep tracks – the ( perhaps misnamed ) Grime and Grime 2 . The first featured <unk> , Mark One and Slaughter Mob , with Kode 9 , Loefah , and Digital Mystikz appearing on the second . These compilations helped to raise awareness of dubstep at a time when the grime sound was drawing more attention , and Digital Mystikz and Loefah 's presence on the second release contributed to the success of their DMZ club night . Soon afterwards , the Independent on Sunday commented on " a whole new sound " , at a time when both genres were becoming popular , stating that " grime " and " dubstep " were two names for the same style , which was also known as " <unk> " , " 8 @-@ bar " , and " <unk> " . 
 = = = 2005 – 08 : growth = = = 
 In the summer of 2005 , Forward > > brought grime DJs to the fore of the line up . Building on the success of Skream 's <unk> anthem " Midnight Request Line " , the hype around the DMZ night and support from online forums ( notably <unk> ) and media , the scene gained prominence after former Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs gathered top figures from the scene for one show , entitled " Dubstep <unk> " , ( later releasing the compilation album Warrior <unk> ) . The show created a new global audience for the scene , after years of exclusively UK underground buzz . Burial 's self @-@ titled album appearing in many critics ' " Best of ... " lists for the year , notably The Wire 's Best Album of 2006 . The sound was also featured prominently in the soundtrack for the 2006 sci @-@ fi film Children of Men , which included Digital Mystikz , Random Trio , Kode 9 , Pressure and DJ Pinch . Ammunition also released the first retrospective compilation of the 2000 – 2004 era of dubstep called The Roots of Dubstep , co @-@ compiled by Ammunition and Blackdown on the Tempa Label . 
 The sound 's first North American ambassador , Baltimore DJ Joe Nice helped kickstart its spread into the continent . Regular Dubstep club nights started appearing in cities like New York , San Francisco , Seattle , Montreal , Houston , and Denver , while Mary Anne Hobbs curated a Dubstep showcase at 2007 's <unk> festival in Barcelona . Non @-@ British artists have also won praise within the larger Dubstep community . The dynamic dubstep scene in Japan is growing quickly despite its cultural and geographical distance from the West . Such DJ / producers as Goth @-@ Trad , <unk> @-@ <unk> , Ena and Doppelganger are major figures in the Tokyo scene . Joe Nice has played at DMZ , while the fifth instalment of Tempa 's " Dubstep Allstars " mix series ( released in 2007 ) included tracks by Finnish producer Tes La Rok and Americans <unk> and Matty G. 
 Techno artists and DJs began assimilating dubstep into their sets and productions . Shackleton 's " Blood on My Hands " was remixed by minimal techno producer Ricardo Villalobos ( an act reciprocated when Villalobos included a Shackleton mix on his " Vasco " EP ) and included on a mix CD by <unk> resident Cassy . Ellen <unk> and <unk> 's 2006 song " Metric " ( from the Orchestra of Bubbles album ) , <unk> 's " Godspeed " ( from the 2007 's Happy Birthday ! album , among other tracks on that same album ) and Roman <unk> 's remix of <unk> 's " Hammer of Thor " are other examples of dubstep @-@ influenced techno . Berlin 's Hard Wax record store ( operated by influential dub techno artists Basic Channel ) has also championed Shackleton 's Skull Disco label , later broadening its focus to include other dubstep releases . 
 The summer of 2007 saw dubstep 's musical palette expand further , with Benga and Coki scoring a crossover hit ( in a similar manner to Skream 's " Midnight Request Line " ) with the track " Night " , which gained widespread play from DJs in a diverse range of genres . BBC Radio 1 DJ Gilles Peterson named it his record of 2007 , and it was also a massive hit in the equally bassline @-@ orientated , but decidedly more four @-@ to @-@ the @-@ floor genre of bassline house , whilst Burial 's late 2007 release Untrue ( which was nominated for the 2008 Nationwide Mercury Music Prize in the UK ) incorporated extensive use of heavily manipulated , mostly female , ' girl next door ' vocal samples . Burial has spoken at length regarding his intent to reincorporate elements of musical precursors such as 2 @-@ step garage and house into his sound . 
 Much like drum and bass before it , dubstep has started to become incorporated into other media , particularly in the United Kingdom . In 2007 , Benga , Skream , and other dubstep producers provided the soundtrack to much of the second series of <unk> Drama , which aired on Channel 4 with a soundtrack CD later released on Rinse Recordings . A track by Skream also featured in the second series of the teen drama Skins , which also aired on Channel 4 in early 2008 . 
 In the summer of 2008 , Mary Anne Hobbs invited Cyrus , Starkey , <unk> , DJ Chef , Silkie , Quest , Joker , Nomad , Kulture and MC Sgt Pokes to the BBC 's Maida Vale studios for a show called Generation Bass . The show was the evolution from her seminal BBC Radio 1 <unk> Show in 2006 , and further documented another set of dubstep 's producers . 
 In the autumn of 2008 , a limited pressing 12 " called " Iron Devil " was released featuring Lee Scratch Perry and Prince Far @-@ I in a dubstep style , including a tune based on the Perry riddim used on reggae hits like " Disco Devil " , " Chase The Devil " , and " <unk> Lizard " . This was the first recorded example of a founder of Jamaican dub style acknowledging dubstep and creating new music in the genre , reinforcing the connection of dubstep to its roots in Jamaican dub reggae at a time when it seemed dubstep was moving away from its reggae underpinnings . 
 As the genre has spread to become an international rather than UK @-@ centric scene , it has also seen a number of women making headway into the scene in a variety of ways . Alongside Soulja of Ammunition Promotions and Mary Anne Hobbs , an influx of female producers , writers , photographers and DJs all have broken through in the up @-@ til @-@ then male orientated scene . With key 12 " releases on <unk> , Immigrant and <unk> Recordings , producers Vaccine , <unk> and <unk> have introduced a palette of new sounds and influences to the genre , such as double @-@ time bass drums , 8 @-@ bit video game samples , hand percussion and lushly arranged strings . Mary Anne Hobbs commented that , unlike " Grime and drum ' n ' bass raves , the mood at dubstep nights is less aggressive , or more meditative , leading to a larger female attendance at events than with the genre 's precursors . You see the female @-@ to @-@ male ratio constantly going up – it 's got the potential to be 40 : 60 " . 
 = = = 2009 – present : mainstream influence = = = 
 The influence of dubstep on more commercial or popular genres can be identified as far back as 2007 , with artists such as Britney Spears using dubstep sounds ; critics observed a dubstep influence in the song " Freakshow " , from the 2007 album Blackout , which Tom Ewing described as " built around the ' wobbler ' effect that 's a genre standby . " Benga and Coki 's single " Night " still continued to be a popular track on the UK dance chart more than a year after its release in late 2007 , still ranking in the top five at the start of April 2008 on Pete Tong 's BBC Radio 1 dance chart list . 
 However , the year 2009 saw the dubstep sound gaining further worldwide recognition , often through the assimilation of elements of the sound into other genres , in a manner similar to drum and bass before it . At the start of the year , UK electronic duo La Roux put their single " In for the Kill " in the remix hands of Skream . They then gave remix duties of " I 'm Not Your Toy " to Nero and then again with their single " Bulletproof " being remixed by Zinc . The same year , London producer Silkie released an influential album , City Limits Vol . 1 , on the Deep <unk> label , using 1970s funk and soul reference points , a departure from the familiar strains of dub and UK garage . The sound also continued to interest the mainstream press with key articles in magazines like Interview , New York , and The Wire , which featured producer Kode9 on its May 2009 cover . XLR8R put Joker on the cover of its December 2009 issue . 
 In a move foreshadowed by endorsements of the sound from R & B , hip @-@ hop and recently , mainstream figures such as Rihanna , or The Bomb Squad 's Hank Shocklee , Snoop Dogg collaborated with dubstep producers Chase & Status , providing a vocal for their " underground anthem " , " Eastern Jam " . The 2011 Britney Spears track " Hold It Against Me " was also responsible for promoting dubstep tropes within pop music . Rihanna 's Rated R album released such content the very year dubstep saw a spike , containing three dubstep tracks . Such events propelled the genre into the biggest radio markets overnight , with considerable airplay . Other hip @-@ hop artists like Xzibit added their vocals to dubstep instrumental tracks for the mixtape project Mr <unk> & Tha Russian Dubstep LA Embrace The Renaissance Vol . 1 Mixed by Plastician . In summer 2009 , rapper and actress Eve used Benga 's " E Trips " ; adding her own verses over the beat to create a new tune called " Me N My " ; the first single on her album Flirt . The track was co @-@ produced by Benga and hip hop producer Salaam Remi . 
 Throughout 2010 , the presence of dubstep in the pop charts was notable , with " I Need Air " by Magnetic Man reaching number 10 in the UK singles chart . This presented a turning point in the popularity of mainstream dubstep amongst UK listeners as it was placed on rotation on BBC Radio 1 . " Katy On a Mission " by Katy B ( produced by Benga ) followed , debuting at number 5 in the UK singles chart , and stayed in the top 10 for five more weeks . Also in 2010 , American producer Skrillex achieved moderate commercial success in North America with a dubstep @-@ influenced sound . By 2011 his EP Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites had peaked at number three on the <unk> Dance / Electronic album charts . In February 2011 , Chase & Status 's second album No More Idols reached No. 2 in the UK album chart . On 1 May 2011 , Nero 's third single " Guilt " from their album reached number 8 in the Official UK Singles Chart . DJ Fresh and Nero both had number one singles in 2011 with " Louder " and " Promises " . Strong baselines imported from dubstep continued in popular music with the Taylor Swift song I Knew You Were Trouble , which made number 1 on Billboard 's U.S. Mainstream Top 40 chart .

 = = = Post @-@ dubstep = = = 
 In early 2011 , the term " post @-@ dubstep " was used to describe urban music that was influenced by certain aspects of dubstep . Such music often references earlier dubstep productions as well as UK garage , 2 @-@ step and other forms of underground electronic dance music . Artists producing music described as post @-@ dubstep have also incorporated elements of ambient music and early R & B. The latter in particular is heavily sampled by three artists described as post @-@ dubstep : Mount <unk> , Fantastic Mr Fox and James Blake . The tempo of music typically characterised as post @-@ dubstep is approximately 130 beats per minute . 
 The breadth of styles that have come to be associated with the term post @-@ dubstep preclude it from being a specific musical genre . Pitchfork writer Martin Clark has suggested that " well @-@ meaning attempts to loosely define the ground we 're covering here are somewhat futile and almost certainly flawed . This is not one genre . However , given the links , interaction , and free @-@ flowing ideas ... you can 't dismiss all these acts as unrelated " The production duo Mount <unk> is often associated with the origination of the term post @-@ dubstep . English music producer Jamie xx released remixes which are considered post @-@ dubstep , including We 're New Here ( 2011 ) , a Gil Scott @-@ Heron remix album . 
 = = = <unk> and American developments = = = 
 In 2011 , dubstep gained significant traction in the US market , by way of a post @-@ dubstep style known as brostep , with the American producer Skrillex becoming something of a " poster boy " for the scene . In September 2011 , a Spin Magazine EDM special referred to brostep as a " lurching and aggressive " variant of dubstep that has proven commercially successful in the United States . Unlike traditional dubstep production styles , which emphasise sub @-@ bass content , brostep accentuates the middle register and features " robotic fluctuations and metal @-@ esque aggression " . According to Simon Reynolds , as dubstep gained larger audiences and moved from smaller club @-@ based venues to larger outdoor events , sub @-@ sonic content was gradually replaced by distorted bass riffs that function roughly in the same register as the electric guitar in heavy metal . 
 The term brostep has been used by some as a slight pejorative descriptor for a style of popular Americanised dubstep . US and Canadian artists often drew inspiration from British brostep producers who tended to work less with sub @-@ bass and more with mid @-@ range sounds such as Caspa and Rusko , and Vex 'd . Rusko himself claimed in an interview on BBC Radio 1Xtra that " brostep is sort of my fault , but now I 've started to hate it in a way ... It 's like someone screaming in your face ... you don 't want that . " According to a BBC review of his 2012 album Songs , the record was a muddled attempt by Rusko to realign his music with a " Jamaican inheritance " and distance it from the " belching , aggressive , resolutely macho " dubstep produced by his imitators . 
 Commenting on the success of American producers such as Skrillex , Skream stated : " I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it 's a UK sound , but it 's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger . The bad side of that is that a lot of people will just say ' dubstep equals Skrillex ' . But in all honesty it genuinely doesn 't bother me . I like the music he makes . " Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision . Their production style has been described by Mixmag as " a viciously harsh , yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage " . The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands . Nu metal band Korn 's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers , including Skrillex and Excision . The term <unk> has been used for a fusion of brostep and metal . 
 = Alexander Mahone = 
 Alexander " Alex " Mahone is a fictional character portrayed by William Fichtner in the American television series Prison Break . Mahone is introduced in the premiere of the second season as a special agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation , specializing in manhunts for escaped prisoners for 14 years . 
 When the protagonist of the series , Michael Scofield ( Wentworth Miller ) , successfully orchestrates the escape of eight prisoners from Fox River State Penitentiary , Mahone is assigned to spearhead the task force assembled to recapture the fugitives and manages to capture four of them . He is later arrested in Panama and imprisoned in Penitenciaría Federal de Sona in the second @-@ season finale . Mahone manages to escape , and is coerced into taking down the Company , a secret group of multinationals which exerts an influence on the White House . An assassin is hired by the Company to murder his son , and Mahone spends the majority of season four seeking revenge . 
 The writers created Mahone 's character in the second season so that there would be a fugitive pursuer who was not corrupt . When the writers saw that the number of antagonists was increasing , they decided to make him the alter ego of Scofield . The writers try to let Mahone inhabit a gray area , shifting the audience 's sympathy for the character . Fichtner , attracted to the potential of the character , was cast as Mahone just one day before filming began for the second season ; he signed on for only two seasons , but was convinced to appear in a third .

C @-@ Note attempts suicide , but is rescued by the guards . <unk> makes a deal with him , and promises to release him if he testifies against Mahone . 
 Because he is unable to capture Michael , Mahone orders Agent Lang ( Barbara Eve Harris ) to follow Michael 's girlfriend Sara Tancredi ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) . Mahone 's sanity begins to unravel from his determination to catch Michael and Lincoln , and from his benzodiazepine addiction . Michael and Lincoln travel to Panama , where Mahone lures them into a trap by impersonating fellow escapee Fernando Sucre ( Amaury Nolasco ) . He captures Lincoln and contacts Michael , ordering him to surrender Charles Westmoreland 's ( Muse Watson ) five million dollars and his boat , the Christina Rose .

When Mahone learns about the bounty placed on fellow inmate James Whistler ( Chris Vance ) , he manages to find him and deliver him to Lechero . 
 Mahone begins to suffer from drug withdrawal and is informed by his state @-@ appointed lawyer that his trial is almost a full year away . When Whistler realizes that Michael is not entirely on his side , he forms an alliance with Mahone . Mahone deduces that Michael is planning to break Whistler out of the prison , and Michael eventually agrees to let him join the escape . After he begins hallucinating about Haywire , Mahone accepts heroin from T @-@ Bag to calm himself . 
 Agent Lang visits Mahone and offers him a deal : eight years in a St. Louis prison in exchange for testifying against the government in the Lincoln Burrows conspiracy , or multiple homicide charges if he does not cooperate . Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses to Lang that he killed Shales , and that guilt made him turn to drugs . Because he is unable to maintain his composure while testifying , Mahone 's testimony is dismissed , and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona . 
 Mahone ( now rehabilitated ) approaches Whistler and Michael and rejoins the escape . He is informed that their escape route ( a tunnel leading to the edge of the prison ) is almost complete , and that they will break out of Sona that night . Michael , Whistler , Mahone and fellow inmate McGrady ( Carlo Alban ) manage to escape ; Lechero , T @-@ Bag and Bellick are caught by the Sona guards .

 = = = Season Four = = = 
 Mahone accepts Whistler 's offer to work for the Company , although the group is secretly working with Homeland Security to destroy the Company , focusing their attention on a card ( code @-@ named " Scylla " ) , which contains information on all of the Company 's agents and operations . Whistler finds the card ; however , he is killed by the Company 's hitman , Wyatt ( Cress Williams ) , who takes the card . 
 Mahone returns to his family home to find his son has been murdered and since he is a wanted criminal , he is arrested by the police . Mahone is contacted by Agent Don Self ( Michael Rapaport ) , a Homeland Security agent who was working with Whistler to take down the Company . He offers Mahone freedom if he joins an unofficial operation to recover Scylla from the Company . Mahone accepts , learning that other members of the operation are Michael , Lincoln , Sara , Bellick , Sucre and computer hacker and identity thief Roland Glenn ( James Hiroyuki Liao ) . The group devises a plan to regain the card , which succeeds , however , they learn that Scylla is actually made up of six cards held by different members of The Company . The group continues to look for the other cards , while Mahone asks Lang to find out who killed his son . 
 Mahone obtains a picture of Wyatt and meets with his estranged wife Pam , who makes him promise to hunt down and kill Wyatt . When Wyatt is captured Mahone tortures him , forcing him to apologize to his wife over the phone . He ties a <unk> to Wyatt 's wrists , and drowns him in the ocean . The group manages to complete Scylla , and Lincoln absolves Mahone for his role in his father 's death . Self betrays the team and steals Scylla , forcing them to be fugitives once again . 
 While the others hunt Self , Mahone meets with Lang and asks for help . Lang calls Wheeler to help Mahone ; however , Wheeler lies to Mahone about a meeting with the Attorney General and arrests him . While transporting Mahone to the airport , Lang allows him to escape and lies to Wheeler about the direction in which he has fled . Mahone returns to help Lincoln , Self , T @-@ Bag and Gretchen retrieve Scylla . When Gretchen is shot while trying to double @-@ cross the team , Mahone and the others leave her for the authorities .

 After the FBI finds out that they believe Michael is going to try and break Sara out of prison they contact Mahone . Mahone is offered his old job back with the FBI if he agrees to give them credible information that leads to proof of Michael 's plans . Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras that Michael had found , which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone . Mahone eventually decides not to turn his back on Michael but instead to use the connection to his advantage . Mahone informs the FBI that Michael is going to parachute into the prison , and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has enough of a distraction to break Sara out . Once Sara has escaped safely , Mahone gives her and Lincoln a tape from Michael that explained why he sacrificed himself for Sara . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Mahone is depicted as an intelligent FBI agent with " an amazingly sharp mind " , quickly discovering the secret of Michael 's tattoos and his plans . His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives ' location , causing Michael to remark , " It 's like he knows where we 're going , what we 're thinking . " Mahone has been described as " intellectually matched with Scofield " , mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings . Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune describes Michael as the " brains of the operation " and Mahone as his " arch @-@ nemesis , sort of his equal on the other side of the law . " Michael and Mahone have been described as " two sides of the same brilliant coin " ; however , Mahone notes , " there 's one big difference between you and I ( sic ) , Michael . And you just proved it . You can 't kill . And that 's what it 's gonna take to stop me . Because I don 't have the same reservations . I can . " His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to " get his life back " , to which he replies " Absolutely . " Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he " doesn 't do everything he does because he wants to do it . He 's not OK about it . It 's going to start to come out . " 
 Mahone is not a straightforward character , and his past is revealed as the series progresses . According to series creator Paul Scheuring , the writers try to let all the characters in the show " inhabit a gray area . " Scheuring says that although Mahone 's pursuit in the second season is very noble , " there are some things about him that we will learn that are slightly less than noble . " Fichtner tries to play the character with a soft side , and believes that those characterizing him as " a hard guy " are " missing what I 'm trying to do . " Regarding the frequent intake of pills by Mahone , the series ' executive producer and writer Matt Olmstead says : 
 Mahone has certain things in his past , as far as what he 's done in the service of his country , things he 's done around the world — he 's starting to hear footsteps from all of that . It doesn 't throw him off his game at all but the sum total of his life does begin to present itself . 
 Mahone 's anxiety is evident when he reaches for the midazolam pills hidden inside his pen . When Mahone runs out of pills , he is tense and easily agitated . Fichtner notes the erratic behavior of his character , commenting , " The more twisted the better ! Who wants to play a straight @-@ away FBI guy ? " He says that the actions that Mahone takes are affected by " some of the things that Mahone has in the back of his closet — and in the back of his mind , the voices he is hearing about his own life . " Andy Dehnart of MSNBC observes that Mahone , " as played by William Fichtner , always seemed to be on the edge of a nervous breakdown . " 
 Although not a major characteristic , Mahone is depicted as remarkably good at unarmed combat ( probably due to his military background ) . It is surprising when Lincoln attempts to kill him , he rapidly masters him and tries to choke him ; Lincoln only manages to master him by squeezing his previous gunshot wound , only to be overcome again and have Mahone 's gun on him . When one of Lechero 's men attempts to stab Michael at the beginning of season three , Mahone stops him and breaks his neck in seconds . He is also the only one T @-@ Bag believed could kill Sammy , but when the tunnel crumbles on top of Sammy Mahone rapidly masters his men . In season four when Christina Rose orders her bodyguard to kill Mahone , he beats both of them down within seconds . 
 = = Development = = 
 The character of Mahone was not in the original plan of the Prison Break staff writers for the second season . When the writers approached the Fox network with their plans for the second season , Fox Entertainment president Peter <unk> suggested including a fugitive pursuer who was " not corrupt " ; a character who is " like the Tommy Lee Jones character in The Fugitive . " Along with Paul Kellerman and Brad Bellick , Mahone became a fugitive hunter at the start of the second season . The writers were aware of the increasing number of antagonists in the show , which led Olmstead to remark , " If there are too many people pursuing them , [ the pursuers ] are rendered inept because they 're not all catching our convicts , and you can only have so many close calls . " The writers decided that the character of Mahone was to be a " very formidable " nemesis for the protagonists , and the " flip side of Michael Scofield . " Scheuring acknowledges comparisons made between Mahone and Les Miserables ' character , Inspector Javert , " He certainly is Javert to Michael 's Valjean , but you can express it however you want . He 's his nemesis . " One of the tricks used by the Prison Break writers is to constantly shift the sympathetic characters . Olmstead notes , " A white @-@ hat character can be kind of boring . " Fichtner does not believe that Mahone is a " bad guy " ; rather , he has " a lot of demons driving him . " 
 Fichtner was cast as Alexander Mahone one day before filming began for the second season . After acting the previous year in the series Invasion , Fichtner did not intend to return to network television . When approached with the scripts for the first two episodes of the second season Fichtner was uncertain of his character 's background , but attracted to " the potential of who this guy is . " Fichtner was given two days to decide whether he wanted to play the character and , although he was unsure if the experience would be worthwhile , he later said that he was glad to have accepted the role . Fichtner has praised the quality of writing on the series , saying " Television shows live or die on writing . The joy of Prison Break has been the writers . They 're great and they forever challenged me , which makes the journey worth it . " Fichtner has also had several concerns with the scripts written for him , and talks to the writers to make sure that the character stays consistent . On at least one occasion , he has sat down with the writer and tweaked the entire script . 
 Fichtner said that his role on Prison Break ended up being " a lot longer " than he had originally thought . He was signed on to appear for a further two seasons , after being convinced by Olmstead to appear in a fourth ( and final ) one . The series ' move from Dallas to Los Angeles for filming was also an inducement for Fichtner , who previously had to leave his family for filming . When Olmstead asked Fichtner to return for the fourth season , his only request was to make it challenging by making his character 's journey difficult . Fichtner believes that in Mahone 's journey , " All of a sudden the blinders went up ... And little by little , he 's trying to make his way back . " He thinks that his character 's journey should end with " something really out of the blue " : " What if he totally loses it ? "

 Mahone is often referred to by critics as Michael 's nemesis . Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette found Mahone to be " a far more worthy adversary for Michael than prison guard Brad Bellick ... who 's still after the convicts but seems like a cartoon compared to the Inspector Javert @-@ like Mahone . " Jeff <unk> of the Arizona Daily Star comments that " William Fichtner is going to be the best actor on any show this season . He 's brooding , sexy , enigmatic and a little scary as the FBI man waiting for the clan to cross state lines and make this a federal case . Add in the reliance on those pills he 's hiding in that pen and I think I smell Emmy ! " Brian Zoromski of IGN believes that the " strongest portions of ' Manhunt ' deal with the introduction of a new character , an FBI agent named Alexander Mahone , played by the great character actor William Fichtner . " 
 Digital Spy 's Ben Rawson @-@ Jones praised the " wonderful " Fichtner , claiming he " quickly became more appealing than the brooding hero himself , " however , he did not enjoy Mahone 's storyline in the third season . Rawson @-@ Jones felt that Mahone had turned into a " gibbering , sweating wreck most of the time " , with only " occasional glimpses " of his brilliance . Robert Bianco of USA Today said that although Fichtner was a welcome addition to the cast , he could not compensate for the " harebrained absurdities that have swamped this show . " Dehnart called Mahone the best new character of the second season , but remarked that his ability to move from various locations in a short amount of time made him seem to possess " the power of super fast transportation . " 
 = Victoria Falls Conference ( 1975 ) = 
 The Victoria Falls Conference took place on 26 August 1975 aboard a South African Railways train halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge on the border between the unrecognised state of Rhodesia ( today Zimbabwe ) and Zambia . It was the culmination of the " détente " policy introduced and championed by B. J. Vorster , the Prime Minister of South Africa , which was then under apartheid and was attempting to improve its relations with the Frontline States to Rhodesia 's north , west and east by helping to produce a settlement in Rhodesia . The participants in the conference were a delegation led by the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith on behalf of his government , and a nationalist delegation attending under the banner of Abel Muzorewa 's African National Council ( UANC ) , which for this conference also incorporated delegates from the Zimbabwe African National Union ( ZANU ) , the Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( ZAPU ) and the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe ( <unk> ) . Vorster and the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda acted as mediators in the conference , which was held on the border in an attempt to provide a venue both sides would accept as neutral . 
 The conference failed to produce a settlement , breaking up on the same day it began with each side blaming the other for its unsuccessful outcome . Smith believed the nationalists were being unreasonable by requesting preconditions for talks — which they had previously agreed not to do — and asking for diplomatic immunity for their leaders and fighters . The nationalists contended that Smith was being deliberately intransigent and that they did not believe he was sincere in seeking an agreement if he was so adamant about not giving diplomatic immunity . Direct talks between the government and the Zimbabwe African People 's Union followed in December 1975 , but these also failed to produce any significant progress . The Victoria Falls Conference , the détente initiative and the associated ceasefire , though unsuccessful , did affect the course of the Rhodesian Bush War , as they gave the nationalist guerrillas significant time to regroup and reorganise themselves following the decisive security force counter @-@ campaign of 1973 – 74 . A further conference would follow in 1976 , this time in Geneva . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the Wind of Change of the early 1960s , the British government under Harold Wilson and the predominantly white minority government of the self @-@ governing colony of Rhodesia , led by the Prime Minister Ian Smith , were unable to agree terms for the latter 's full independence . Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965 . This was deemed illegal by Britain and the United Nations ( UN ) , each of which imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia . 
 The two most prominent black nationalist parties in Rhodesia were the Zimbabwe African National Union ( ZANU ) — a predominantly Shona movement , influenced by Chinese Maoism — and the Zimbabwe African People 's Union ( ZAPU ) , which was Marxist – Leninist , and mostly Ndebele . ZANU and its military wing , the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) , received considerable backing in training , materiel and finances from the People 's Republic of China and its allies , while the Warsaw Pact and associated nations , prominently Cuba , gave similar support to ZAPU and its Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( ZIPRA ) . ZAPU and ZIPRA were headed by Joshua Nkomo throughout their existence , while the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole founded and initially led ZANU . The two rival nationalist movements began what they called their " Second Chimurenga " against the Rhodesian government and security forces , and , while based outside the country , sent groups of guerrillas into Rhodesia at regular intervals . Most of these early incursions , which had little success , were perpetrated by ZIPRA . 
 Wilson and Smith held abortive talks aboard HMS Tiger in 1966 and HMS Fearless two years later . A constitution was agreed upon by the Rhodesian and British governments in November 1971 , but when the British gauged Rhodesian public opinion in early 1972 they abandoned the deal on the grounds that they perceived most blacks to be against it . The Rhodesian Bush War suddenly re @-@ erupted after two years of relative inactivity on 21 December 1972 when ZANLA attacked Altena Farm near Centenary in the country 's north @-@ east . The security forces mounted a strong counter @-@ campaign and by the end of 1974 had reduced the number of guerrillas active within the country to under 300 . In the period October – November 1974 , the Rhodesians killed more nationalist fighters than in the previous two years combined . 
 = = Mozambican independence and the South African " détente " initiative = = 
 The effect of the security forces ' decisive counter @-@ campaign was undone by two drastic changes to the geopolitical situation in 1974 and 1975 , each relating to one of the Rhodesian government 's two main backers , Portugal and South Africa . In Lisbon , a military coup on 25 April 1974 replaced the right @-@ wing Estado Novo administration with a leftist government opposed to the unpopular Colonial War in Angola , Mozambique and Portugal 's other African territories . Following this coup , which became known as the Carnation Revolution , Portuguese leadership was hurriedly withdrawn from Lisbon 's overseas territories , each of which was earmarked for an immediate handover to communist guerrillas . Brief , frenzied negotiations with FRELIMO in Mozambique preceded the country 's independence on 25 June 1975 ; FRELIMO took power without contesting an election , while Samora Machel assumed the presidency . Now that Mozambique was under a friendly government , ZANLA could freely base themselves there with the full support of Machel and FRELIMO , with whom an alliance had already existed since the late 1960s . The Rhodesian Security Forces , on the other hand , now had a further 1 @,@ 100 kilometres ( 680 mi ) of border to defend and had to rely on South Africa alone for imports . 
 The second event was more surprising for the Rhodesians . In late 1974 , the government of Rhodesia 's main ally and backer , South Africa , adopted a doctrine of " détente " with the Frontline States . In an attempt to resolve the situation in Rhodesia , the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster negotiated a deal : the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda would prevent guerrilla infiltrations into Rhodesia from his country , and in return the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith would agree to a ceasefire and " release all political detainees " — the leaders of ZANU and ZAPU — who would then attend a conference in Rhodesia , united under a single banner and led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa and his African National Council ( UANC ) . Vorster hoped that if this were successful the Frontline States would enter full diplomatic relations with South Africa and allow it to retain apartheid . Under pressure from Pretoria to accept the terms , the Rhodesians agreed on 11 December 1974 and followed the terms of the ceasefire ; Rhodesian military actions were temporarily halted and troops were ordered to allow retreating guerrillas to leave unhindered . Vorster withdrew some 2 @,@ 000 members of the South African Police ( SAP ) from forward bases in Rhodesia , and by August 1975 had pulled the SAP out of Rhodesia completely . 
 The nationalists , on the other hand , ignored the agreed terms and used the sudden cessation of security force activity as an opportunity to regroup and re @-@ establish themselves both inside and outside the country . Guerrilla operations continued : an average of six incidents a day were reported inside Rhodesia over the following months . Far from being seen as a gesture of potential reconciliation , the ceasefire and release of the nationalist leaders gave the message to the rural population that the security forces had been defeated , and that the guerrillas were in the process of emulating FRELIMO 's victory in Mozambique . ZANU and ZANLA were unable to totally capitalise on the situation , however , because of internal conflict which had started earlier in 1974 . Some ordinary ZANU cadres perceived the ZANU High Command members in Lusaka , the Zambian capital , to be following a luxurious lifestyle , contrary to the party 's Maoist principles . This culminated in the <unk> rebellion of November 1974 , in which mutinous guerrillas were forcibly put down by the ZANU defence chief , Josiah <unk> . The ZANU and ZAPU leaders imprisoned in Rhodesia were released in December 1974 as part of the " détente " deal . Robert Mugabe had been elected ZANU president while they were incarcerated , though this was disputed by its founding leader , the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole , who continued to be recognised as such by the Frontline States . On his release , Mugabe moved into Mozambique to consolidate his supremacy within ZANU and ZANLA , while Sithole prepared to take part in talks with the Rhodesian government as part of the UANC delegation . Sithole retained the ZANU leadership in the eyes of the Frontline States until late 1975 . 
 = = The Victoria Falls Conference = = 
 According to the terms agreed in December 1974 , the talks between the Rhodesian government and the UANC were to take place within Rhodesia , but in the event the black nationalist leaders were loath to attend a conference on ground they perceived as not neutral . The Rhodesians , however , were keen to adhere to the accord and meet at a Rhodesian venue . In an effort to placate both sides , Kaunda and Vorster relaxed the terms so that the two sides would instead meet aboard a train provided by the South African government , placed halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge , on the Rhodesian – Zambian border . The Rhodesian delegates could therefore take their seats in Rhodesia and the nationalists , on the opposite side of the carriage , would be able to attend without leaving Zambia . As part of the détente policy , Kaunda and Vorster would act as mediators in the conference , which was set for 26 August 1975 . 
 The UANC delegation was led , as expected , by Muzorewa and included Sithole representing ZANU , Nkomo for ZAPU and James <unk> , the former ZAPU vice @-@ president , for a third militant party , the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe . According to Rhodesian intelligence , the various nationalist factions had not patched up their differences , were not prepared to accept Muzorewa as their leader and , to this end , were hoping that the conference failed to produce an agreement . The Rhodesians relayed these concerns to Pretoria , which told them firmly that the UANC would surely not risk losing the support of Kaunda and the Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere by deliberately sabotaging the peace process . When the Rhodesians persisted in their complaints , citing evidence of nationalist infighting in Lusaka , the South Africans were terser still , eventually wiring Salisbury : " If you don 't like what we are offering , you always have the alternative of going it alone ! " 
 The conference started on the morning of 26 August as planned . The six Rhodesian delegates took their places first , then around 40 nationalists entered and crowded around Muzorewa on the opposite side of the cramped railway carriage . Vorster and Kaunda arrived and sat on the Rhodesian side , where there was more space , and each spoke in turn , giving their blessing to the negotiations . Muzorewa then opened the proceedings at Smith 's invitation . Speaking assertively , the bishop gave three concessions which would have to be given by the Rhodesian side for talks to begin : first , one man , one vote was established by Muzorewa to be " a basic necessity " ; second , an amnesty would have to be given for all guerrilla fighters , including those convicted of murder by the High Court in Salisbury ; and finally , all of the nationalists would have to be given permission to return to Rhodesia as soon as possible to begin political campaigning . Smith replied calmly that Kaunda , Nyerere and Vorster had all assured him that the UANC had agreed not to demand preconditions for talks , and that Kaunda and Vorster had in fact confirmed this to him that same morning ; his delegation was therefore surprised by Muzorewa 's confrontational opening speech . 
 Smith says that his reply " provoked a flood of rhetoric " ; the nationalists evaded his words and , one by one , gave passionate speeches about being " a suppressed people ... denied freedom in their own country " who only wanted to " return home and live normal , peaceful lives " . Smith sat back and waited for them to finish , then responded that there was nothing stopping them from going home at any time and living peacefully if they so wished , and that they were in this situation by their own hand . They themselves , he said , had refused the Anglo @-@ Rhodesian accord agreed four years previously , which he said had offered Rhodesian blacks " preferential franchise facilities " , and they themselves had chosen to use " unconstitutional means and terrorism in order to overthrow the legal government of our country . " The UANC delegates countered by railing against Smith even more strongly than before , repeating their previous arguments and rejecting the right of Britain to negotiate on their behalf . This argument went on for nine and a half hours before the conference broke up , Smith refusing outright to grant diplomatic immunity to the UANC 's " terrorist leaders who bear responsibility for ... murders and other atrocities " . Muzorewa said that he doubted Smith 's sincerity in seeking a resolution if he was unwilling to grant such a " very small thing " as immunity to the nationalist leaders . The conference broke up without any agreement or progress having been made . 
 = = Aftermath : direct talks between the government and ZAPU in Salisbury = = 
 After the failure of the talks across the Falls , even the facade of a united front amongst the nationalists was broken on 11 September , when Muzorewa expelled Nkomo and four of his deputies from the council after they suggested a new leadership election be held . ZAPU contacted Salisbury soon after , stating that they wished to enter talks directly with the government . Smith " opted for the unthinkable " , in the words of Eliakim Sibanda , reasoning that for all of their differences , Nkomo was still , as Sibanda writes , " a seasoned and pragmatic politician " , who commanded a not insignificant force of guerrillas . The ZAPU leader was popular , too , not only locally but also regionally and internationally . If he could be brought into an internal government , and ZIPRA onto the side of the security forces , Smith thought , ZANU would find it difficult to justify continuing the guerrilla war , and even if they did so , they would be less likely to win . 
 Dr Elliot <unk> , Muzorewa 's deputy in the UANC , told Smith that Nkomo was " the most balanced and experienced " of the nationalist leaders , and that most Ndebele now favoured open negotiation . He said that most Ndebele would support a deal between the government and Nkomo , and that Muzorewa probably would as well . Meetings between Nkomo and Smith were duly arranged , and the first took place in secret in October 1975 . After a few clandestine sessions passed without major problems , the two leaders agreed to have formal talks in the capital in December 1975 . 
 Nkomo was wary of being labelled a " sell @-@ out " by his ZANU rivals , particularly Mugabe , so to prevent this from happening he first consulted Kaunda , Machel and Nyerere , the presidents of the Frontline States . Each of the presidents gave his approval to ZAPU 's participation in direct talks , and with their blessing Nkomo and Smith signed a declaration of intent to negotiate on 1 December 1975 . Constitutional negotiations between the government and ZAPU began in Salisbury ten days later . The ZAPU delegation proposed an immediate switch to black majority rule , a government elected on a " strictly non @-@ racial " basis , and reluctantly offered some sweeteners for the Rhodesian white population , " which we detested " , Nkomo says , including some reserved seats for whites in parliament . The talks dragged on for months afterwards , with little progress being made , though Smith notes the " congenial atmosphere , with both sides ready to crack a joke " . Nkomo 's account of the meetings is less favourable , stressing Smith 's perceived intransigence : " We went to great lengths to offer conditions that the Rhodesian régime might find acceptable , but Smith would not budge .

 = Highgrove House , Eastcote = 
 Highgrove House , also known as High Grove House or High Grove , is a Grade II listed mansion in the suburban area of Ruislip , within the London Borough of Hillingdon . Originally built in 1750 by the Reverend John <unk> , the house was rebuilt in 1881 by Sir Hugh Hume @-@ Campbell following a catastrophic fire . Along with Haydon Hall and Eastcote House , Highgrove was one of the three main houses of Eastcote and eventually became a residential hostel for homeless families , run by the local council from the 1960s until 2007 . An area of the estate was sold to the local council in 1935 by the then @-@ owner Eleanor Warrender to become what is now Warrender Park . In 1975 , the house was granted Grade II listed status on account of its special architectural character . 
 The house was subsequently closed as a hostel by the council and sold for £ <unk> to Westcombe Estates . Planning permission was granted to the new owners in January 2007 for the conversion of the building into a luxury housing block of 12 units and expanded for a further three years in February 2010 .

 = = = First house = = = 
 The site of the present house was originally owned and lived on by the Hale family in the 13th century . Reverend John <unk> of Harmondsworth bought part of the land owned by Martha Hale and Elizabeth Kelly in 1747 and had the first house built . 
 Robert Turner bought the house and lived there from 1758 ; his son sold it in 1787 to the canon of Wells Cathedral , William Blencowe . John Humphrey Babb leased the house from the early 19th century , purchasing it outright from the Blencowe family in 1813 . Upon his death in 1825 , his successor as <unk> of the Vote in the House of Commons , James Mitchell , moved to the house , living there until his own death in 1833 . His widow subsequently sold Highgrove at auction . 
 In 1843 , the house was bought by Lieutenant General Joseph Fuller . Days before his death , his daughter Juliana married Sir Hugh Hume @-@ Campbell in October 1841 . Ownership based to Fuller 's daughter , the new Lady Hume @-@ Campbell , although in 1879 the house was destroyed by fire . The Uxbridge Volunteer Fire Brigade with assistance from a pump provided by Pinner Hall were unable to save the building . 
 = = = Second house = = = 
 The ruins of the house were cleared following the fire , and Sir Hugh contracted Edward Schroeder Prior to design the new house , which was completed in 1881 . Prior followed the Queen Anne and early Georgian architecture styles in his design , which is based around an " L " shape with an southern extension for the house 's domestic services . Highgrove was built of red brick , with two storeys and an attic . The window arches were also made of brick . On the ground floor facing the gardens , three sets of three windows in bays were included . Prior 's design drawings for the house were shown in an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1882 . 
 The Hume @-@ Campbells had no children , and the house eventually passed to the Warrender family in 1894 , who , as the grandchildren of Sir Hugh from his first marriage , were the next of kin . Brother and sister Hugh and Eleanor Warrender shared the house and were friends with Jenny Churchill , the mother of the future British prime minister Winston Churchill . He stayed at the house for his honeymoon in the early 1900s . 
 In 1935 , Eleanor Warrender sold 10 @.@ 5 acres ( 4 @.@ 2 ha ) of the grounds of the house to the local council to establish a new playground and park , now named Warrender Park , and 13 acres ( 5 @.@ 3 ha ) to Ideal Homes for a residential development . During the Second World War , she made Highgrove available to the military , and British and American personnel from RAF Northolt stayed there . 
 Highgrove was bought by the Ruislip @-@ Northwood Urban District Council in 1949 following Eleanor Warrender 's death . The Council gave it to the Middlesex County Council and the house became a home for the elderly . In 1965 , ownership passed to the newly established London Borough of Hillingdon and Highgrove became a residential hostel for homeless families . The house received Grade II listed status on 26 November 1975 due to its special architectural character , though was slightly damaged by a fire in the attic in 1979 . According to English Heritage , a Grade II listing denotes " buildings that are of special interest , warranting every effort to preserve them . " 
 = = = Restoration = = = 
 The house closed as a hostel in 2007 , after the London Borough of Hillingdon chose to replace its temporary accommodation with affordable permanent housing , in light of a directive from the Government for all local authorities to reduce the number of families in temporary housing by half by 2010 . Highgrove , together with six other buildings was put forward to be sold for redevelopment , with the proceeds to be invested in the construction of new housing . 
 Permission was granted for the restoration of the house and its conversion into a 12 unit luxury housing block in January 2007 . Part of the conversion work by the new owners , Westcombe Estates , involved the demolition of an annex building to make way for a sheltered housing block . At that time , the total land around and including the house included with the sale was 0 @.@ 74 hectares ( 1 @.@ 8 acres ) . In February 2010 , the planning permission for the work was extended for a further three years . 
 In June 2010 , an arson attack damaged sections of the ground floor and first floor . Two people were arrested the following day and released on bail in relation to the attack . 
 The construction of mews houses behind Highgrove House as part of the development was halted in July 2011 after it was found they were being built 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) out of the positions set in the planning permission . Following a review , the council agreed to allow the developers to continue the work , despite the close proximity to several existing houses bordering the site . 
 = T2 3 @-@ D : Battle Across Time = 
 T2 3 @-@ D : Battle Across Time is an attraction at various Universal Studios parks around the world including those in Florida and Japan . The version of the ride at Universal Studios Hollywood closed in 2012 . 
 The attraction is a mini @-@ sequel to Terminator 2 : Judgment Day and reunites director James Cameron and the main cast from the movie , including Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator , Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor , Edward Furlong as John Connor , and Robert Patrick as the T @-@ 1000 . The show is presented in two parts ; a pre @-@ show where a Cyberdyne Systems company hostess shows guests a brief video presentation about the company 's innovations , and the main show , where live performers interact with a 3 @-@ D film . 
 = = History = = 
 The initial planning for T2 3 @-@ D : Battle Across Time began in the early 1990s . It was originally developed for Universal Studios Florida , with producers pushing for a second installation in Universal Studios Hollywood during development . The original attraction cost a total of $ 60 million . With a total run time of 12 minutes , the film alone cost $ 24 million , making it one of the most expensive films per minute in the world . The attraction opened in the Hollywood area of Universal Studios Florida on April 27 , 1996 , to very positive reviews . Additional venues were later announced for Universal Studios Hollywood and the upcoming Universal Studios Japan theme park . 
 Construction for the Hollywood venue forced the closure of <unk> 's Playland and An American Tail Theatre , which were built atop a parking structure . The attraction opened on the Upper Lot of Universal Studios Hollywood on May 6 , 1999 . In the year of the attraction 's opening , attendance at Universal Studios Hollywood remained steady at 5 @.@ 1 million ; however , other parks in the region saw declines in revenue , such as Disneyland which experienced a 5 % drop . The Terminator stage was subsequently used for the annual Halloween Horror Nights event , with The Rocky Horror Picture Show : A Tribute being shown in 2009 . 
 At Universal Studios Japan , the attraction was added as one of the debut attractions in the New York section of the park . It opened to the public on March 31 , 2001 . California @-@ based firm <unk> provided special effects and show equipment for the attraction . 
 In late 2012 , Universal Studios Hollywood announced that their version would close on December 31 , 2012 . It was later announced Despicable Me : Minion Mayhem would replace the attraction .

 The queue features dozens of television monitors that show a series of video segments ( which are being presented on the " Cyberdyne Information Network , " or <unk> ) about the latest innovations and products of Cyberdyne Systems . The video also includes several special musical segments , including two songs from the film ; " Bad to the Bone " and " Guitars , Cadillacs " , as well as a " live " video feed from Costa Rica of a performance of the song La Bamba . Mixed into the video cycle are live images of the waiting audience ( in the manner of a closed @-@ circuit security system ) and two brief comical sketches of " customers " running afoul of Cyberdyne security – either being electrocuted by a security device or being arrested by security staff . Just before entering the pre @-@ show auditorium , guests pass an unmanned kiosk where they pick up a pair of " safety visors " ( which are polarized 3D glasses ) for use during the main show .

 The pre @-@ show is hosted in the " Miles Bennett Dyson Memorial Auditorium " by Kimberley Duncan and other Cyberdyne Systems Directors of Community Relations and Media Control . Here , the audience stands and views a promotional video about Cyberdyne 's numerous technological innovations , which includes several references to the Terminator universe . The pre @-@ show was updated in 2015 to include video footage that is more about the future , as the previous preshow was very outdated and showed a " future " where almost all of the futuristic technologies already existed in current day 2015 . However , footage from the old pre @-@ show , like the parts with John and Sarah Connor remain . 
 = = = Main show = = = 
 Guests are ushered from the pre @-@ show auditorium into a large theater that seats 700 where they are to see a demonstration of Cyberdyne 's newest creation , robotic soldiers called T @-@ 70 Terminators . Once guests are seated , they put on their " safety visors " to watch a demonstration of the Terminators in action . However , John and Sarah arrive and disrupt the proceedings , followed by a T @-@ 1000 Terminator from the future ( its appearance as the helicopter pilot ) , whom they engage with automatic @-@ weapons . Kimberley Duncan is killed by the T @-@ 1000 while attempting to stop it . A second Terminator , portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger , bursts through the movie screen " time portal " on his signature Harley @-@ Davidson motorcycle – via actual actor / stunt double riding into auditorium – to rescue John . He takes John back through the portal and into the future war between humans and machines , with the T @-@ 1000 in pursuit . After defeating it , John and the Terminator make their way across the war ravaged landscape as they head towards Skynet . Along the way , they are chased by a Flying Hunter @-@ Killer , four mini Hunter @-@ Killers , and a Terminator endoskeleton . 
 The duo successfully penetrate and descend with the audience into the Skynet core , where they battle the " T @-@ 1000000 " , a giant liquid @-@ metal spider @-@ like construct similar to a very large T @-@ 1000 . The Terminator finally sends John back to the present while he stays behind to blow up Skynet and the T @-@ 1000000 . Water is squirted from the ceiling onto the riders . The show ends with the ground @-@ shaking destruction of Skynet , leaving Sarah and John alone in the present time once again . During the explosion , the seats of the auditorium lurch with a sudden drop , giving guests a final scare . Sarah finishes the show by saying that she feels that she owes her life to the Terminator for saving John 's life . During this narration , a terminator endoskeleton 's face fills the screen , which morphs into Schwarzenegger 's face before the film fades to black , during which John and Sarah mysteriously disappear .

 The initial planning for T2 3 @-@ D : Battle Across Time began in the early 1990s . Jay Stein , Universal Parks & Resorts ' Chairman and CEO at the time , asked Gary Goddard and his team at Landmark Entertainment to develop a stunt show based around the Terminator franchise . <unk> sought permission from MCA Planning and Development ( later Universal Creative ) to morph this concept into a theater @-@ based presentation featuring a 3 @-@ D film , live action and pyrotechnics . After a year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half of development , MCA Planning and Development and Landmark Entertainment approached James Cameron 's <unk> Entertainment for ultimate approval . Although Cameron was originally against the idea of Universal taking his Terminator franchise and converting it into a ride , he found the storyboards and the whole concept to be " great " , so the project was green @-@ lit . 
 A full @-@ scale mock @-@ up duplicating the dimensions of the planned Florida venue was created in an airplane hangar at the Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley . The set consists of a stage surrounded by a triptych of adjoined silver screens . Each of these three screens measured 23 by 50 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 by 15 @.@ 2 m ) . A total of six Iwerks projectors were used to run the 3 @-@ D , 70mm film simultaneously at 30 frames per second . Several elements of T2 3 @-@ D : Battle Across Time have been patented by Universal , including the seat drop effect , the blending of live action and film , the trio of projection screens , and the simulated assault weapons . 
 The film was shot at the abandoned Eagle Mountain iron ore mine , just north of Desert Center in California . The cast and crew from the first two Terminator films returned for the shoot , including Arnold Schwarzenegger as The Terminator , Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor , Robert Patrick as T @-@ 1000 , and Edward Furlong as John Connor . To achieve the 3 @-@ D effect on a 70mm projected film , a two @-@ camera rig weighing 450 pounds ( 200 kg ) was used . 
 As a sequel to the 1991 film , T2 3 @-@ D : Battle Across Time introduced two new Terminator characters . The first is the Cyberdyne 's latest invention , the T @-@ 1000000 . It is a large spider @-@ like version of the T @-@ 1000 that defends Skynet 's CPU from attack . Like the T @-@ 1000 , it is made of mimetic <unk> , allowing it to form its legs into stabbing weapons . The only known T @-@ 1000000 was destroyed when Skynet 's core was destroyed . 
 The demonstration featured as the premise for the film involves several large practical effects robots called T @-@ 70s , designed as mechanical soldiers , with large miniguns on their arms . They are the earliest terminator models shown to have a humanoid form with arms and legs , and are a direct predecessor to Schwarzenegger 's T @-@ 800 . The T @-@ 70s stand 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) tall and line the walls of the arena . 
 = The Downward Spiral = 
 The Downward Spiral is the second studio album by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails , released March 8 , 1994 , on Interscope Records . It is a concept album detailing the destruction of a man , from the beginning of his " downward spiral " to his attempt at suicide . The Downward Spiral features elements of industrial rock , techno , and heavy metal , in contrast to the synthpop @-@ influenced Pretty Hate Machine . 
 Co @-@ produced by Trent Reznor and Flood , The Downward Spiral was conceived after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival tour as a pivot for Reznor 's personal issues and the " negative vibe " felt by the band . Reznor moved to 10050 Cielo Drive , Benedict Canyon , Los Angeles in Beverly Hills , California the following year , where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family . It was used as a studio called " Le Pig " for recording Broken and The Downward Spiral with collaborations from other musicians . The album was influenced by late 1970s rock music albums , David Bowie 's Low and Pink Floyd 's The Wall in particular , and focused on texture and space , avoiding explicit usage of guitars or synthesizers . 
 The Downward Spiral was promoted with the Self Destruct Tour and four songs from the album ( " March of the Pigs " , " Closer " , " Piggy " , and " Hurt " ) became singles . The tour 's concerts debuted the band 's grungy and messy image and were violent and chaotic , with band members often injuring themselves and destroying their instruments . " March of the Pigs " and " Closer " were accompanied by music videos ; the " March of the Pigs " video was shot twice and " Closer " ' s was heavily censored . " Piggy " and " Hurt " were released as promotional singles . 
 A major commercial success , The Downward Spiral established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene , with its sound being widely imitated and Reznor receiving media hype and multiple honors while diverging into drug abuse and depression . It has been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and was praised for its abrasive , eclectic nature and dark themes , although it was scrutinized by social conservatives for its lyrics . A companion remix album , Further Down the Spiral , was released in 1995 . To mark the album 's tenth anniversary , The Downward Spiral was remastered and re @-@ released on November 23 , 2004 in high @-@ resolution SACD and DualDisc formats . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 The Downward Spiral was conceived after the Lollapalooza festival tour as Trent Reznor thought of a " negative vibe " felt by the band when they were in a European hotel . Nine Inch Nails live performances were known for its aggressive on @-@ stage dynamic , in which band members act angry , injure themselves , and destroy instruments . Reznor had a feud with TVT Records that resulted in him co @-@ founding Nothing Records with his former manager John Malm , Jr. and signing with Interscope . He wanted to explore a fictional character whose life is psychologically wounded and developed a concept about the album 's themes ; he later used the concept as lyrics . The concept was based on Reznor 's social issues at the time : he had personal conflicts with band member Richard Patrick and was known for enjoying alcohol . When developing The Downward Spiral , Reznor struggled with drug addiction and was depressed as he wrote songs related to personal issues . His friends suggested that he could take Prozac ( fluoxetine ) , an antidepressant , but this choice did not appeal to him . He wanted the album 's sound to diverge from Broken , emphasizing mood , texture , restraint and subtlety , although he was not sure about its musical direction . The album was made with " full range " and focused on texture and space , avoiding explicit usage of guitars or synthesizers . 
 Reznor searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in 1992 for recording Broken and The Downward Spiral , a decision made against his initial choice to record the album in New Orleans . 10050 Cielo Drive is referred to as the " Tate House " since Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family in 1969 ; Reznor named the studio " Le Pig " after the message that was scrawled on the front door with Tate 's blood by her murderers , and stayed there with Malm for 18 months . He called his first night in 10050 Cielo Drive " terrifying " because he already knew it and read books related to the incident . Reznor chose the Tate house to calibrate his engineering skills and the band bought a large console and two Studer machines as resources , a move that he believed was cheaper than renting . The studio was also used for the recording of Marilyn Manson 's debut album Portrait of an American Family , which Reznor co @-@ produced . Marilyn Manson accepted Reznor 's offer of signing a contract with Nothing Records . 
 Reznor collaborated with former Jane 's Addiction and Porno for <unk> drummer Stephen Perkins , progressive rock guitarist Adrian Belew , and Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna . Belew 's first visit to the studio involved playing the guitar parts in " Mr. Self @-@ Destruct " , and he was told to play freely , think on reacting to melodies , concentrate on rhythm , and use noise . This approach improved Reznor 's confidence in the instrument : he found it to be more expressive than the keyboard due to the interface . Belew praised Reznor for his " command of technology , " and commented that the music of Nine Inch Nails made innovations " that are in [ his ] realm . " Vrenna and Perkins played drum parts recorded live in the studio ; the tracks were rendered into looped samples . Reznor took a similar approach to recording guitar parts : he would tape 20 to 25 @-@ minute long sessions of himself playing guitars on a hard disc recorder with the Studio Vision sequencer . 
 Most of the music was recorded into a Macintosh computer using a board and manipulated with music editor programs on the computer . Unique effects such as analyzing and inverting the frequency were applied to the tracks to create original sounds . The band would " get an arrangement together " and convert it into analog tape . Reznor sampled excerpts from guitar tracks and processed them to the point of randomness and expression . Among the equipment Reznor used for recording the album are Pro Tools , Digidesign 's <unk> , a Marshall rack head , the Prophet VS keyboard , and various Jackson and Gibson guitars . 
 In December 1993 , Reznor was confronted by Patti Tate , who asked if he was exploiting Sharon Tate 's death in the house . Reznor responded that he was interested in the house as her death happened there . He later made a statement about this encounter during a 1997 interview with Rolling Stone : 
 While I was working on [ The ] Downward Spiral , I was living in the house where Sharon Tate was killed . Then one day I met her sister [ Patti Tate ] . It was a random thing , just a brief encounter . And she said : ' Are you exploiting my sister 's death by living in her house ? ' For the first time , the whole thing kind of slapped me in the face . I said , ' No , it 's just sort of my own interest in American folklore . I 'm in this place where a weird part of history occurred . ' I guess it never really struck me before , but it did then . She lost her sister from a senseless , ignorant situation that I don 't want to support . When she was talking to me , I realized for the first time , ' What if it was my sister ? ' I thought , ' Fuck Charlie Manson . ' I went home and cried that night . It made me see there 's another side to things , you know ? 
 Flood , known for engineering and producing U2 and Depeche Mode albums , was employed as co @-@ producer on The Downward Spiral . It became his last collaboration with Nine Inch Nails due to creative differences . A " very dangerously self @-@ destructive , " humorous short song written for the album , " Just Do It " , was not included in the final version and criticized by Flood in that Reznor had " gone too far . " Reznor completed the last song written for the album , " Big Man with a Gun " , in late 1993 . After the album 's recording , Reznor moved out and the house was demolished shortly thereafter . The Downward Spiral entered its mixing and mastering processes , done at Record Plant Studios and A & M Studios with Alan Moulder , who subsequently took on more extensive production duties for future album releases . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Numerous layers of metaphors are present throughout The Downward Spiral , which leaves it open to wide interpretation . The album relays nihilism and is defined by a prominent theme of self @-@ abuse and control . It is a semi @-@ autobiographical concept album in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist 's descent into madness in his own inner solipsistic world , through a metaphorical " Downward Spiral " , dealing with religion , dehumanization , violence , disease , society , drugs , sex , and finally suicide . Reznor described the concept as consisting of " someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness , but through career , religion , relationship , belief and so on . " Media journalists like The New York Times writer Jon Pareles noted the album 's theme of angst had already been used by grunge bands like Nirvana , and that Nine Inch Nails ' depiction was more generalized . 
 The Downward Spiral features elements of industrial rock , techno , and heavy metal , a change from the synthpop @-@ influenced Pretty Hate Machine . Reznor regularly uses noise and distortion in his song arrangements that do not follow verse – chorus form , and incorporates dissonance with chromatic melody or harmony ( or both ) . The treatment of metal guitars in Broken is carried over to The Downward Spiral , which includes innovative techniques such as expanded song structures and unconventional time signatures . The album features a wide range of textures and moods to illustrate the mental progress of the central protagonist . Reznor 's singing follows a similar pattern from beginning to end , frequently moving from whispers to screams . These techniques are all used in the song " Hurt " , which features a highly dissonant tritone played on guitar during the verses , a B5 # 11 , emphasized when Reznor sings the eleventh note on the word " I " every time the B / E # dyad is played . 
 " Mr. Self Destruct " , a song about a powerful person , follows a build @-@ up sampled from THX 1138 with an " industrial roar " and is accompanied by an audio loop of a pinion rotating . " The Becoming " expresses the state of being dead and the protagonist 's transformation into a non @-@ human organism . " Closer " concludes with a chromatic piano motif : The melody is debuted during the second verse of " Piggy " on organ , then reappears in power chords at drop D tuning throughout the chorus of " Heresy " , and recurs for the final time on " The Downward Spiral " . The album was chiefly inspired by David Bowie 's Low , an experimental rock album which Reznor related to on songwriting , mood , and structures , as well as progressive rock group Pink Floyd 's The Wall . 
 = = Cover art = = 
 <unk> , an installation featuring artwork and sketches for The Downward Spiral , " Closer " and " March of the Pigs " by Russell Mills was displayed at the Glasgow School of Art . Mills explained the ideas and materials that made up the painting ( titled " Wound " ) that was used for the cover art : 
 I had been thinking about making works that dealt with layers , physically , materially and conceptually . I wanted to produce works that were about both exposure and revealing and at the same dealt with closure and covering . Given the nature of the lyrics and the power of the music I was working with , I felt justified in attempting to make works that alluded to the apparently contradictory imagery of pain and healing . I wanted to make beautiful surfaces that partially revealed the visceral rawness of open wounds beneath . The mixed media work ' Wound ' was the first piece I tackled in this vein ( no pun intended ) and it became the cover of the album . It is made of plaster , acrylics , oils , rusted metals , insects , moths , blood ( mine ) , wax , varnishes , and surgical bandaging on a wooden panel .

 " March of the Pigs " and " Closer " were released as singles ; two other songs , " Hurt " and " Piggy " , were issued to radio without a commercial single release . " March of the Pigs " has an unusual meter , alternating three bars of 7 / 8 time with one of 8 / 8 ( in effect , a 29 / 8 time signature ) , and has a BPM rate of 269 . The song 's music video was directed by Peter Christopherson and was shot twice ; the first version scrapped due to Reznor 's involvement , and the released second version being a live performance . 
 " Closer " features a heavily modified bass drum sample from the Iggy Pop song " <unk> " from his album The Idiot . Lyrically , it is a meditation on self @-@ hatred and obsession , but to Reznor 's dismay , the song was widely misinterpreted as a lust anthem due to its chorus , which included the line " I wanna fuck you like an animal " . The music video for " Closer " was directed by Mark Romanek and received frequent rotation on MTV , though the network heavily censored the original version , which they perceived to be too graphic . The video shows events in a laboratory dealing with religion , sexuality , animal cruelty , politics , and terror ; controversial imagery included a nude bald woman with a crucifix mask , a monkey tied to a cross , a pig 's head spinning on a machine , a diagram of a vulva , Reznor wearing an S & M mask while swinging in shackles , and of him wearing a ball gag . A radio edit that partially censored the song 's explicit lyrics also received extensive airtime . The video has since been made part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City . 
 " Piggy " uses " nothing can stop me now " , a line that recurs in " <unk> " and " Big Man with a Gun " . The frantic drumming on the song 's outro is Reznor 's only attempt at performing drums on the record , and one of the few " live " drum performances on the album . He had stated that the recording was from him testing the microphone setup in studio , but he liked the sound too much not to include it . It was released as a promotional single in December 1994 and reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart . 
 Released in 1995 , " Hurt " clearly includes references to self @-@ harm and heroin addiction , although the overall meaning of the song is disputed . Johnny Cash covered the song for American IV : The Man Comes Around . Its accompanying music video , featuring images from Cash 's life and also directed by Mark Romanek , was named the best video of all time by NME . British singer @-@ songwriter Leona Lewis covered the song and included it on her first EP , Hurt : The EP . Her cover garnered a mixed response from music critics . Lewis Corner for Digital Spy was complimentary of Lewis ' rock interpretation of the song as it displays the singer 's " emotive tones " on which she sings in " spine @-@ chilling " falsetto notes .

 The Nine Inch Nails live band embarked on the Self Destruct tour in support of The Downward Spiral . Chris Vrenna and James Woolley performed drums and keyboards respectively , Robin Finck replaced Richard Patrick on guitar and bassist Danny Lohner was added to the line @-@ up . The stage set @-@ up consisted of dirty curtains which would pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as " Hurt " . The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights , along with very little actual ones . The tour debuted the band 's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch . The concerts were violent and chaotic , with band members often injuring themselves . They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts , attack each other , and stage @-@ dive into the crowd . 
 The tour included a set at Woodstock ' 94 broadcast on Pay @-@ per @-@ view and seen in as many as 24 million homes . The band being covered in mud was a result of pre @-@ concert backstage play , contrary to the belief that it was an attention @-@ grabbing ploy , thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage : Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair entering his eyes while performing . Nine Inch Nails was widely proclaimed to have " stolen the show " from its popular contemporaries , mostly classic rock bands , and its fan base expanded . The band received considerable mainstream success thereafter , performing with significantly higher production values and the addition of various theatrical visual elements . Its performance of " Happiness in Slavery " from the Woodstock concert earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1995 . Entertainment Weekly commented about the band 's Woodstock ' 94 performance : " Reznor <unk> rock to its horrifying , melodramatic <unk> experience as draining as it is exhilarating " . Despite this acclaim , Reznor attributed his dislike of the concert to its technical difficulties . 
 The main leg of the tour featured Marilyn Manson as the supporting act , who featured bassist Jeordie White ( then playing under the pseudonym " Twiggy Ramirez " ) ; White later played bass with Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007 . After another tour leg supporting the remix album Further Down the Spiral , Nine Inch Nails contributed to the Alternative Nation Festival in Australia and subsequently embarked on the Dissonance Tour , which included 26 separate performances with co @-@ headliner David Bowie . Nine Inch Nails was the opening act for the tour , and its set transitioned into Bowie 's set with joint performances of both bands ' songs . However , the crowds reportedly did not respond positively to the pairing due to their creative differences . 
 The tour concluded with " Nights of Nothing " , a three @-@ night showcase of performances from Nothing Records bands Marilyn Manson , Prick , Meat Beat Manifesto , and Pop Will Eat Itself , which ended with an 80 @-@ minute set from Nine Inch Nails . Kerrang ! described the Nine Inch Nails set during the Nights of Nothing showcase as " tight , brash and dramatic " , but was disappointed at the lack of new material . On the second of the three nights , Richard Patrick was briefly reunited with the band and contributed guitar to a performance of " Head Like a Hole " . After the Self Destruct tour , Chris Vrenna , member of the live band since 1988 and frequent contributor to Nine Inch Nails studio recordings , left the act permanently to pursue a career in producing and to form <unk> . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The Downward Spiral 's release date was delayed at various times to slow down Reznor 's intended pace of the album 's recording . The first delay caused the process of setting up Le Pig to take longer than he expected , and its release was postponed again as he was educating himself different ways to write songs that did not resemble those on Broken and Pretty Hate Machine . He considered delivering the album to Interscope in early 1993 , only to experience a writer 's block as he was unable to produce any satisfactory material . Interscope grew impatient and concerned with this progress , but Reznor was not forced by their demands of expediency despite crediting the label for giving him creative freedom . He told rock music producer Rick Rubin that his motivation for creating the album was to get it finished , thus Rubin responded that Reznor might not do so until he makes music that is allowed to be heard . Reznor realized that he was in the most fortunate situation he imagined when the album was recorded with a normal budget , " cool " equipment , and a studio to work at . 
 Released on March 8 , 1994 to instant success , The Downward Spiral debuted the following week at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart ; American grunge band Soundgarden 's Superunknown had topped the chart in the same week and also shipped on March 8 . On October 28 , 1998 the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) certified the album quadruple platinum , denoting shipments of four million in the United States . The album peaked at number nine on the UK Albums Charts and the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) gave the album a gold certification on July 22 , 2013 for sales of over 100 @,@ 000 copies in the United Kingdom . It reached number 13 on the Canadian RPM album charts and received a triple platinum certification from the Canadian Recording Industry Association ( CRIA ) for selling 300 @,@ 000 copies in Canada . A group of early listeners of the album viewed it as " commercial suicide , " but Reznor did not make it for profit as his goal was to slightly broaden Nine Inch Nails ' scope . Reznor felt that the finished product he delivered to Interscope was complete and faithful to his vision and thought its commercial potential was limited , but after its release he was surprised by the success and received questions about a follow @-@ up single with a music video to be shown on MTV . The album has since sold over four million copies worldwide . 
 Many music critics and audiences praised The Downward Spiral for its abrasive , eclectic nature and dark themes and commented on the concept of a destruction of a man . The New York Times writer Jon Pareles ' review of the album found the music to be highly abrasive . Pareles asserted that unlike other electro @-@ industrial groups like Ministry and Nitzer Ebb , " Reznor writes full @-@ fledged tunes " with stronger use of melodies than riffs . He noticed criticisms of Nine Inch Nails from industrial purists for popularizing the genre and the album 's transgression . Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention ( ) rating and commented that , musically , the album was comparable to " <unk> Bosch as postindustrial atheist " , but lyrically more closely resembled " Transformers as kiddie porn . " Jonathan Gold , writing for Rolling Stone , likened the album to cyberpunk fiction . Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tom Sinclair commented : " Reznor 's pet topics ( sex , power , S & M , hatred , transcendence ) are all here , wrapped in hooks that hit your psyche with the force of a blowtorch . "

 The Downward Spiral has been listed on several publications ' best album lists . In 2003 , the album was ranked number 201 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and number 201 on its 2012 online edition . The Rolling Stone staff wrote : " <unk> up in the one @-@ time home of Manson @-@ family victim Sharon Tate , Trent Reznor made an overpowering meditation on NIN 's central theme : control . " The album was placed 10th on Spin 's 125 Best Albums of the Past 25 Years list ; the Spin staff quoted Ann Powers ' review that appreciated its bleak , aggressive style . It was ranked number 488 in the book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time by heavy metal music critic Martin Popoff . In 2001 , Q named The Downward Spiral as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums of All Time ; in 2010 , the album was ranked number 102 on their 250 Best Albums of Q 's Lifetime ( 1986 @-@ 2011 ) list . The Downward Spiral was featured in Robert Dimery 's book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .

In July 2014 , Guitar World placed The Downward Spiral at number 43 in their " Superunknown : 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994 " list .

 The immediate success of The Downward Spiral established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s . The band 's image and musical style became highly recognizable that a Gatorade commercial featured a remix of " Down in It " without its involvement . Reznor felt uncomfortable with the media hype and success the band earned , received false reports of his death , depression , and relationship with serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer , and was depicted as a sex icon due to his visual identity . Nine Inch Nails received several honors , including Grammy Award nominations for Best Alternative Performance for The Downward Spiral and Best Rock Song for " Hurt " . After the release of The Downward Spiral , many bands such as Gravity Kills , <unk> Westward , Filter , and Mötley Crüe made albums that imitated the sound of Nine Inch Nails . 
 Reznor interpreted The Downward Spiral as an extension of himself that " became the truth fulfilling itself , " as he experienced personal and social issues presented in the album after its release . He had already struggled with social anxiety disorder and depression and started his abuse of narcotics including cocaine while he went on an alcohol binge . Around this time , his studio perfectionism , struggles with addiction , and bouts of writer 's block prolonged the production of The Fragile , and Reznor completed rehabilitation from drugs in 2001 . 
 One year after The Downward Spiral 's release , Reznor produced an accompanying remix album entitled Further Down the Spiral , the only non @-@ major Nine Inch Nails release to be certified gold in the United States . It features contributions from Coil with Danny Hyde , J. G. Thirlwell , electronic musician Aphex Twin , producer Rick Rubin , and Jane 's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro . The album peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200 and received mixed reviews . <unk> , a remix EP of " Gave Up " , " Closer " , " The Downward Spiral " , and " Eraser " by Coil , was released on February 24 , 2014 via British record label Cold Spring . 
 Retrospective reviews regard The Downward Spiral as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and Reznor 's greatest work . The 2004 edition of The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album five out of five stars and called it " a powerful statement , and one of the landmark albums of the Nineties . " Writing for Entertainment Weekly , Kyle Anderson remembered watching the music video of " Closer " on MTV as an adolescent and expressed that the album changed his perception of popular music from that of songs heard on the radio to albums with cover art . Stereogum 's Tom Breihan remains favorable toward the album since it is " the one that most fully inhabits " Nine Inch Nails ' characteristics and influenced youth culture , with teenagers wearing ripped fish nets on their arms . The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .

 Its emphasis on transgressive themes made The Downward Spiral 's lyrics vulnerable to criticism from American social conservatives . Senator Bob Dole , then head of the Republican Party , sharply denounced Time Warner after a meeting between Michael J. Fuchs ( head of the Warner Music Group ) , William Bennett , and C. Delores Tucker , at which Tucker and Bennett demanded that Fuchs recite lyrics from " Big Man with a Gun " because they thought the song was an attack on American conservatives by metaphorically claiming within the lyrics that they have a jingoistic agenda . Interscope was blamed for releasing gangster rap albums by Dr. Dre , Tupac Shakur , and Snoop Dogg that were deemed objectionable . Reznor called Tucker ( who referred to Nine Inch Nails as a gangster rap act ) " such a fucking idiot " and claimed " Big Man with a Gun " was a satire of the genre and was originally about madness . Reznor conceded The Downward Spiral could be " harmful , through implying and subliminally suggesting things , " whereas hardcore hip hop can be " cartoonish . " Robert Bork also repeatedly referenced " Big Man with a Gun " in his book <unk> Toward Gomorrah as evidence of a cultural decline . The book incorrectly states that it is a rap song . 
 Before the Columbine High School massacre , perpetrator Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails multiple times in his journal . Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of the album as a symbol of his own depression . On May 4 , 1999 , a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television , music , film , and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation . The committee heard testimony from cultural observers , professors , and mental @-@ health professionals that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver , Reverend Charles J. Chaput . Participants criticized the album , Nine Inch Nails ' label @-@ mate Marilyn Manson , and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible . The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry 's marketing practices to minors . 
 In 2009 , Apple rejected a proposal for a Nine Inch Nails iPhone application , citing objectionable content in The Downward Spiral . Days later , Apple reversed the decision but refused to explain its reasoning .

 " Love on Top " is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her fourth studio album 4 ( 2011 ) . Inspired from her state of mind while playing Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records , Beyoncé wrote the song alongside Terius Nash and Shea Taylor ; its production was handled by Taylor and Beyoncé . A throw @-@ back to 1980s music , the uptempo R & B song exhibits style similar to that of Stevie Wonder , Whitney Houston and The Jackson 5 , among others . While incorporating four key changes , Beyoncé adopts a high range when repeating the song 's chorus towards the end of the song . She sings about a man whom she can always call , even after facing grief and hard work , finally earning his love and respect . 
 The song 's musical composition , as well as Beyoncé 's vocals and versatility , positively surprised critics . Beyoncé sang " Love on Top " live at 2011 MTV Video Music Awards , announcing her pregnancy at the end of her performance . This caused the upsurge of the song on several charts worldwide . It reached the top ten in Hungary and South Korea , and the top twenty in Australia , Italy , New Zealand and the United Kingdom . It also debuted at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and became the second highest debut of Beyoncé 's career as a solo artist . " Love on Top " remained at number one on the US Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks , and has sold over one million copies . At the 55th Grammy Awards , Beyoncé won her 17th Grammy Award with Best Traditional R & B Performance for " Love on Top " . 
 Mainly inspired by the work of the American band New Edition , the accompanying music video for " Love on Top " shows Beyoncé along with five male dancers , performing choreographed moves in a penthouse studio in New York City overlooking the Hudson River towards New Jersey . Critics generally commended the simplicity of the video , the wardrobe changes with every key change , and Beyoncé 's youthful exuberance throughout the clip . The song was part of the singer 's set lists on the residency shows 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé ( 2011 ) and Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live ( 2012 ) , as well as The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour ( 2013 – 14 ) and The Formation World Tour ( 2016 ) . Critics noted that the song was even more impressive in person and that going through the last four key changes while performing it live remains a difficult task .

 " Love on Top " was written by Beyoncé , Terius Nash and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Beyoncé and Taylor . From June 16 to June 27 , 2011 , the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyoncé 's official website , paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and a quote . On June 26 , 2011 , " Love on Top " was the eighth song to be chosen . The quote found Beyoncé elaborating on the song 's inspiration : 
 " When I played Etta James [ in the 2008 musical biopic , Cadillac Records ] it was the most I 'd learned about myself until the recording of this album . When I went into the studio I used the same passion , honesty , and approach with my vocals I channeled as Etta James . It does not sound like the vocals on my past albums . It 's a lot rawer . It comes from a deep place . " 
 Beyoncé , who has covered " At Last " which is a song originally recorded by James , portrayed the artist in the 2008 musical biopic , Cadillac Records and won critical acclaim for her portrayal . She told Billboard magazine : " I realized that Etta James was so unapologetic , bold and strong that playing her was a big risk for me . It gave me the confidence and the push to challenge myself a little more with my music . " " Love on Top " impacted Urban radio in the United States on January 10 , 2012 , as the fourth single from the album in that country .

 " Love on Top " is an up @-@ tempo R & B song viewed as a modern take on old school music . It also exhibits elements of retro @-@ soul music , retro @-@ pop , the 1980s pop music , funk music , jazz , and the 1970s classic disco music , as stated by Joanne Dorken of MTV UK , Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun and Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun @-@ Times . According to Slant Magazine 's Eric Henderson , " Love on Top " is a " bright , breezy tribute to the freshness of mid- [ 19 ] 80s , pre @-@ new @-@ jack @-@ FM R & B reminiscent of Whitney Houston and Anita Baker . " He also noted the song to be the " perfect and totally inverted fraternal twin " of another song on 4 , being " Rather Die Young " . " Love on Top " ' s retro elements are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps , a " distorted " bass groove , and a melding of horns as well as sweet backing harmonies , especially in the bridge and the chorus of the song . It is instrumentally complete with a thumping bassline , synthesizers , tribal drums , an arena @-@ rock music piano , a guitar , a peppy saxophone , and some backing vocals . Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice compared " Love on Top " to <unk> 's " You Can 't Change That " ( 1979 ) and New Edition 's " Mr. Telephone Man " ( 1984 ) . Priya Elan of NME noted that " Love on Top " echoes Janet Jackson 's " Whoops Now " ( 1995 ) , Lionel Richie 's " Dancing on the Ceiling " ( 1986 ) and the theme from My Two Dads . 
 According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing , " Love on Top " is mainly written in the key of C major with a tempo of 94 beats per minute . Beyoncé 's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of A ♭ 3 to the high note of C6 . " Love on Top " is set as " both a sweet love song and an expression of girl power " as stated by Georgette Cline of AOL Music . Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club and David Amidon of PopMatters noted that " Love on Top " features " mature lyrics " alongside Beyoncé " sounding vocally giddy and aggressive while portraying the message . " Lyrically , the song finds Beyoncé as the female protagonist expressing the happiness she feels to have her love interest in her life . " The languid , synth @-@ soul <unk> allows for enjoyably euphoric tone " before she chimes in with " Bring the beat in ! " , introducing " a mid @-@ album interlude of mid- [ 19 ] 80s pop " , as stated by Andy Gill of The Independent as well as Hamish MacBain of NME . 
 Rich Juzwiak noted that Beyoncé " ecstatically and <unk> " changes keys six times during the entire song . As stated by Scott Shetler of PopCrush , she constantly sings praises of her love interest in the first verse where she also seemingly sends him subtle digs as he did not give her his full attention in the past , this being illustrated in lyrics such as , " after fighting through my fears [ ... ] finally you 've put me first . " The chorus , complimented with sweet backing harmonies , then arrives , with Beyoncé chanting , " Baby it 's you , you 're the one I love / You 're the one I need / You 're the only one I see / Come on baby it 's you / You 're the one that gives your all / You 're the one I can always call / When I need you make everything stop / Finally you put my love on top . " The chorus carries the final two minutes of the song through four key changes , proceeding to D ♭ , then to D , E ♭ and finally to E. This was highlighted by Henderson who wrote that " the spirit carries both her and the song into a Stevie Wonder @-@ reminiscent climax of continually rising key changes . " In this way , the word " baby " is said about 24 times throughout the song . As soon as the synthesizers drop out , the song fades out almost instantaneously .

 " Love on Top " received acclaim by critics , who appreciated the 1980s @-@ vibe Beyoncé attempted and they compared the song to multiple artists of that time , including Stevie Wonder and Whitney Houston . Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice complimented it as " easy listening / easier dancing boogie vibe " . Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club viewed " Love on Top " as an exception on the album due to its up @-@ tempo nature , calling it " a first @-@ listen earworm with its breezy , retro @-@ soul style . " Matthew Horton of BBC joked about the climax of the song , stating that the album 4 " was named after the four key changes in the final , teetering chorus of ' Love on Top ' to ram the point home . " Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commended the song for putting a " bounce " in Beyoncé 's step . Similarly , Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone named " Love on Top " " a blast " as Beyoncé creates a modern take on old @-@ school Whitney Houston . Hamish MacBain of NME favored the song 's up @-@ tempo style , stating that it was much needed after the " ballad @-@ heavy " first half of the album . Priya Elan of the same publication commented that it has " 100 watt smile lyrics " . Stating that " Love on Top " is reminiscent of 1980s R & B , Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine complimented the song as a " Halcyon love song , perfect to be whisked away to " . Spence D. of IGN commented that Beyoncé 's " cheery disposition " and the " brash horns " will remind listeners of " damn good " mid @-@ 1980s R & B can be . While including the song as a " must hear " from the album , Andy Gill of The Independent named " Love on Top " as " a small footnote to Stevie Wonder 's innovatory genius . " Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised Beyoncé 's vocals and called " Love on Top " a " well @-@ written " song . 
 Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also gave " Love on Top " a positive review , favoring its " infectious upbeat spirit " and comparing it to the styling of Stevie Wonder , Anita Baker and Whitney Houston . He also complimented the fact that the various key changes throughout the song " force Beyoncé out of her scold range and into some winningly girlish soprano whoops . " Similarly , Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle commented that " Love on Top " is a " bouncy jam " which finds Beyoncé in " feel @-@ good diva mode " . He added that it might have turned up on early albums from Natalie Cole , Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey . Guerra concluded that Beyoncé " rarely has sounded so charming , even as she soars through several key changes . " Mikael Wood of Spin magazine noted that the song " imagines a perfect genetic splice " of Whitney Houston 's eponymous debut album and Michael Jackson 's Off the Wall . Ricky Schweitzer of One Thirty BPM stated that " Love on Top " is instantaneously reminiscent of Michael Jackson , Janet Jackson and Stevie Wonder , and favored Beyoncé 's numerous key changes , writing : 
 <unk> On Top ' employs a similar pacing [ to ' Party ' ] , though tonally , this track reminds one more immediately of Michael and Janet Jackson , as well as Stevie Wonder . This effervescent throwback escapes corniness by reveling in its pure joy and as such , it becomes one of the highlights of the album . The numerous key changes that flood the end of the song could seem masturbatory , but Beyoncé is not proving that she can sing as high as Mariah [ Carey ] or Whitney [ Houston ] because we already trust her to . It is energy and not ego that drives the constantly rising progression . 
 Becky Bain of the website Idolator viewed " Love on Top " as " joyful tune that doubles as a throwback to a simpler time " and added that Beyoncé 's energy is " infectious " . Conrad Tao of Sputnikmusic showed high favoritism towards " Love on Top " , writing : " [ ... ] as she forces herself into a rarely used high range , she sets for a perfect catharsis for the burgeoning sexual passions of the album 's first two thirds " , and describing the outcome as " absolutely magnificent " . Melinda Newman of HitFix commented " the soulful , exuberant , mid @-@ tempo finger snapper , ' Love On Top ' is deliciously sunny and sweet . " James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that " Love on Top ' sounds like the pretty young thing of Michael Jackson 's ' P.Y.T. ' grew up to make a sequel to that 1983 hit . " Similarly , Joanne Dorken of MTV UK who described " Love on Top " as " scream [ ing ] ' classic disco ' , catchy , [ being ] more uptempo and differing from the rest of the album " , concluded that the song shows Beyoncé 's versatility and that it is " very Jackson 5 " . Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that " Love on Top " is summery and " laidback , rather than massively immediate " . However , he added that it proves to be a grower as it " ratchets up the key changes on the final third " , further writing that Beyoncé 's voice sounds " particularly impressive " . A mixed review came from Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly , who compared Beyoncé 's work on " Love on Top " to that of past idols such as Luther Vandross and Diana Ross , but felt the tone overshadowed her style , stating " she gets lost in her idols ' polyester @-@ swathed shadows . " Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song was " slinky but nowhere near sexy " adding that it sounds like a song young Brandy Norwood would release .

 James Montgomery of MTV News placed " Love on Top " at number nine on his list of the 25 Best Songs Of 2011 . He called it " a throwback jam " to Beyoncé 's older R & B material , stating that " [ it 's ] big , bold , brassy and blissed @-@ out , [ and ] it represents everything B was going for on her 4 album " . Montgomery also noted that the song was an " absolute lifesaver " and " as is the case with all of her best tunes , Beyoncé belts here " . Slant Magazine 's staff members listed " Love on Top " as the 24th best song of the year , with Eric Henderson commenting that " somewhere between [ 4 's ] copious ballads and its few , hyperventilating dance tracks , Beyoncé strikes a perfect balance with this breezy midtempo tribute to the 1980s . " On The Village Voice 's Pazz & Jop critic year @-@ end list in 2011 , " Love on Top " was ranked at number 51 . Additionally , Nick Murray of the same publication included the song on his list of 53 Great Songs From 2011 .

 The music video for " Love on Top " was directed by Ed Burke and Beyoncé . A preview of the clip was shown on the Australian television program , Sunday Night , on October 9 , 2011 . The visuals showed Beyoncé in a black leotard , stockings , high @-@ top sneakers , and medal @-@ adorned Czech military cap . Together with her five male dancers , they perform choreographed moves at Canoe Studios , a penthouse studio in West Chelsea overlooking New York City . The preview was inspired by the music video for " If It Isn 't Love " by American band New Edition and was described as " stripped @-@ down " by Tom Ayres of Digital Spy . The full video was initially supposed to be premiered on October 17 , 2011 , on Australia 's Today Show . However , the release date was pushed up a day and it was released on October 16 , 2011 , instead . That same day , Beyoncé posted the following statement regarding the video on her official website : 
 I am excited to give my Australian fans the World Premiere of ' Love On Top ' ! Thank you for the amazing response to the song at radio . I have worked very hard on this video , this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on some of my favorite male groups . I remember seeing videos from New Edition , The Jackson 5 and the Temptations , bands I love for their beautiful harmonies , and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself . It was so much fun . I put my heart and soul into ' Love On Top ' and I hope you love it . 
 After the release of the sneak peek , Michael Bivins of the New Edition told <unk> , " When I saw Beyonce on the MTV awards in the sequined jacket this year and with the dancers in R & B group positions , I knew then she was showing love to NE ! The video teaser was part two ... the classic video ' If It Isn 't Love ' reference . " After the release of the full video , Johnny Gill told <unk> magazine that he considers " Love on Top " ' s video to be a tribute and that Beyoncé as well as her backup dancers did a great job of capturing New Edition 's essence . In his opinion , that is why " she is one of the greatest living performers . " He went on to say , " [ The video ] was so cool . There 's no more Michael Jackson but I think she 's a beast to begin with . It 's such an honor to have someone who knew , and knows , her history and to be aware of where it all started . "

 Although the song is 4 minutes and 27 seconds long , the video is 3 minutes and 17 seconds long due to the omission of the second verse . Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine and Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the fact that Beyoncé wears several different clothes including the dress that was worn during her performance at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards . The clip starts with a casually dressed Beyoncé moving in coordination with her male back @-@ up dancers who are also wearing casual clothes and Nike <unk> . Wearing a black body suit with black hose , Beyoncé puts on a display of footwork before breaking into the song . About halfway through , the visuals suddenly switch to night as the singer lights up the space in various formal looks , including a gold pantsuit , white suit , and finally a tuxedo complete with coattails , top hat , and cane . The choreography from here resembles that of the 1960s male groups . The wardrobe changes in fact correspond with every key change , except the final one . The video ends with Beyoncé yelling " cut ! " and the shot returns to them at rehearsal .

 Consequence of Sound 's Alex Young praised the simplicity of the concept adding that it costs " more money than your entire life fortune . " That was echoed by Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine who called the video " super @-@ simplistic , albeit effective . " Sarah Fitzmaurice of Daily Mail also gave a positive review for the video praising its simple and energetic concept accompanied by the " fierce outfits " . A writer of OK ! compared the video with Will Smith 's work in The Fresh Prince of Bel @-@ Air adding that Beyoncé " has gone back to video basics . " A writer of The Huffington Post called the video a " fresh take on a New Edition classic " and concluded that it was a " lot more simple than it sounds . " Lisa Potter of Marie Claire also praised the energy and Beyoncé 's figure in the video , writing , " The pregnant superstar puts on another energetic performance during the video , showing off her fabulous figure in a skimpy black leotard complete with a military fetish cap and Isabel <unk> sneakers , before changing into a series of tailored suits . " Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the video was similar to Michael Jackson 's Dangerous era adding , " While some might say the basic concept of Beyoncé 's ' Love On Top ' video is too straightforward , we actually think it 's amazing – just let Beyoncé sing , dance , look <unk> and wear a cute hat ! What else do you people need ? ! " Maura Johnston of The Village Voice described the video as a direct homage to New Edition 's " If It Isn 't Love " but added that when the song 's key changes start , " Beyoncé and her posse of backup dancers get a bit <unk> and fancier " . She further wrote that the video was something that Phil Collins " would be proud " of . 
 Comparing the video with works by Stevie Wonder , Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote , " compared to the over @-@ the @-@ top sensory overload of ' Countdown , ' the ' Love On Top ' clip is very simple and straightforward , with the singer performing with backup singers and dancers in a spare room . Still , she changes wardrobe with every key change as the song reaches its euphoric climax . " Similarly , Leah Collins of Dose magazine wrote , " New jack swing dance moves and costume changes are pretty much the focus of this one . [ ... ] Still , Beyonce reveals a talent we never knew she had : the ability to switch costumes every time she switches keys . ( This , it turns out , is a good thing . That <unk> African dictator look in the first scene ? Maybe we 're the only ones , but we 're not really feeling Idi Amin @-@ chic this season . ) " Georgette Cline of The Boombox found similarities between the video for " Love on Top " and the earlier videos that Beyoncé made with Destiny 's Child while Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post called the video fancy and an " obvious homage to New Edition 's ' If It Isn ’ t Love . ' " A more mixed review was given by Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine who wrote that " The video will do nothing to silence Beyoncé plagiarism or baby bump conspiracy theorists ; the first half borrows from an old New Edition video , and the entire thing was clearly filmed before her bump began to show . " However , she added , " Still , Vulture salutes any artistic undertaking that requires a costume change with every key change . " The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards and in the category for Best Female Video at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards . It won Best Dance Performance at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards .

 Beyoncé performed " Love on Top " live for the first time on August 14 , 2011 , during her residency show 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé held at Roseland Ballroom in New York City . Wearing a gold dress , she performed the song in front of 3 @,@ 500 people and she was backed by her all @-@ female band and her backing singers , called the Mamas . For the performance , " Love on Top " was given an " uptempo overhaul " and eventually got everyone " moving to the catchy [ synthesizers ] " , as stated by Mike Wass of Idolator . Wass also wrote that " Love on Top " was one of the highlights of the concert . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times gave Beyoncé critical acclaim , favoring performances of " underdog tracks " such as " Party " and " Love on Top " . Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone also complimented Beyoncé 's performance of the song , commending how she turned " the groovy ' Love on Top ' into a vintage soul showcase , dropping on bended knee to unleash melismas at the top of her vocal range . " Jozen Cummings of The Wall Street Journal commented that " the focus was on her voice [ on ] ' Love on Top ' [ ... ] she changes key four times — impressive on the album but even more so in person . " Yolanda Sangweni of Essence magazine stated that the fact that Beyoncé goes through four key changes is " quite a feat for any singer . " The live performance was later included on the DVD Live at Roseland : Elements of 4 which chronicled the concert . It premiered online and released on the iTunes Store on January 11 , 2012 . 
 In May 2012 , Beyoncé performed " Love on Top " during her residency show Revel Presents : Beyoncé Live in Atlantic City . Beyoncé started singing the song by saying , " Atlantic City , snap your fingers " . According to Maura Johnston of The Village Voice , the crowd " sang the chorus of ' Love On Top ' and even ... tried its endlessly modulating key @-@ change while Beyoncé watched with bemusement and delight " . Chuck Darrow of The Philadelphia Inquirer was positive about the performance of the song during the concert , saying , " As for the music , Beyonce kept the needle in the red zone for much of the show , dealing primarily in such full @-@ throttle , groove @-@ intensive signature tracks as ' Love on Top ' " . Tris McCall of New Jersey On @-@ Line noted that she " made the most of each modulation and break " while performing the song . Rebecca Thomas of MTV News was also positive about the performance , writing , " Without missing a step of the New Edition @-@ inspired choreography , B powered through the song 's modulations in an extended vocal showcase . " The performance of " Love on Top " on the concert was later included on the concert film Live in Atlantic City ( 2013 ) . 
 Beyoncé sang the chorus of the song a capella during the opening of her Super Bowl XLVII halftime show performance . In 2013 and 2014 , the song was part of the set list of Beyoncé 's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour . On May 8 , 2013 , while performing the song in Manchester , she held her microphone out a random audience member , which turned out to be British singer Joe McElderry , who sang a line of the song through the microphone , Beyoncé responding " Wow , you sound beautiful " and holding her microphone out to him again . An a cappella version of the song was performed in 2016 as part of the setlist of The Formation World Tour .

 At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards , Beyoncé performed " Love on Top " after having said on the black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage that she would be making an announcement . Before beginning her live performance , she said to the audience : " Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet , I want you to feel the love that 's growing inside of me " , giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet . She took the stage in " a purple spangly tuxedo jacket , black pants and white tuxedo shirt , still rocking her fierce six @-@ inch heels of old , pregnant or not " , as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News . As she performed , her blond hair blowing in the wind , and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering <unk> , Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics : " Now everybody asks me why I 'm smiling out from ear to ear . " She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing " Love on Top " . Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down , she encouraged the audience to put their hands together . Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone , opening her jacket , rubbing her belly , and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world . 
 Describing Beyoncé as " a veteran on the VMA stage " , Kaufman wrote that " the audience was clearly feeling the love also " and praised how she " [ got ] a bit wild as she brought the tune home with some of her signature . " Staff members of the AOL 's The Boombox commented that the lyrics of the song " felt especially meaningful " to announce her pregnancy to the world . Staff members of Rolling Stone called the performance " spectacular " while Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times called it " rousing " . Claire Suddath of Time magazine commented that " this offering from the reigning queen of pop music is relatively toned down and yet she still looked and sounded better than nearly everyone else at the awards . " Similarly , Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly wrote that " If you had to pick one defining moment , it would have to be Beyoncé ’ s baby bump . The diva 's rendition of ' Love on Top ' might not have been her best VMA performance ever , but there ’ s no denying the sheer electricity in the room when she ended her set by proudly revealing her pregnant tummy . " A critic of Essence magazine concluded that " [ Beyoncé 's ] performance of ' Love on Top ' at the 2011 VMAs [ ... ] will surely be one of the year 's most memorable pop culture moments . " The writers of MTV News placed the performance at number 4 on their list of Best Live MTV Performances of 2011 . It was stated that Beyoncé was in " typical Sasha Fierce fashion " while the performance was described as " ebullient " . Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine put the performance at number two on her list of " Beyonce 's 5 Biggest TV Performances " adding that it was " one of the most memorable TV moments of her career " . Dan Hyman from Rolling Stone listed the performance and Beyoncé 's announcement of her pregnancy at number 17 on the list of " The 24 Wildest Moments in VMA History " , while Billboard listed it at number 7 on its list of " MTV VMAs ' 10 Best Performances Ever " in 2013 .

 = Canidae = 
 The biological family Canidae / <unk> / is a lineage of carnivorans that includes domestic dogs , wolves , foxes , jackals , dingoes , and many other extant and extinct dog @-@ like mammals . A member of this family is called a canid ( / <unk> / , / <unk> / ) . 
 The cat @-@ like feliforms and dog @-@ like caniforms emerged within the <unk> 43 million years before present . The caniforms included the fox @-@ like Leptocyon genus whose various species existed from 34 million years before present before branching 11 @.@ 9 million <unk> into Vulpini ( foxes ) and Canini ( canines ) . 
 Canids are found on all continents except Antarctica , having arrived independently or accompanied human beings over extended periods of time . Canids vary in size from the 2 @-@ m @-@ long ( 6 ft 7 in ) gray wolf to the 24 @-@ cm @-@ long ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) fennec fox . The body forms of canids are similar , typically having long muzzles , upright ears , teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh , long legs , and bushy tails . They are mostly social animals , living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively . Typically , only the dominant pair in a group breeds , and a litter of young is reared annually in an underground den . Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations . One canid , the domestic dog ( including the dingo ) , long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 All living canids as a group form a monophyletic relationship with the extinct <unk> through both groups having a bicuspid ( two points ) on the lower carnassial talonid , which gives this tooth an additional ability in mastication . This together with the development of a distinct entoconid cusp and the broadening of the talonid of the first lower molar , and the corresponding enlargement of the talon of the upper first molar and reduction of its parastyle distinguish these late Cenozoic canids and are the essential differences that identify their clade . 
 = = = Phylogenetic relationships = = = 
 Within the Canidae , the results of allozyme and chromosome analyses have previously suggested several phylogenetic divisions : 
 The wolf @-@ like canids , ( genus Canis , Cuon and Lycaon ) including the dog ( Canis lupus familiaris ) , gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) , red wolf ( Canis rufus ) , eastern wolf ( Canis <unk> ) , coyote ( Canis latrans ) , golden jackal ( Canis aureus ) , Ethiopian wolf ( Canis <unk> ) , black @-@ backed jackal ( Canis <unk> ) , side @-@ striped jackal ( Canis adustus ) , dhole ( Cuon alpinus ) , and African wild dog ( Lycaon pictus ) . 
 The fox @-@ like canids , which include the kit fox ( " Vulpes <unk> " ) , red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) , Cape fox ( Vulpes <unk> ) , Arctic fox ( Vulpes lagopus ) , and fennec fox ( Vulpes <unk> ) . 
 The South American canids , including the bush dog ( Speothos venaticus ) , hoary fox ( Lycalopex <unk> ) , crab @-@ eating fox ( Cerdocyon thous ) and maned wolf . 
 Various monotypic taxa , including the bat @-@ eared fox ( Otocyon megalotis ) , gray fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus ) , and raccoon dog ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 DNA analysis shows that the first three form monophyletic clades . The wolf @-@ like canids and the fox @-@ like canids together form the tribe Canini . Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf @-@ like canines ( Canis , Cuon , and Lycaon ) , with the jackals being the most basal of this group . The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog , and the fox @-@ like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford 's fox . The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades , however this topological difference is not strongly supported . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 The Canidae today includes a diverse group of some 34 species ranging in size from the maned wolf with its long limbs to the short @-@ legged bush dog . Modern canids inhabit forests , tundra , savannahs and deserts throughout tropical and temperate parts of the world . The evolutionary relationships between the species have been studied in the past using morphological approaches but more recently , molecular studies have enabled the investigation of phylogenetic relationships . In some species , genetic divergence has been suppressed by the high level of gene flow between different populations and where the species have hybridized , large hybrid zones exist . 
 = = = Eocene epoch = = = 
 <unk> evolved from <unk> about 55 million years ago ( Mya ) during the late Paleocene . Some five million years later , the carnivorans split into two main divisions : caniforms ( dog @-@ like ) and feliforms ( cat @-@ like ) . By 40 Mya , the first member of the dog family proper had arisen . Called Prohesperocyon wilsoni , its fossilized remains have been found in what is now the southwestern part of Texas . The chief features which identify it as a canid include the loss of the upper third molar ( part of a trend toward a more shearing bite ) , and the structure of the middle ear which has an enlarged bulla ( the hollow bony structure protecting the delicate parts of the ear ) . Prohesperocyon probably had slightly longer limbs than its predecessors , and also had parallel and closely touching toes which differ markedly from the splayed arrangements of the digits in bears . 
 The canid family soon subdivided into three subfamilies , each of which diverged during the Eocene : Hesperocyoninae ( about 39 @.@ 74 @-@ 15 Mya ) , Borophaginae ( about 34 @-@ 2 Mya ) , and Caninae ( about 34 @-@ 0 Mya ) . Caninae is the only surviving subfamily and all present @-@ day canids including wolves , foxes , coyotes , jackals , and domestic dogs belong to it . Members of each subfamily showed an increase in body mass with time , and some exhibited specialised <unk> diets that made them prone to extinction . 
 = = = Oligocene epoch = = = 
 By the Oligocene , all three subfamilies of canids ( Hesperocyoninae , Borophaginae , and Caninae ) had appeared in the fossil records of North America . The earliest and most primitive branch of the Canidae was the Hesperocyoninae lineage , which included the coyote @-@ sized Mesocyon of the Oligocene ( 38 @-@ 24 Mya ) . These early canids probably evolved for the fast pursuit of prey in a grassland habitat ; they resembled modern civets in appearance . <unk> eventually became extinct in the middle Miocene . One of the early members of the <unk> , the genus Hesperocyon , gave rise to Archaeocyon and Leptocyon . These branches led to the <unk> and canine radiations . 
 = = = Miocene epoch = = = 
 Around 9 – 10 Mya during the Late Miocene , Canis , Urocyon , and Vulpes genera expanded from southwestern North America , where the canine radiation began . The success of these canines was related to the development of lower carnassials that were capable of both mastication and shearing . Around 8 Mya , the Beringian land bridge allowed members of the genus Eucyon a means to enter Asia and they continued on to colonise Europe . 
 = = = Pliocene epoch = = = 
 During the Pliocene , around 4 – 5 Mya , Canis lepophagus appeared in North America . This was small and sometimes coyote @-@ like . Others were wolf @-@ like in characteristics . Canis latrans ( the coyote ) is theorized to have descended from Canis lepophagus . 
 The formation of the Isthmus of Panama , about 3 Mya , joined South America to North America , allowing canids to invade South America , where they diversified . However the most recent common ancestor of the South American canids lived in North America some 4 Mya and the likelihood is that there were more than one incursion across the new land bridge . One of the resulting lineages consisted of the gray fox ( Urocyon <unk> ) and the now extinct dire wolf ( Canis dirus ) . The other lineage consisted of the so @-@ called South American endemic species , the maned wolf ( Chrysocyon brachyurus ) , the short @-@ eared dog ( Atelocynus <unk> ) , the bush dog ( Speothos venaticus ) , the crab @-@ eating fox ( Cerdocyon thous ) and the South American foxes ( Lycalopex spp . ) . The monophyly of this group has been established by molecular means . 
 = = = Pleistocene epoch = = = 
 During the Pleistocene , the North American wolf line appeared , with Canis edwardii , clearly identifiable as a wolf , and Canis rufus appeared , possibly a direct descendent of Canis edwardii . Around 0 @.@ 8 Mya , Canis <unk> emerged in North America . A large wolf , it was found all over North and Central America , and was eventually supplanted by its descendant , the dire wolf , which then spread into South America during the late Pleistocene . 
 By 0 @.@ 3 Mya , a number of subspecies of the gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) had developed and had spread throughout Europe and northern Asia . The gray wolf colonized North America during the late Rancholabrean era across the Bering land bridge , there being at least three separate invasions , with each one consisting of one or more different Eurasian gray wolf clades . <unk> studies have shown that there are at least four extant C. lupus lineages . The dire wolf shared its habitat with the gray wolf but became extinct in a large @-@ scale extinction event that occurred around 11 @,@ 500 years ago . It may have been more of a scavenger than a hunter ; its molars appear to be adapted for crushing bones and it may have died out as a result of the extinction of the large herbivorous animals on whose carcases it relied . 
 In 2015 , a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and whole genome nuclear sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf @-@ like canids have colonised Africa from Eurasia at least 5 times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene , which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of African canid fauna diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors , likely coincident with Plio @-@ Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions . When comparing the African and Eurasian golden jackals , the study concluded that the African specimens represented a distinct monophyletic lineage that should be recognized as a separate species , Canis <unk> ( African golden wolf ) . According to a phylogeny derived from nuclear sequences , the Eurasian golden jackal ( Canis aureus ) diverged from the wolf / coyote lineage 1 @.@ 9 million years ago but the African golden wolf separated 1 @.@ 3 million years ago . Mitochondrial genome sequences indicated the Ethiopian wolf diverged from the wolf / coyote lineage slightly prior to that . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Wild canids are found on every continent except Antarctica , and inhabit a wide range of different habitats , including deserts , mountains , forests , and grasslands . They vary in size from the fennec fox , which may be as little as 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) in length and weigh 0 @.@ 6 kg ( 1 @.@ 3 lb ) , to the gray wolf , which may be up to 160 cm ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) long , and can weigh up to 79 kg ( 174 lb ) . Only a few species are arboreal – the North American gray fox , the closely related Channel Island fox , and the raccoon dog habitually climb trees . 
 All canids have a similar basic form , as exemplified by the grey wolf , although the relative length of muzzle , limbs , ears and tail vary considerably between species . With the exceptions of the bush dog , raccoon dog , and some domestic breeds of Canis lupus , canids have relatively long legs and lithe bodies , adapted for chasing prey . The tails are bushy and the length and quality of the pelage varies with the season . The muzzle portion of the skull is much more elongated than that of the cat family . The zygomatic arches are wide , there is a transverse <unk> ridge at the rear of the cranium and in some species , a sagittal crest running from front to back . The bony orbits around the eye never form a complete ring and the auditory bullae are smooth and rounded . 
 All canids are digitigrade , meaning they walk on their toes . The tip of the nose is always naked , as are the cushioned pads on the soles of the feet . These latter consist of a single pad behind the tip of each toe and a more @-@ or @-@ less three @-@ lobed central pad under the roots of the digits . Hairs grow between the pads and in the Arctic fox , the sole of the foot is densely covered with hair at some times of year . With the exception of the four @-@ toed African hunting dog ( Lycaon pictus ) , there are five toes on the forefeet but the pollex ( thumb ) is reduced and does not reach the ground . On the hind feet , there are four toes , but in some domestic dogs , a fifth vestigial toe , known as a dewclaw , is sometimes present but has no anatomical connection to the rest of the foot . The slightly curved nails are non @-@ retractile and more or less blunt . 
 The penis in male canids is supported by a bone called the baculum . It also contains a structure at the base called the bulbus <unk> which helps to create a copulatory tie during mating , locking the animals together for up to an hour . Young canids are born blind , with their eyes opening a few weeks after birth . All living canids ( Caninae ) have a ligament analogous to the nuchal ligament of ungulates used to maintain the posture of the head and neck with little active muscle exertion ; this ligament allows them to conserve energy while running long distances following scent trails with their nose to the ground . However , based on skeletal details of the neck , at least some Borophaginae ( such as Aelurodon ) are believed to have lacked this ligament . 
 = = = Dentition = = = 
 Most canids have 42 teeth , with a dental formula of : 3 @.@ 1 @.@ 4 @.@ 23 @.@ 1 @.@ 4 @.@ 3 . The bush dog has only one upper molar with two below , the dhole has two above and two below , and the bat @-@ eared fox has three or four upper molars and four lower ones . The molar teeth are strong in most species , allowing the animals to crack open bone to reach the marrow . The deciduous , or baby teeth , formula in canids is 3 @.@ 1 @.@ 33 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 , molars being completely absent . 
 = = Social behavior = = 
 Almost all canids are social animals and live together in groups . In general , they are territorial or have a home range and sleep in the open , using their dens only for breeding and sometimes in bad weather . In most foxes , and in many of the true dogs , a male and female pair work together to hunt and to raise their young . Gray wolves and some of the other larger canids live in larger groups called packs . African wild dogs have packs which may consist of twenty to forty animals , and packs of fewer than about seven individuals may be incapable of successful reproduction . Hunting in packs has the advantage that larger prey items can be tackled . Some species form packs or live in small family groups depending on the circumstances , including the type of available food . In most species , some individuals live on their own . Within a canid pack , there is a system of dominance so that the strongest , most experienced animals lead the pack . In most cases , the dominant male and female are the only pack members to breed . 
 Canids communicate with each other by scent signals , by visual clues and gestures , and by vocalizations such as growls , barks , and howls . In most cases , groups have a home territory from which they drive out other conspecifics . The territory is marked by leaving urine scent marks , which warn trespassing individuals . Social behaviour is also mediated by secretions from glands on the upper surface of the tail near its root and from the anal glands . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Canids as a group exhibit several reproductive traits that are uncommon among mammals as a whole . They are typically monogamous , provide paternal care to their offspring , have reproductive cycles with lengthy <unk> and <unk> phases and have a copulatory tie during mating . They also retain adult offspring in the social group , suppressing the ability of these to breed while making use of the alloparental care they can provide to help raise the next generation of offspring . 
 During the <unk> period , increased levels of <unk> make the female attractive to the male . There is a rise in progesterone during the <unk> phase and the female is now receptive . Following this , the level of <unk> fluctuates and there is a lengthy <unk> phase during which the female is pregnant . Pseudo @-@ pregnancy frequently occurs in canids that have ovulated but failed to conceive . A period of <unk> follows pregnancy or pseudo @-@ pregnancy , there being only one <unk> period during each breeding season . Small and medium @-@ sized canids mostly have a gestation period of fifty to sixty days while larger species average sixty to sixty @-@ five days . The time of year in which the breeding season occurs is related to the length of day , as has been demonstrated in the case of several species that have been translocated across the equator to the other hemisphere and experiences a six @-@ month shift of phase . Domestic dogs and certain small canids in captivity may come into oestrus more frequently , perhaps because the photoperiod stimulus breaks down under conditions of artificial lighting . 
 The size of a litter varies , with from one to sixteen or more pups being born . The young are born small , blind and helpless and require a long period of parental care . They are kept in a den , most often dug into the ground , for warmth and protection . When the young begin eating solid food , both parents , and often other pack members , bring food back for them from the hunt . This is most often vomited up from the adult 's stomach . Where such pack involvement in the feeding of the litter occurs , the breeding success rate is higher than is the case where females split from the group and rear their pups in isolation . Young canids may take a year to mature and learn the skills they need to survive . In some species , such as the African wild dog , male offspring usually remain in the natal pack , while females disperse as a group , and join another small group of the opposite sex to form a new pack . 
 = = = Inbreeding avoidance = = = 
 Because the African wild dog ( Lycaon pictus ) largely exists in fragmented small populations , its existence is endangered . Inbreeding avoidance via mate selection is characteristic of the species and has important potential consequences for population persistence . Inbreeding is rare within natal packs . Computer @-@ population simulations indicate that all populations continuing to avoid incestuous mating will become extinct within 100 years due to the unavailability of unrelated mates . Thus the impact of reduced numbers of suitable unrelated mates will likely have a severe demographic impact on the future viability of small wild dog populations . 
 Red wolves primarily live in packs composed of a socially monogamous breeding pair and offspring of different ages . Using long @-@ term data on red wolf individuals of known pedigree , it was found that inbreeding among first @-@ degree relatives was rare . A likely mechanism for avoidance of inbreeding is independent dispersal trajectories from the natal pack . Many of the young wolves spend time alone or in small non @-@ breeding packs composed of unrelated individuals . The union of two unrelated individuals in a new home range is the predominant pattern of breeding pair formation . 
 Among Ethiopian wolves , most females disperse from their natal pack at about two years of age , and some become " floaters " that may successfully immigrate into existing packs . Breeding pairs are most often unrelated to each other , suggesting that female @-@ biased dispersal reduces inbreeding . 
 Grey wolves and Arctic foxes also exhibit inbreeding avoidance . 
 Inbreeding is ordinarily avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness ( inbreeding depression ) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles . Cross @-@ fertilization between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny . 
 = = = Inbreeding depression = = = 
 On the basis of an analysis of data on 42 @,@ 855 dachshund litters , it was found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased , litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased , thus indicating inbreeding depression . 
 = = Canids and humans = = 
 One canid , the domestic dog , entered into a partnership with humans a long time ago . This partnership is documented as far back as 26 @,@ 000 years ago , when the footprints of a young boy aged about eight to ten was found in Chauvet Cave in southern France , walking alongside what was identified as a large dog or wolf . The earliest recorded fossil of a dog was found to be around 36 @,@ 000 years ago in <unk> Cave in Belgium . Even earlier , wolves were found fossilized in the same locations as humans at sites that date back 300 @,@ 000 years , showing how far back humans and wolves had interactions with one another . The fact that wolves are pack animals with cooperative social structures may have been the reason that the relationship developed . Humans benefited from the canid 's loyalty , cooperation , teamwork , alertness and tracking abilities while the wolf may have benefited from the use of weapons to tackle larger prey and the sharing of food . Humans and dogs may have evolved together . The bond between humans and dogs can be seen in the burial of dogs with their owners as early as 11 @,@ 000 years ago in the Americas and 8 @,@ 500 years ago in Europe . 
 Among canids , only the gray wolf has widely been known to prey on humans . Nonetheless , at least two records have coyotes killing humans , and two have golden jackals killing children . Human beings have trapped and hunted some canid species for their fur and , especially the gray wolf , coyote and the red fox , for sport . Canids such as the dhole are now endangered in the wild because of persecution , habitat loss , a depletion of ungulate prey species and transmission of diseases from domestic dogs .

 = = Early life = = 
 Ricki @-@ Lee Dawn Coulter was born on 10 November 1985 in Auckland , New Zealand . Her mother Loretta Sheerin , of Māori descent , was a model . Coulter 's parents separated before she was born , and she was raised by her mother . Coulter and her mother relocated to Gold Coast , Queensland when she was three months old . Coulter 's father figure at the time was her grandfather Rocky . Coulter 's mother gave her every chance to visit her biological father in New Zealand when she was a child . " He wasn 't a part of my life . I 'd go over there and stay with him and his family , [ but ] it was just weird to me . Then when I got to an age where I could speak up to Mum , about six or seven , I said , ' I don 't want to go ; I don 't like it . ' " 
 She attended Southport State Primary School and experienced the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as she wanted a life similar to her school friends . " Their mums and dads were married . They had brothers and sisters . They had afternoon tea . They had a cooked dinner . I never had that . I 'd get home from school and there was nothing in the cupboard . I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up " . Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills . During primary school , Coulter participated in many sports , including swimming , touch football and netball , which she played for six years . When Coulter was nine years old , her mother met John , a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father . Coulter has two half @-@ sisters , Jodie and Emily . 
 As a teenager , she attended Southport State High School . At the age of 15 , Coulter had a serious knee injury which required reconstructive surgery . She was told she would never play netball again . Several months later , Coulter 's ability to sing was discovered by her mother who overheard her in her bedroom , which led to her performing at gigs in the Gold Coast and Brisbane areas with live bands . Coulter had also secured lead roles in high school productions such as , Hair , Jesus Christ Superstar , Les Misérables , Miss Saigon , Cats , Rent , The Boy Friend , Phantom of the Opera , Grease and The Rocky Horror Show . Aside from singing , she also learned how to play several instruments , including the tenor saxophone , flute and trumpet , and would often play them in school concerts and in the school stage band . During high school , Coulter excelled in music and sport . After completing high school in 2002 , she decided to focus on her music career , and began writing her own songs with her good friend <unk> <unk> .

 In 2003 , Coulter auditioned for the first season of Australian Idol but did not make it past the audition rounds . The following year , Coulter successfully auditioned for the first season of Popstars Live , and progressed to the top sixty round of the competition but was part of the first group of performers who were sent home . Later that same year , Coulter successfully auditioned for the second season of Australian Idol , singing En Vogue 's " Don 't Let Go ( Love ) " , and progressed through to the semi @-@ finals . Following the semi @-@ final process , she had advanced through to the top twelve . Throughout the season , Coulter was regarded as a favourite to win the competition because of her performances of Michael Jackson 's " Don 't Stop ' til You Get Enough " , Tina Turner 's version of " Proud Mary " and Whitney Houston 's " I Have Nothing " . In the final seven @-@ week , Coulter was eliminated from the competition . One of the show 's judges Ian " <unk> " Dickson described her departure as a scandal . Following her elimination , " newspapers ran the story as front @-@ page news and Coulter herself couldn 't quite hide the anger and disappointment she plainly felt " . Like contestant Daniel Belle , who was eliminated the week before her , Coulter never appeared in the bottom three until her elimination .

 Following her departure from Australian Idol , Coulter was offered recording contracts by record labels including the show 's sponsor Sony BMG , but she signed with Australia 's biggest independent label Shock Records . Coulter explained , " I 'd met with a number of labels and Shock were the only one that asked me what I wanted to do and what kind of album I wanted to make and who I wanted to work with " . Her debut single " Hell No ! " was released in June 2005 , ahead of the related self @-@ titled debut album , Ricki @-@ Lee . The song peaked at number five on the ARIA Singles Chart – remaining in the top @-@ ten for three consecutive weeks . It was eventually certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association , for shipments of 35 @,@ 000 copies . " Sunshine " was released as her second single in September , which peaked at number eight and was also certified gold . Ricki @-@ Lee was released on 3 October 2005 , which peaked at number 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart . Coulter collaborated with a several producers and songwriters on the album , including Audius Mtawarira , Israel Cruz , Nitty , Jarrad Rogers and Kara DioGuardi , among others . " Breathe " was released as the album 's third and final single in January 2006 , and reached number 14 . At the 2006 Australian and New Zealand Urban Music Awards , Ricki @-@ Lee was nominated for ' Best R & B Album ' . 
 That same year , Coulter joined forces with previous Australian Idol contestants Paulini , Emily Williams and Kate DeAraugo to be part of the all @-@ girl singing project called Young Divas . The project was initially formed to promote a joint 17 @-@ date national tour , where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group . Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer 's single " This Time I Know It 's for Real " in May 2006 , through Sony BMG , to promote tickets for the tour . A music video was also shot to accompany the song 's release . In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald , DeAraugo stated that they are " not an Idol supergroup , it 's just about finding four female voices . It just so happened the four we 've gone with are all from Idol . The single is just to promote the tour , just to show a taste of what will be on there , but there won 't be an album " . Young Divas ' version of " This Time I Know It 's for Real " peaked at number two and remained in the top @-@ ten for fourteen consecutive weeks . It was eventually certified platinum , for shipments of 70 @,@ 000 copies . Five months after the single 's release , Young Divas released a second single in November 2006 , a cover of Lonnie Gordon 's " <unk> ' All Over Again " . The song peaked at number nine and was certified gold . 
 Their commercial success prompted the release of a debut album of classic disco and pop covers titled , Young Divas , on 27 November 2006 , establishing themselves as an official group . The album debuted at number four and was certified double platinum , for shipments of 140 @,@ 000 copies . A cover of Hazell Dean 's " <unk> ' " was released as the group 's third single , and reached number 40 . In February 2007 , it was announced that Young Divas had pulled out of their scheduled national tour supporting Irish boy band Westlife , because Coulter had headed overseas to work on her second solo album . The cancellation occurred amid claims that Coulter was set to leave the group , due to personality clashes with DeAraugo .

 = United States Sesquicentennial coinage = 
 The United States Sesquicentennial coin issue consisted of a commemorative half dollar and quarter eagle ( gold $ 2 @.@ 50 piece ) struck in 1926 at the Philadelphia Mint for the 150th anniversary of American independence . The obverse of the half dollar features portraits of the first president , George Washington , and the president in 1926 , Calvin Coolidge , making it the only American coin to depict a president in his lifetime . 
 By the March 1925 Act of Congress , by which the National Sesquicentennial Exhibition Commission was chartered , Congress also allowed it to purchase 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 specially designed half dollars and 200 @,@ 000 quarter eagles , which could be sold to the public at a premium . The Commission had trouble agreeing on a design with Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock , and asked Philadelphia attorney , arts patron and numismatist John Frederick Lewis ( 1860 – 1932 ) to submit sketches . These were adapted by Sinnock , without giving credit to Lewis , whose involvement would not be generally known for forty years . 
 Both the quarter eagle , designed by Sinnock , and the half dollar were struck in the maximum number authorized , but many were returned to the Mint for melting when they failed to sell . The Liberty Bell reverse for the half dollar was later reused by Sinnock , again without giving Lewis credit , on the Chief Engraver 's Franklin half dollar , which was first minted in 1948 . 
 = = Inception = = 
 Legislation for a commemorative coin to mark the 150th anniversary of American independence was introduced on behalf of the United States National Sesquicentennial Exhibition Commission , which was charged with organizing what became known as the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia . In the Act of March 3 , 1925 , Congress both chartered the Commission and allowed one million half dollars and 200 @,@ 000 quarter eagles to be struck in commemoration of the Sesquicentennial of American Independence . These coins would be sold only to the Commission , at face value ; it could then retail them to the public at a premium . Profits would go to financing the Exposition . 
 The original version of the bill , introduced in the House of Representatives on February 16 , 1925 by Pennsylvania Congressman George P. Darrow and in the Senate by that state 's George W. Pepper , called for a $ 1 @.@ 50 gold coin for the 150th anniversary , for commemorative half dollars , and for a $ 1 bill honoring the Declaration of Independence . A hearing was held before the House Committee on Industrial Arts and Expositions two days later , at which Congressman Darrow predicted that the $ 1 @.@ 50 gold pieces would not be opposed by either the Treasury or the Committee on Coinage , Weights , and Measures , but he was incorrect ; Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon would not support them . The Commission also hoped to have commemoratives depicting the enlargement of the country through acquisitions such as the Louisiana Purchase and the Annexation of Texas , but these were not included in the final version of the bill . Nevertheless , the Commission continued to pursue congressional approval of the $ 1 @.@ 50 piece and the other proposed commemoratives at least through August 1925 . 
 In May , H. P. <unk> , secretary of the Commission of Fine Arts , a body charged with making recommendations on the approval of coinage design , wrote to the Sesquicentennial Commission , asking what they proposed to do about the coins . Having received no reply , he wrote again in late August , this time to Milton Medary , a member of the Fine Arts Commission , asking what progress had been made . Medary replied that the Sesquicentennial Commission was in touch with the new Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint , John R. Sinnock ( his predecessor , George T. Morgan , had died in January ) , but that Sinnock had not yet submitted satisfactory designs . 
 Apparently dissatisfied with Sinnock 's work , the Sesquicentennial Commission hired John Frederick Lewis to create designs . Lewis , who served as president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts from 1906 until his death in 1932 , was known as a numismatist , but not as an artist . On December 8 , 1925 , Sesquicentennial Commission director Asher C. Baker submitted Lewis 's sketches , which appear much like the present half dollar , to Fine Arts Commission chairman Charles Moore . Baker referred to Lewis 's " designs for the coins " , which may mean that he submitted sketches for the quarter eagle as well , but if so , they are not extant and were not acted upon by the Fine Arts Commission . The half dollar designs were approved by the Fine Arts Commission , on condition the sketches were converted into models by a competent sculptor , and Moore sent them on December 11 to Mint Director Robert J. Grant . The resultant plaster models , made by Sinnock , were submitted to the Fine Arts Commission on March 13 , 1926 , and were undoubtedly endorsed , but the approval letter is lost . 
 Sinnock 's sketches for the quarter eagle were sent to the Fine Arts Commission on February 27 , 1926 , and were forwarded to sculptor member Lorado Taft for his views . Moore sent his commission 's approval to Grant on March 26 , with several recommendations , including that the motto E Pluribus Unum , present on the obverse in Sinnock 's sketches , and the sun 's rays on the reverse , be omitted . The rays were not removed , and the motto was moved to the reverse . Approval of the models followed in April , again with minor suggestions . 
 = = Design = = 
 The obverse of the half dollar features jugate busts of George Washington , first president of the United States , and Calvin Coolidge , the president in 1926 . According to Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen , " both were mistakes . Washington was not president of the Continental Congress in 1776 , and Coolidge 's likeness was illegal . By an 1866 Act of Congress , no living person could be portrayed on U.S. coins or currency ; but this law had been many times violated and would be again . " Although Sinnock had not previously designed a coin showing a president , he had created presidential medals under Chief Engraver Morgan 's direction . Other living Americans , including Virginia Senator Carter Glass , have appeared on commemorative coinage , but Coolidge is the only president to appear on a U.S. coin in his lifetime . The Liberty Bell appears on the reverse , making the Sesquicentennial half dollar the first U.S. coin to bear private advertising — that is , the legend " Pass and Stow " on the bell , for the long @-@ defunct partnership of John Pass and John Stow , who recast the bell after it initially broke in 1752 . Sinnock 's initials JRS are on the obverse , on the truncation of Washington 's bust . 
 Swiatek and Breen describe the obverse of the quarter eagle as " very Art Deco " . Liberty appears on it , wearing a liberty cap and holding both a scroll representing the United States Declaration of Independence and a torch likely intended to recall the Statue of Liberty . The reverse depicts Independence Hall , where the Declaration was signed , and the rising sun behind it . Sinnock 's initials are to the right , above the right wing of the building . Bowers pointed out that the depiction of Independence Hall closely resembles that on the Bicentennial half dollar , struck a half century later . As no clock hands are seen on the bell tower of the building on the quarter eagle , it is not possible to say what time is intended — on the Bicentennial half dollar , the time is 3 : 00 . 
 At the insistence of the Sesquicentennial Commission , the coins were minted in very shallow relief , and thus struck up poorly . Coin dealer and numismatic author Q. David Bowers opined , " from the standpoint of aesthetic appeal the [ half dollar ] is at the bottom of the popularity charts along with the 1923 @-@ S Monroe half dollar " . 
 Art historian Cornelius Vermeule took a more positive view of the two coins . Commenting on the half dollar obverse , he praised its technical aspects , showing the Mint had learned something from earlier attempts at coin redesign . He admired the reverse , calling the bell and the lettering " jewels of precision " . For the quarter eagle obverse , with its figure of a robed Liberty standing on a globe , Vermeule suggested that Sinnock " revert [ ed ] in part to the allegorical iconography of the nineteenth century . " He felt that the Liberty allegory is too blatant , with scroll and torch , and noted that Sinnock eventually found a more proper place for his torch on the Roosevelt dime ( 1946 ) . The figure itself , despite classical robes , " looks more like a ' flapper ' of the 1920s . Her cloth cap accentuates this , " according to Vermeule . The reverse , in Vermeule 's view , was part of a tradition of realistic views of structures on U.S coins that would repeat itself with the Jefferson nickel ( 1938 ) . 
 = = Distribution and aftermath = = 
 The first Sesquicentennial half dollar was coined by Philadelphia Mayor W. Freeland Kendrick at a special ceremony at that city 's mint on May 19 , 1926 . It was presented to President Coolidge when he visited the Exposition and today rests in the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Library and Museum . Lewis , in a May 5 letter to Mint Director Grant , had indicated his ( mistaken ) understanding that a mark was placed on the first 1 @,@ 000 coins struck to distinguish them and proposed that it be " K " for Kendrick ; this was not done . 
 The Philadelphia Mint coined 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 528 of the half dollars at the behest of the Commission in May and June 1926 , with the excess over the authorized mintage reserved for inspection and testing at the 1927 meeting of the United States Assay Commission . They also had the mint strike 200 @,@ 226 quarter eagles in May and June , with the excess also set aside for the Assay Commission . The gold piece was the second quarter eagle to be a commemorative , after the Panama – Pacific issue of 1915 . No further gold commemoratives , of any denomination , would be issued by the Mint Bureau until 1984 , when a $ 10 piece was issued for the Los Angeles Olympics . 
 The Sesquicentennial Exposition opened in Philadelphia on June 1 , 1926 , financed in part by $ 5 million in bonds floated by the city . Work had not been completed on many of the exhibits and construction continued to the close of the fair . Nevertheless , there were many scientific , artistic , and commercial displays . Most firms that exhibited lost money by their participation , as did the city , and according to Bowers , " in the annals of fairs and expositions in the United States , the Sesquicentennial event earns a low rating . " 
 Sales of coins at the Exposition were handled by the Commission ; those by mail were dealt with by the Franklin Trust Company . The half dollar was priced at $ 1 , and the quarter eagle at $ 4 ; however they did not sell well and the Commission 's belief it could sell the entire mintage proved wildly optimistic . Although six million people visited the Exposition , 859 @,@ 408 of the 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 half dollars were returned to the mint for melting . Similarly , 154 @,@ 207 quarter eagles of the mintage of 200 @,@ 000 were returned for melting . This did not take place all at once : 420 @,@ 000 half dollars had been returned by January 1930 , with the rest later . According to coin dealer B. Max Mehl in his 1937 volume on commemoratives , " Philadelphia with a population of over 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 people ... could and should have sold a greater number of coins " . Arlie R. Slabaugh wrote in his 1975 book on the same subject , " we have been called complacent about our independence and the American way of life in recent years — judging by the sale of these coins , it must have been much worse in 1926 ! " 
 Sinnock reused the reverse for the Franklin half dollar , first struck in 1948 , the year after his death . Mint and other publications gave credit for both coins ' designs only to Sinnock until Don Taxay published his An Illustrated History of U.S. Commemorative Coinage in 1967 , disclosing Lewis 's involvement . Taxay referred to " the Mint 's ... final , deliberate misattribution of the artist who designed the half dollar " and wrote , " perhaps after these forty years , it is time for a new credit line " . Bowers noted , " Lewis and Sinnock should share the credit . " R. S. Yeoman 's A Guide Book of United States Coins ( 2015 edition ) notes the involvement of both men , and values the half dollar at $ 90 , with the quarter eagle beginning at around $ 450 , though higher @-@ graded coins may sell for more . Many are known in circulated condition . 
 = Patrick Cleburne = 
 Patrick Ronayne Cleburne ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ burn ; March 17 , 1828 – November 30 , 1864 ) was an Irish @-@ born American soldier , best known for his service in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War , where he rose to the rank of major general . 
 Born in County Cork , Ireland , Cleburne served in the 41st Regiment of Foot , a Welsh regiment of the British Army , after failing to gain entrance into Trinity College of Medicine in 1846 . He emigrated to the United States three years later . At the beginning of the Civil War , Cleburne sided with the Confederate States . He progressed from being a private soldier in the local militia to a division commander . Cleburne participated in many successful military campaigns , especially the Battle of Stones River , the Battle of Missionary Ridge and the Battle of Ringgold Gap . His strategic ability gained him the nickname " Stonewall of the West " . He was killed in 1864 , at the Battle of Franklin . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Cleburne was born in Ovens , County Cork , Ireland , the second son of Dr. Joseph Cleburne , a middle @-@ class physician of Anglo @-@ Irish ancestry . Patrick 's mother died when he was 18 months old , and he was an orphan at 15 . He followed his father into the study of medicine , but failed his entrance exam to Trinity College of Medicine in 1846 . In response to this failure , he enlisted in the 41st Regiment of Foot of the British Army , subsequently rising to the rank of corporal . 
 Three years later , Cleburne bought his discharge and emigrated to the United States with two brothers and a sister . After spending a short time in Ohio , he settled in Helena , Arkansas , where he was employed as a pharmacist and was readily accepted into the town 's social order . During this time , Cleburne became close friends with Thomas C. Hindman , who would later parallel his course as a Confederate Major General . The two men also formed a business partnership with William Weatherly to buy a newspaper , the Democratic Star , in December 1855 . 
 In 1856 , Cleburne and Hindman were both wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena with members of the Know @-@ Nothing Party following a debate . Cleburne was shot in the back , turned around and shot one of his attackers , killing him . The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left . After the two recovered , they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against them . They were exonerated and , afterward , went to Hindman 's parents ' house in Mississippi . By 1860 , he was a naturalized citizen , a practicing lawyer , and very popular with the local residents . 
 = = Service in the Confederate Army = = 
 When the issue of secession reached a crisis , Cleburne sided with the Southern states . His choice was not due to any love of slavery , which he claimed not to care about , but out of affection for the Southern people who had adopted him as one of their own . As the crisis mounted , Cleburne joined the local militia company ( the Yell Rifles ) as a private soldier . He was soon elected captain . He led the company in the seizure of the U.S. Arsenal in Little Rock in January 1861 . When Arkansas left the Union , the Yell Rifles became part of the 1st Arkansas Infantry , later designated the 15th Arkansas , of which he was elected Colonel . He was promoted to brigadier general on March 4 , 1862 . 
 Cleburne served at the Battle of Shiloh and the Battle of Richmond ( Kentucky ) , where he was wounded in the face when a <unk> ball pierced his left cheek , smashed several teeth , and exited through his mouth , recovering in time to participate in the Battle of Perryville . After the Army of Tennessee retreated to its namesake state in late 1862 , Cleburne was promoted to division command and served at the Battle of Stones River , where his division advanced three miles as it routed the Union right wing and drove it back to the Nashville Pike and its final line of defense . He was promoted to major general on December 13 . 
 During the campaigns of 1863 in Tennessee , Cleburne and his soldiers fought at the Battle of Chickamauga . At the Battle of Wauhatchie near Chattanooga they conducted a rare night assault . They successfully resisted a much larger Union force under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman on the northern end of Missionary Ridge during the Battle of Missionary Ridge , and Joseph Hooker at the Battle of Ringgold Gap in northern Georgia , in which Cleburne 's men again protected the Army of Tennessee as it retreated to Tunnel Hill , Georgia . Cleburne and his troops received an official Thanks from the Confederate Congress for their actions during this campaign . 
 Cleburne 's strategic use of terrain , his ability to hold ground where others failed , and his talent in foiling the movements of the enemy earned him fame , and gained him the nickname " Stonewall of the West . " Federal troops were quoted as dreading to see the blue flag of Cleburne 's Division across the battlefield . General Robert E. Lee referred to him as " a meteor shining from a clouded sky " . 
 By late 1863 , it had become obvious to Cleburne that the Confederacy was losing the war because of the growing limitations of its manpower and resources . In 1864 , he dramatically called together the leadership of the Army of Tennessee and put forth the proposal to emancipate slaves and enlist them in the Confederate Army to secure Southern independence . His plan did not include black equality , suggesting that legislation and foresight would ensure relations between blacks and whites would not materially change . This proposal was met with polite silence at the meeting , and while word of it leaked out , it went unremarked , much less officially recognized . From his letter outlining the proposal : 
 Satisfy the negro that if he faithfully adheres to our standard during the war he shall receive his freedom and that of his race ... and we change the race from a dreaded weakness to a position of strength . 
 Will the slaves fight ? The helots of Sparta stood their masters good stead in battle . In the great sea fight of Lepanto where the Christians checked forever the spread of <unk> over Europe , the galley slaves of portions of the fleet were promised freedom , and called on to fight at a critical moment of the battle . They fought well , and civilization owes much to those brave galley slaves ... the experience of this war has been so far that half @-@ trained negroes have fought as bravely as many other half @-@ trained Yankees . 
 It is said that slavery is all we are fighting for , and if we give it up we give up all . Even if this were true , which we deny , slavery is not all our enemies are fighting for . It is merely the pretense to establish sectional superiority and a more centralized form of government , and to deprive us of our rights and liberties .

 Prior to the campaigning season of 1864 , Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile , Alabama . Their marriage was never to be , as Cleburne was killed during an ill @-@ conceived assault ( which he opposed ) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin , just south of Nashville , Tennessee , on November 30 , 1864 . He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised , after his horse was shot out from under him . Accounts later said that he was found just inside the Federal line and his body carried back to an aid station along the Columbia Turnpike . Confederate war records indicate he died of a shot to the abdomen , or possibly a bullet that went through his heart . When Confederates found his body , he had been picked clean of any valuable items , including his sword , boots and pocket watch . 
 According to a letter written to General Cheatham from Judge Mangum post war , Cleburne 's remains were first laid to rest at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia , Tennessee . At the urging of Army Chaplain <unk> Quintard , Judge Mangum , staff officer to Cleburne and his law partner in Helena , had Cleburne 's remains moved to St. John 's Episcopal Church near Mount Pleasant , Tennessee , where they remained for six years . He had first observed St. John 's during the Army of Tennessee 's march into Tennessee during the campaign that led to the Battle of Franklin and commented that it was the place he would like to be buried because of its great beauty and resemblance to his Irish homeland . In 1870 , he was disinterred and returned to his adopted hometown of Helena , Arkansas , with much fanfare , and buried in the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery , overlooking the Mississippi River . 
 William J. Hardee , Cleburne 's former corps commander , had this to say when he learned of his loss : " Where this division defended , no odds broke its line ; where it attacked , no numbers resisted its onslaught , save only once ; and there is the grave of Cleburne . " 
 Several geographic features are named after Patrick Cleburne , including Cleburne County in Alabama and Arkansas , and the city of Cleburne , Texas . The location where he was killed in Franklin , Tennessee was reclaimed by preservationists and is now known as Cleburne Park . 
 The Patrick R. Cleburne Confederate Cemetery is a memorial cemetery in Jonesboro , Georgia that was named in honor of General Patrick Cleburne .

 = Obesity = 
 Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health . People are generally considered obese when their body mass index ( BMI ) , a measurement obtained by dividing a person 's weight by the square of the person 's height , is over 30 kg / m2 , with the range 25 – 30 kg / m2 defined as overweight . Some East Asian countries use lower values . Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases , particularly heart disease , type 2 diabetes , obstructive sleep apnea , certain types of cancer , and osteoarthritis . 
 Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake , lack of physical activity , and genetic susceptibility . A few cases are caused primarily by genes , endocrine disorders , medications , or mental illness . Evidence to support the view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported . On average , obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass . 
 Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices . Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments . Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy @-@ dense foods , such as those high in fat and sugars , and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber . Medications may be taken , along with a suitable diet , to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption . If diet , exercise , and medication are not effective , a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length , leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food . 
 Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide , with increasing rates in adults and children . In 2014 , 600 million adults ( 13 % ) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese . Obesity is more common in women than men . Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century . Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world ( particularly in the Western world ) , though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world . In 2013 , the American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health . It is defined by body mass index ( BMI ) and further evaluated in terms of fat distribution via the waist – hip ratio and total cardiovascular risk factors . BMI is closely related to both percentage body fat and total body fat . In children , a healthy weight varies with age and sex . Obesity in children and adolescents is defined not as an absolute number but in relation to a historical normal group , such that obesity is a BMI greater than the 95th percentile . The reference data on which these percentiles were based date from 1963 to 1994 , and thus have not been affected by the recent increases in weight . BMI is defined as the subject 's weight divided by the square of their height and is calculated as follows . 
 <formula> , 
 where m and h are the subject 's weight and height respectively . 
 BMI is usually expressed in kilograms per square metre , resulting when weight is measured in kilograms and height in metres . To convert from pounds per square inch multiply by 703 ( kg / m2 ) / ( lb / sq in ) . 
 The most commonly used definitions , established by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in 1997 and published in 2000 , provide the values listed in the table . 
 Some modifications to the WHO definitions have been made by particular bodies . The surgical literature breaks down " class III " obesity into further categories whose exact values are still disputed . 
 Any BMI ≥ 35 or 40 kg / m2 is severe obesity . 
 A BMI of ≥ 35 kg / m2 and experiencing obesity @-@ related health conditions or ≥ 40 – 44 @.@ 9 kg / m2 is morbid obesity . 
 A BMI of ≥ 45 or 50 kg / m2 is super obesity . 
 As Asian populations develop negative health consequences at a lower BMI than Caucasians , some nations have redefined obesity ; the Japanese have defined obesity as any BMI greater than 25 kg / m2 while China uses a BMI of greater than 28 kg / m2 .

 Excessive body weight is associated with various diseases , particularly cardiovascular diseases , diabetes mellitus type 2 , obstructive sleep apnea , certain types of cancer , osteoarthritis and asthma . As a result , obesity has been found to reduce life expectancy . 
 = = = Mortality = = = 
 Obesity is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide . A number of reviews have found that mortality risk is lowest at a BMI of 20 – 25 kg / m2 in non @-@ smokers and at 24 – 27 kg / m2 in current smokers , with risk increasing along with changes in either direction . This appears to apply in at least four continents . In contrast , a 2013 review found that grade 1 obesity ( BMI 30 @-@ 35 ) was not associated with higher mortality than normal weight , and that overweight ( BMI 25 @-@ 30 ) was associated with " lower " mortality than was normal weight ( BMI 18 @.@ 5 @-@ 25 ) . Other evidence suggests that the association of BMI and waist circumference with mortality is <unk> or J @-@ shaped , while the association between waist @-@ to @-@ hip ratio and waist @-@ to @-@ height ratio with mortality is more positive . In Asians risk begins to increase between 22 – 25 kg / m2 . A BMI above 32 kg / m2 has been associated with a doubled mortality rate among women over a 16 @-@ year period . In the United States obesity is estimated to cause 111 @,@ 909 to 365 @,@ 000 deaths per year , while 1 million ( 7 @.@ 7 % ) of deaths in Europe are attributed to excess weight . On average , obesity reduces life expectancy by six to seven years , a BMI of 30 – 35 kg / m2 reduces life expectancy by two to four years , while severe obesity ( BMI > 40 kg / m2 ) reduces life expectancy by ten years .
