 On May 19 , 2002 , Rivera recorded his 225th career save , surpassing Dave Righetti as the Yankees ' franchise leader in saves . Over the next few months of the season , injuries limited his playing time . He was first placed on the disabled list in June due to a groin strain , though his first @-@ half numbers , which included a 1 @.@ 47 ERA and 21 saves , earned him an All @-@ Star selection . In a game on July 14 , Rivera endured one of his worst outings , allowing six earned runs , including a walk @-@ off grand slam . One week later , he was placed on the disabled list with a shoulder strain . Rivera was activated on August 8 after receiving a cortisone shot but returned to the disabled list after a recurrence of shoulder tightness . Overall , he finished the season with a 2 @.@ 74 ERA and 28 saves in 32 opportunities in just 46 innings pitched . 
 To placate the Yankees ' concerns about his durability , Rivera followed a strength and conditioning program in the offseason , instead of throwing . Torre said that he would try to reduce Rivera 's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer . However , Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began , causing him to miss the first month . After returning on April 30 , he pitched well in the season 's first half , saving 16 games in 17 opportunities . His save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter Roger Clemens . Rivera slumped early in the second half ; over one stretch , he blew five of eleven save opportunities , but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season . He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA ( 1 @.@ 66 ) , along with 40 saves in 46 opportunities . In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the arch @-@ rival Boston Red Sox , Rivera had one of the most memorable postseason performances of his career ; in the decisive Game 7 , he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5 – 5 and pitched three scoreless innings , his longest outing since 1996 . He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh @-@ inning walk @-@ off home run that clinched the Yankees ' series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series . Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher 's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God , as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate . Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series . The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins ; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16 innings pitched that postseason . 
 Prior to the 2004 season , with a year remaining on his contract , Rivera signed a two @-@ year extension worth $ 21 million , with an option for a third year . That season , Rivera surpassed 300 career saves and made his sixth All @-@ Star team with 32 saves at the midseason break , then an AL record . His final numbers for the year included a 1 @.@ 94 ERA and a career @-@ high 53 saves in 57 opportunities ; it was his third time leading the major leagues in saves . Along with winning a third AL Rolaids Relief Man Award , he placed third in the AL Cy Young Award voting . Following the Yankees ' victory in the 2004 AL Division Series against the Minnesota Twins , Rivera returned home to Panama to mourn two relatives who had died in an accident in his swimming pool . Despite his status being in doubt for the 2004 AL Championship Series against the Red Sox , he returned to New York for Game 1 after attending the funeral in Panama earlier in the day . He recorded a save that night , as well as in Game 2 . Although the Yankees led three @-@ games @-@ to @-@ none in the series , Rivera blew saves in Games 4 and 5 , and the Red Sox won both games in extra innings to avoid elimination . In Game 4 , Boston 's Dave Roberts pinch ran and stole second base against Rivera , eventually scoring on a single to tie the game . In Game 5 , Rivera entered with a one @-@ run lead with runners on base and allowed a sacrifice fly to tie the score . Although he allowed just one earned run in the 2004 postseason , he blew three of five save opportunities in the two series . Boston 's comeback victories helped them become the first team in MLB history to win a best @-@ of @-@ seven series in which they trailed three @-@ games @-@ to @-@ none . 
 Following a career high in appearances in 2004 , Rivera did not throw during the offseason , unlike previous years . His 2005 season began on a low note . After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis , he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox , marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston dating back to the previous postseason . Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera , and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over . He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre @-@ game introductions at Fenway Park the following week , in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox . He responded to the ovation with a sense of humor by tipping his cap to the crowd . 
 Rivera rebounded in dominating fashion and finished 2005 with his greatest season to that point . He was selected to the All @-@ Star team , converted 31 consecutive save opportunities , and finished the season with 43 saves in 47 opportunities . He set new career bests in many statistical categories , including ERA ( 1 @.@ 38 ) and walks plus hits per inning pitched , or WHIP ( 0 @.@ 87 ) . Rivera limited opposing hitters to a batting average against of <unk> , then the best mark of his closer career . In addition to winning a fourth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award , he placed second in voting for the AL Cy Young Award behind starter Bartolo Colón , and ninth for the AL MVP Award — his best finishes in voting for both awards . During the postseason , MLB announced the Latino Legends Team , a fan @-@ voted all @-@ time roster of the greatest Latino players ; Rivera was named the team 's relief pitcher . 
 = = = = 2006 – 2008 = = = = 
 Rivera began 2006 with a 3 @.@ 72 ERA and two losses in April , but his numbers improved in subsequent months . On June 6 , he saved his 391st career game , passing Dennis Eckersley for the fourth @-@ most saves in major league history . Rivera was selected to his third consecutive All @-@ Star team with a 1 @.@ 76 ERA and 19 saves entering the midseason break . He saved the AL 's comeback victory in the 2006 All @-@ Star Game for his third career All @-@ Star save , tying him with Eckersley for the most ever . On July 16 , Rivera achieved another milestone by becoming the fourth MLB pitcher to reach 400 saves . Although a throwing elbow strain sidelined Rivera for most of September , he finished the 2006 season with 34 saves in 37 opportunities and an ERA of 1 @.@ 80 — his fourth consecutive season with a sub @-@ 2 @.@ 00 ERA . For a second consecutive year , fans voted him the Delivery Man of the Year . 
 With his contract set to expire after the 2007 season , Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training . Team management refused to negotiate near the start of the season , prompting him to respond that he would consider free agency at the end of the year . In April , Rivera blew his first two save opportunities , compiled two losses , and surrendered nine earned runs in 7 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched . Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use , as the Yankees presented him with few situations to enter a game . Rivera saved 30 of his next 32 opportunities and posted a 2 @.@ 26 ERA over the final five months of the season . In addition , he passed John Franco for third place on the all @-@ time saves list with his <unk> career save . Still , Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs ( 25 ) , hits ( 68 ) , and ERA ( 3 @.@ 15 ) , and his 30 saves in 34 opportunities were his second @-@ lowest total since 1997 . After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round , Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market . He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would be influenced by whether long @-@ time manager Joe Torre was re @-@ signed . Although Torre did not return , Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three @-@ year , $ 45 million contract , making him the highest @-@ paid reliever in baseball history . 
 Rivera rebounded in 2008 and began the year with 16 consecutive scoreless innings pitched and 28 consecutive save opportunities converted , both personal bests to start a season . His first @-@ half performance , highlighted by a 1 @.@ 06 ERA and 23 saves in as many opportunities , garnered him his ninth All @-@ Star selection . Leading up to the 2008 MLB All @-@ Star Game , which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue 's final year of existence , a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL 's starting pitcher as a tribute to him and his home ballpark . He instead was used as a reliever in the AL 's extra @-@ inning win . In the final month of the season , he recorded two milestones : on September 15 , he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all @-@ time in regular season saves ; on September 21 , in the final game at Yankee Stadium , Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue 's history , retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground @-@ out . After the Yankees missed the postseason for the first time in his career , Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year . Tests revealed calcification of the <unk> joint in his throwing shoulder , for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason . 
 Rivera finished 2008 with one of his best individual seasons . Along with a 1 @.@ 40 ERA and 39 saves in 40 opportunities , he set career bests in multiple statistical categories , including WHIP ( 0 @.@ 67 ) , on @-@ base plus slugging ( OPS ) <unk> ( .422 ) , batting average against ( .165 ) , save percentage ( 97 @.@ 5 % ) , walks ( 6 ) , earned runs ( 11 ) , and blown saves ( 1 ) . He averaged 9 @.@ 81 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched , his best mark as a closer . He pitched with such control that his 12 @.@ 83 strikeout @-@ to @-@ walk ratio made him the second MLB pitcher ever to record a figure that high in a season ( minimum 50 innings pitched ) . He placed fifth in the AL Cy Young Award voting . 
 = = = = 2009 – 2012 = = = = 
 In his first 12 appearances of 2009 , Rivera surrendered four home runs and had a 3 @.@ 97 ERA , leading to speculation about his cutter 's effectiveness and his shoulder 's health at age 39 . As the season progressed , his numbers improved , and he reached a milestone on June 28 by becoming the second pitcher with 500 regular season saves . In the same game , while batting against fellow closer Francisco Rodríguez , he collected his first career run batted in by walking with the bases loaded . With 23 saves in 24 opportunities and a 2 @.@ 43 ERA in the season 's first half , Rivera was selected an All @-@ Star for the tenth time . At the 2009 MLB All @-@ Star Game , he set a record by saving his fourth career All @-@ Star Game . In the season 's second half , Rivera allowed earned runs in only two of his final 40 appearances , while he set a new personal best for consecutive save opportunities converted with 36 . He finished the regular season with a 1 @.@ 76 ERA , 44 saves in 46 opportunities , and a 0 @.@ 90 WHIP . In the postseason , he pitched 16 innings , allowing one earned run and saving five games , and he clinched the Yankees ' victory in the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies — his fifth championship . He was the only closer who did not record a loss or blown save that postseason . Rivera collected several awards at season 's end , including his third Delivery Man Award , his fifth AL Rolaids Relief Man Award , and the 2009 Sporting News Pro Athlete of the Year Award . Reflecting on the decade 's end , ESPN.com 's Jerry <unk> called Rivera the most valuable major league pitcher of the previous 10 years . 
 In 2010 , Rivera and two of his " Core Four " teammates , Derek Jeter and Jorge Posada , became the first trio in any of the four major sports leagues in North America ( MLB , NFL , NBA , or NHL ) to play together on the same team for 16 consecutive seasons . Rivera began with one of his best first halves , compiling a 1 @.@ 05 ERA , 20 saves in 22 opportunities , and 0 @.@ 64 WHIP before the All @-@ Star break , and in June , he set a personal best streak with 24 consecutive batters retired . He earned an 11th All @-@ Star selection but withdrew from the game due to lingering oblique and knee injuries . In the second half , he was less effective — he struck out batters half as often , and in September , he compiled three blown saves and a 4 @.@ 76 ERA . Rivera finished 2010 with a 1 @.@ 80 ERA and 0 @.@ 83 WHIP , numbers that were among his career bests , though his 33 saves in 38 opportunities and 6 @.@ 75 strikeouts per 9 innings ratio were below his career averages . In the postseason , he pitched 6 1 ⁄ 3 scoreless innings while saving three games . After becoming a free agent in the offseason , Rivera agreed to a two @-@ year , $ 30 million contract to remain with the Yankees . 
 That same offseason , Trevor Hoffman retired as the all @-@ time regular season saves leader with a final tally of 601 , leaving Rivera as the active leader in saves and 42 behind Hoffman 's record to start 2011 . Rivera 's season was marked by several milestones . He broke the all @-@ time record for games finished , and in May , he became the 15th pitcher to make 1 @,@ 000 appearances and the first to do so with a single team . He was named an All @-@ Star for the 12th time with a 1 @.@ 85 ERA and 22 saves in 26 opportunities at the midseason break , but for the second consecutive year , he skipped the game to rest injuries . His pursuit of Hoffman 's saves record reached a climax in the final month of the season ; on September 13 , he collected his 600th save , making him just the second pitcher to accomplish the feat . Four days later , he saved his 601st game , tying him with Hoffman for the most in MLB history . Rivera broke the record on September 19 at Yankee Stadium by closing out a 6 – 4 win against the Twins , the final out by strikeout . After the game , Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli called him to offer his congratulations . Rivera finished the season with a 1 @.@ 91 ERA , a 0 @.@ 90 WHIP , and 44 saves in 49 opportunities , making him the first pitcher over the age of 40 to save at least 40 games in a season . In the offseason , he underwent throat surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords . 
 Rivera began the 2012 season by blowing a save on Opening Day but followed it with eight scoreless innings and five saves for the remainder of April . After just nine appearances , his season was prematurely ended by a freak injury ; prior to a May 3 game against the Kansas City Royals , Rivera twisted his right knee on the field 's warning track while shagging balls during batting practice , causing him to tear his right anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) . Speculation grew that the injury would end his career , as he had hinted at retirement in spring training . Rivera put those concerns to rest the following day when he announced his intentions to return , saying , " Write it down in big letters . I 'm not going down like this . " He successfully underwent ACL reconstructive surgery on June 12 , while his meniscus , previously thought to have been damaged , did not need to be repaired . Rafael Soriano filled in as closer in Rivera 's absence and saved 42 games in 46 opportunities . Rivera signed a one @-@ year , $ 10 million contract in the offseason to remain with the team . 
 = = = = 2013 = = = = 
 After successfully rehabilitating his knee in the offseason , Rivera announced on March 9 , 2013 , that he would retire after the 2013 season , his 19th in the major leagues . Throughout his final year , Rivera spent time during visits to each ballpark meeting privately with fans and unsung team employees to hear their stories and thank them for supporting baseball . He explained : " It was important for me to meet the people who make baseball what it is , the people who work in the game every day . They have given me far more than I have given them . " Each opposing team returned the favor by honoring Rivera with a gift during his final visit to their city : in Cleveland , the Indians teamed up with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to present Rivera with a gold record of his entrance song " Enter Sandman " ; the Minnesota Twins commissioned a rocking chair made of broken bats , many broken personally by Rivera 's cutter , called the " Chair of Broken Dreams " ; the rival Boston Red Sox gave him a painting and several artifacts from Fenway Park . Many teams made donations to the Mariano Rivera Foundation , the pitcher 's charitable organization . Corporate sponsors of the Yankees paid tribute as well ; Delta Air Lines dedicated a Boeing 757 airplane with Rivera 's signature and uniform number 42 on the exterior , while Hard Rock Cafe retired " Enter Sandman " from its song system at all locations except for its Yankee Stadium restaurant . 
 Rivera 's 10 saves in 10 opportunities in April were his highest total for the opening month of a season . He converted his first 18 save attempts of the season until blowing a save against the Mets on May 28 ; it was the first time that he blew a save and lost a game without recording an out . Rivera entered the midseason break with 30 saves in 32 opportunities and a 1 @.@ 83 ERA , and he was named an All @-@ Star for the 13th time in his career , the second @-@ most All @-@ Star selections for a pitcher behind Warren Spahn 's 17 . During the All @-@ Star Game , held at Citi Field in New York , Rivera was called upon to pitch in the eighth inning for his final All @-@ Star appearance . As he trotted onto the field , players from both teams remained near their dugouts and joined fans in giving Rivera a standing ovation as he stood alone on the field . Rivera retired all three batters he faced , preserving his 0 @.@ 00 career ERA in All @-@ Star Games . He was named the All @-@ Star Game MVP , making him the first reliever selected to an All @-@ Star team to ever receive the award , as well as the first pitcher since Pedro Martínez in 1999 and the second Yankee ever after Derek Jeter in 2000 . He became the first MLB player to be named the MVP of a World Series , League Championship Series , and All @-@ Star Game . Rivera 's performance dipped in the second half of the season , as he blew five save opportunities in the last two months , including three consecutive chances for the first time in his career . In a Fox Sports documentary chronicling his final season , entitled Being : Mariano , Rivera said that his farewell to baseball had mentally and physically drained him and that by September , he had " no desire " left for the sport . 
 On September 22 , 2013 , a day that Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg declared " Mariano Rivera Day " , the Yankees held a 50 @-@ minute pre @-@ game tribute to Rivera at Yankee Stadium . In a ceremony attended by former teammates , Yankees staff , and members of Jackie Robinson 's family , Rivera 's uniform number 42 was retired by the team , making him the first active Yankee to receive that honor . Metallica performed " Enter Sandman " live as he walked onto the field during the festivities . The team presented a video montage and several gifts to Rivera before he addressed the crowd to offer his thanks . Four days later against the Tampa Bay Rays , he pitched in the final game of his career before a home crowd at Yankee Stadium . Entering in the eighth inning to a pre @-@ recorded introduction by late Yankees public address announcer Bob Sheppard , Rivera pitched 1 1 ⁄ 3 innings without allowing a baserunner . In the ninth inning , after retiring Yunel Escobar on a pop fly for the second out , Rivera was removed from the game ; with permission from the umpires , Yankees manager Joe Girardi ceremonially delegated the substitution duty to Rivera 's long @-@ time teammates Andy Pettitte and Derek Jeter . After they reached the mound to make the pitching change , the normally reserved Rivera tearfully embraced his teammates for nearly a minute . Walking off the field to a standing ovation from fans and players , he saluted the crowd and then took a curtain call . After the game , he visited the mound for a final time and grabbed a handful of dirt as a memento . Rivera finished his final season with a 2 @.@ 11 ERA , 1 @.@ 05 WHIP , and 44 saves in 51 opportunities , earning him the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award , among several awards . During the World Series , he was honored as the 13th recipient of the Commissioner 's Historic Achievement Award for his accomplished career and for being " a great ambassador of the game " .

 = = = Pitching style = = = 
 Rivera 's signature pitch was a cut fastball or " cutter " , which exhibited lateral movement towards left @-@ handed hitters similar to that of a slider but with the velocity of a fastball . The sharp , late movement of Rivera 's cutter prevented hitters from making contact with the ball on the sweet spot of their bats , leading to them not only making weak contact on batted balls but also frequently breaking their bats ; according to a tally by columnist Buster Olney , Rivera broke 44 bats during the 2001 regular season . Chipper Jones , who once witnessed teammate Ryan Klesko break three bats in one plate appearance against Rivera in the 1999 World Series , called the pitch a " buzz saw " . Rivera 's long fingers and loose wrist contributed to the pitch 's movement , allowing him to impart more spin on the ball . Describing his grip of the cutter , he said , " it 's really a four @-@ seam fastball with pressure on the middle finger " . By adjusting the pressure that he applied to the ball with his fingertips , Rivera could vary the pitch 's movement . He threw four @-@ seam and two @-@ seam fastballs as complimentary pitches but primarily used his cutter ; according to baseball statistics website Fangraphs , 83 @.@ 3 % of his pitches in 2010 were cutters . All three pitches typically reached a velocity in the low @-@ to @-@ mid 90s mph . 
 Early in his major league career , Rivera was a " power pitcher " who relied on an overpowering four @-@ seam fastball that topped out at 96 mph ( 154 km / h ) to retire hitters . By enticing them to swing and miss at pitches high in the strike zone , he accumulated strikeouts at a high rate . Rivera changed his pitching style after accidentally discovering how to throw a cutter in June 1997 ; during his daily warm @-@ up tosses with teammate Ramiro Mendoza , Rivera noticed that his fastballs were moving sharply and unpredictably , a problem that began to occur in games as well . After unsuccessfully spending a month trying to eliminate the movement , Rivera relented and incorporated the cutter into his pitching repertoire , eventually making it one of his primary pitches in 1998 . When asked about the pitch 's origin , he explained , " It was just from God . I didn 't do anything . It was natural . " As he came to rely on the cutter , Rivera began to record more outs on batted balls . Consequently , his strikeout rate decreased in subsequent years , dropping from 10 @.@ 87 strikeouts per 9 innings in 1996 to 5 @.@ 3 in 1998 , but at the benefit of more efficiency ; his pitches per inning rate dropped from 18 @.@ 7 in 1995 to 14 @.@ 9 in 1998 . 
 Rivera had an impeccable ability to accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes , particularly on the inside and outside edges of the strike zone . This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters ' anticipation of it . His former catcher Joe Girardi said , " He was so easy to catch because he always put the ball right there . I don 't think there 's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch . " Rivera 's 4 @.@ 10 career strikeout @-@ to @-@ walk ratio in the regular season ranks fourth @-@ best in major league history . His control was a byproduct of his smooth , easily repeated pitching motion , which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive ; Darrin Fletcher said in 1999 that Rivera " almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery . It gives you a false sense of security , and then the ball is on you and it 's exploding . " 
 Rivera 's cut fastball was a respected pitch among major league hitters . Jim Thome called it " the single best pitch ever in the game " . In 2004 , ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best " out pitch " in baseball . Olney described his cut fastball as " the most dominant pitch of a generation " . Although switch @-@ hitters usually bat left @-@ handed against right @-@ handed pitchers to better see the ball 's release point , switch @-@ hitters occasionally batted right @-@ handed when facing the right @-@ handed Rivera to avoid being jammed on their hands by his cutter . Similarly , some managers , such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 World Series , sent right @-@ handed batters to pinch hit for left @-@ handed batters against Rivera , thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit . Opposing batters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats , rather than risk their best bats being shattered by his cutter . 
 Rivera was considered an exceptional athlete , distinguished by his slender physique and durability . His propensity to shag balls during batting practice convinced scouts he could be a top AL center fielder . Olney compared Rivera 's regimen of physical preparation and guidelines for staying healthy to Satchel Paige 's " Rules for Staying Young " . 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Rivera exhibited a reserved demeanor on the field that contrasted with the emotional , demonstrative temperament of many of his peers . Hall of Fame closer Goose Gossage said that Rivera 's composure under stress gave him the appearance of having " ice water in his veins " . Commenting on his ability to remain focused in pressure situations , Rivera said , " When you start thinking , a lot of things will happen ... If you don 't control your emotions , your emotions will control your acts , and that 's not good . " His ability to compartmentalize his successes and failures impressed fellow reliever Joba Chamberlain , who said , " He 's won and lost some of the biggest games in the history of baseball , and he 's no worse for the wear when he gives up a home run . " Rivera explained the need to quickly forget bad performances , saying " the game that you 're going to play tomorrow is not going to be the same game that you just played . " Derek Jeter called him the " most mentally tough " teammate with whom he had ever played . 
 During his playing career , Rivera was regarded as a team leader within the Yankees organization , often mentoring younger pitchers and counseling teammates . He had a team @-@ first mindset and deferred most discussions about individual accolades to team goals and his teammates , praising them for making his presence in games possible . When once asked to describe his job , Rivera put it simply , " I get the ball , I throw the ball , and then I take a shower . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Rivera was a dominant reliever throughout his career , pitching with a consistency and longevity uncharacteristic of a role commonly marked by volatility and high turnover . In his 17 @-@ year tenure as the Yankees ' closer , Rivera compiled considerable career numbers . A 13 @-@ time All @-@ Star , he is the majors ' all @-@ time regular season leader in saves ( 652 ) and games finished ( 952 ) . Rivera holds or shares several records for the most seasons of reaching various save milestones , including seasons with at least : 20 saves ( sixteen ) ; 25 saves ( fifteen consecutive , sixteen non @-@ consecutive ) ; 30 saves ( nine consecutive , fifteen non @-@ consecutive ) ; 35 saves ( twelve ) ; 40 saves ( nine ) ; and 50 saves ( two ) . Rivera 's career ERA ( 2 @.@ 21 ) and WHIP ( 1 @.@ 00 ) are the lowest of any MLB pitcher in the live @-@ ball era ( minimum 1 @,@ 000 innings pitched ) , making him one of the top pitchers since 1920 at preventing hitters from reaching base and scoring . He recorded an ERA under 2 @.@ 00 in 11 seasons , tying him with Walter Johnson for the most such seasons ( minimum 60 innings pitched each ) . Rivera also ranks first in career adjusted ERA + ( 205 ) , a statistic that adjusts ERA for league and ballpark to allow comparisons of players across different epochs on the same baseline . 
 In addition to his strong regular season numbers , Rivera excelled in the postseason . He had an 8 – 1 win – loss record and a 0 @.@ 76 WHIP in the postseason , and he holds numerous postseason records , including : lowest career ERA , minimum 30 innings pitched ( 0 @.@ 70 ) ; most saves ( 42 ) ; most consecutive scoreless innings pitched ( 33 1 ⁄ 3 ) ; most consecutive save opportunities converted ( 23 ) ; and most games pitched ( 96 ) . No pitcher saved half as many postseason games as Rivera did . Joe Torre , who managed him for most of his career , said , " Let 's face it . The regular season for Mo is great , but that 's the cupcakes and the ice cream . What separates him from everybody else is what he 's done in the postseason . " Rivera 's dominance in the postseason often led to him being utilized for two @-@ inning appearances , as he saved a record 14 postseason games in this manner . Between 1998 and 2008 , he recorded 26 postseason saves of four or more outs ; the second @-@ highest total by any other pitcher during that time was four such saves , and the rest of baseball combined had 33 . At the start of the 2011 playoffs , Rivera ranked first all @-@ time in win probability added in the postseason with 11 @.@ 62 , more than three times the total of the next @-@ closest player . In a 2009 ESPN.com poll , Rivera was voted one of the top five postseason players in MLB history . 
 Rivera achieved a reputation as an all @-@ time great reliever among baseball experts and his peers . Hall of Fame starter @-@ turned @-@ closer Dennis Eckersley called him " the best ever , no doubt " , while Trevor Hoffman said he " will go down as the best reliever in the game in history " . Torre said , " He 's the best I 've ever been around . Not only the ability to pitch and perform under pressure , but the calm he puts over the clubhouse . " Writer Tom Verducci said , " Rivera is definitively the best at his position by a wider margin than any player at any position in the history of baseball . There is Rivera , a gulf , and then every other closer . " He compared Rivera 's reputation for being the best at his position to that of Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky . MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said , " Clearly unequivocally , he 's the greatest relief pitcher of all time , and did it in a way that was remarkable . " Speaking about Rivera 's looming presence at the end of games , Alex Rodriguez said , " He 's the only guy in baseball who can change the game from a seat in the clubhouse or the bullpen . He would start affecting teams as early as the fifth inning , because they knew he was out there . I 've never seen anyone who could affect a game like that . " Gossage said that Rivera " might be the greatest closer of all @-@ time " but suggested that the modern closer 's job has become too specialized and easy compared to multiple @-@ inning " firemen " from Gossage 's era ; Rivera had only one regular season save of seven @-@ plus outs in his career , whereas Gossage logged 53 . Although the Baseball Writers ' Association of America has historically been reluctant to elect relievers into the Baseball Hall of Fame , sportswriters anticipate that Rivera will be elected in his first year of eligibility . In 2016 , ESPN.com ranked Rivera 49th on its list of the greatest MLB players . 
 Rivera is well respected throughout baseball for his professionalism . Fellow closer Joe Nathan said , " I look up to how he 's handled himself on and off the field ... You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game . I 've always looked up to him and it 's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him . " Michael Young said of Rivera , " I respect Mo more than anybody in the game . The guy goes out there , gets three outs and shakes [ Jorge ] Posada 's hand . You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does , respects the people he plays with and against , and obviously his results speak for themselves . " In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career , Verducci said of the pitcher , " Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers . " Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis ; at the time of his retirement , he was the only player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson 's retired number . Speaking about Rivera 's connection to her husband , Robinson 's widow Rachel said , " [ Rivera ] carried himself with dignity and grace , and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack ... I 've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it . " Presenting him with the Commissioner 's Historic Achievement Award , Selig said : " Throughout his illustrious career , he has represented his family , his country , the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity . It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson 's sacred number 42 . I am pleased that our entire sport can pause on our greatest stage to thank him and his family for all of his contributions to our national pastime . " 
 Several of Rivera 's colleagues credit him with popularizing the cutter among major league pitchers . Fellow closer Jason Isringhausen , who adopted the pitch later in his career , said , " I think he 's been an influence on everybody that throws it . Everybody saw what [ Rivera ] could do , basically with one pitch . Nobody could throw it like he did , but now , you talk about the evolution of the cutter — just ask hitters about it and they tell you everybody 's throwing one . And they hate it . " Al Leiter , whose signature pitch was a cutter , echoed Isringhausen 's sentiments : " Now , everybody throws it and Mo has had a huge influence on that . Pitchers watched him and marveled at what he did with one pitch . "

 Rivera and his wife Clara have known each other since elementary school , and they were married on November 9 , 1991 . They have three sons : Mariano III , <unk> , and <unk> . The family lived in Panama until 2000 , when they relocated to Westchester County , New York ; they currently reside in Rye , New York . Mariano III pitched for Iona College in New Rochelle , not far from his home . He was drafted by the Yankees with the <unk> pick in the 2014 MLB draft , but decided to return to Iona for his junior year . In the following year 's draft , Mariano III was selected by the Washington Nationals in the 4th round with the 134th overall pick . 
 Over the course of his professional career , Rivera learned English , beginning in 1991 with the Greensboro Hornets , when he realized none of his teammates spoke his native Spanish . He is now a proponent of Latino players learning English and of American press members learning Spanish , in order to bridge the cultural gap . 
 = = = Religion and philanthropy = = = 
 Rivera is a devout Christian . During his childhood , neither he nor his family attended church , but after a born @-@ again experience around the age of 21 , Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith . His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him . Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens . For example , he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson . Had the Yankees won the series , Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587 , which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard . Rivera told Wilson , " I am glad we lost the World Series , because it means that I still have a friend . " Rivera 's pitching glove was inscribed " Phil . 4 : 13 " , in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4 : 13 ( " I can do all things through Christ , who strengthens me " ) . 
 Rivera is involved with philanthropic contributions in his native Panama , which include building an elementary school , providing Christmas gifts to children , and developing a program that provides computer access and adult mentors to youths . The Mariano Rivera Foundation , which helps provide underprivileged children with an education , distributes more than $ 500 @,@ 000 annually in the US and Panama through church @-@ based institutions . In addition to funding church start @-@ ups in Panama , Mexico , the Dominican Republic , California , and Florida , Rivera opened a church in New Rochelle in March 2014 that his foundation renovated at a cost of $ 3 million . The church , named Refugio de Esperanza ( " Refuge of Hope " ) , has Rivera 's wife Clara as its pastor and hosts a Pentecostal congregation that previously met at the Rivera home . Since retiring from baseball , Rivera has dedicated himself to philanthropy and his churches . He and Clara have twice awarded a scholarship in their names to a student at the local College of New Rochelle . In 2012 , the Giving Back Fund estimated that Rivera donated $ 627 @,@ 500 to charity in 2010 , ranking him as the 25th @-@ most generous celebrity on a list that the fund compiled . He won the 2013 Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award , which is given to the MLB player " who inspires others through his on @-@ field performances and contributions to his community " .

 Rivera was an investor in two New York area restaurants : " Clubhouse Grill " , which opened in New Rochelle in 2006 as " Mo 's New York Grill " ; and Siro 's , which opened in Manhattan in 2012 . Both restaurants have since closed . In 2015 , he opened a Toyota and Scion car dealership in Mount Kisco , New York . Rivera has been a celebrity spokesman for several companies , including : Nike sports apparel ; <unk> , a premium men 's clothing company , as their first athlete spokesperson ; Skechers footwear ; and Hartford Financial Services Group , Inc . A 2011 list by the marketing firm Nielsen ranked Rivera as the second @-@ most marketable player in baseball ; the list accounted for personal attributes such as sincerity , approachability , experience , and influence .

 In March 2014 , Rivera was twice recognized for his philanthropic efforts , receiving the <unk> Humanitarian Award from the Jackie Robinson Foundation , as well as a Jefferson Award for Public Service . Later that month , the " Legends Series " , comprising two MLB exhibition games between the Yankees and Miami Marlins , was played in Rivera 's native Panama to " honor [ his ] legacy " ; he helped promote the games , which were supplemented by charitable events and a gala benefiting his foundation . On April 9 , 2014 , MLB announced that a new annual award for relief pitchers , the Reliever of the Year Award , would replace the existing Delivery Man of the Year Award , and that the AL honor would be named after Rivera . The following month , a section of River Avenue bordering Yankee Stadium at 161st Street was renamed " Rivera Avenue " in the pitcher 's honor . This coincided with the release of his autobiography , The Closer : My Story , co @-@ authored with Wayne Coffey . New York University bestowed an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree upon Rivera during its commencement ceremony at Yankee Stadium on May 21 , 2014 .

 = Ian Johnson ( cricketer ) = 
 Ian William Geddes Johnson CBE ( 8 December 1917 – 9 October 1998 ) was an Australian cricketer who played 45 Test matches as a slow off @-@ break bowler between 1946 and 1956 . Johnson captured 109 Test wickets at an average of 29 @.@ 19 runs per wicket and as a lower order batsman made 1 @,@ 000 runs at an average of 22 @.@ 92 runs per dismissal . He captained the Australian team in 17 Tests , winning seven and losing five , with a further five drawn . Despite this record , he is better known as the captain who lost consecutive Ashes series against England . Urbane , well @-@ spoken and popular with his opponents and the public , he was seen by his team mates as a disciplinarian and his natural optimism was often seen as naive . 
 Aged 17 , Johnson made his first @-@ class cricket debut for Victoria in the 1935 – 36 season but did not establish a permanent place in the team until 1939 – 40 . His career was interrupted by the Second World War ; he served with the Royal Australian Air Force as a pilot and later as a flight instructor . He returned to cricket after his discharge and was selected to tour New Zealand with the Australian team , making his Test debut . Johnson was part of Don Bradman 's Invincibles team ; undefeated on tour in England in 1948 . He was a regular member of the national side until poor form saw him left out of the Australian squad for the 1953 tour of England . 
 Johnson was appointed Australian captain following Lindsay Hassett 's retirement . The appointment was not universally popular ; some team mates and supporters felt Keith Miller had a better claim to the position . In his first series as captain , Australia was defeated by a strong English team on home soil . The tour of the West Indies that followed was a cricketing and diplomatic triumph for Johnson . Australia won the Test series comfortably and Johnson 's astute public relations skills helped avoid a repeat of the crowd disturbances that had marred England 's visit to the islands 12 months before . However , his Australian team then went on to lose the 1956 Ashes series in England . Johnson 's Test career ended with Australia 's first Test tour of the Indian subcontinent , which occurred during the voyage back to Australia . Australia lost the one @-@ off Test against Pakistan , the first between the two nations , before claiming the series against India . On his return to Australia , he retired from all forms of cricket at age 39 . 
 After retirement , Johnson worked for a time as a sports commentator , including covering the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne . In 1957 he was appointed Secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club , one of the most prestigious positions in Australian sport . He would remain in the role for 26 years , overseeing the development of the Melbourne Cricket Ground and playing a key role in the organisation of the Centenary Test in 1977 . In 1957 he was also honoured with an MBE for services to cricket ; this was twice upgraded : to OBE in 1977 and to CBE in 1982 . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Johnson was born in North Melbourne , an inner suburb of Melbourne , on 8 December 1918 . His father , William Johnson — a wine and spirit grocer — was a keen cricketer who played one first @-@ class match for Victoria in 1924 – 25 before serving as a selector for the Australian Test team . 
 As a schoolboy , Ian Johnson excelled at a variety of sports . He participated in athletics and Australian rules football , as well as playing as a wicket @-@ keeper for Middle Park State School . In 1936 , he became the Victorian amateur squash champion . However , he found his vocation in cricket . In 1934 – 35 , aged only 16 , and still a schoolboy at Wesley College , Johnson played his first match for the South Melbourne Cricket Club First XI . 
 He was given the opportunity to play first @-@ class cricket the following season , playing Tasmania — not then involved in the Sheffield Shield competition — just 23 days past his seventeenth birthday . He scored 34 and 26 and took two wickets in each innings as Tasmania won by six wickets . He was retained for the next game , scoring 15 runs in his only innings and taking 3 wickets for 40 runs ( 3 / 40 ) in the Tasmanian first innings and 1 / 27 in the second . 
 He did not play first @-@ class cricket again for three years , finally returning to the Victorian side to play another two games against Tasmania in 1938 – 39 , making his highest first @-@ class score to date , 88 runs , in the second game . He secured his place in the Victorian team in the 1939 – 40 season , making his Sheffield Shield debut against South Australia in Adelaide in November 1939 . Batting at number five , Johnson scored 33 runs in the first innings and 41 in the second , but was unable to take a wicket . That season , Johnson scored 313 runs at an average of 26 @.@ 08 and took 13 wickets at an average of 39 @.@ 92 . In a season truncated because of the Second World War , Johnson played five matches in 1940 – 41 , scoring 292 runs at an average of 32 @.@ 44 and taking 25 wickets at 27 @.@ 60 . 
 Johnson 's cricket career was interrupted by the war and he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in March 1941 . He flew Bristol Beaufighters with No. 22 Squadron RAAF and , by 1944 , was serving as a Flight Lieutenant in the South West Pacific theatre . In June 1945 , Johnson was awarded the Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air for his work as a flight instructor with No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School , based at Benalla in rural Victoria . He was discharged in December 1945 and resumed his first @-@ class cricket career in the 1945 – 46 season . 
 = = Test career = = 
 = = = Debut and early Test career = = = 
 Following his discharge from service , Johnson returned to first @-@ class cricket in the 1945 – 46 season , winning a place on the Australian tour of New Zealand . The only Test match — the first between the two nations — was played at the Basin Reserve in Wellington . Johnson scored 7 not out and he was not needed to bowl as New Zealand collapsed for an aggregate of just 96 runs in their two innings ; Australia won by an innings and 103 runs . 
 Test cricket resumed in Australia with the visit of the English team in 1946 – 47 . Before the Test matches started , the touring team played Victoria in a warm @-@ up match . Johnson took 4 wickets for 38 runs in the English second innings but was unable to prevent the tourists from winning by 244 runs . He was included in the Australian team for the First Test at Brisbane , scoring 47 runs in the Australian total of 645 . Once again Johnson was not given an opportunity to bowl as Australia won the match by an innings and 332 runs . Johnson took his first Test wicket with only his third delivery in Test cricket , dismissing Len Hutton caught behind down the leg side in the Second Test in Sydney . Making use of the breeze , in one 11 over stretch Johnson conceded only three runs — including eight maidens , taking one wicket . Johnson went on to take 6 wickets for 42 runs in the innings as England were bowled out for 255 . Johnson , batting as a nightwatchman , joined Sid Barnes at the wicket late on the second day of the match , batting through until stumps . He was dismissed the next day having scored 7 runs in an Australian total of 659 . In the English second innings Johnson took another two wickets ; England were dismissed for 371 runs and lost the Test by an innings and 33 runs . 
 Johnson met with less success in the Third Test in his home town of Melbourne . Batting at number six , Johnson was dismissed by Norman Yardley for a golden duck and , in the second innings , run out , again without scoring , giving him an unwanted pair . With the ball , Johnson took one wicket in the English first innings . In the second innings Australia were not able to dismiss England and the match was drawn ; Johnson failed to take a wicket . Johnson returned to form with the bat in the Fourth Test at Adelaide . Unable to take a wicket in England 's first innings , during the Australian first innings he made 52 runs . He dismissed Hutton again in the second innings , his only wicket of the match . The match finished in a draw , giving the Australians an unbeatable two – nil lead in the Test series and therefore retaining The Ashes . Johnson was injured and could not play in the Fifth and final Fifth Test in Sydney . 
 A weak Indian team toured Australia for the first time in 1947 – 48 , to play five Tests against an Australian team led by Don Bradman . The Indian team was weakened by withdrawals of their first @-@ choice captain Vijay Merchant , as well as <unk> Modi and Mushtaq Ali . Furthermore , Fazal Mahmood had become a Pakistani , following the partition of India . Johnson played in the first four Tests , taking 16 wickets at an average of 16 @.@ 31 runs per wicket . The Third Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) saw Johnson 's best performance of the series , 4 / 59 in the first innings and 4 / 35 in the second . Australia won the series 4 – 0 . 
 = = = Bradman 's Invincibles = = = 
 Johnson was a member of Don Bradman 's Australian team touring England in 1948 . Known as the Invincibles , the Australian team was the first side to remain unbeaten through an entire English tour . Johnson started the tour well , taking 7 / 42 in an early tour match against Leicestershire , followed by 5 / 53 against Surrey . Against Essex , Johnson took 6 / 37 in the second innings . Earlier in the match Australia had scored 721 runs in a single day ; Johnson made 9 . 
 Having earned selection for the First Test at Trent Bridge , Johnson took only one wicket in the match ; Australia won the Test by eight wickets . He had more success in the Second Test at Lord 's taking three wickets in the first innings as Australia won the match by 409 runs . Johnson failed to take a wicket in a rain @-@ affected Third Test at Old Trafford , and was replaced after the Fourth Test , having taken only seven wickets in the series at an average of 61 @.@ 00 . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack noted that while Johnson had started the tour well , he was not as effective in English conditions as Australian . 
 [ Johnson ] was not so troublesome to batsmen in Tests as when at home , principally because of the difference in pace of the pitches and his inability to bowl round the wicket , an almost essential part in the make @-@ up of an off @-@ spinner in England . False expectation against Johnson in Australia usually cost a batsman his wicket , but on slower English pitches there was time to change a stroke and still keep the ball out of the stumps , even though beaten by flight . 
 Nonetheless , Johnson played an important role in maintaining the Australian team 's unbeaten record , bowling more overs than anyone other than Bill Johnston — allowing Bradman to rest Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall , his fast bowling pair , for the important matches . 
 = = = Decline in form = = = 
 During the Test series in South Africa in 1949 – 50 , Johnson took 18 wickets at an average of 24 @.@ 22 — only Bill Johnston , with 23 , took more . Against a South African team weakened following the Second World War , the Australians started the series with a win in the First Test at Ellis Park at Johannesburg . The Australians won the match by an innings and 83 runs ; Johnson made 66 and took 3 / 37 and 3 / 54 . His best performance was in the Third Test at Kingsmead in Durban ; 5 / 34 including the wicket of Dudley Nourse as South Africa was dismissed for 99 . Australia , having made only 75 in their first innings , scored 336 , including 151 not out by Neil Harvey , to win the match by five wickets . Australia won the series — Lindsay Hassett 's first as captain — four Tests to nil . 
 Freddie Brown and his English team toured Australia in 1950 – 51 to compete for the Ashes in a five Test series . Australia won the series four Tests to one ; however Wisden reports that while " Australia held a slight superiority ... the difference between the teams was markedly less than revealed by statistics " . Johnson had a " mediocre series " , taking only seven wickets at an average of 44 @.@ 42 . His best performance was in the Third Test , when he took three wickets in the England first innings . He followed this by scoring 77 runs in a 150 run partnership with Keith Miller , who went on to score 145 not out . Johnson took another wicket in the English second innings and Australia won the Test by an innings and 13 runs . England 's victory in the Fifth Test in Melbourne ended Australia 's unbeaten run of 29 Tests since 1938 . 
 The next summer , the West Indian team visited Australia to play five Tests . The series was billed as the " unofficial cricket championship of the world " , following the West Indian victory against England in 1950 . However , the Australians won the series comfortably , 4 – 0 . Johnson had another lean series , taking only eight wickets at an average of 32 @.@ 75 . 
 When the South Africans toured in 1952 – 53 , Johnson was selected for Australia ahead of Queenslander Colin McCool . His selection was unpopular with a parochial Gabba crowd ; when Gil Langley — who had replaced another Queenslander , Don Tallon — fumbled a stumping chance against John Watkins , they cheered loudly . Johnson was omitted from the side for the remainder of the series and was not included in the Australian squad to tour England in 1953 . 
 = = Captaincy = = 
 = = = Selection = = = 
 While the Australian team lost the Ashes for the first time in twenty years , Johnson spent the winter of 1953 calling Australian rules football matches for local radio station 3AW and writing columns for The Argus newspaper . Later that year , the Victorian Cricket Association appointed him to succeed the retired Hassett as captain of Victoria . In the middle of the season , at a mutual friend 's New Year 's Eve party , Hassett approached Johnson to discuss his form . Taking a confrontational approach , Hassett said to Johnson , " The problem is that you are not getting stuck in . You 're not trying . " When Johnson protested , Hassett continued " If you have got any brains , you will start taking this game seriously . Because if you do you will end up captaining Australia next year . " 
 The other contender for the vacant national captaincy position was Keith Miller , the fast @-@ bowling all @-@ rounder and captain of New South Wales . Miller had led his team to victory in the 1953 – 54 Sheffield Shield and was recognised as an intuitive captain . Based solely on cricketing merit , Miller , a regular selection at international level , was seen as the superior candidate . However , inter @-@ state rivalries and a perception that Miller would be a poor disciplinarian saw him passed over . This perception was partly based on an incident when Miller , as captain of New South Wales , allowed his team @-@ mate Sid Barnes to serve drinks on the field dressed in a three @-@ piece suit rather than standard cricket whites . Johnson , on the other hand , was part of the cricket establishment : he was an alumnus of the exclusive Wesley College and the son of a former Test selector . He had also returned to form , taking 37 wickets in the 1953 – 54 Sheffield Shield — more than any other player — at an average of 16 @.@ 37 . In what cricket writer Dick Whitington speculated was a vote split between the New South Wales and Victorian factions , the Australian Board of Control appointed Johnson as Australian captain . His appointment was not universally applauded . 
 There is strong feeling amongst cricket enthusiasts that horse trading on a state basis rather than objective evaluation of cricket skills has dominated selectors ' discussions . The operating principle seems to have been " you look after my man and we 'll look after yours . " 
 = = = Ashes defeat = = = 
 Johnson 's first challenge as captain was the Ashes series against England in 1954 – 55 . In his first match as captain — the First Test at the Gabba in Brisbane — he led his team to victory , defeating England by an innings and 154 runs . It was to be the only Australian victory in the series . Injured , Johnson was unable to play in the Second Test in Sydney . With Miller also injured , Arthur Morris was asked to lead the Australian team against an English fast bowling attack including Frank Tyson and Brian Statham . Tyson , who took ten wickets in the match , was instrumental in England winning the Test by 38 runs . Johnson and Miller returned for the Third Test in Melbourne but were unable to prevent another English victory , this time by 128 runs . The Test was marred by controversy ; Melbourne newspaper , The Age , alleged that the pitch had been watered during the course of the match , in contravention of the laws of cricket . Following an enquiry , the Victorian Cricket Association and the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a statement denying any watering of the playing area during the match ; however Wisden reported that " large cracks were evident on Saturday yet on Monday these had closed and for a time the surface behaved more kindly to batsmen " . Certainly , Johnson felt the pitch had been changed to his disadvantage : " It was like losing the toss twice over " . Johnson and Test debutant Len Maddocks shared a partnership of 54 runs to help Australia fight back in their first innings . Tyson ended the Australian resistance , taking 7 / 27 in the Australian second innings — England won the match by 128 runs . England won the Fourth Test at Adelaide by five wickets and therefore retained the Ashes . With the Fifth and final Test ending in a draw , England won the series 3 – 1 . 
 Wisden attributed England 's victory to " superb fast bowling by Tyson and Statham [ that ] turned the scales so that finally the Australian batsmen were completely humbled " . Losing three successive Tests saw the selectors of the Australian team subjected to harsh criticism . In the four Tests that Johnson played , he claimed 12 wickets at 20 @.@ 25 and had a batting average of 58 @.@ 00 — inflated because of a series of not out innings ; his highest score for the series was 41 . 
 = = = Caribbean success = = = 
 In March 1955 , Johnson led Australia 's first Test tour of the West Indies . The Australian Board of Control was concerned about the team 's relations with the West Indian public . Against a background of rising anti @-@ colonial feeling and resentment , England 's tour of the West Indies the year before had been marred by riots and violent disturbances . With the White Australia policy in place at the time , the Australians feared an unpleasant reception from the Caribbean public . However , the Australian team proved very popular throughout the West Indies ; Wisden reported that " much credit belonged to the tact displayed by Ian Johnson , who proved a most able captain " . Johnson cultivated a relaxed manner with the locals ; in one instance at Sabina Park in Jamaica , he stopped to pick up a toddler who had run onto the playing field during the change of innings . Smiling and chatting to the boy , he then carried him safely off the ground . Team mate Alan Davidson claimed , " Ian did the best PR job of any captain I 've ever seen " . 
 As well as being popular , the Australian team was successful on the field , winning the series three Tests to nil . The series was dominated by batsmen ; in the five Test matches played the Australians scored 12 centuries while for the West Indies , Clyde Walcott alone scored five centuries — including centuries in both innings in the Tests at Sabina Park and Queens Park Oval . Johnson injured his foot while batting during the Sabina Park Test and was unable to bowl or field for the remainder of the match . In his place , Miller led the Australians to a nine @-@ wicket victory . The Second Test at Queens Park Oval was a high scoring draw ; Johnson scored 66 runs and took a single wicket . Johnson met with success in the Third Test at Bourda in Georgetown , Guyana . He took 7 / 44 in the West Indian second innings — still the best @-@ ever innings analysis by an Australian captain — and Australia won the Test by eight wickets . 
 A major rift between Johnson and Miller — erstwhile rivals for the Australian captaincy — developed during the Fourth Test , played at Kensington Oval in Barbados . During the third day , Miller , bowling fast @-@ medium swingers , had dismissed Everton Weekes and Collie Smith in quick succession to leave the West Indies at 6 / 147 with Denis Atkinson and <unk> Depeiaza batting . Johnson , thinking that the two batsmen would be vulnerable to express pace , asked Miller to increase his bowling speed . When Miller refused , Johnson remonstrated with him : " I 'll say who bowls and what they bowl " . With Miller refusing to bowl as directed , Johnson replaced him in the attack with Ray Lindwall . Walking off the field at the end of the day 's play and continuing in the dressing room , Miller provoked Johnson , telling him he " couldn 't captain a team of schoolboys " , among other insults . Finally Johnson responded , asking " If you want to go on like that why don 't we go around the back and thrash it out ? " The much larger Miller declined the offer and the pair travelled back to the team hotel together . The next day , Atkinson and Depeiaza batted throughout the entire day 's play . Their partnership of 347 runs for the seventh wicket is still a world record . 
 In the Fifth and final Test , the Australians scored 758 runs in their only innings — including maiden Test centuries for Benaud and Ron Archer , centuries for Miller and Colin McDonald , and a double century for Neil Harvey — to win the match by an innings and 83 runs . 
 Overall , despite the team 's victory in the series , Johnson 's on @-@ field contribution was inconsistent . While he took 14 wickets in the Test series , seven came in just one innings . His inconsistent form saw internal team tensions develop over whether his place in the team was justified ; Wisden claimed that " some malcontents called him ' myxomatosis ' because he only bowled when the rabbits were in " . 
 Ian was starting to wane as a player . He was always confident in his own ability but things were getting hard for him . And I do think players need to realise when they are playing that one season too many . 
 Donald Bradman wrote to Prime Minister Robert Menzies after the tour , recommending an honour for Johnson in recognition of his contribution to the tour 's success . The next year , both Johnson and Miller were appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) . 
 = = = " <unk> " = = = 
 Johnson led his Australian team to England in 1956 . The team 's visit to England coincided with what was described by Wisden as " the wettest of all summers in memory " . The poor weather gave the Australian team little chance to develop their confidence and Johnson used the early matches of the tour to allow his batsmen and bowlers to experiment in the unfamiliar conditions . In one of these early matches , Surrey defeated Australia by ten wickets ; the first time Australia had lost to county opposition since 1912 . In parallel with later events in the Old Trafford Test , off @-@ spinner Jim Laker took all ten wickets in the Australian first innings ; Laker and left @-@ arm spinner Tony Lock took 19 of the 20 Australian wickets that fell in the match . While Johnson was successful with the ball , taking 6 wickets for 168 ; his preconceived tactics saw him allow Lindwall — his main fast bowler — only two overs in Surrey 's first innings and attempt to turn Alan Davidson into a spin bowler . Cricket writer Ray Robinson said of Johnson 's tactics throughout the tour , " I have not met one good cricketer or cricket judge who is not mystified by them " . The manner of this loss severely dented Australia 's confidence against spin for the remainder of the tour . 
 The First Test , at Nottingham , was affected by rain and , despite England declaring twice , the match ended in a draw . Injuries to Lindwall and Davidson meant an under @-@ strength Australian team was forced to take the field in the Second Test at Lord 's . In what Wisden described as a " triumph of teamwork " , the Australians won the match by 185 runs . Johnson was unlucky to lose the toss in the Third Test at Leeds , because Lock and Laker were able to take maximum advantage of a pitch conducive to spin . The duo took 18 of the 20 Australian wickets and England won the match by an innings and 42 runs . 
 The Fourth Test at Manchester proved controversial . The Old Trafford pitch had little grass , perhaps as a result of earlier wet weather . Again , Johnson lost the toss and England chose to bat first . Johnson and his spinning partner , Richie Benaud were unable to exploit the spin @-@ friendly conditions and the English made 459 runs . In reply , the Australians could not come to grips with the conditions ; Laker took nine of the ten wickets , Lock the other , as Australia were brushed away for just 84 . Amid wild weather , the Australians were asked to follow @-@ on . A determined batting performance was not enough to prevent an English victory by an innings and 170 runs . Laker 's performance was historic . He took 10 / 53 , the first time in a Test match a bowler had taken all ten wickets in an innings . With his 9 / 37 in the first innings , he had captured 19 wickets for the match , still a world record in first @-@ class cricket . Wisden reported that the Australians were " extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch " . Former Test cricketer and journalist Bill O 'Reilly wrote " This pitch is a complete disgrace " while Colin McDonald later said , " England cheated : if by cheating you include the practise of preparing wickets to suit your own purpose . " Johnson was generous towards the victors . Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians , he said : " When the controversy and side issues of the match are forgotten , Laker 's wonderful bowling will remain . " The media reported that Australia had been " <unk> " . 
 The Fifth and final Test was drawn and Australia lost the series two Tests to one . Australia had now lost three Ashes series in a row , the last two with Johnson as captain . His own form was modest ; he took only six wickets in the Tests at an average of over 50 runs per wicket . His performance with the bat was worse , scoring just 61 runs at an average of only 7 @.@ 62 . Once again , Johnson 's place in the team was questioned . <unk> cricket pundit Sid Barnes — a former team mate — joked that Johnson was " Australia 's non @-@ playing captain " . Bill Ferguson , the Australian team 's scorer , was also critical : " Had Johnson been told by his friends in the press that he was , in fact , a passenger , he might have pondered on the advisability of standing down . [ ... ] There would have been no shame in standing down . " Writing after the tour , Miller — a tour selector — stated " Privately I thought that [ Johnson ] was not a form selection . On the other hand , I did not think it wise to change skippers in midstream . " 
 I was over the hill , no doubt about it . So were [ Miller ] and [ Lindwall ] . But even though I wasn 't performing well , I still thought I was important to the side . 
 = = = Home and retirement = = = 
 On the return journey from England , the Australians toured India and Pakistan for the first time , with mixed results . On a matting pitch , unfamiliar to the Australians , Johnson 's team lost the inaugural Test against Pakistan at Karachi . Responding to the loss , a cartoon drawn by Norman Mitchell of the Adelaide News newspaper suggested island planters might be able to scrape together a team that would be a match for the Australians . Returning to turf pitches in India , the Australians restored some pride . Johnson was the highest scorer in the Australian team 's victory by an innings and five runs in the First Test at Nehru Stadium in Madras . Due to injury , both Johnson and Miller missed the drawn Second Test at Brabourne Stadium at Bombay ; Lindwall skippered the side . Johnson returned for the Third Test at Eden Gardens , Calcutta for what would ultimately prove to be his final Test . The Australians won the match by 94 runs , giving them a 2 – 0 series win . S. K. <unk> , summing up in the Indian Cricket Almanack , wrote : " The Australians showed themselves to be a superior side even when their batting failed " . 
 When the team finally arrived home , Johnson announced his retirement from all cricket at the age of 39 . In all , he played 45 Tests , capturing 109 wickets at an average of 29 @.@ 19 , including three five @-@ wicket hauls . He scored exactly 1 @,@ 000 runs , making him one of only eleven Australians to achieve the double of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket . In all first @-@ class cricket , Johnson had taken 619 wickets and scored 4 @,@ 905 runs . 
 His record as the Australian captain was mixed ; he had captained Australia in 17 Tests , winning seven and losing five . However , he was better known as the first captain to lead Australia to successive Ashes defeats in the 20th century . Reviewing Johnson 's time as captain , Wisden said , " Unfortunately for him , he took over in the mid @-@ 1950s , when Australian cricket was decidedly inferior to England 's for the first time since before the Bradman era " but " he was a fine cricketer and , in some respects , a visionary " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 In 1942 , aged 24 , Johnson married 19 @-@ year @-@ old Lal Park , the daughter of former Test cricketer , Dr Roy Park . They were married for 56 years and had two sons , Bill and Bob . After the war , when cricket commitments allowed , Johnson worked as a salesman . Immediately following his retirement , Johnson spent some time as one of the first television sporting commentators in Australia , covering the 1956 Summer Olympics , held in his home town of Melbourne . He wrote a book ; Cricket at the crossroads , published in 1957 . 
 The following year , Johnson was chosen from a group of 44 candidates for the position of secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club . The position — previously held by Test cricketers Hugh Trumble and Vernon Ransford — is one of the most prestigious jobs in Australian cricket . During a time of " dramatic change " , he helped to maintain the Melbourne Cricket Ground 's ( " MCG " ) pre @-@ eminence as a sporting arena . Johnson managed the club and the ground through some major redevelopment , keeping a balance between the competing interests of Australian rules football and cricket . For services to sports administration , he was appointed an Officer in the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in 1976 . He played a leading part in organising the Centenary Test , held at the MCG in 1977 . 
 For 20 years , he served as a member of the Victorian state Parole board . After serving Melbourne Cricket Club for 26 years , he retired to spend more time at his home in the southern Melbourne suburb of Albert Park and his holiday house in Torquay . In 1982 , his OBE was upgraded , when he was appointed a Commander in the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) for services to cricket . He died in Melbourne in 1998 following a long illness .

 Unusually for an Australian , Johnson bowled off @-@ spin rather than the wrist spin normally associated with countrymen of his day . Johnson had an atypical bowling action , with a " rather staccato swing " of his bowling arm . He bowled with a high degree of flight , causing opposing batsmen difficulties in judging where the ball would land . Making intelligent use of the wind , Johnson was able to make his deliveries float away from the batsman , changing from his standard off @-@ break . According to E. W. Swanton , Johnson was " probably the slowest bowler to achieve any measure of success in Test cricket " . His action was compared to a corkscrew ; writer Ray Robinson saying that " to coax turn from firm Australian pitches he twisted the ball almost hard enough to screw a doorknob off " . There were doubts about the legality of his bowling action ; his English rival , Trevor Bailey claimed Johnson threw every delivery . Johnson was never no @-@ balled for throwing , having played cricket in front of umpires from Australia , England , New Zealand , South Africa , the West Indies , India and Pakistan . 
 [ Johnson was ] at his best on dry crumbling wickets — the wet ones made him too slow . It always looked like he could be hit by a fast @-@ footed batsman . That he wasn 't may be put down to his straight ball , which was hard to detect , and often left the striker down the wicket . A most intelligent bowler , always scheming . 
 Jack Pollard described Johnson as a " dour middle order batsman " . He had a sound defence and when necessary could hit the ball with power . Bradman was full of praise for Johnson 's batting after the Invincibles tour in 1948 : " Splendid batsman — most valuable about number 7 " , also describing him as a " very good slip field " . 
 As captain , Johnson was noted for his public relations skills and his gift for public speaking . He was optimistic by nature , with a belief in " guts and determination " . However , he was seen as insensitive at times ; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session : " Just cos you are one of the old blokes in the side doesn 't mean you don 't have to bloody well put in you know . " At times his optimism could appear artless and naive . Ian Craig — his successor as Australian captain — was critical of Johnson 's attitude during the 1956 tour of England : " I don 't think [ Johnson ] was ever realistic about the situation . [ ... ] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches , but the team knew what was going on . " Pat Crawford felt " Johnson couldn 't get anything out of the players , whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [ Miller ] " . He was seen by some of his team mates as " dictatorial " with Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson 's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead @-@ in match before 1956 Test series in England . 
 Johnson was sportsmanlike ; on one occasion in South Africa , when Eastern Province batsman Ray Connell was bowled after the ball deflected from his head , Johnson replaced the bails , allowing him to continue batting . During the Adelaide Test in 1950 – 51 he " walked " , ensuring that the unlucky John Warr took at least one wicket for the series . 
 I got the faintest of faint touches and Godfrey [ Evans ] went up , half @-@ heartedly . John followed him , but the umpire said not out . Well I saw John 's shoulders sag , and he looked so crestfallen that on the spur of the moment I nodded to the umpire and walked . 
 Johnson was not above some gamesmanship , resorting to time @-@ wasting tactics to avoid defeat in the final Test of the 1956 series against England . He was willing to have some fun on occasion ; when in the West Indies he convinced a local pilot to allow him to fly the plane carrying the Australian team between Trinidad and nearby Tobago , to the later displeasure of the Australian Board of Control . 
 Normally diplomatic , in a newspaper article in South Africa , Johnson was blunt with his hosts about race relations in the country : " I am certain that the average man @-@ in @-@ the @-@ street avoids the problem too much for , at the moment , you 're living in a fool 's paradise " . Urbane , courteous and popular with opposition players and spectators , Colin Cowdrey described Johnson as " an astute leader and fine ambassador for cricket " .

 = Oscar Robertson = 
 Oscar Palmer Robertson ( born November 24 , 1938 ) , nicknamed " The Big O " , is an American retired National Basketball Association player who played for the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks . The 6 ft 5 in ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) , 220 lb ( 100 kg ) Robertson played at point guard and was a 12 @-@ time All @-@ Star , 11 @-@ time member of the All @-@ NBA Team , and one @-@ time winner of the MVP award in 14 professional seasons . He is the only player in NBA history to average a triple @-@ double for a season . He was a key player on the team which brought the Bucks their only NBA title in the 1970 – 71 NBA season . His playing career , especially during high school and college , was plagued by racism . 
 Robertson is a two @-@ time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee , having been inducted in 1980 for his individual career , and in 2010 as a member of the 1960 United States men 's Olympic basketball team and president of the National Basketball Players Association . He also was voted one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 . The United States Basketball Writers Association renamed their College Player of the Year Award the Oscar Robertson Trophy in his honor in 1998 , and he was one of five people chosen to represent the inaugural National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame class in 2006 . He was ranked as the 36th best American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN . 
 Robertson was also an integral part of Robertson v. National Basketball Ass 'n of 1970 . The landmark NBA antitrust suit , named after the then @-@ president of the NBA Players ' Association , led to an extensive reform of the league 's strict free agency and draft rules and , subsequently , to higher salaries for all players . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Robertson was born in poverty in Charlotte , Tennessee and grew up in a segregated housing project in Indianapolis . In contrast to many other boys who preferred to play baseball , he was drawn to basketball because it was " a poor kids ' game . " Because his family could not afford a basketball , he learned how to shoot by tossing tennis balls and rags bound with rubber bands into a peach basket behind his family 's home . Robertson attended Crispus Attucks High School , a segregated all @-@ black high school . 
 = = High school career = = 
 At Crispus Attucks , Robertson 's coach was Ray Crowe , whose emphasis on a fundamentally sound game had a positive effect on Robertson 's style of play . In 1954 , as a sophomore , he starred on an Attucks team that lost in the semi @-@ state finals ( state quarterfinals ) to eventual state champions Milan , whose story would later be the basis of the classic 1986 movie Hoosiers . When Robertson was a junior , Crispus Attucks dominated its opposition , going 31 – 1 and winning the 1955 state championship , the first for any all @-@ black school in the nation . The following year the team finished with a perfect 31 – 0 record and won a second straight Indiana state title , becoming the first team in Indiana to secure a perfect season and compiling a state @-@ record 45 straight victories . The state championships were also the first ever by an Indianapolis team in the Hoosier tourney . After their championship game wins , the team was paraded through town in a regular tradition , but they were then taken to a park outside downtown to continue their celebration , unlike other teams . Robertson stated , " [ Officials ] thought the blacks were going to tear the town up , and they thought the whites wouldn 't like it . " Robertson scored 24 @.@ 0 points per game in his senior season and was named Indiana " Mr. Basketball " in 1956 . After his graduation that year , Robertson enrolled at the University of Cincinnati . 
 = = College career ( 1957 – 1960 ) = = 
 Robertson continued to dominate his opponents while at the University of Cincinnati , recording an incredible scoring average of 33 @.@ 8 points per game , the third highest in college history . In each of his three years , he won the national scoring title , was named an All @-@ American , and was chosen College Player of the Year , while setting 14 NCAA and 19 school records . 
 Robertson 's stellar play led the Bearcats to a 79 – 9 overall record during his three varsity seasons , including two Final Four appearances . However , a championship eluded Robertson , something that would become a repeated occurrence in his later career . When Robertson left college he was the all @-@ time leading NCAA scorer until fellow Hall of Fame player Pete Maravich topped him in 1970 . 
 He continues to stand atop the Bearcats ' record book . The many records he still holds include : points in one game , 62 ( one of his six games of 50 points or more ) ; career triple @-@ doubles , 10 ; career rebounds per game , 15 @.@ 2 ; and career points , 2 @,@ 973 . 
 Of his many outstanding individual game performances , including his 10 triple @-@ doubles , perhaps the best is his line of 45 points , 23 rebounds and 10 assists vs. Indiana State in 1959 . 
 Despite his success on the courts , Robertson 's college career was soured by racism . Road trips to segregated cities were especially difficult , with Robertson often sleeping in college dorms instead of hotels . " I 'll never forgive them , " he told the Indianapolis Star years later . Decades after his college days , Robertson 's stellar NCAA career was rewarded by the United States Basketball Writers Association when , in 1998 , they renamed the trophy awarded to the NCAA Division I Player of the Year the Oscar Robertson Trophy . This honor brought the award full circle for Robertson since he had won the first two awards ever presented . 
 = = 1960 Olympics = = 
 After college , Robertson co @-@ captained the U.S. basketball team at the 1960 Summer Olympics with Jerry West . The team , described as the greatest assemblage of amateur basketball talent ever , went undefeated during the competition to win the gold medal . Robertson was a starting forward along with Purdue 's Terry <unk> , but played point guard as well . He was the co @-@ leading scorer with fellow NBA legend Jerry Lucas , as the U.S. team won its nine games by a margin of 42 @.@ 4 points . 10 of the 12 college players on the American squad later played professionally in the NBA , including Robertson as well as future Hall @-@ of @-@ Famers West , Lucas , and Walt Bellamy .

 = = = Cincinnati Royals = = = 
 Prior to the 1960 – 61 NBA season , Robertson made himself eligible for the 1960 NBA draft . He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick . The Royals gave Robertson a $ 33 @,@ 000 signing bonus , a far cry from his childhood days when he was too poor to afford a basketball . In his rookie season , Robertson averaged 30 @.@ 5 points , 10 @.@ 1 rebounds and 9 @.@ 7 assists ( leading the league ) , almost averaging a triple @-@ double for the entire season . He was named NBA Rookie of the Year , was elected into the All @-@ NBA First Team – which would happen in each of Robertson 's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive All @-@ Star Game appearances . In addition , he was named the 1961 NBA All @-@ Star Game MVP following his 23 @-@ point , 14 @-@ assist , 9 @-@ rebound performance in a West victory . However , the Royals finished with a 33 – 46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division . 
 In the 1961 – 62 season , Robertson became the only player in NBA history to average a triple @-@ double for an entire season , with 30 @.@ 8 points , 12 @.@ 5 rebounds and 11 @.@ 4 assists . He broke the assists record by Bob Cousy , who had recorded 715 assists two seasons earlier , by logging 899 . The Royals earned a playoff berth ; however , they were eliminated in the first round by the Detroit Pistons . In the next season , Robertson further established himself as one of the greatest players of his generation , averaging 28 @.@ 3 points , 10 @.@ 4 rebounds and 9 @.@ 5 assists , narrowly missing out on another triple @-@ double season . The Royals advanced to the Eastern Division Finals , but succumbed in a seven @-@ game series against a Boston Celtics team led by Bill Russell . 
 In the 1963 – 64 season , the Royals achieved a 55 – 25 record , which meant second place in the Eastern Division . Under new coach Jack McMahon , Robertson flourished , and for the first time in his career , he had a decent supporting cast : second scoring option Jack Twyman was now supplemented by Jerry Lucas and Wayne Embry , and fellow guard Adrian Smith helped Robertson in the backcourt . Robertson led the NBA in free @-@ throw percentage , scored a career @-@ high 31 @.@ 4 points per game , and averaged 9 @.@ 9 rebounds and 11 @.@ 0 assists per game . The averages for his first five NBA seasons are a triple @-@ double : 30 @.@ 3 points , 10 @.@ 4 rebounds and 10 @.@ 6 assists per game . He won the NBA MVP award and became the only player other than Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to win it from 1960 to 1968 . Robertson also won his second All @-@ Star Game MVP award that year after scoring 26 points , grabbing 14 rebounds , and dishing off 8 assists in an East victory . In the postseason , the Royals defeated the Philadelphia 76ers , but then were dominated by the Celtics 4 games to 1 . 
 From a win – loss perspective , however , that season would be Robertson 's last successful Royals season . From the 1964 – 65 season on , things began to turn sour for the franchise . Despite Robertson 's stellar play , never failing to record averages of at least 24 @.@ 7 points , 6 @.@ 0 rebounds and 8 @.@ 1 assists in the six following seasons , the Royals were eliminated in the first round from 1965 to 1967 , then missed the playoffs from 1968 to 1970 . In the 1969 – 70 season , the sixth disappointing season in a row , fan support was waning . To help attract the public , 41 @-@ year @-@ old head coach Bob Cousy made a short comeback . For seven games , the former Celtics point guard partnered with Robertson in the Royals ' backcourt , but they missed the playoffs . 
 = = = Milwaukee Bucks and the ' Oscar Robertson suit ' = = = 
 Prior to the 1970 – 71 season , the Royals stunned the basketball world by trading Robertson to the Bucks for Flynn Robinson and Charlie Paulk . Officially , no reasons were named , but many pundits suspected head coach Bob Cousy was jealous of all the attention Robertson was getting . Robertson himself said : " I think he was wrong and I will never forget it . " The relationship between Oscar and the Royals had soured to the point that Cincinnati had also approached the Lakers and Knicks about deals involving their star player ( the Knicks players who were discussed in those scenarios are unknown , but Los Angeles stated publicly that the Royals asked about Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain , with the Lakers saying they would not consider trading either star ) . 
 However , the trade proved highly beneficial for Robertson . After being stuck with an under @-@ performing team the last six years , he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor , who would years later become the all @-@ time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar . With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the backcourt , the Bucks charged to a league @-@ best 66 – 16 record , including a then @-@ record 20 @-@ game win streak , a dominating 12 – 2 record in the playoffs , and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4 – 0 in the 1971 NBA Finals . For the first time in his career , Robertson had won a championship on the NCAA or NBA level . 
 From a historical perspective , however , Robertson 's most important contribution was made not on the court , but rather in court . It was the year of the landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass 'n , an antitrust suit filed by the NBA 's Players Association against the league . As Robertson was the president of the Players Association , the case bore his name . In this suit , the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976 , and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed . Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players : players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up , because free agency did not exist back then . Six years after the suit was filed , the NBA finally reached a settlement , the ABA @-@ NBA merger took place , and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players . 
 On the hardwood , the veteran Robertson still proved he was a valuable player . Paired with Abdul @-@ Jabbar , two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the 1971 – 72 and 1972 – 73 season . In Robertson 's last season , he helped lead Milwaukee to a league @-@ best 59 – 23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals . There , Robertson had the chance to end his stellar career with a second ring . The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens , and the Bucks lost in seven games . As a testament to Robertson 's importance to the Bucks , in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38 – 44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul @-@ Jabbar . 
 Robertson was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995 . 
 = = = Post @-@ NBA career = = = 
 After he retired as an active player , Robertson stayed involved in efforts to improve living conditions in his native Indianapolis , especially concerning fellow African @-@ Americans . In addition , he worked as a color commentator with Brent Musburger on games televised by CBS during the 1974 – 75 NBA season . His trademark expression was " Oh , Brent , did you see that ! " in reaction to flashy or spectacular situations such as fast breaks , slam dunks , player collisions , etc . 
 After his retirement , the Kansas City Kings ( the Royals moved there while Robertson was with the Bucks ) retired his # 14 ; the retirement continues to be honored by the Kings in their current home of Sacramento . The Bucks also retired the # 1 he wore in Milwaukee . 
 In 1994 , a nine @-@ foot bronze statue of Robertson was erected outside the Fifth Third Arena at Shoemaker Center , the current home of Cincinnati Bearcats basketball . Robertson attends many of the games there , viewing the Bearcats from a chair at courtside . In 2006 , the statue was relocated to the entrance of the Richard E. Lindner Athletics Center at the University of Cincinnati . 
 Starting in 2000 , Robertson served as a director for Countrywide Financial Corporation , until the company 's sale to Bank of America in 2008 . 
 After many years outside the spotlight , on November 17 , 2006 , Robertson was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame . He was one of five , along with John Wooden , Bill Russell , Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith , selected to represent the inaugural class . 
 In July , 2004 , Robertson was named interim head coach of the Cincinnati Bearcats men 's basketball team on a temporary basis for around one month while head coach Bob Huggins served a suspension stemming from a drunk @-@ driving conviction . 
 In January 2011 , Robertson joined a class action lawsuit against the NCAA , challenging the organization 's use of the images of its former student athletes . 
 In 2015 , Robertson was among a group of investors that placed a marijuana legalization initiative on the Ohio ballot . The initiative sought exclusive grow rights for the group members while prohibiting all other cultivation except small amounts for personal use . Robertson appeared in a TV ad advocating for passage of the initiative , but it was ultimately defeated . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Robertson is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history , a triple threat who could score inside , outside and also was a stellar playmaker . His rookie scoring average of 30 @.@ 5 points per game is the third highest of any rookie in NBA history , and Robertson averaged more than 30 points per game in six of his first seven seasons . Only two other players in the NBA have had more 30 + point per game seasons in their career . Robertson was the first player to average more than 10 assists per game , doing so at a time when the criteria for assists were more stringent than today . Furthermore , Robertson is the only guard in NBA history to ever average more than 10 rebounds per game , doing so three times . In addition to his 1964 regular season MVP award , Robertson won three All @-@ Star Game MVPs in his career ( in 1961 , 1964 , and 1969 ) . He ended his career with 26 @,@ 710 points ( 25 @.@ 7 per game , ninth @-@ highest all time ) , 9 @,@ 887 assists ( 9 @.@ 5 per game ) and 7 @,@ 804 rebounds ( 7 @.@ 5 per game ) . He led the league in assists six times , and at the time of his retirement , he was the NBA 's all @-@ time leader in career assists and free throws made , and was the second all @-@ time leading scorer behind Wilt Chamberlain . 
 Robertson also set <unk> in versatility . If his first five NBA seasons are strung together , Robertson averaged a triple @-@ double over those , averaging 30 @.@ 3 points , 10 @.@ 4 rebounds and 10 @.@ 6 assists . For his career , Robertson had 181 triple @-@ doubles , a record that has never been approached . These numbers are even more astonishing if it is taken into account that the three @-@ point shot , which benefits sharpshooting backcourt players , did not exist when he played . In 1967 – 68 , Robertson also became the first of only two players in NBA history to lead the league in both scoring average and assists per game in the same season ( also achieved by Nate Archibald ) . The official scoring and assist titles went to other players that season , however , because the NBA based the titles on point and assist totals ( not averages ) prior to the 1969 – 70 season . Robertson did , however , win a total of six NBA assist titles during his career . For his career , Robertson shot a high .485 field goal average and led the league in free @-@ throw percentage twice — in the 1963 – 64 and 1967 – 68 seasons . 
 Robertson is recognized by the NBA as the first legitimate " big guard " , paving the way for other oversized backcourt players like Magic Johnson . Furthermore , he is also credited to have invented the head fake and the fadeaway jump shot , a shot which Michael Jordan later became famous for . For the Cincinnati Royals , now relocated and named the Sacramento Kings , he scored 22 @,@ 009 points and 7 @,@ 731 assists , and is all @-@ time leader in both statistics for the combined Royals / Kings teams . 
 Robertson was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on April 28 , 1980 . He received the " Player of the Century " award by the National Association of Basketball Coaches in 2000 and was ranked third on SLAM Magazine 's Top 75 NBA Players in 2003 , behind fellow NBA legends Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain . Furthermore , in 2006 , ESPN named Robertson the second greatest point guard of all time , praising him as the best post @-@ up guard of all time and placing him only behind Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson . 
 In 1959 , the Player of the Year Award was established to recognize the best college basketball player of the year by the United States Basketball Writers Association . Five nominees are presented and the individual with the most votes receives the award during the NCAA Final Four . In 1998 , it was renamed the Oscar Robertson Trophy in honor of the player who won the first two awards because of his outstanding career and his continuing efforts to promote the game of basketball . In 2004 , an 18 " bronze statue of Robertson was sculpted by world @-@ renowned sculptor Harry Weber .

 Robertson is the son of <unk> and Bailey Robertson . He has two brothers , Bailey Jr. and Henry . He remembers a tough childhood , plagued by poverty and racism . When a biography was going to be written about him in the 1990s , Robertson joked that his life had been " dull " , and that he had been " married to the same woman for a long time " . In 1997 , Robertson donated one of his kidneys to his daughter Tia , who suffered lupus @-@ related kidney failure . He has been an honorary spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation ever since . In 2003 , he published his own autobiography , The Big O : My Life , My Times , My Game . Robertson also owns the chemical company <unk> , based in Cincinnati , Ohio . 
 Regarding basketball , Robertson has stated that legendary Harlem Globetrotters players Marques Haynes and " clown prince " Goose Tatum were his idols . Now in his seventies , he refrains from playing basketball , although he still follows it on TV and attends most home games for the University of Cincinnati , his alma mater . He now lists woodworking as his prime hobby . Robertson adds that he still could average a triple @-@ double season in today 's basketball , and that he is highly skeptical that anyone else could do it . On June 9 , 2007 , Oscar received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Cincinnati for both his philanthropic and entrepreneurial efforts .

 The stadium is part of a 75 @-@ acre ( 30 ha ) expansion of the Twin Cities campus , the largest since the West Bank was built in the 1960s . Current plans for the area call for the construction of as many as ten new academic buildings by 2015 . The METRO Green Line light rail runs near the stadium , with a station in Stadium Village serving the facility . Construction of the Green Line began in 2010 and opened June 14 , 2014 . The two other major Twin Cities stadiums are located along this line , within a short distance and travel time on the Light rail line . 
 An environmental impact assessment of the stadium site was conducted by the university between December 2004 and March 2006 at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 5 million . The results were approved by the Board of Regents on March 27 , 2006 .

 The stadium is a horseshoe @-@ style stadium which organizers said would have a " traditional collegiate look and feel " . On December 7 , 2006 , the university announced that the stadium 's field would be laid out in an unorthodox east @-@ west configuration , with the open west end of the stadium facing campus . This layout , similar to that of Memorial Stadium , provides a view of downtown Minneapolis . 
 On September 17 , 2009 , the University of Minnesota announced that the stadium was awarded LEED Silver Certification , the first college or professional football stadium to achieve LEED certification .

 The centerpiece of the stadium is the massive scoreboard , designed and built by Daktronics at a cost of $ 9 million . At 48 by 108 feet ( 14 @.@ 6 m × 32 @.@ 9 m ) , the HD @-@ X light @-@ emitting diode ( LED ) video scoreboard is currently the ninth largest ( by area ) in college football @-@ only stadiums , and was the third largest at the time of construction . 
 The playing surface is FieldTurf , an infilled artificial turf , and the brick wall surrounding the playing field was made possible by an alumni donation of $ 500 @,@ 000 . 
 Located on the stadium ground level is the Murray <unk> Locker Room , named in honor of the Gophers ' national championship winning coach from 1954 to 1971 . It is the largest home locker room in college or professional football , and features a block “ M ” lighting fixture and 120 custom @-@ built cherry @-@ wood lockers . Adjacent to the Murray <unk> Locker Room are other team areas including a fully equipped training room , therapy room , medical exam rooms , an equipment room , custom coaches ’ offices and locker rooms , a home media room , private recruiting room , and a training table for dining and nutrition . After a tour of the complex , Pro Bowl wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald remarked that , " This has got to be the best locker room in the Big Ten . "

 To recognize that the venue is a statewide facility and to pay tribute to the support of all Minnesota citizens , the names of the state 's 87 counties are cast in stone around the perimeter of the first level . Each is engraved in a piece of cast stone that is 16 by 5 @.@ 3 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m × 1 @.@ 6 m ) and weighs 6 @,@ 500 pounds ( 2 @,@ 900 kg ) . These panels are contained within the reminiscent Memorial Wall , which forms the external surface of the stadium building . This brick façade perimeter wall with arched portals reflects the heritage of Memorial Stadium 's exterior , and a 360 ° colonnade provides a year @-@ round walkway around the stadium . Displayed on the façade of the stadium 's upper deck are panels commemorating the 7 national championships and 18 Big Ten Conference championships won by Minnesota in football , as well as ones distinguishing the five players whose numbers have been retired by the program . 
 The Minnesota Tribal Nations Plaza encompasses the main western entrance to the stadium and is named in honor of the 11 Native American nations in Minnesota , featuring eleven 18 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) -tall sky markers : one for each nation . The stadium also incorporates the Veterans Tribute , a memorial dedicated to Minnesota veterans , located in the open end of the horseshoe near the main plaza . 
 = = = Seating and amenities = = = 
 The first phase of the construction includes approximately 50 @,@ 805 seats , with the design able to support future expansion of up to 80 @,@ 000 seats . The 10 @,@ 000 @-@ seat student section is located in the eastern end of the stadium , and the area reserved for the U of M marching band is partitioned from it , situated directly behind the eastern end zone and framed by a backdrop labeled Pride of Minnesota . There are approximately 20 @,@ 000 seats with permanent <unk> in the stadium , located between the goal lines in both the upper and lower decks , but all remaining locations have aluminum bench seating with no backs . The stadium also features 1 @,@ 000 handicap accessible and companion seats , and accessible seating is located throughout the stadium , including in the first row of the first level , the last row of the first level , and the last row of the second level . Premium seating includes 37 private suites , 250 indoor club seats , 1 @,@ 250 outdoor club seats , and 50 loge boxes , along with access to the exclusive 20 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 900 m2 ) climate @-@ controlled DQ Club Room , which offers luxurious amenities to premium @-@ seat ticket holders . 
 The main concourse is on the second level and wraps around the entire stadium , open to the field of play . Concessions and many of the venue 's 113 restrooms are located here . 
 Located in the southwest corner of the stadium is Goldy 's Locker Room , the team store , which spans two floors . The T. Denny Sanford Athletics Hall of Fame was opened in fall of 2010 , positioned in the southwest end of the stadium next to Goldy 's Locker Room . The more than 5 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 460 m2 ) Hall of Fame is not football specific , rather encompassing all 25 of the University of Minnesota 's athletic programs through dramatic imagery , artifacts , and interactive kiosks . Visitors to the Hall of Fame hear a soundscape with some of the great radio calls from Minnesota 's play @-@ by @-@ play voices . The space also honors the members of the ' M ' Club Hall of Fame with a wall complete with plaques for each inductee . The Hall of Fame housed the Floyd of Rosedale trophy after a win over Iowa in 2010 . 
 The media area is a three @-@ tiered press box with 10 network TV camera positions and seating for 160 members of the media .

 The stadium was designed to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80 @,@ 000 . The 30 @,@ 000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium from the end of the press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue , wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe . The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck . The University of Minnesota could add all 30 @,@ 000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10 @,@ 000 seats , meeting demand as it is needed ( although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely ) . If expansion is ever undertaken , it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season .

 For the 2014 and 2015 seasons , the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League ( NFL ) used TCF Bank Stadium as their home venue while their new venue , U.S. Bank Stadium , is under construction at the site of the Metrodome . To help accommodate the Vikings , TCF Bank Stadium underwent several changes , including a new playing surface with heating coils , increased storage space throughout the stadium , and concession upgrades . In addition , temporary seats have been installed that have increased the stadium 's capacity to 52 @,@ 525 . These accommodations were expected to cost about $ 7 million - an amount attributed to the overall construction cost of the new stadium

 The push for a new on @-@ campus stadium for Golden Gopher football began in the fall of 2000 . The university cited poor revenue and lack of a college football atmosphere at the off @-@ campus Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome as their main reasons for wanting to move back on campus . A plan for a joint Minnesota Vikings / University of Minnesota football stadium was proposed in 2002 , but differences over how the stadium would be designed and managed , as well as state budget constraints , led to the plan 's failure . In September 2003 a highly publicized attempt was made by T. Denny Sanford to be the lead donor for the project , but in early 2004 the plan fell through when the two parties were unable to come to an agreement on the financial terms . The university unveiled preliminary stadium drawings and a general plan to seek state money and donations in December 2003 . On March 24 , 2005 , the university and TCF Bank announced a deal that would have the bank contribute $ 35 million towards the project which would give them naming rights . The deal was given an expiration date of December 31 , 2005 ; time enough for the Minnesota Legislature to provide the bulk of funding needed to make the project a reality . 
 During the remainder of 2005 the university concentrated on drafting a stadium proposal that would draw the support of state politicians . The final plan proposed that the state of Minnesota would contribute 40 % of the stadium cost while the university would raise the remaining 60 % on its own . Portions of that 60 % were to be funded by the TCF naming rights , while the remainder would come from a $ 50 per semester student fee , private donations , the sale of 2 @,@ 840 acres ( 11 @.@ 5 km ² ) of university land in rural Dakota County back to the state , and game day parking revenue . Even though the university proposal drew widespread legislative support , the stadium effort suffered a setback when the 2005 legislative session ended before the stadium bill could be heard . Late in 2005 when it became evident that this would happen , the university and TCF Bank announced that it had extended the naming rights deal to June 30 , 2006 . 
 Despite the 2005 session having ended with the bill not coming to a vote , the stadium effort did not lose momentum in the legislature and was introduced quickly in the 2006 session . On April 6 , 2006 , the Minnesota House of Representatives passed the stadium bill on a 103 – 30 vote . The house bill was nearly identical to what the university was proposing and had full university support . However , on May 9 , 2006 , the Minnesota Senate passed a radically different version of the bill on a 34 – 32 vote . The Senate version would have removed the TCF naming rights deal , the student fees , and the purchase of the university owned land . The proposed funding that was removed was to be replaced with a statewide tax on sports memorabilia . It also would have required the stadium to be named Veterans Memorial Stadium ( similar to the previous on @-@ campus football stadium Memorial Stadium , which was last used in 1981 and demolished in 1992 ) . Governor Tim Pawlenty stated he supported the House version . He signed the bill in May 2006 at the University of Minnesota McNamara Alumni Center . 
 = = Legislative approval 2006 = = 
 Even though the differences between the House and Senate bills were major , the details were ironed out and approved on May 19 , in a House – Senate conference committee . The naming rights and land sale remained in the bill , as did a scaled down $ 25 per year student fee . The tax on sports memorabilia as well as the Veterans Memorial Stadium name were voted out . The committee also voted to increase the state contribution to the project to compensate for the smaller student fees . The compromise bill was then approved by both the full house and senate on May 20 , and was signed by Governor Tim Pawlenty on May 24 . 
 = = Funding = = 
 The stadium 's cost totals $ 288 @.@ 5 million , of which the university will pay 52 % and the state of Minnesota the remaining 48 % . Including interest the state 's cost is about $ 10 million per year or about $ 1 @.@ 7 million per game for 25 years . About $ 50 million of the state 's portion goes to the purchase of 2 @,@ 840 acres ( 11 @.@ 5 km ² ) of undeveloped university land , part of the Rosemount Research Center in Dakota County , over 25 years by the state of Minnesota who will assume responsibility for risks if the site requires environmental cleanup . The university retains its right to use the land for its " research , education and engagement mission " in perpetuity . 
 The university 's share is $ 111 million or 52 % . TCF Financial Corporation of Wayzata , Minnesota is contributing $ 35 million over 25 years in exchange for the TCF Bank naming rights and other agreements . The university projected earnings of $ 2 @.@ 5 million per year or $ 96 million over the life of agreements with TCF that will include marketing debit cards to alumni and ticketholders . If unable to fulfill its contractual obligations , TCF Financial Corporation must propose an alternate name subject to the approval of the university . Other corporate donations have been pledged as well , including Best Buy ( $ 3 million ) , Dairy Queen ( $ 2 @.@ 5 million ) , Target Corporation ( $ 2 million ) , Federated Insurance , General Mills , and Norwest Equity Partners . 
 The university is also accepting donations from individuals . Initially donations were only being sought from " high @-@ end " donors ( those contributing $ 100 @,@ 000 or more ) , but in June 2008 the university expanded the fundraising effort to gather smaller donations as well . On May 21 , 2009 , the University announced they had received a $ 6 million donation from T. Denny Sanford , meaning the university had achieved its goal of $ 86 million in private fund raising . The remainder of the university 's portion will come from a $ 12 @.@ 50 per semester student fee ( $ 25 per year ) and game day parking revenue . 
 Even though the cost of building TCF Bank Stadium originated at $ 248 @.@ 7 million , changes in the construction planning raised the cost to $ 288 @.@ 5 million . The university has vowed that even if the stadium cost rises again , it will not seek more money from the state nor increase the student fees any further . 
 The University has been charging all U of M students a mandatory stadium fee of $ 12 @.@ 50 every semester since planning for the project began , and is continuing this fee despite the stadium being finished . The cost of the stadium was $ 288 @.@ 5 million of which the university had to pay 52 % , and with an average of more than 50 @,@ 000 students in a given year , in one semester the university makes more than $ 625 @,@ 000 from the stadium fee , meaning they receive more than $ 12 @.@ 5 million every 10 years from students .

The hospitality plaza on the stadium 's west side and the scholarship were named to honor the community , and the plaza designed to " ... celebrate the history , presence , and cultural contributions of all eleven Native American tribes in Minnesota " . The University received an additional $ 2 million from the SMSC for construction of the plaza in 2009 .

 On June 8 , 2006 , the university announced that it had selected Populous to design the stadium . Populous ( then HOK Sport ) was one of the three finalists , along with HNTB Architects and Crawford Architects , that made presentations to the university on May 24 , 2006 . The local firm that worked on the project was Minneapolis @-@ based Architectural Alliance , and M.A. Mortenson Company was the general contractor . Schematic designs of the stadium were presented to the public on January 3 , 2007 . 
 Infrastructure work at the stadium site began in late June 2006 , and a ceremonial groundbreaking took place at the stadium site on September 30 , 2006 . The beginning of construction on the stadium itself along with the unveiling of the stadium 's logo took place on July 11 , 2007 . Site preparation and foundation work continued through the summer and fall of 2007 . More than 8 @,@ 800 tons of steel that make up the stadium 's skeleton was put in place between January 28 , 2007 – June 28 , 2008 . 
 = = Alcohol controversy = = 
 University president Robert Bruininks originally planned to have the school apply for a state liquor license in order to serve beer and wine in limited areas of the stadium . Under his proposal , alcohol would have been available only to occupants of premium season ticket seats ranging in price from $ 1 @,@ 800 to $ 45 @,@ 000 a year . This is / was consistent with the University 's long @-@ held alcohol policy at other on @-@ campus athletic venues , such as Williams Arena and Mariucci Arena . This is also consistent with other NCAA institutions ( including all other Big Ten Conference teams except for the University of Michigan ) with on campus stadiums . No Big Ten stadiums serve alcohol in their general seating . 
 In May 2009 , the state legislature passed a law that states that no alcohol may be served or sold anywhere in the stadium , including in suites and premium boxes , unless all ticketholders 21 or older in the stadium can buy alcohol at a game . The University of Minnesota regents voted on June 24 , 2009 , on Bruininks ' subsequent proposal to ban alcohol entirely at campus athletic events ( and also ban it in Mariucci and Williams arenas ) , which passed 10 – 2 . 
 In May 2010 , the legislature passed a law saying that alcohol could be served in premium seating if it was also available in one @-@ third of the general seats . Bruininks declined to ask the board of regents to make this compromise . Dan Wolter , a spokesman for the university , said , " We recognize and understand that underage drinking is a big problem in our society as a whole so that is a stand that the University wanted to take . " 
 On July 11 , 2012 , the university regents voted to allow beer sales at the stadium starting in the fall of 2012 .

 The Canoe River train crash occurred on November 21 , 1950 , near Valemount in eastern British Columbia , Canada , when a westbound troop train and the eastbound Canadian National Railway ( CNR ) Continental Limited collided head @-@ on . The collision killed 21 people : 17 Canadian soldiers en route to the Korean War and the two @-@ man locomotive crew of each train . 
 The post @-@ crash investigation found that the order given to the troop train differed from the intended message . Crucial words were missing , causing the troop train to proceed on its way rather than halt on a siding , resulting in the collision . A telegraph operator , Alfred John " Jack " Atherton , was charged with manslaughter ; the Crown alleged that he was negligent in passing an incomplete message . His family hired his Member of Parliament , John Diefenbaker , as defence counsel . Diefenbaker joined the British Columbia bar to take the case , and obtained Atherton 's acquittal . 
 After the accident , the CNR installed block signals on the stretch of track on which the crash occurred . The railway later realigned the main line in that area , eliminating a sharp curve that prevented crews from seeing oncoming trains . Diefenbaker 's successful defence of Atherton became an asset in his political rise . A number of monuments honour the dead . 
 = = Crash = = 
 On November 21 , 1950 , a westbound troop train , Passenger Extra 3538 West — consisting of the S @-@ 2 @-@ a class 2 @-@ 8 @-@ 2 steam locomotive 3538 and 17 cars , about half of which had wood bodies with steel underframe — was travelling from Camp Shilo , Manitoba to Fort Lewis , Washington . It was carrying 23 officers and 315 men of 2nd Regiment , Royal Canadian Horse Artillery ( <unk> ) for deployment to the Korean War , a movement dubbed Operation <unk> . The train was moving through the Rocky Mountains on the CNR transcontinental mainline . CNR Train No. 2 , the eastbound Continental Limited , consisted of the U @-@ 1 @-@ a class 4 @-@ 8 @-@ 2 steam locomotive <unk> and eleven all @-@ steel cars and was en route from Vancouver to Montreal . 
 By 1950 , the CNR used the part @-@ wooden cars only for the transportation of soldiers ; other passengers were no longer carried in them . After the 1947 Dugald rail accident , the Board of Transport Commissioners had ordered that wooden passenger coaches not be placed between all @-@ steel cars . However , under the terms of that decision , General Order Number 707 , the wooden cars with steel underframes did not count as " wooden cars " . 
 CNR dispatcher A. E. Tisdale meant to send both trains identical orders to " meet " ( get past each other ) on a mostly single @-@ track section . His intended order read " <unk> Extra 3538 West meet No. 2 Eng <unk> at Cedarside and No. 4 Eng <unk> Gosnell . " ( Cedarside and Gosnell were sidings where trains could wait to allow opposing traffic to clear . ) Tisdale dictated the order from his office in Kamloops , British Columbia , to Alfred John " Jack " Atherton , the operator at Red Pass Junction , for delivery to Passenger Extra 3538 West , the troop train , and to F.E. Parsons , the operator at Blue River , 89 miles ( 143 km ) westbound from Red Pass Junction , for delivery to No. 2 , the Continental . The words " at Cedarside " did not appear in the order as copied down by Atherton to be handed to the troop train crew . Parsons 's version of the order accorded with Tisdale 's , and was passed to the Continental and to Train No. 4 . According to Hugh A. Halliday in his history of Canadian railroad wrecks , " it would have been one man 's word against the other , but the Blue River operator had been on the line at the same time . Parsons backed up Tisdale 's version of events ; Atherton would be cast firmly as the culprit in this affair . " 
 When the westbound troop train stopped at Red Pass Junction , Atherton gave the incorrect written order to train conductor John A. <unk> . As the full order had been passed to the eastbound Continental , its crew expected to meet the troop train at Cedarside , 43 miles ( 69 km ) eastbound from Blue River ; the crew aboard the troop train expected to meet the Continental and another train at Gosnell 25 miles ( 40 km ) westbound from Cedarside . With neither train crew aware of anything wrong , the troop train passed Cedarside and the Continental passed Gosnell . Both trains were travelling at moderate speeds , and attempted to negotiate a sharp curve from opposite ends . Thomas W. Tindall , a forestry employee , saw the two trains approaching each other from an embankment ; he tried to signal the Continental crew , who responded to his frantic signals with a friendly wave . The two crews did not realise that a collision was imminent until the last moment , and the trains struck head @-@ on at 10 : 35 a.m. 
 The accident occurred south of Valemount , 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 0 @.@ 97 km ) east of a small station named Canoe River , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) westbound from Cedarside . The crash took place on the only stretch ( 18 @-@ mile ( 29 km ) long ) of CNR mainline in the mountains not protected by automatic block signals . The leading cars of each train were derailed , while those which had been part of the troop train were demolished by the crash . According to testimony at the inquiry , most of the deaths were caused by steam from the troop train 's ruptured boilers penetrating the damaged cars . At the moment of the crash , two soldiers , Gunners William Barton and Roger Bowe , both of Newfoundland , were buying cigarettes at the newsstand aboard the train . The structure of the newsstand shielded them in the crash , and they survived . Their fellow Newfoundlanders , Gunners Joseph Thistle and James A. White , standing just a few feet away , were not shielded by the newsstand and perished in the crash . 
 = = Rescue = = 
 People from the nearby settlement of Valemount hurried to the scene and found the troop cars damaged beyond recognition . Some had collapsed in the disaster ; rescuers used axes and hammers to break into them . There were no medical supplies aboard the troop train , and the only medical officer on board had disembarked in Edmonton . First @-@ aid kits on that train proved empty ; a box labelled " Medical Stores " was found to contain only contraceptives . 
 Dr. P. S. Kimmett of Edson , Alberta , a passenger on the Continental , took charge of efforts to aid the injured with his wife , a nurse . Kimmett supervised efforts to aid 50 people despite having almost no supplies or trained personnel . One soldier , still alive , appeared to have not an inch of skin on his body <unk> ; another had a chunk of glass piercing his chest from front to back . With the exception of the engine and tender of the Continental , which were demolished , there was little damage to the eastbound train . Several of the passengers on the Continental suffered minor injuries . One dining car on the troop train was used as a hospital , another as a morgue . James Henderson , a young officer on the troop train , recalled : 
 I talked with one soldier who lay shivering in a bunk in the hospital coach . He had no visible sign of injury but his face was a ghastly green shade . He wanted more blankets and a cigarette , and I gave him both . An hour later , I helped move his body to the other coach . 
 At the time of the crash , the temperature was about 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) , and there were about 6 inches ( 15 cm ) of snow on the ground . The telephone lines next to the track were cut by the accident , but a crewman managed to make an emergency call to Jasper in Alberta . Because the crash site was 83 miles ( 134 km ) away , medical relief took three hours to arrive . A work engine , in the interim , took the movable coaches of the troop train back along the track as far as Cedarside . The hospital train brought eight nurses and two doctors from Jasper , who spent the trip making what preparations they could . On arrival , they found patients with severe injuries . " There was hardly a case with only one type of trauma . " That rescue train transported the injured to Edmonton from the crash scene . The Jasper doctors left the train when the rescue train reached there , again placing Dr. Kimmett in charge . He remained so until the civilians were relieved by Army personnel from Edmonton , who joined the train in Edson . Major Francis P. Leask , commanding the soldiers , praised Dr. Kimmett 's work , " We couldn 't have gotten along without him " and also praised his men , both veterans and recruits , for their calm , efficient work in the disaster . 
 <unk> weather made subsequent attempts to recover the dead difficult ; four bodies were never found . Transcontinental traffic was rerouted temporarily onto Canadian Pacific tracks through Calgary as the CNR attempted to clear the tracks . The work was hampered by an explosion and fire that broke out on the morning of November 22 , consuming many of the wrecked cars and likely the missing bodies , and the wreckage was cleared by that evening , allowing traffic to resume the following day . 
 On November 29 , 1950 , the remaining soldiers left Camp Wainwright , Alberta , where they had been taken after being evacuated to Edmonton , resuming their journey to Korea . The death toll had been 20 , including 16 soldiers . Twelve soldiers and the two two @-@ man locomotive crews died in or shortly after the crash ; four soldiers died on the rescue train en route to hospital in Edmonton . A 17th soldier , Gunner David Owens , died in an Edmonton hospital on December 9 , bringing the death toll to 21 . Owens had suffered severe burns , and was believed on the way to recovery when he suffered a relapse . Gunner Art <unk> , a survivor of the crash , recalled the eeriness of the first roll call at Wainwright , " It was a very small group that answered the roll call that day . "

 Within days of the crash , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) , as the provincial police for British Columbia , began an investigation . The site of the crash was under the jurisdiction of the RCMP detachment in Prince George , British Columbia , and any charges would be laid there . The CNR suspended all <unk> involved in passing the order to the troop train and held an internal inquiry at Kamloops . The Board of Transport Commissioners announced that a public inquiry would be held at Edmonton in December 1950 . 
 Atherton , aged 22 , was dismissed by the CNR before the Edmonton hearings . He testified that there was a lengthy gap in transmission , and that he did not hear the words " at Cedarside " . Although railway regulations called for him to listen to a repeat of the order by the telegrapher at Blue River , he did not do so and instead continued with his other duties , passing the message to the troop train without the vital two words . He denied repeating back the order to dispatcher Tisdale with the two words included . 
 Tisdale testified to passing the order by telephone to Blue River and to Red Pass Junction , and that it was correctly read back to him by both operators . He also testified to a brief gap in communications several days before the crash , saying that in the rough country through which the railway line passed it was not uncommon for objects falling against the communication line to cause brief outages . Parsons also testified that Atherton had correctly repeated back the order . 
 Testimony to the inquiry established the damage to the troop train and those on it . The wooden cars with steel underframes gave little resistance to the impact , unlike the Continental 's steel cars . A CNR official testified that it would cost $ 127 million to replace all such cars with modern steel ones . Dr. Kimmett testified , stating that though he had six bottles of penicillin when he began his work , no syringe could be found to administer it . When a syringe was later found , five of the bottles could no longer be found . No heating was available on the troop train until the arrival of the emergency locomotive from Red Pass Junction , and no blood plasma had been brought on the hospital train — none was available until the injured reached Jasper . Dr. Kimmett testified that it was " very difficult " to administer plasma on the train , and that two men died between Jasper and Edson . 
 The Board of Transport Commissioners issued its report on January 18 , 1951 . It avoided assigning individual responsibility for the deaths and urged the CNR to install block signals on the section of line where the accident took place . The Board noted that the CNR already had a policy of installing such signals , though they were expensive and difficult to obtain from the United States , and that the CNR had deemed other sections of the line more dangerous . It also urged additional training , to ensure that messages were transmitted accurately , and safety checks to catch instances where messages were transmitted incorrectly .

 In anticipation of charges being laid against his son , Atherton 's father approached Member of Parliament and King 's Counsel John Diefenbaker in December 1950 and sought to retain him as defence counsel . The Athertons were Diefenbaker 's constituents ; their hometown , Zealandia , Saskatchewan , was in his riding , Lake Centre . Diefenbaker declined the case , stating that Parliament had first call on his time , that his wife Edna was seriously ill with leukemia , and that he was not admitted as a lawyer in British Columbia . As Edna Diefenbaker was well known as an influence over her husband , in desperation Alfred Atherton Sr. talked his way into her Saskatoon hospital room . 
 In his memoirs , Diefenbaker did not mention the elder Atherton 's initial approach but wrote that he was in Australia at a parliamentary conference at the time of the Canoe River crash . An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker ; he thought it interesting but noted that he was not a member of the Law Society of British Columbia . Diefenbaker wrote that he planned to meet Edna in Hawaii on his way back from Australia . Instead she wired him , requesting that he meet her in Vancouver . 
 Diefenbaker related that he found his wife in a Saskatoon hospital , in the final stages of the illness that would kill her ( she died on February 7 , 1951 ) . She told him that Jack Atherton had been to see her and that the soldiers ' deaths were from being transported in wooden train cars . " Everyone in the CNR is running away from responsibility for what appears to have been a grievous disregard for human lives . " John Diefenbaker objected that the bar examination in British Columbia was notoriously difficult and that the application fee was $ 1 @,@ 500 . Edna Diefenbaker informed her husband , " I told him you 'd take it " , and eventually her husband gave in . 
 Atherton was arrested for manslaughter on January 9 , 1951 , in Saskatoon and was taken to Prince George by the RCMP . After his dismissal by the CNR , Atherton was staying with his parents at Zealandia , where his father was CNR station agent . The manslaughter charge concerned the death of Henry <unk> , fireman aboard the troop train . Bail was set at $ 5 @,@ 000 , and Magistrate P.J. Moran required any sureties to appear before him , making it difficult for Atherton 's connections in Saskatchewan to obtain his release . Atherton was released from custody on January 24 , as Prince George furniture store owner Alex Moffat and local CNR employee William Reynolds each posted sureties valued at $ 2 @,@ 500 . 
 After his wife 's death in February 1951 , Diefenbaker travelled to Vancouver in early March to take the British Columbia bar examination , which the Prince George Citizen called " a formality which will cost him $ 1500 " . ( Failure to pass the bar would effectively disqualify Diefenbaker from the Atherton case because he would have to wait for reexamination , and the preliminary hearing was set for mid @-@ March . ) He paid his fee and was then given an oral examination by the bar secretary , which in full was : " Are there contracts required by statute to be in writing ? " " Yes . " " Name one of them . " " A land contract . " Diefenbaker was then congratulated for being the first applicant to pass the British Columbia bar exam with a perfect score . 
 = = = Hearings and trial = = = 
 The preliminary hearing began on March 13 , 1951 , and lasted three days , during which the Crown called 20 witnesses . Diefenbaker alleged that the rules of the CNR did not require that the telegraph operator listen to the repeat of his message , but merely recommended that he should . Nevertheless , Diefenbaker 's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia ( a trial @-@ level court ) . Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge , and Atherton 's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George . 
 The trial began on May 9 , 1951 . Colonel Eric Pepler , a World War I veteran and British Columbia 's deputy attorney general , led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence . To a CNR official on the stand , Diefenbaker said , " I suppose the reason you put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so that no matter what they might subsequently find in Korea , they 'd always be able to say , ' Well we had worse than that in Canada ' . " Colonel Pepler objected , stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question . Diefenbaker responded , " My Lord , it was made clear by the elevation of my voice at the end of the sentence that there was a great big question mark on it . " The judge , Justice A.D. McFarlane , began to rule , but Pepler interjected , " I want to make it clear that in this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea . " Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman , but Diefenbaker pounced : " Oh , you 're not concerned about the killing of a few privates ? Oh , Colonel ! " Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran , sitting on the jury , expressed shock at Pepler 's comment , and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as " Colonel " . 
 The two lead counsel clashed again during their final addresses to the jury , with Pepler objecting to Diefenbaker 's use of testimony from the preliminary hearing . Justice McFarlane stated to Pepler , " I do not think you should object like this " , and when Pepler persisted , the judge " roared " at him , " Please , just stop this . " Diefenbaker stated , " I sat and suffered while my learned friend misconstrued the evidence " and when he noticed Pepler muttering under his breath , said to him , " You are growling " , to which Pepler replied , " Yes I am growling . I am objecting too . " 
 Diefenbaker suggested to the jury that the silence on the line which had , he contended , swallowed the words " at Cedarside " might have been caused by a fish dropped on a snow @-@ covered line by a bird and claimed to have evidence of a previous occurrence . He noted in his memoirs that the incident " was not well documented , but it was all we had " . He blamed the disaster on Tisdale , stating that lack of the word " at " before " Gosnell " in the order indicated that the Kamloops dispatcher had not been paying attention , and that he should have noticed that , according to Diefenbaker , the words " at Cedarside " were missing from Atherton 's repeat of the order . The trial had taken four days ; the lawyers argued for five hours ; Diefenbaker 's summation took three of them . Justice McFarlane took an hour to charge the jury . McFarlane told the jurors that if they believed that Atherton had passed the order to conductor <unk> in the same form he had received it , they would be justified in acquitting him . The jury returned after 40 minutes of deliberations . Jury foreman Fred <unk> announced the acquittal of Atherton , as Atherton 's mother wept . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The CNR adopted the inquiry recommendations , installing block signalling in the area of the accident . In 1953 , it modernised its passenger fleet , ordering 302 new cars . In later years , the line was rerouted to eliminate the sharp curve on which the disaster took place . 
 Atherton went to work for the Saskatchewan Transportation Company and settled in Saskatoon . Pepler retired in 1954 , having served 20 years as British Columbia 's deputy attorney general . He subsequently served as one of British Columbia 's commissioners on uniform provincial laws and embarked on a revision of the rules of the British Columbia Supreme Court before dying on November 16 , 1957 , at age 66 in a suburban Vancouver hospital . 
 Diefenbaker had represented Atherton at his own expense , though donations from railroad employees reimbursed him for about half his costs . The case had been followed throughout Canada 's railway community , and on his return to Ottawa , Diefenbaker was widely congratulated for his victory . By 1957 , he had become Leader of the Opposition and Progressive Conservative Party leader , and when he campaigned in Saskatchewan during that year 's election , Atherton travelled to Regina to greet him , skipping his own wedding rehearsal . As Diefenbaker campaigned in British Columbia , the Vancouver Sun reported on the large , enthusiastic crowds he gathered , and noted that he remained well remembered in Prince George for his defence of Atherton . Diefenbaker 's biographer , Denis Smith , wrote of the Atherton case : 
 Diefenbaker had won a popular victory , redeemed his promise to Edna , and endeared himself for life to Jack Atherton and his fellow railway workers . The case was celebrated in the press and became one of his major political assets . 
 Diefenbaker won the election and , on June 21 , 1957 , became Prime Minister of Canada . 
 = = Memorials and tributes = = 
 The <unk> suffered more casualties in the crash than it did in its first year of fighting in Korea . A monument to the soldiers who died stands at CFB Shilo ( as Camp Shilo has been redesignated ) , where a memorial parade is conducted each year on the anniversary of the crash . It was dedicated on November 21 , 1952 . 
 A memorial cairn was erected near the crash site by the regiment in 1987 . A special remembrance was held in Valemount for the 60th anniversary of the disaster in 2010 . The CNR has also raised a monument near the site of the disaster . The names of the military dead are inscribed in the Korea Book of Remembrance and are also on the Wall of Remembrance in Brampton , Ontario ; they may also be found on the Korea Cairn at Winnipeg Brookside Cemetery . Manitoba has named a lake for Gunner William D. Wright , who died in the crash . 
 In 2003 , as part of Remembrance Week observances for the Canadian Senate , five family members of the soldiers who died in the crash were presented with Memorial Crosses . Other family members were due to receive them at a later date . The dead were not given posthumous Canadian Volunteer Service Medals as they never reached the Korean theatre ; Tom <unk> , a survivor of the crash , considers that an injustice and has campaigned for medals to be awarded . 
 = 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak = 
 The 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak was a deadly tornado outbreak which affected the Southern United States and the lower Ohio Valley on February 5 and 6 , 2008 . The event began on Super Tuesday , while 24 U.S. states were holding primary elections and caucuses to select the presidential candidates for the upcoming presidential election . Missouri , Illinois , Arkansas , Alabama , and Tennessee were among the affected regions in which primaries were being held . Some voting locations were forced to close early due to the approaching severe weather . 
 Eighty @-@ seven tornadoes occurred over the course of the outbreak , which lasted over 15 hours from the afternoon of February 5 until the early morning of February 6 . The storm system produced several destructive tornadoes in heavily populated areas , most notably in the Memphis metropolitan area , in Jackson , Tennessee , and the northeastern end of the Nashville metropolitan area . 
 A total of 57 people were killed across four states and 18 counties , with hundreds of others injured . The outbreak , at the time , was the deadliest in the era of modern NEXRAD doppler radar , which was fully implemented in 1997 . The event was the second deadliest in February since 1950 behind the February 1971 Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak , which killed 123 , the deadliest outbreak in both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super Outbreak , and was at the time the deadliest tornado outbreak in the US overall since the 1985 United States – Canada tornado outbreak which killed 90 people . This record would not be surpassed until the 2011 Super Outbreak which killed 324 people . Damage from tornadoes was estimated at over $ 500 million ( 2008 USD ) . 
 The weather system which produced the tornadoes caused significant straight @-@ line wind damage , hail as large as softballs – 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter – major flooding , significant freezing rain , and heavy snow across many areas of eastern North America . The total damage from the entire weather system exceeded $ 1 billion . 
 = = Meteorological synopsis = = 
 A series of strong low pressure systems formed across the southern Great Plains on February 4 , contributing to record warmth on February 4 and 5 in the southern Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley . High temperatures across many areas reached the 70s ° F ( 21 – 26 ° C ) , and in Alabama temperatures reached the low 80s ° F ( 27 ° C ) with dew points in the middle 60s ° ( 17 – 20 ° C ) . Dewpoints in the mid 60s ° F were recorded as far north as Memphis . A strong cold front trailing the low pressure area approached the region from the west . 
 The high temperatures and dew points created moderate instability across the outbreak area . CAPE values , a measurement of the level of tropospheric instability , were over 1000 J / kg , and helicity levels , a measurement of the potential for rotating winds , reached over 200 m ² / s ² . The upper level jet stream also contributed a large amount of wind shear . These factors were all indicative of a high potential for severe weather . 
 On February 5 at 6 : 39 am CST ( 1239 UTC ) , the Storm Prediction Center ( SPC ) issued a high risk of severe storms for most of Arkansas , the first in February since 1998 . At 10 : 16 am CST ( 1616 UTC ) , the high risk area was extended farther northeast to include western Kentucky , northwestern Mississippi , the Missouri Bootheel , West Tennessee , and Southern Illinois . A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for northwestern Alabama , the rest of Arkansas , the rest of southern Illinois , southern Indiana , most of the rest of Kentucky , northern Louisiana , central Mississippi , parts of southeastern Missouri , southwestern Ohio , eastern Oklahoma , middle Tennessee and northeastern Texas . A total of fifteen watches were issued by the SPC during the outbreak , including thirteen tornado watches ( two of which were PDS watches ) and two severe thunderstorm watches . 
 Early on the morning of February 5 , a squall line developed across eastern Texas northward into Missouri and moved east towards the high risk area . Ahead of the squall line , the cap took longer than expected to break , but when it finally did in the late afternoon hours , numerous supercell thunderstorms quickly formed across Arkansas and southern Missouri . The first tornadoes touched down around 3 : 30 pm CST ( 2130 UTC ) . A cap is a layer of relatively warm air aloft ( usually several thousand feet above the ground ) which suppresses or delays the development of thunderstorms ; the cap often prevents or delays thunderstorm development even in the presence of extreme instability . However , if the cap is removed or weakened , then explosive thunderstorm development can occur . Some of the most powerful tornado @-@ producing supercells were situated across the Memphis and Jackson areas , as well as central Arkansas ( one producing a tornado that tracked 122 miles ( 196 km ) and lasted about two hours ) between 5 : 00 and 7 : 30 pm CST ( 2300 to 0130 UTC ) while numerous other tornadoes were reported across northern Mississippi northwest of Tupelo , Mississippi , early in the evening . As the evening progressed , one of these supercells traveled across Middle Tennessee including the Nashville metropolitan area and south @-@ central Kentucky , where several deadly tornadoes were reported during the evening hours between 7 : 30 pm and 11 : 00 pm CST ( 0130 to 0500 UTC ) . 
 Meanwhile , the squall line that developed from near Dallas to Kansas City moved eastward throughout the late evening and overnight hours causing numerous reports of damaging wind along with many spin @-@ up tornadoes from Louisiana to Ohio and Indiana . It then moved through the southeast U.S. during the early morning hours . Additional strong thunderstorms developed ahead of the front across the southeast during the overnight and early morning hours . A record ( at the time ) of five tornado emergency declarations were issued on February 5 ; four for Tennessee , and one in Alabama . 
 On February 6 , a slight risk of severe weather was issued for much of the eastern United States from Pennsylvania to the Florida Panhandle as the squall line raced eastward ahead of the cold front . After several additional tornadoes touched down in Alabama during the early morning hours just before dawn , the primary severe weather threat became damaging wind across the Mid @-@ Atlantic States . No additional tornadoes were reported during the late morning and afternoon as the cold front exited into the Atlantic Ocean , although wind damage was reported across eastern Kentucky , eastern Pennsylvania and most of Georgia . Farther north , snow and freezing rain , at times heavy , continued from Iowa to Quebec until February 7 as the center of the system moved slowly out of the area .

 The first long @-@ lived supercell , which spawned the tornado with the longest continuous track of any single tornado in this outbreak , developed around 4 : 50 pm CST ( 2250 UTC ) southeast of Centerville in Yell County . The tornado tracked into Pope County , striking the community of Atkins . Four people died in Atkins and much of the town was destroyed . The tornado continued on and crossed into Conway County where it killed two more people , injured five others , and destroyed numerous homes . The next hard hit town was Clinton in Van Buren County , where three people died . One of these deaths occurred at a boat manufacturing facility which was destroyed . The tornado continued into Stone County , where one person was killed . In the town of Mountain View the local hospital lost its roof and a fire station was destroyed . The tornado affected mostly rural areas for the rest of its path , but two additional people were killed in Izard County before it finally lifted back into the clouds northeast of Highland in Sharp County , about two hours after it initially touched down . 
 An aerial survey later determined that the damage across the seven counties was caused by one tornado , with a track estimated at 122 miles ( 196 km ) in length . This was the longest single tornado track recorded in Arkansas since detailed record keeping began in 1950 . The tornado was rated an EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale . Thirteen people were killed by this tornado , and about 140 people were injured . Approximately 200 homes and businesses were destroyed along the tornado 's path . Damage from this tornado was estimated at nearly $ 120 million across the seven counties . 
 = = = Memphis area tornado = = = 
 At 5 : 32 pm CST ( 2332 UTC ) , a supercell thunderstorm produced a tornado in Southaven , Mississippi , inflicting heavy damage upon Southaven High School , now Southaven Middle School . The tornado quickly tracked across the Mississippi – Tennessee state line and into southeastern portions of Memphis , where <unk> tower cameras showed the tornado tracking across Memphis ' southeastern suburbs , particularly over Southaven , Mississippi . National Weather Service officials issued a Tornado Emergency ( the first of five in the outbreak ) for most of the Memphis metropolitan region . 
 This tornado produced a swath of extensive damage over residential and commercial areas . Hickory Ridge Mall suffered damage when portions of a wall and roof were destroyed . Major damage was also reported in the Pleasant Ridge area of Germantown in the southern end of Memphis . In addition , damage was reported at Memphis International Airport , where a hangar lost its roof , the FedEx freight terminal 's fire station suffered roof damage , airstair trucks were thrown 100 yards ( 91 m ) , and aircraft were moved around , including a Boeing 737 that was moved one foot . FedEx service was disrupted due to flight delays and closed roads , all because of the tornado damage in surrounding areas . The airport weather station 's reporting equipment recorded a wind gust of 73 knots ( 84 mph , 135 km / h ) . The Hardy Bottling Company facility was also damaged , which released 120 @,@ 000 pounds ( 54 @,@ 500 kg ) of anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere , although no public health impacts were reported . Electricity supply to about 65 @,@ 000 customers was briefly cut . 
 The National Weather Service office in Memphis rated the tornado as an EF2 . Four people in the metropolitan area were killed ; three of whom were in a warehouse when it collapsed in the Hickory Hill section of Memphis . A spokesperson for the state 's Emergency Management Agency also reported one fatality at the Hickory Ridge Mall , although the NWS office in Memphis did not confirm this . Thirty @-@ six other people were injured in Shelby County by the tornadoes . One additional death took place southeast of Hebron , Tennessee from a separate EF3 tornado . Shelby County Election Commission administrator James Johnson stated the weather did not interfere with Super Tuesday primary voting . 
 = = = Jackson area tornadoes = = = 
 Farther northeast near Jackson , Tennessee , a tornado touchdown caused the issuance of another tornado emergency ( the second of the outbreak ) at 7 : 00 pm CST ( 0100 UTC ) . This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier . Several cars and at least 15 tractor trailers were overturned by the tornado along Interstate 40 between mile markers 68 and 79 . In addition , the areas southwest of Jackson saw severe damage , including destroyed homes and major damage to a church and a rest area along I @-@ 40 . Major damage was also reported in a commercial area near the U.S. Route 45 bypass and to the northeast of Jackson . Also , the Sharon Baptist Church ( Savannah , TN ) lost its $ 7 million facilities to the tornado , including a 550 @-@ seat sanctuary which was completely destroyed . The most severe damage was at the devastated Union University , where a total of 31 buildings on the campus received damage of varying degrees . Hurt , Watters , and McAfee dormitories were the hardest hit with approximately 80 % of their accommodation rendered uninhabitable . Twelve students at the university were trapped in damaged buildings but all were eventually rescued . Due to the damage , the university was closed until February 18 . 
 The National Weather Service rated the tornado as an EF4 and later determined that there were two distinct tracks , with an EF3 satellite tornado to the southwest of the main one . It was originally believed a third ( an EF3 ) touched down but it was later found to be linked to the main one that hit Union University . This was the third violent tornado to hit Jackson in 10 years . Two others , both rated F4 , had devastated the community on January 17 , 1999 and May 4 , 2003 . 
 Over 60 people in the Jackson area were treated for injuries as a result of the severe weather , 50 of whom were released immediately . No fatalities were caused by the main Jackson tornado , however two fatalities occurred in the Huntersville community , located west of Jackson , from the initial EF3 tornado . Estimates indicate that the tornadoes caused about $ 47 million worth of damages in Madison County , with $ 40 million of that total occurring at Union University alone . 
 = = = Northeast Nashville region tornado = = = 
 Just after 9 : 00 PM CST ( 0300 UTC ) , a supercell that spawned tornadoes over northern Mississippi as well as causing fatalities in Hardin County , Tennessee , moved to the northeast over Nashville . Fortunately , no tornadoes were reported there ( although there were reports of funnel clouds ) and no significant damage was reported in Nashville or Davidson County . At the time the supercell moved over Nashville , a National Hockey League game between the Nashville Predators and the Carolina Hurricanes , which was nationally televised on Versus , was being played at the Sommet Center . With just over nine minutes left in the third period , Predators head coach Barry <unk> was told that the game may have to be stopped . Although the game continued to completion , at the game 's end fans were not allowed to leave the arena until the storm had passed . 
 After the supercell moved through Nashville the environment became more favorable again and a strong tornado did touch down , devastating a lengthy swath of Middle Tennessee in the late evening hours and killing 22 people . The tornado touched down near Castalian Springs and Westmoreland , a rural area in Sumner County , Tennessee , just after 10 : 00 pm CST ( 0400 UTC ) . Eight fatalities were confirmed in Castalian Springs due to the tornado , the last occurring two weeks later . The 19th century <unk> Inn , a national historical landmark , suffered major damage to its second level and grounds during the storm . 
 The tornado then tracked into Trousdale County and left three people dead , two of whom were found at a home along U.S. Route 231 . From there the tornado continued northeast to Macon County , Tennessee , where 13 people died . As a result of the tornado , a major fire occurred at a natural gas plant near the small community of Green Grove in the extreme southwestern portion of the county . The area was evacuated and no one was injured at the plant . Widespread damage in the area was also reported to houses and trailers , particularly in the community of Lafayette . Debris from the Lafayette area was found as far north as Sano , Kentucky , in Adair County , approximately 70 miles ( 113 km ) to the northeast . Sixteen thousand TVA electricity customers in Macon and Trousdale Counties lost power , some of whom did not have their service restored for a week . Macon County schools were closed until February 19 . In total , about 260 houses in the three counties were destroyed , and damage amounts were estimated at $ 78 million in Macon County alone . In addition , on March 13 , 2008 , the tornado claimed the life of a 14th Macon County resident who had been critically injured . 
 The tornado continued across the state boundary into Kentucky where a metal warehouse , two homes and two mobile homes near Gamaliel were destroyed , and several other structures suffered extensive damage . Thirteen people from an adjacent trailer park hid inside a basement and were trapped by debris for up to 30 minutes . 
 Preliminary surveys by the National Weather Service office in Nashville confirmed that the 22 deaths ( which was revised downward from 24 due to double @-@ counting ) were caused by a single tornado , which was rated an EF3 . The tornado path was 51 miles ( 82 km ) long and up to .75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) wide . National Weather Service Meteorologist Bobby Boyd theorized that cold air downbursts impinging on the tornado forced it to lift up from the ground and remain a funnel cloud as it crossed over Davidson County and downtown Nashville before touching down again east of the city . 
 The devastation was described by Governor Phil Bredesen as " It looks like the Lord took a Brillo pad and scrubbed the ground " while surveying by helicopter . The tornado is the deadliest single tornado to strike Middle Tennessee in over 75 years , and the deadliest single US tornado since the Evansville Tornado of November 2005 ( which killed 25 ) . 
 = = = North @-@ central Alabama tornado = = = 
 At approximately 1 : 00 am CST ( 0700 UTC ) , the broken squall line that had affected Oklahoma and Missouri entered the state of Alabama . Individual supercell storms began to develop ahead of the squall line along the Alabama – Mississippi border due to the strengthening of the upper level jet stream . A supercell that developed over Starkville , Mississippi , and tracked over Lamar , Marion and Fayette Counties in Alabama spawned a tornado in Lawrence County , Alabama , at 3 : 02 am CST ( 0902 UTC ) . The tornado touched down at <unk> near the William B. Bankhead National Forest . Many houses were damaged or destroyed , and a church was leveled . Three fatalities , all from a single family , were reported north of Aldrich Grove . An elderly woman was also killed by the storm , and 20 – 25 others were injured . The tornado was initially classified as an EF3 , although it was upgraded to EF4 in later analysis . The hardest hit communities were the towns of Wren , Speake and Five Points . The tornado moved into Morgan County and threatened the Decatur area , leading the NWS in Huntsville to issue a tornado emergency ( the fifth for the outbreak ) for Morgan County and southern Limestone County . The tornado lifted off the ground before reaching Decatur . The same supercell moved over the Huntsville Metro area , though no tornadoes were reported .

 Numerous reports of damaging winds were associated with the passage of the cold front . Wind gusts from Arkansas to Indiana exceeded 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , bringing down numerous trees and power lines , and causing widespread power outages . A 67 mph ( 108 km / h ) wind gust was recorded during the passage of a squall line at Little Rock National Airport . The highest recorded wind gust associated with the passage of the squall line was 82 mph ( 131 km / h ) in Terre Haute , Indiana . Hail as large as softballs ( 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 11 cm ) in diameter ) was reported in several communities . In Canada , unseasonably early thunderstorms brought bouts of heavy rainfall to parts of southern Ontario late on February 4 . 
 = = = Flooding = = = 
 Heavy rains in association with thunderstorms on February 4 to February 6 , combined with the melting of snow , caused flooding across parts of Illinois , New York , Kentucky , Indiana and Ohio . Among the areas hardest hit by the flooding rivers and streams were the Miami Valley , areas along the Blanchard River in Findlay and parts of northern Indiana between Indianapolis and north of Fort Wayne along the Tippecanoe , St. Marys and Wabash Rivers . Several streets in Fort Wayne were under water , and flooding also occurred between Lafayette and Terre Haute . 
 = = = Winter storm = = = 
 The same low pressure systems that caused the tornado outbreak also spawned a significant snowstorm from the Central Plains to the western Great Lakes where winter storm warnings were issued . Between 10 and 15 inches ( 25 – 38 cm ) of snow fell from eastern Iowa to southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois , with local amounts ranging from 18 to 21 inches ( 45 – 53 cm ) in southeastern Wisconsin . In Michigan , up to 14 inches ( 35 cm ) of snow fell north of Grand Rapids . Environment Canada also issued freezing rain and winter storm warnings for Southern Ontario , where some areas north of Lake Erie received close to 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of freezing rain . In Toronto , two waves of moderate to heavy snow accompanied by thunder and lightning , along with ice pellets , brought up to 14 inches ( 35 cm ) of accumulated winter precipitation on February 6 and 7 . Other areas from Windsor to Ottawa , as well as southwestern Nova Scotia , received from 4 to 20 inches ( 10 – 50 cm ) of snow . 
 Over 1 @,@ 000 flight cancellations were reported at Chicago 's O 'Hare International Airport , and numerous flight cancellations also occurred at Toronto 's Pearson International Airport . In Milwaukee , whiteout conditions and 13 inches ( 33 cm ) of snow briefly shut down the General Mitchell International Airport . Near Madison , Wisconsin , about 1 @,@ 000 vehicles were stranded on Interstate 90 due to the snow . Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle declared a state of emergency for the area and activated the Wisconsin National Guard . On February 6 , numerous schools , colleges , government buildings , churches , businesses , and shopping malls were forced to close throughout southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois due to the inclement weather . The winter storm was responsible for at least four deaths : one each in Illinois , Wisconsin , Michigan and Quebec . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On February 7 a federal disaster declaration was made by President George W. Bush for 11 counties in Arkansas and five counties in Tennessee . Sixteen additional counties in Tennessee requested federal aid , and on February 12 , Tennessee Governor Bredesen announced that eight counties in Tennessee became eligible . President Bush also visited Tennessee to tour the devastated areas on February 8 . 
 The American Red Cross , the Salvation Army , the United Way and other charitable groups also quickly mobilized volunteers to assist survivors in the aftermath across the regions affected . In the three hardest hit Middle Tennessee counties alone , the Red Cross sent out over 100 volunteers to deliver meals and supplies . Emergency assistance was also offered by the Tennessee Department of Human Services for low income victims in the counties affected by the tornadoes . In addition , the Nashville Predators announced that for their game on February 7 against the Tampa Bay Lightning , half the ticket sales revenue would be donated to the American Red Cross to help with their efforts , and that fans could make additional donations to Red Cross volunteers at the arena 's main entrances . The National Football League 's Tennessee Titans along with the Mayor 's Office of Emergency Management of Nashville organized a donation drive during the weekend of February 9 at LP Field . 
 = Voluntary Human Extinction Movement = 
 The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement ( VHEMT ) is an environmental movement that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind . VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because , in the group 's view , it would prevent environmental degradation . The group states that a decrease in the human population would prevent a significant amount of human @-@ caused suffering . The extinctions of non @-@ human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation . 
 VHEMT was founded in 1991 by Les U. Knight , an American activist who became involved in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth 's biosphere and humanity . Knight publishes the group 's newsletter and serves as its spokesman . Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events , it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message . Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme , though other writers have applauded VHEMT 's perspective . In response to VHEMT , some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels . Others maintain that , whatever the merits of the idea , the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction . 
 = = History = = 
 The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement was founded by Les U. Knight , a high school substitute teacher who lives in Portland , Oregon . After becoming involved in the environmental movement as a college student in the 1970s , Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation . He joined the Zero Population Growth organization , and chose to be <unk> at age 25 . He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth 's environmental problems . He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history . 
 In 1991 , Knight began publishing VHEMT 's newsletter , known as These Exit Times . In the newsletter , he asked readers to further human extinction by not procreating . VHEMT has also published cartoons , including a comic strip titled " <unk> Baby " , featuring a woman who forgoes childbearing in favor of adopting a bonobo . In 1996 , Knight created a website for VHEMT ; it was available in 11 languages by 2010 . VHEMT 's logo features the letter " V " ( for voluntary ) and an inverted Earth ( i.e. , with north at the bottom ) . 
 = = Organization and promotion = = 
 VHEMT functions as a loose network rather than a formal organization , and does not compile a list of members . Daniel Metz of Willamette University stated in 1995 that VHEMT 's mailing list had just under 400 subscribers . Six years later , Fox News said the list had only 230 subscribers . Knight says that anyone who agrees with his ideology is a member of the movement ; and that this includes " millions of people " . 
 Knight serves as the spokesman for VHEMT . He attends environmental conferences and events , where he publicizes information about population growth . VHEMT 's message has , however , primarily been spread through coverage by media outlets , rather than events and its newsletter . VHEMT sells buttons and T @-@ shirts , as well as bumper stickers that read " Thank you for not breeding " . 
 = = Ideology = = 
 Knight argues that the human population is far greater than the Earth can handle , and that the best thing for Earth 's biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing . He says that humans are " incompatible with the biosphere " and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about the extinction of humans ( as well as other organisms ) . According to Knight , the vast majority of human societies have not lived sustainable lifestyles , and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change the fact that human existence has ultimately been destructive to the Earth and many of its non @-@ human organisms . Voluntary human extinction is promoted on the grounds that it will prevent human suffering and the extinction of other species ; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the increasing human population . 
 James Ormrod , a psychologist who profiled the group in the journal Psychoanalysis , Culture & Society , notes that the " most fundamental belief " of VHEMT is that " human beings should stop reproducing " , and that some people consider themselves members of the group but do not actually support human extinction . Knight , however , believes that even if humans become more environmentally friendly , they could still return to environmentally destructive lifestyles and hence should eliminate themselves . Residents of First World countries bear the most responsibility to change , according to Knight , as they consume the largest proportion of resources . 
 Knight believes that Earth 's non @-@ human organisms have a higher overall value than humans and their accomplishments , such as art : " The plays of Shakespeare and the work of Einstein can 't hold a candle to a tiger " . He argues that species higher in the food chain are less important than lower species . His ideology is drawn in part from deep ecology , and he sometimes refers to the Earth as Gaia . He notes that human extinction is unavoidable , and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid causing the extinction of other animals . The potential for evolution of other organisms is also cited as a benefit . 
 Knight sees abstinence from reproduction as an altruistic choice – a way to prevent involuntary human suffering – and cites the deaths of children from preventable causes as an example of needless suffering . Knight claims that non @-@ reproduction would eventually allow humans to lead idyllic lifestyles in an environment comparable to the Garden of Eden , and maintains that the last remaining humans would be proud of their accomplishment . Other benefits of ceasing human reproduction that he cites include the end of abortion , war , and starvation . Knight argues that " procreation today is de facto child abuse " . He maintains that the standard of human life will worsen if resources are consumed by a growing population rather than spent solving existing issues . He speculates that if people ceased to reproduce , they would use their energy for other pursuits , and suggests adoption and foster care as outlets for people who desire children . 
 VHEMT rejects government @-@ mandated human population control programs in favor of voluntary population reduction , supporting only the use of birth control and willpower to prevent pregnancies . Knight states that coercive tactics are unlikely to permanently lower the human population , citing the fact that humanity has survived catastrophic wars , famines , and viruses . Though their newsletter 's name recalls the suicide manual Final Exit , the idea of mass suicide is rejected , and they have adopted the slogan " May we live long and die out " . A 1995 survey of VHEMT members found that a majority of them felt a strong moral obligation to protect the earth , distrusted the ability of political processes to prevent harm to the environment , and were willing to surrender some of their rights for their cause . VHEMT members who strongly believed that " Civilization [ is ] headed for collapse " were most likely to embrace these views . However , VHEMT does not take any overt political stances . 
 VHEMT promotes a more extreme ideology than Population Action International , a group that argues humanity should reduce — but not eliminate — its population to care for the Earth . However , the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia , which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism . The 1995 survey found that 36 % considered themselves members of Earth First ! or had donated to the group in the previous five years . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Knight states his group 's ideology runs counter to contemporary society 's <unk> . He believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting , or even discussing , population control . He admits that his group is unlikely to succeed , but contends that attempting to reduce the Earth 's population is the only moral option . 
 Reception of Knight 's idea in the mainstream media has been mixed . Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle , Gregory <unk> states that there is an " undeniable logic " to VHEMT 's arguments , but he doubts whether Knight 's ideas can succeed , arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded . Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in The Independent , noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the basic human reproductive drive . At The Guardian 's website , Guy <unk> applauds the movement 's aim as " in many ways laudable " , but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction . Freelance writer Abby O 'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success , VHEMT 's goal is difficult to attain . Knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural , human desire for children is a product of <unk> . 
 The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has criticized Knight 's platform , arguing that the existence of humanity is divinely ordained . Ormrod claims that Knight " arguably abandons deep ecology in favour of straightforward misanthropy " . He notes that Knight 's claim that the last humans in an extinction scenario would have an abundance of resources promotes his cause based on " benefits accruing to humans " . Ormrod sees this type of argument as counter @-@ intuitive , arguing that it borrows the language of " late @-@ modern consumer societies " . He faults Knight for what he sees as a failure to develop a consistent and unambiguous ideology . The Economist characterizes Knight 's claim that voluntary human extinction is advisable due to limited resources as " Malthusian bosh " . The paper further states that compassion for the planet does not necessarily require the pursuit of human extinction . Sociologist Frank Furedi also deems VHEMT to be a Malthusian group , classifying them as a type of environmental organization that " [ thinks ] the worst about the human species " . Writing in Spiked , Josie Appleton argues that the group is indifferent to humanity , rather than " anti @-@ human " . 
 Brian Bethune writes in Maclean 's that Knight 's logic is " as absurd as it 's unassailable " . However , he doubts Knight 's claim that the last survivors of the human race would have pleasant lives and suspects that a " collective loss of the will to live " would prevail . In response to Knight 's platform , journalist Sheldon Richman argues that humans are " active agents " and can change their behavior . He contends that people are capable of solving the problems facing Earth . Alan Weisman , author of The World Without Us , suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction . 
 Katharine <unk> of Salon.com recommends that childless people adopt VHEMT 's arguments when facing " probing questions " about their childlessness . Writing in the Journal for Critical Animal Studies , Carmen Dell <unk> notes that VHEMT seeks to renounce children as a symbol of perpetual human progress . She casts the movement as a form of " queer oppositional politics " because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation . She argues that the movement seeks to come to a new definition of " civil order " , as Lee Edelman suggested that queer theory should . Dell <unk> believes that VHEMT fulfills Edelman 's mandate because they embody the death drive rather than ideas that focus on the reproduction of the past . 
 Although Knight 's organization has been featured in a book titled Kooks : A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief , The Guardian journalist Oliver Burkeman notes that in a phone conversation Knight seems " rather sane and self @-@ deprecating " . Weisman echoes this sentiment , characterizing Knight as " thoughtful , soft @-@ spoken , articulate , and quite serious " . Philosophers Steven Best and Douglas Kellner view VHEMT 's stance as extreme , but they note that the movement formed in response to extreme stances found in " modern humanism " . 
 = Hurricane Hilda ( 1955 ) = 
 Hurricane Hilda was a strong Category 3 hurricane that was the second in a succession of three hurricanes to strike near Tampico , Mexico . The eighth named storm of the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season , Hilda formed from a tropical wave on September 10 near the Lesser Antilles . It quickly intensified while moving westward into a small hurricane , and it crossed over southeastern Cuba on September 13 . There , it dropped heavy rainfall and produced gusty winds that destroyed 80 % of the coffee crop in Oriente Province . In the eastern Cuban city of Baracoa , Hilda severely damaged the oldest church in the country . Damage totaled $ 2 million in Cuba , and there were four deaths . Later , the hurricane moved across the Caribbean Sea , causing light damage in the sparsely populated region of the eastern Yucatán Peninsula . 
 After reaching the Gulf of Mexico , Hilda strengthened to reach peak winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) late on September 18 . Before the hurricane moved ashore , there was residual flooding in Tampico from earlier Hurricane Gladys . Hilda struck the city early on September 19 , with gusts estimated at 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . It dropped heavy rainfall that flooded 90 % of Tampico , while its strong winds damaged half of the homes , leaving 15 @,@ 000 homeless . The storm killed 300 people and caused over $ 120 million ( 1955 USD ) in Mexico . Ongoing flooding caused an outbreak of dysentery , and about 10 days after Hilda struck , Hurricane Janet struck the same region and caused further flooding and damage . Collectively , the damage from the storms represented about half of Mexico 's budget in 1955 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Hilda were from an easterly wave , which spawned a tropical depression over the northern Lesser Antilles late on September 10 . By the next day , the system was producing winds of 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) in squalls . After moving to the northwest , it turned more to the west and quickly intensified . On September 12 , Hilda attained hurricane status to the north of the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic . It was a small cyclone , and the strongest winds were in a small region around the eye . Hilda continued to the west about 30 mi ( 48 km ) offshore northern Hispaniola . After reaching winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , the hurricane weakened slightly while off the north coast of Haiti . Turning to the west @-@ southwest , Hilda made landfall near the southeastern tip of Cuba on September 13 . While crossing the island into the Caribbean Sea , it weakened from a hurricane into a tropical storm . 
 On September 14 , Hilda emerged into the Caribbean Sea . It quickly re @-@ intensified , surpassing its previous strength to winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) by September 15 . The hurricane weakened slightly as it neared the Yucatán Peninsula , and Hilda struck the sparsely populated area between Chetumal and Cozumel on September 16 with winds of about 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . It weakened slightly over the Yucatán Peninsula , emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on September 17 with winds of about 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Hilda again re @-@ intensified , reaching its maximum sustained winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) late on September 18 . Early the next day , the hurricane made landfall near Tampico , Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico . Winds in the city reached 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) , and the eye was observed for 45 minutes . The lowest pressure in Tampico was 952 mbar ( 28 @.@ 1 inHg ) on September 19 . Hilda rapidly weakened over land , turning to the west @-@ southwest and dissipating on September 20 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Early in its duration , the storm produced winds of 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) on Grand Turk Island . Its threat prompted a small craft advisory for southern Florida , the southern Bahamas , and Cuba . When Hilda struck southeastern Cuba , it caused moderate damage and killed four people , all of whom in Oriente Province . Wind gusts reached 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base , which caused a brief power outage . High waves washed a freighter ashore along Cuba 's north coast . Strong winds severely damaged the church in Baracoa , which was built in the 16th century and was the oldest in the country . In Santiago de Cuba , Hilda produced heavy rains and gusty winds , which knocked down telephone lines and caused flooding . Five people were injured after houses collapsed in the city . High rains and winds damaged the sugar cane and pineapple crop , and destroyed 80 % of the coffee crop in Oriente Province . Damage in the country was not severe , estimated at $ 2 million . Hundreds of people were injured or left homeless . After the hurricane isolated the town of Caimanera , American workers sent a train there from Guantanamo Bay with a medical team and supplies . 
 While Hilda moved across the western Caribbean , it produced winds of 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) on Grand Cayman Island . Ahead of Hilda 's landfall on the Yucatán peninsula , officials warned the residents to prepare for high winds and waves . A storm warning was issued in Belize City . When Hilda crossed the Yucatán peninsula , it caused about $ 100 @,@ 000 in damage . Ahead of the storm in South Texas , officials provided sandbags and advised businesses to move merchandise within 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) of the floor , both an effort to mitigate potential flooding . The large circulation produced winds of 22 mph ( 35 km / h ) and flooded coastal roads in southern Texas . Outer rainbands flooded Raymondville and other towns in the region . 
 Before the hurricane struck , residents in Mexico expected that Hurricane Hilda would be weaker and strike near Tampico . When the storm was announced via radio about three hours before landfall , most people were already asleep and unable to prepare . Tides rose in advance of the storm , and before it made landfall , 10 % of Tampico was still flooded from previous Hurricane Gladys . In Tampico , Hilda 's strong winds blew away an anemometer after the instrument recorded winds of 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) ; peak winds were later estimated at around 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . At the city 's port , Hilda damaged boats and ferries , some of which washed out to sea . The hurricane destroyed the roofs of about half of the city 's houses , as well as several schools and large buildings . Hilda produced severe flooding in Tampico that was reported to have covered 90 % of the city 's streets . Although smaller than the previous Hurricane Gladys , Hilda dropped heavy rainfall that flooded local rivers . Overall , 11 @,@ 432 people were directly affected by Hilda . The hurricane caused 300 deaths and $ 120 million in damage , mostly due to the flooding . 
 After the storm , Tampico was left without power or communications . About 15 @,@ 000 people became homeless due to the storm , or previously from Hurricane Gladys . The governor of Tamaulipas declared a state of emergency and requested assistance from the military to provide food and shelter . Within a day after the storm , water access was restored , although the city initially remained without power or telephone . Communications were cut to Tampico , except for the airport at the radio . The rail line from Laredo , Texas to Mexico City was cut during the storm , but was restored ten days later . Due to ongoing flood conditions , there was an outbreak of dysentery that killed two children . The Mexican government flew medical supplies , food , and clothing from Mexico City to Tampico , while four United States helicopters assisted in rescue missions along the Pánuco River . About 10 days after Hilda struck Tampico , Hurricane Janet affected the same area , causing further damage and deaths . Collectively , the two hurricanes caused 1 @,@ 240 deaths along their paths , and damage from the consecutive storms totaled about half of Mexico 's 1955 national budget . After the two hurricanes , the Mexican government and military worked to assist the affected residents , and the Mexican Red Cross provided vaccinations and medical assistance to prevent the spread of disease . 
 = 1920 Muncie Flyers season = 
 The 1920 Muncie Flyers season was the franchise 's inaugural season in the American Professional Football League ( APFA ) — later named the National Football League . The Flyers entered the season coming off a 4 – 1 – 1 record in 1919 . Several representatives from the Ohio League wanted to form a new professional league ; thus , the APFA was created . The 1920 team only played in one game that counted in the standings : a 45 – 0 loss against the Rock Island Independents . This game and the Columbus Panhandles – Dayton Triangles on the same date is considered to be the first league game featuring two APFA teams . The Flyers tried to schedule other games , but the opponents canceled to play better teams . As a result , the Flyers had to play the rest of the season 's game versus local teams . In week 10 , the Flyers won a game against the Muncie Offers More AC for the Muncie City Championship . No players from the 1920 Muncie Flyers were listed on the 1920 All @-@ Pro Team , and no player has been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame .

 The Muncie Flyers , playing as the Muncie <unk> Flyers , finished 4 – 1 – 1 as an independent team in 1919 . They concluded this season with a win over Avondale AA and won the Muncie City Championship . Representatives of four Ohio League teams — the Canton Bulldogs , the Cleveland Tigers , the Dayton Triangles , and the Akron Pros — called a meeting on August 20 , 1920 to discuss the formation of a new , professional league . At the meeting , they tentatively agreed on a salary cap and pledged not to sign college players or players already under contract with other teams . They agreed on a name for the circuit : the American Professional Football Conference . 
 Earl Ball , the Flyers ' manager , heard about this gathering on August 29 and was interested in participating . The original four representatives then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17 . At that meeting , held at Bulldogs owner Ralph Hay 's Hupmobile showroom in Canton , representatives of the Rock Island Independents , the Flyers , the Decatur Staleys , the Racine Cardinals , the Massillon Tigers , the Chicago Cardinals , and the Hammond Pros agreed to join the league . Representatives of the Buffalo All @-@ Americans and Rochester Jeffersons could not attend the meeting but sent letters to Hay asking to be included in the league . Team representatives changed the league 's name slightly to the American Professional Football Association and elected officers , installing Jim Thorpe as president . Under the new league structure , teams created their schedules dynamically as the season progressed , and representatives of each team voted to determine the winner of the APFA trophy .

 The Flyers hosted a practice game against the Muncie Tigers on September 26 , 1920 , but the result of the game is unknown . The Flyers ' first game of the season was against the Rock Island Independents . The Independents beat the Flyers 45 – 0 . As a result , the Staleys , who were supposed to play the Flyers the next week , cancelled because they wanted to play a better team . The Flyers tried to schedule game for the next few weeks but were unsuccessful . Since there were no rules to keep players on teams , several Flyers ' players left and played for other teams . The Flyers scheduled a game against the Cleveland Tigers three weeks later , but the game was cancelled because the Tigers decided to play against the Panhandles instead . The same result happened next week against the Dayton Triangles . The Flyers were challenged by the Gas City Tigers and Muncie Offers More AC — two teams of Muncie .

 After their first victory of the season , the Flyers were challenged by the Muncie Offers More AC . The game was labelled as the Muncie City Championship . Since most of the other local teams ' seasons were finished , both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game . The field was muddy , which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times . In the third quarter , the Flyers scored two touchdowns to give them a 14 – 0 lead going into the fourth quarter .

The first quarter was scoreless , as the only near score was from a failed drop kick from the Flyers . The first score of the game came in the second quarter . Weaver of the Tigers returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown . On the Tigers ' next possession , they dropped a pass in the endzone on fourth down . Early in the third quarter , a member of the Tigers fumbled , and the Flyers recovered it on the 5 @-@ yard line . Huffine score a rushing touchdown on that possession to tie the game 7 – 7 .

 = Defence @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Defence @-@ class ironclads were a class of two warships built for the Royal Navy between 1859 and 1862 . The ships were designed as armoured frigates in response to an invasion scare sparked by the launch of the French ironclad Gloire and her three sisters in 1858 . They were initially armed with a mix of rifled breech @-@ loading and muzzle @-@ loading smoothbore guns , but the Armstrong breech @-@ loading guns proved unreliable and were withdrawn from service after a few years . 
 Both ships were initially assigned to the Channel Squadron , but HMS Resistance was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron in 1864 . The ships were rearmed in the late 1860s after the completion of their first commission . They alternated between assignments with the fleet and guardship duties with the First Reserve for the rest of their careers . Resistance was the first to be paid off in 1880 and was used as a target for gunnery and torpedo trials beginning in 1885 . She was sold for ship breaking in 1898 , but wrecked en route to the breaker 's yard . HMS Defence was paid off in 1885 and she became a stationary training ship in 1890 until she was sold for scrap in 1935 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1859 the Admiralty was not yet convinced that the very expensive ( £ 377 @,@ 000 ) Warrior @-@ class ironclads , which was over double that of wooden , steam @-@ powered ships of the line , had to be accepted as the norm . They noted that the 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 114 mm ) armour plate of the Warriors was adequate to deflect all ordnance currently afloat , and high speed was not necessary to prevent existing wooden ships from massing their fire against the ironclads . Their Lordships therefore requested a design which , while carrying the same armour , was smaller and slower , and thus cheaper , than the Warriors . Rear Admiral Sir Baldwin Wake Walker , Controller of the Navy , proposed that six ships be built to this design , but he was over @-@ ruled and only two were ordered on 14 December 1859 . 
 The Admiralty 's decision saddled the Royal Navy with a pair of ships that could not operate with the Warriors in a tactical squadron and were inferior to the French ironclads then under construction . The naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby , a future Constructor of the Navy , considered that a Defence @-@ class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior in terms of combat , although they cost about two @-@ thirds as much . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Defence class was 280 feet ( 85 @.@ 3 m ) long between perpendiculars and 291 feet 4 inches ( 88 @.@ 80 m ) long overall . They had a beam of 54 feet 2 inches ( 16 @.@ 5 m ) and a draught of 26 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . The ships displaced 6 @,@ 070 long tons ( 6 @,@ 170 t ) and had a tonnage of 3 @,@ 710 tons burthen . Unlike their predecessors , they were fitted with a ram in the shape of a plough . The ends of the hull were subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads and had a partial double bottom . Each ship had a complement of 460 ( officers and enlisted men ) . The Defence class was 128 feet 8 inches ( 39 @.@ 2 m ) shorter overall and displaced more than 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) less than the Warrior @-@ class ironclads . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Defence @-@ class ships had a single two @-@ cylinder trunk steam engine made by John Penn and Sons driving a single 21 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) propeller . Four rectangular boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 20 psi ( 138 kPa ; 1 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines produced 2 @,@ 329 – 2 @,@ 343 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 737 – 1 @,@ 747 kW ) during sea trials which gave the ships maximum speeds of 11 @.@ 23 – 11 @.@ 4 knots ( 20 @.@ 80 – 21 @.@ 11 km / h ; 12 @.@ 92 – 13 @.@ 12 mph ) . They carried 450 long tons ( 460 t ) of coal , enough to steam 1 @,@ 670 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 090 km ; 1 @,@ 920 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ironclads were barque @-@ rigged and had a sail area of 24 @,@ 500 square feet ( 2 @,@ 276 m2 ) . The lower masts and bowsprit were made of iron to withstand the shock of ramming . Both ships could make about 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ; 12 @.@ 1 mph ) under sail alone . To reduce wind resistance while under sail alone , the funnel was semi @-@ retractable . Similarly , the propeller could be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail .

 The armament of the Defence @-@ class ships was intended to be 18 smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 68 @-@ pounder guns , eight on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck , plus four Armstrong 40 @-@ pounder guns , an early rifled breech loader ( RBL ) design , as saluting guns . The 8 @.@ 12 @-@ inch ( 206 mm ) 68 @-@ pounder weighed 10 @,@ 640 @-@ pound ( 4 @,@ 826 @.@ 2 kg ) and had a range of 3 @,@ 200 yards ( 2 @,@ 900 m ) with solid shot . During construction the armament was changed to include six ( Defence ) or eight ( Resistance ) rifled 110 @-@ pounder guns , ten 68 @-@ pounders and either two 32 @-@ pounder smoothbores ( Resistance ) or four breech @-@ loading 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) guns ( Defence ) . The innovative 9 @,@ 520 @-@ pound ( 4 @,@ 318 @.@ 2 kg ) 110 @-@ pounder , whose 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) shell could reach 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) was in short supply when the ironclads were launched , but poor results in armour @-@ penetration tests halted plans to fully equip the ironclads with this gun . The 110 @-@ pounders blew up when other ships used them in action , were labour @-@ intensive to load and fire , and were henceforth only used with a reduced propellant charge , which left them useless in practice . 
 Both ships were rearmed in the late 1860s with 14 seven @-@ inch and 2 eight @-@ inch rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried . On both ships the eight @-@ inch guns were mounted amidships on the main deck on the broadside and a pair of seven @-@ inch guns were mounted on the upper deck as fore and aft chase guns . Eight of the remaining seven @-@ inch guns were also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship 's armour , but one pair was on the main deck further aft where they were not protected by armour . The two ships differed where the last pair of seven @-@ inch guns was positioned : Defence mounted them on the main deck , forward of the armour , while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck . 
 The shell of the eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) weighed 175 pounds ( 79 @.@ 4 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 9 long tons ( 9 @.@ 1 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 410 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate 9 @.@ 6 inches ( 244 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 6 @.@ 5 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) seven @-@ inch gun fired a 112 pounds ( 50 @.@ 8 kg ) shell and could penetrate 7 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 196 mm ) armour . All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells .

 The Defence @-@ class ships had a wrought iron armour belt , 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick , that covered 140 feet ( 42 @.@ 7 m ) amidships . The armour extended from upper deck level to six feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) below the waterline . Transverse bulkheads 4 @.@ 5 inches thick protected the guns on the main deck from raking fire . The armour was backed by 18 inches ( 460 mm ) of teak . The ends of the ship were left entirely unprotected which meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable . They were , however , sub @-@ divided into many watertight compartments to minimize any flooding .

 HMS Defence was assigned to the Channel Squadron upon completion in 1862 . The ship was paid off in 1866 to refit and be re @-@ armed and was briefly reassigned to the Channel Squadron again when she recommissioned in 1868 . Defence had brief tours on the North American and Mediterranean Stations , from 1869 to 1872 before she was refitted again from 1872 to 1874 . She became guard ship on the Shannon when she recommissioned . The ship was transferred to the Channel Squadron again in 1876 and then became guard ship in 1879 on the Mersey until 1885 . Defence was placed in reserve until 1890 when she was assigned to the mechanical training school at Devonport in 1890 . She was renamed Indus when the school adopted that name and served there until sold in 1935 . 
 HMS Resistance was the first capital ship in the Royal Navy to be fitted with a ram and was given the nickname of Old <unk> . She was initially assigned to the Channel Squadron , but was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron in 1864 , the first ironclad to be assigned to that squadron . Resistance was rearmed in 1867 and became a guardship when recommissioned in 1869 . The ship was reassigned to the Channel Fleet in 1873 before reverting to her former duties in 1877 . Resistance was decommissioned in 1880 and was used for gunnery and torpedo trials beginning in 1885 . The ship was sold for scrap in 1898 and foundered the following year en route to the breaker 's yard . Her wreck was salvaged and later scrapped . 
 = Thor = 
 In Norse mythology , Thor ( / <unk> / ; from Old Norse Þórr ) is a hammer @-@ wielding god associated with thunder , lightning , storms , oak trees , strength , the protection of mankind , and also <unk> and fertility . The cognate deity in wider Germanic mythology and paganism was known in Old English as <unk> and in Old High German as Donar ( runic <unk> <unk> ) , stemming from a Common Germanic * <unk> ( meaning " thunder " ) . 
 Ultimately stemming from Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European religion , Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples , from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania , to the tribal expansions of the Migration Period , to his high popularity during the Viking Age , when , in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia , emblems of his hammer , Mjölnir , were worn in defiance and Norse pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity . Into the modern period , Thor continued to be acknowledged in rural folklore throughout Germanic regions . Thor is frequently referred to in place names , the day of the week Thursday ( " Thor 's day " ; Old English <unk> , Thunor 's day ; German " Donnerstag " Donar 's day ; Dutch " <unk> " ) bears his name , and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today . 
 In Norse mythology , largely recorded in Iceland from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia , numerous tales and information about Thor are provided . In these sources , Thor bears at least fourteen names , is the husband of the golden @-@ haired goddess Sif , is the lover of the jötunn Járnsaxa , and is generally described as fierce @-@ eyed , red @-@ haired and red @-@ bearded . With Sif , Thor fathered the goddess ( and possible valkyrie ) Þrúðr ; with Járnsaxa , he fathered Magni ; with a mother whose name is not recorded , he fathered Móði , and he is the stepfather of the god Ullr . The same sources list Thor as the son of the god Odin and the personified earth , <unk> , and by way of Odin , Thor has numerous brothers . Thor has two servants , <unk> and <unk> , rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats , <unk> and <unk> ( that he eats and resurrects ) , and is ascribed three dwellings ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) . Thor wields the mountain @-@ crushing hammer , Mjölnir , wears the belt <unk> and the iron gloves <unk> , and owns the staff <unk> . Thor 's exploits , including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr — and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnarök — are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology . 
 Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture . Like other Germanic deities , veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in Heathenry . 
 = = Name = = 
 Old Norse Þórr , Old English <unk> , Old High German Donar , Old Saxon <unk> , and Old Frisian <unk> are cognates within the Germanic language branch , descending from the Proto @-@ Germanic masculine noun * <unk> ' thunder ' . 
 The name of the god is the origin of the weekday name Thursday . By employing a practice known as interpretatio germanica during the Roman Empire period , the Germanic peoples adopted the Roman weekly calendar , and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own . Latin dies <unk> ( ' day of Jupiter ' ) was converted into Proto @-@ Germanic * <unk> <unk> ( " Thor 's day " ) , from which stems modern English " Thursday " and all other Germanic weekday cognates . 
 Beginning in the Viking Age , personal names containing the <unk> <unk> are recorded with great frequency . Prior to the Viking Age , no examples are recorded . <unk> @-@ based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization , similar to the wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor 's hammer pendants .

 = = = Roman era = = = 
 The earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans , and in these works Thor is frequently referred to — via a process known as interpretatio romana ( where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non @-@ Roman god as a Roman deity ) — as either the Roman god Jupiter ( also known as Jove ) or the Greco @-@ Roman god Hercules . The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian Tacitus 's late first @-@ century work Germania , where , writing about the religion of the Suebi ( a confederation of Germanic peoples ) , he comments that " among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship . They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him , on fixed days , human as well as other sacrificial victims . Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind " and adds that a portion of the Suebi also venerate " Isis " . In this instance , Tacitus refers to the god Odin as " Mercury " , Thor as " Hercules " , and the god Týr as " Mars " , and the identity of the Isis of the Suebi has been debated . In Thor 's case , the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor 's hammer and Hercules ' club . In his Annals , Tacitus again refers to the veneration of " Hercules " by the Germanic peoples ; he records a wood beyond the river Weser ( in what is now northwestern Germany ) as dedicated to him . 
 In Germanic areas occupied by the Roman Empire , coins and votive objects dating from the 2nd and 3rd century AD have been found with Latin inscriptions referring to " Hercules " , and so in reality , with varying levels of likelihood , refer to Thor by way of interpretatio romana . 
 = = = Post @-@ Roman Era = = = 
 The first recorded instance of the name of the god appears in the Migration Period , where a piece of jewelry ( a fibula ) , the <unk> fibula , dating from the 7th century AD and found in Bavaria , bears an Elder Futhark inscription that contains the name " <unk> " , i.e. " Donar " , the southern Germanic form of the god 's name . 
 According to a near @-@ contemporary account , the Christian missionary Saint Boniface felled an oak tree dedicated to " Jove " in the 8th century , the Donar Oak in the region of Hesse , Germany . 
 Around the second half of the 8th century , Old English mentions of a figure named Thunor ( <unk> ) are recorded , a figure who likely refers to an Old English version of the god . In relation , Thunor is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss Jupiter , the god may be referenced in the poem Solomon and Saturn , where the thunder strikes the devil with a " fiery axe " , and the Old English expression <unk> ( " thunder ride " ) may refer to the god 's thunderous , goat @-@ led chariot . 
 A 9th @-@ century AD codex from Mainz , Germany , known as the Old Saxon <unk> Vow records the name of three Old Saxon gods , <unk> ( Old Saxon " Wodan " ) , <unk> , and <unk> , by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally converting to Christianity . 
 The Kentish royal legend , probably 11th @-@ century , contains the story of a villainous reeve of Ecgberht of Kent called Thunor , who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as <unk> <unk> ( Old English ' Thunor 's mound ' ) . Gabriel Turville @-@ Petre saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god 's name .

 In the 11th century , chronicler Adam of Bremen records in his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum that a statue of Thor , who Adam describes as " mightiest " , sits in the Temple at Uppsala in the center of a triple throne ( flanked by Woden and " <unk> " ) located in Gamla Uppsala , Sweden . Adam details that " Thor , they reckon , rules the sky ; he governs thunder and lightning , winds and storms , fine weather and fertility " and that " Thor , with his mace , looks like Jupiter " . Adam details that the people of Uppsala had appointed priests to each of the gods , and that the priests were to offer up sacrifices . In Thor 's case , he continues , these sacrifices were done when plague or famine threatened . Earlier in the same work , Adam relays that in 1030 an English preacher , Wulfred , was lynched by assembled Germanic pagans for " profaning " a representation of Thor . 
 Two objects with runic inscriptions invoking Thor date from the 11th century , one from England and one from Sweden . The first , the Canterbury Charm from Canterbury , England , calls upon Thor to heal a wound by banishing a thurs . The second , the <unk> amulet , invokes protection by both Thor and his hammer .

 In the 12th century , more than a century after Norway was " officially " Christianized , Thor was still being invoked by the population , as evidenced by a stick bearing a runic message found among the Bryggen inscriptions in Bergen , Norway . On the stick , both Thor and Odin are called upon for help ; Thor is asked to " receive " the reader , and Odin to " own " them . Also around the 12th century , iconography of the Christianizing 11th @-@ century king Olaf II of Norway absorbed elements of the native Thor ; Olaf II had become a familiarly red @-@ bearded , hammer @-@ wielding figure . 
 = = = = Poetic Edda = = = = 
 In the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from traditional source material reaching into the pagan period , Thor appears ( or is mentioned ) in the poems Völuspá , Grímnismál , Skírnismál , Hárbarðsljóð , Hymiskviða , Lokasenna , Þrymskviða , Alvíssmál , and Hyndluljóð . 
 In the poem Völuspá , a dead völva recounts the history of the universe and foretells the future to the disguised god Odin , including the death of Thor . Thor , she foretells , will do battle with the great serpent during the immense mythical war waged at Ragnarök , and there he will slay the monstrous snake , yet after he will only be able to take nine steps before succumbing to the venom of the beast : 
 Afterwards , says the völva , the sky will turn black before fire engulfs the world , the stars will disappear , flames will dance before the sky , steam will rise , the world will be covered in water and then it will be raised again , green and fertile ( see Prose Edda section below for the survival of the sons of Thor , who return after these events with Thor 's hammer ) . 
 In the poem Grímnismál , the god Odin , in disguise as Grímnir , and tortured , starved and thirsty , imparts in the young Agnar cosmological lore , including that Thor resides in <unk> , and that , every day , Thor wades through the rivers Körmt and Örmt , and the two <unk> . There , Grímnir says , Thor sits as judge at the immense cosmological world tree , Yggdrasil . 
 In Skírnismál , the god Freyr 's messenger , Skírnir , threatens the fair Gerðr , who Freyr is smitten with , with numerous threats and curses , including that Thor , Freyr , and Odin will be angry with her , and that she risks their " potent wrath " . 
 Thor is the main character of Hárbarðsljóð , where , after traveling " from the east " , he comes to an inlet where he encounters a ferryman who gives his name as Hárbarðr ( Odin , again in disguise ) , and attempts to hail a ride from him . The ferryman , shouting from the inlet , is immediately rude and obnoxious to Thor and refuses to ferry him . At first , Thor holds his tongue , but Hárbarðr only becomes more aggressive , and the poem soon becomes a flyting match between Thor and Hárbarðr , all the while revealing lore about the two , including Thor 's killing of several jötnar in " the east " and <unk> women on <unk> ( now the Danish island of Læsø ) . In the end , Thor ends up walking instead . 
 Thor is again the main character in the poem Hymiskviða , where , after the gods have been hunting and have eaten their prey , they have an urge to drink . They " sh [ <unk> ] the twigs " and interpret what they say . The gods decide that they would find suitable cauldrons at Ægir 's home . Thor arrives at Ægir 's home and finds him to be cheerful , looks into his eyes , and tells him that he must prepare feasts for the gods . Annoyed , Ægir tells Thor that the gods must first bring to him a suitable cauldron to brew ale in . The gods search but find no such cauldron anywhere . However , Týr tells Thor that he may have a solution ; east of <unk> lives Hymir , and he owns such a deep kettle . 
 So , after Thor secures his goats at Egil 's home , Thor and Týr go to Hymir 's hall in search of a cauldron large enough to brew ale for them all . They arrive , and Týr sees his nine @-@ hundred @-@ headed grandmother and his gold @-@ clad mother , the latter of which welcomes them with a horn . After Hymir — who is not happy to see Thor — comes in from the cold outdoors , Týr 's mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron . Thor eats a big meal of two oxen ( all the rest eat but one ) , and then goes to sleep . In the morning , he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening , and that he will catch plenty of food , but that he needs bait . Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture , which he expects should not be a problem for Thor . Thor goes out , finds Hymir 's best ox , and rips its head off . 
 After a lacuna in the manuscript of the poem , Hymiskviða abruptly picks up again with Thor and Hymir in a boat , out at sea . Hymir catches a few whales at once , and Thor baits his line with the head of the ox . Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr bites . Thor pulls the serpent on board , and violently slams him in the head with his hammer . Jörmungandr shrieks , and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in the manuscript . 
 After the second lacuna , Hymir is sitting in the boat , unhappy and totally silent , as they row back to shore . On shore , Hymir suggests that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm . Thor picks both the boat and the whales up , and carries it all back to Hymir 's farm . After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir 's head on Týr 's mother 's suggestion , Thor and Týr are given the cauldron . Týr cannot lift it , but Thor manages to roll it , and so with it they leave . Some distance from Hymir 's home , an army of many @-@ headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two , but are killed by the hammer of Thor . Although one of his goats is lame in the leg , the two manage to bring the cauldron back , have plenty of ale , and so , from then on , return to Ægir 's for more every winter . 
 In the poem Lokasenna , the half @-@ god Loki angrily flyts with the gods in the sea entity Ægir 's hall . Thor does not attend the event , however , as he is away in the east for unspecified purposes . Towards the end of the poem , the flyting turns to Sif , Thor 's wife , whom Loki then claims to have slept with . The god Freyr 's servant Beyla interjects , and says that , since all of the mountains are shaking , she thinks that Thor is on his way home . Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel , to which Loki responds with insults . 
 Thor arrives and tells Loki to be silent , and threatens to rip Loki 's head from his body with his hammer . Loki asks Thor why he is so angry , and comments that Thor will not be so daring to fight " the wolf " ( Fenrir ) when it eats Odin ( a reference to the foretold events of Ragnarök ) . Thor again tells him to be silent , and threatens to throw him into the sky , where he will never be seen again . Loki says that Thor should not brag of his time in the east , as he once crouched in fear in the thumb of a glove ( a story involving deception by the magic of <unk> @-@ Loki , recounted in the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning ) — which , he comments , " was hardly like Thor " . Thor again tells him to be silent , threatening to break every bone in Loki 's body . Loki responds that he intends to live a while yet , and again insults Thor with references to his encounter with <unk> @-@ Loki . Thor responds with a fourth call to be silent , and threatens to send Loki to Hel . At Thor 's final threat , Loki gives in , commenting that only for Thor will he leave the hall , for " I know alone that you do strike " , and the poem continues . 
 In the comedic poem Þrymskviða , Thor again plays a central role . In the poem , Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer , Mjöllnir , is missing . Thor turns to Loki , and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen . The two go to the dwelling of the goddess Freyja , and so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir , Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak . Freyja agrees , and says she would lend it to Thor even if it were made of silver or gold , and Loki flies off , the feather cloak whistling . 
 In Jötunheimr , the jötunn Þrymr sits on a barrow , plaiting golden collars for his female dogs , and trimming the manes of his horses . Þrymr sees Loki , and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the elves ; why is Loki alone in Jötunheimr ? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir — that Thor 's hammer , Mjöllnir , is gone . Þrymr says that he has hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth , from which it will be retrieved , but only if Freyja is brought to him as his wife . Loki flies off , the feather cloak whistling , away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods . 
 Thor asks Loki if his efforts were successful , and that Loki should tell him while he is still in the air as " tales often escape a sitting man , and the man lying down often barks out lies . " Loki states that it was indeed an effort , and also a success , for he has discovered that Þrymr has the hammer , but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to Þrymr as his wife . The two return to Freyja and tell her to put on a bridal head dress , as they will drive her to Jötunheimr . Freyja , indignant and angry , goes into a rage , causing all of the halls of the Æsir to tremble in her anger , and her necklace , the famed <unk> , falls from her . Freyja pointedly refuses . 
 As a result , the gods and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter . At the thing , the god Heimdallr puts forth the suggestion that , in place of Freyja , Thor should be dressed as the bride , complete with jewels , women 's clothing down to his knees , a bridal head @-@ dress , and the necklace <unk> . Thor rejects the idea , yet Loki interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mjöllnir . Loki points out that , without Mjöllnir , the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard . The gods dress Thor as a bride , and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid , and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together . 
 After riding together in Thor 's goat @-@ driven chariot , the two , disguised , arrive in Jötunheimr . Þrymr commands the jötnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches , for Freyja has arrived to be his wife . Þrymr recounts his treasured animals and objects , stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth . 
 Early in the evening , the disguised Loki and Thor meet with Þrymr and the assembled jötnar . Thor eats and drinks ferociously , consuming entire animals and three casks of mead . Þrymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja , and Loki , sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a " very shrewd maid " , makes the excuse that " Freyja 's " behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive . Þrymr then lifts " Freyja 's " veil and wants to kiss " her " . Terrifying eyes stare back at him , seemingly burning with fire . Loki says that this is because " Freyja " has not slept for eight nights in her eagerness . 
 The " wretched sister " of the jötnar appears , asks for a bridal gift from " Freyja " , and the jötnar bring out Mjöllnir to " sanctify the bride " , to lay it on her lap , and marry the two by " the hand " of the goddess Vár . Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer , takes hold of it , strikes Þrymr , beats all of the jötnar , kills their " older sister " , and so gets his hammer back . 
 In the poem Alvíssmál , Thor tricks a dwarf , Alvíss , to his doom upon finding that he seeks to wed his daughter ( unnamed , possibly Þrúðr ) . As the poem starts , Thor meets a dwarf who talks about getting married . Thor finds the dwarf repulsive and , apparently , realizes that the bride is his daughter . Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone , and that the dwarf must seek his consent . To do so , Thor says , Alvíss must tell him what he wants to know about all of the worlds that the dwarf has visited . In a long question and answer session , Alvíss does exactly that ; he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world , and gives an amount of cosmological lore . 
 However , the question and answer session turns out to be a ploy by Thor , as , although Thor comments that he has truly never seen anyone with more wisdom in their breast , Thor has managed to delay the dwarf enough for the Sun to turn him to stone ; " day dawns on you now , dwarf , now sun shines on the hall " . 
 In the poem Hyndluljóð , Freyja offers to the jötunn woman Hyndla to blót ( sacrifice ) to Thor so that she may be protected , and comments that Thor does not care much for jötunn women . 
 = = = = Prose Edda , Heimskringla , and sagas = = = = 
 In the prologue to his Prose Edda , Snorri Sturluson <unk> Thor as a prince of Troy , and the son of king Memnon by <unk> , a daughter of Priam . Thor , also known as <unk> , is said to have married the prophetess Sibyl ( identified with Sif ) . Thor is further said here to have been raised in Thrace by a chieftain named <unk> , whom he later slew to assume the title of " King of Thrace " , to have had hair " fairer than gold " , and to have been strong enough to lift ten bearskins . 
 The name of the <unk> is explained as " men from Asia , " Asgard being the " Asian city " ( i.e. , Troy ) . Alternatively , Troy is in <unk> ( Turkey , i.e. , Asia Minor ) , and <unk> is Scythia , where Thor founded a new city named Asgard . Odin is a remote descendant of Thor , removed by twelve generations , who led an expedition across Germany , Denmark and Sweden to Norway . 
 In the Prose Edda , Thor is mentioned in all four books ; Prologue , Gylfaginning , Skáldskaparmál , and Háttatal . 
 In Heimskringla , composed in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , Thor or statues of Thor are mentioned in Ynglinga saga , Hákonar saga góða , <unk> saga Tryggvasonar , and Óláfs saga <unk> . In Ynglinga saga chapter 5 , a heavily euhemerized account of the gods is provided , where Thor is described as having been a <unk> — a pagan priest — who was given by Odin ( who himself is explained away as having been an exceedingly powerful magic @-@ wielding chieftain from the east ) a dwelling in the mythical location of <unk> , in what is now Sweden . The saga narrative adds that numerous names — at the time of the narrative , popularly in use — were derived from Thor . 
 = = = Modern folklore = = = 
 Tales about Thor , or influenced by native traditions regarding Thor , continued into the modern period , particularly in Scandinavia . Writing in the 19th century , scholar Jacob Grimm records various phrases surviving into Germanic languages that refer to the god , such as the Norwegian <unk> ( " Thor 's warmth " ) for lightning and the Swedish <unk> <unk> ( " The good old ( fellow ) is taking a ride " ) as well as the word <unk> ( " Thor 's rumble " or " Thor 's thunder " ) when it thunders . Grimm comments that , at times , Scandinavians often " no longer liked to utter the god 's real name , or they wished to extol his fatherly goodness [ ... ] . " 
 Thor remained pictured as a red @-@ bearded figure , as evidenced by the Danish rhyme that yet referred to him as Thor med sit lange <unk> ( " Thor with the long beard " ) and the Frisian curse <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ( " let red @-@ haired thunder see to that ! " ) . 
 A Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and jötnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales , and may be a late reflection of Thor 's role in fighting such beings . In connection , the lack of trolls and <unk> in modern Scandinavia is explained as a result of the " accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes " .

 = = = Runestone invocations and image stones = = = 
 On four ( or possibly five ) runestones , an invocation to Thor appears that reads " May Thor hallow ( these runes / this monument ) ! " The invocation appears thrice in Denmark ( DR 110 , DR 209 , and DR 220 ) , and a single time in Västergötland ( Vg 150 ) , Sweden . A fifth appearance may possibly occur on a runestone found in Södermanland , Sweden ( Sö 140 ) , but the reading is contested . Pictorial representations of Thor 's hammer also appear on a total of five runestones found in Denmark and in the Swedish counties of Västergötland and Södermanland . 
 Three stones depict Thor fishing for the serpent Jörmungandr ; the <unk> stone in Thy , Denmark , the <unk> Runestone in <unk> , Sweden , one of the Ardre image stones ( stone VII ) from Gotland , Sweden , and the Gosforth Cross in Gosforth , England . 
 = = = Hammer pendants and <unk> Statue = = = 
 <unk> in a distinctive shape representing the hammer of Thor ( known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir ) have frequently been unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials . The hammers were worn as a symbol of Norse pagan faith and as a symbol of opposition to Christianization ; a response to crosses worn by Christians . Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor 's hammers and Christian crucifixes , and at least one example of a combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered . The <unk> Statue , a copper alloy figure found near Akureyri , Iceland dating from around the 11th century , may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer . 
 = = = Swastikas = = = 
 The swastika symbol has been identified as representing the hammer or lightning of Thor . Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson ( 1965 ) comments on the usage of the swastika as a symbol of Thor : 
 The protective sign of the hammer was worn by women , as we know from the fact that it has been found in women 's graves . It seems to have been used by the warrior also , in the form of the swastika . [ ... ] Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire , and to have been linked with the sun @-@ wheel . It may have been on account of Thor 's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer , for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor . When we find it on the pommel of a warrior 's sword and on his sword @-@ belt , the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God 's protection . 
 Swastikas appear on various Germanic objects stretching from the Migration Period to the Viking Age , such as the 3rd century <unk> <unk> ( DR <unk> ; 123 ) from Zealand , Denmark ; the Gothic spearhead from Brest @-@ Litovsk , Belarus ; numerous Migration Period bracteates ; cremation urns from early Anglo @-@ Saxon England ; the 8th century <unk> sword from Sogn , Norway ; and the 9th century <unk> Stone ( DR 248 ) from <unk> , Denmark .

 Numerous place names in Scandinavia contain the Old Norse name Þórr . The identification of these place names as pointing to religious significance is complicated by the aforementioned common usage of Þórr as a personal name element . Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements <unk> ( signifying the location of a <unk> , a type of pagan Germanic shrine ) , <unk> ( a structure used for religious purposes , see heathen <unk> ) , and <unk> ( a holy grove ) . The place name <unk> is recorded with particular frequency in Denmark ( and has direct cognates in Norse settlements in Ireland , such as Coill <unk> ) , whereas <unk> appears particularly often in southern Norway . <unk> ( Thor 's Island ) appears on the Swedish <unk> . Thor also appears in many placenames in Uppland . 
 In English placenames , Old English Thunor ( in contrast with the Old Norse form of the name , later introduced to the Danelaw ) left comparatively few traces . Examples include Thundersley , from * <unk> <unk> and <unk> ( Old English " Thunor 's pillar " ) . F. M. Stenton noted that such placenames were apparently restricted to Saxon and Jutish territory and not found in Anglian areas . 
 In what is now Germany , locations named after Thor are sparsely recorded , but an amount of locations called <unk> ( German " Donner 's mountain " ) may derive their name from the deity Donner , the southern Germanic form of the god 's name . 
 In as late as the 19th century in Iceland , a specific breed of fox was known as <unk> ( " Thor of the holt " ) , likely due to the red coat of the breed . In Sweden in the 19th century , smooth , wedge @-@ shaped stones found in the earth were called <unk> ( " Thor 's wedges " ) , according to a folk belief that they were once hurled at a troll by the god Thor . ( Compare <unk> . ) Similarly , meteorites may be considered memorials to Thor in folk tradition due to their sheer weight . On the Swedish island of Gotland , a species of beetle ( <unk> <unk> ) was named after the god ; the <unk> . When the beetle is found turned upside down and one flips it over , Thor 's favor may be gained . In other regions of Sweden the name of the beetle appears to have been demonized with Christianization , where the insect came to be known as <unk> or <unk> ( both meaning " Thor @-@ devil " ) . 
 = = Origin , theories , and interpretations = = 
 Thor closely resembles other Indo @-@ European deities associated with the thunder : the Celtic Taranis , the Baltic <unk> , the Slavic Perun , and particularly the Hindu Indra , whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the vajra are obvious parallels . Scholars have compared Indra 's slaying of <unk> with Thor 's battle with Jörmungandr . Although in the past it was suggested that Thor was an indigenous sky god or a Viking Age import into Scandinavia , these Indo @-@ European parallels make him generally accepted today as ultimately derived from a Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European deity . 
 In Georges Dumézil 's trifunctional hypothesis of Indo @-@ European religion , Thor represents the second function , that of strength . Dumézil notes that as a result of displacements , he does not lead armies ; most of the functions of Indra have been in effect taken over by Odin . Many scholars have noted the association of Thor with fertility , particularly in later folklore and in the reflex of him represented by the Sami Hora <unk> ( " Good @-@ man Thor " ) . For Dumézil , this is the preservation by peasants of only the side @-@ effect of the god 's atmospheric battles : the fertilizing rain . Others have emphasized Thor 's close connection to humanity , in all its concerns . Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson summarizes : 
 The cult of Thor was linked up with men 's habitation and possessions , and with well @-@ being of the family and community . This included the fruitfulness of the fields , and Thor , although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths , was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round . In our own times , little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring . Thor 's marriage with Sif of the golden hair , about which we hear little in the myths , seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess , when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile . In this way Thor , as well as Odin , may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age .

 In modern times , Thor continues to be referenced in popular culture . Starting with F. J. Klopstock 's 1776 ode to Thor , Wir und Sie , Thor has been the subject of various poems , including Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger 's 1807 epic poem Thors <unk> til Jotunheim and , by the same author , three more poems ( <unk> <unk> , Thors <unk> , and Thor <unk> Hymir ) collected in his 1819 Nordens Guder ; Thors Trunk ( 1859 ) by Wilhelm Hertz ; the 1820 satirical poem <unk> eller <unk> by J.

 Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius ( 1779 – 1848 ) discovered a chemical element that he named after Thor – thorium . 
 In 1962 , American comic book writer Stan Lee and his brother Larry Lieber , together with Jack Kirby , created the Marvel Comics superhero Thor , which they based on the god of the same name . Portrayed by Australian actor Chris Hemsworth , this character stars in the Marvel Studios films Thor ( 2011 ) , The Avengers ( 2012 ) , Thor : The Dark World ( 2013 ) and Avengers : Age of Ultron ( 2015 ) and the upcoming Thor : Ragnarok ( 2017 ) .

It and its sister species , the hero shrew ( <unk> <unk> ) , are the only mammal species known to have interlocking vertebrae . The team named the shrew after Thor due to the god 's association with strength .

 = Action of 18 November 1809 = 
 The Action of 18 November 1809 was the most significant engagement of a six @-@ month cruise by a French frigate squadron in the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars . The French commander , Commodore Jacques Hamelin , raided across the Bay of Bengal with his squadron and achieved local superiority , capturing numerous merchant ships and minor warships . On 18 November 1809 , three ships of Hamelin 's squadron encountered a convoy of India @-@ bound East Indiamen , mainly carrying recruits for the Indian Army , then administered by the Honourable East India Company ( HEIC ) . 
 Despite spirited resistance from the largest British merchant ship , Windham , the failure of the other Indiamen to support their leader and the size and power of the French ships forced the British to withdraw : all the HEIC ships were subsequently captured by the larger , faster French warships . A month later , Hamelin 's raiding campaign skirted disaster when a winter hurricane on the voyage back to Île de France almost wrecked his flagship Vénus . Vénus only survived with the co @-@ operation of the British prisoners aboard , who brought the ship safely to port . Only two of the captured Indiamen were successfully brought to Ile de France : the same storm that nearly destroyed Vénus scattered the squadron and its prizes , allowing a patrolling British frigate to recapture Windham just a few miles from the French island . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the late autumn of 1808 , the French Navy despatched four large frigates to the East Indies . These ships , stationed on Île de France and Île Bonaparte , were ordered to attack and disrupt British trade routes from the Far East , in particular British India . This disruption was intended to have a negative financial effect on the British economy and force the Royal Navy to send ships into the Indian Ocean , expending valuable resources in doing so . The commander of this French force was Commodore Jacques Hamelin , a highly skilled officer who ordered his frigates to disperse in the Bay of Bengal to hunt British East Indiamen , large and well armed merchant ships that carried millions of pounds worth of goods between Britain and her Empire ever year . 
 During the late spring , the most active of the French frigates was Caroline , which intercepted a convoy of East Indiamen in the Action of 31 May 1809 . Due to a brief but determined resistance by the larger vessels , one of the East Indiamen was able to escape , but two others were captured and brought to Île Bonaparte . During the spring of 1809 , the Royal Navy in the region , represented by Admiral Albemarle Bertie at the Cape of Good Hope , had also been active . Bertie had gathered a squadron of available ships which he ordered to blockade the French Indian Ocean islands and probe them for weaknesses that would assist future invasion attempts . The force was led by Commodore Josias Rowley in HMS Raisonnable and mainly consisted of frigates , in roughly equivalent numbers to the French force under Hamelin . Rowley 's first significant operation was the successful Raid on Saint Paul on 21 September 1809 . 
 = = Hamelin 's cruise = = 
 In July 1809 , Hamelin had departed Île de France for the Bay of Bengal in Vénus , accompanied by the corvette Créole and the frigate Manche . The frigates were both armed with at least 40 cannon each and the corvette 14 . All three ships were crewed by a full complement of experienced sailors drawn from the pool of unemployed men stranded in Île de France by the British blockade . This force was followed a month later by the similarly sized frigate Bellone . Hamelin 's early cruises were successful : operating initially off the Nicobar Islands , Vénus captured the HEIC armed ship Orient on 26 July . After this however , targets became scarcer and despite the capture of a number of small merchant vessels , Hamelin was forced to take his squadron further east and south to find British shipping to attack . On 10 October , he raided the small trading port of <unk> on Sumatra , captured its British population and razed the town . 
 At 06 : 00 on 18 November 1809 , with the sailing season almost at an end , Hamelin finally encountered a sizable target . Cruising in Vénus , accompanied by Manche and Créole , Hamelin sighted and chased a northwards @-@ bound convoy of East Indiamen . These three ships were the Windham , Charlton and United Kingdom , under the command of Captain John Stewart on Windham . Stewart 's ships had departed Britain months earlier , destined for Calcutta to receive cargoes for Britain . Their main cargo on this voyage were over 200 passengers , primarily soldiers enlisted in the army of the HEIC . All three vessels weighed approximately 800 tons and carried between 20 and 30 cannon each , but were not warships : their crews were not trained to military standards and their guns were not as powerful as those typically carried on military vessels . In addition , a large proportion of the crew were lascars , who were not considered reliable in combat . Stewart however had been warned of Hamelin 's presence by the sloop HMS Rattlesnake a week earlier and had been rehearsing Windham 's gunnery in case he should meet the French squadron . Ship for ship , the East Indiamen were outclassed by the French frigates , which were faster , stronger , more powerful and better armed and manned . In convoy however the British were still a formidable target : only four years earlier , at the Battle of Pulo Aura , a convoy of East Indiamen had defeated and pursued a more powerful French squadron under Admiral Linois in similar waters . 
 = = Engagement = = 
 The French squadron had become disorganised in its initial pursuit the British , with Manche , under Captain Jean Dornal de Guy , falling substantially to leeward of the flagship . Seeing this , Stewart realised that the best hope his convoy had of survival was to unite and attack Manche together . The combined batteries of the East Indiamen could be deployed en masse , hopefully inflicting enough damage to drive Manche away and discourage Hamelin in Vénus from attacking alone . Signalling his intentions to the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom , Stewart turned towards Vénus and bore down on her . Hamelin , realising the threat his scattered squadron faced , signalled for his ships to join up . With the wind against him however , it was obvious that Windham would reach Manche first . 
 By 08 : 00 , it was clear that despite his vessels speed , Stewart 's plan was going to fail : the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even attempted to join his advance , deliberately checking their advance towards the French , falling far behind Windham . Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds , he had no option but to continue the attack : his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate . Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09 : 30 , his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached . Stewart did not return fire , instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery . Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly , Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was as close as he was able before unleashing his guns . The results were disappointing : the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship . The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range , and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour , Stewart still unsupported by his companions , who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range . 
 At 12 : 00 , Dornal de Guy on Manche pulled away from her battered opponent , obeying Hamelin 's order to join with his flagship . Hamelin then sent Manche and Créole after the slow Charlton and United Kingdom , using Vénus to chase Windham . Stewart had used the break in the action to effect rudimentary repairs to his battered ship and , with the agreement of his officers , determined to abandon the other ships and escape alone . Manche and the corvette rapidly overhauled and captured Charlton and United Kingdom , their captains Charles Mortlock and William D 'Esterre making no serious attempt to resist or escape . Vénus however became embroiled in a lengthy chase as Stewart threw all not essential stores overboard in an effort to make his ship lighter and faster . For five days , Windham led Vénus in pursuit across the Bay of Bengal and it was not until 10 : 30 on 22 November that Hamelin finally closed with the British ship and forced her surrender . 
 = = Return to Île de France = = 
 Bellone , under Captain Guy @-@ Victor Duperré , had been sailing independently of Hamelin 's squadron and had also had a successful cruise , capturing the small British warship HMS Victor on 2 November and the 48 @-@ gun Portuguese frigate Minerve on 22 November in the northern Bay of Bengal , before sailing back to Île de France . To the south , Hamelin and Dornal de Guy reunited with their prizes on 6 December and also determined to return to Île de France as the cyclone season , in which any ship in the Indian Ocean would be at serious risk of destruction by a sudden tropical cyclone , was fast approaching . This was a dangerous time to be at sea : the year before seven large East Indiamen had sunk with a thousand lives in two major hurricanes and the year before that , the flagship of Sir Thomas Troubridge , HMS Blenheim had disappeared without a trace in similar circumstances , 
 On 19 December , the first winter storm struck the French squadron . In the heavy waves and high winds , first Windham and then Vénus were separated from the convoy , Manche marshalling the remaining ships and continuing the southwards journey . Windham 's French prize crew were able to regain control of their ship and continued on to Île de France alone , but Vénus was struck by an even larger hurricane on 27 December and lost all three topmasts in the gale . The French crew panicked as the storm began , and refused to attend to the sails or even close the hatches : as a result the vessel almost founded as huge amounts of water poured into the ship . In desperation , Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate . Stewart refused to give any such guarantee but agreed to help repair the damage and bring the ship to safety . After securing the weapons lockers aboard , Hamelin agreed and Stewart and his men cut away the wrecked masts and pumped the water out of the hold , repairing the ship so that she was able to continue her journey without fear of foundering . 
 On 31 December , the battered Vénus docked in Rivière Noire and Stewart and his men , who had never had an opportunity to seize their freedom , were marched to Port Louis , where they witnessed the arrival of Manche , accompanied by Créole , Charlton and United Kingdom on 1 January 1810 . For their services , Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good Hope . There they discovered Windham , which had failed to arrive at Île de France . Although her prize crew had retained control of the ship following the storm , they had been sighted , chased and seized within sight of Île de France on 29 December by the newly arrived British frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Lucius Curtis . Bellone and her prizes arrived at Port Louis on 2 January , having slipped past Rowley 's blockade during a period of calm weather . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Casualties in the battle were minimal , the British losing four killed and two wounded while the French recorded no casualties at all . The significance of the action lies in the ease with which French frigates operating from Île de France were able to attack and capture vital trade convoys without facing serious opposition . The action of 18 November was the second occasion in 1809 in which a British East India convoy was destroyed and another would be lost at the Action of 3 July 1810 the following year . These losses were exceptionally heavy , especially when combined with the 12 East Indiamen wrecked during 1809 , and would eventually provoke the massive buildup of British forces in late 1810 . Despite the French success Vénus was never again able to operate independently in this manner . Hamelin was needed during 1810 to operate against the strong British frigate squadrons that returned in the spring to harass his cruisers and prepare for the planned invasions of Île Bonaparte and Île de France using the soldiers stationed on Rodriguez . The French commodore was ultimately unable to prevent these operations and was eventually captured in the Action of 18 September 1810 , a personal engagement with Rowley on HMS Boadicea . 
 = 2009 American League Central tie @-@ breaker game = 
 The 2009 American League Central tie @-@ breaker game was a one @-@ game extension to Major League Baseball 's ( MLB ) 2009 regular season , played between the Detroit Tigers and Minnesota Twins to determine the champion of the American League 's ( AL ) Central Division . It was played at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis , Minnesota , on October 6 , 2009 . The Twins won the game 6 – 5 in extra innings and advanced to the 2009 AL Division Series where they were swept by the New York Yankees ; the Tigers failed to qualify for the postseason . 
 A tie @-@ breaker was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win – loss records of 86 – 76 . The Twins , who had won the regular season series against the Tigers , 11 games to 7 , were thus awarded home field due to a rules change prior to the 2009 season . It was the third tie @-@ breaker played in MLB from 2007 – 2009 . It was also the second consecutive tiebreaker for the AL Central title after 2008 , when the Chicago White Sox defeated the Twins to win the division . In baseball statistics tie @-@ breakers are counted as the 163rd regular season game played by both teams and all events in the game are added to regular season statistics . This was the Twins ' final regular season game at the Metrodome as the team moved to Target Field for the 2010 season . The tie @-@ breaker was later named the Best Regular @-@ Season Game of the Decade by Sports Illustrated . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Tigers led the AL Central for periods at the start of the season in April , ultimately tying for the lead on May 10 and taking the lead outright on May 16 . The Tigers held at least a share of the divisional lead from then onwards , holding their largest lead of 7 games on September 6 . Although the Tigers went 16 – 12 in September , their second @-@ best month by winning percentage in 2009 , they won just 1 of 4 games in October . The Twins went 16 – 11 and 4 – 0 , respectively , over this same stretch to tie the Tigers for the divisional lead after the 162 @-@ game regular season . More broadly , the Tigers were 48 – 39 over the first half of the season while the Twins were 45 – 44 but the Twins came back in the second half going 41 – 32 leading up to the tie @-@ breaker while the Tigers went 38 – 37 over the same span . The Twins won 11 of the two team 's 18 match @-@ ups that season prior to the tie @-@ breaker . 
 This late season competition for the AL Central title included a 4 @-@ game series between the two teams from September 29 to October 2 . The series , played at the Tigers ' home field Comerica Park , started with a day @-@ night doubleheader caused by a rainout the night before when the series was scheduled to start . The final game of the series featured moments of contention between the two teams . In the third inning , Nate Robertson hit Denard Span . Minnesota starter Scott Baker hit Marcus Thames with a pitch the next inning . Thames responded by sliding hard into second base to break up a potential double play that inning . Twins ' reliever Jose Mijares then threw behind the Tigers ' Adam Everett in the eighth inning . Umpire Angel Hernandez warned Mijares and the Tigers bench , Tigers ' manager Jim Leyland argued with Hernandez , and he was ejected . Despite the warning Minnesota 's Delmon Young was hit in the knee with the first pitch in the ninth inning by Jeremy Bonderman . Bonderman was immediately ejected as was Tigers ' catcher Gerald Laird who argued with Hernandez and the benches cleared , though there was no brawl . Bonderman was suspended for three games , and Tigers ' hitting coach Lloyd McClendon — who had been acting as manager following Leyland 's ejection — was suspended for a game . McClendon , Leyland , and Laird were all fined . 
 Ultimately , the four @-@ game series was split with two wins for each team , and the Tigers maintained a two @-@ game lead with only three games remaining for each club . The Tigers lost two of their next three games to the Chicago White Sox , whereas the Twins swept the Kansas City Royals in a three @-@ game set leaving both teams tied with an 86 – 76 record . A one @-@ game playoff would decide the winner of the Central division while the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention . Prior to the 2009 season , home field advantage in a tiebreaker game was decided by a series of coin tosses held towards the end of the regular season that would decide the home teams of all possible one @-@ game playoffs . A rule change following the 2008 season altered this process , leaving the site determined on a series of performance @-@ based criteria beginning with the head @-@ to @-@ head record between the two teams that were tied . Therefore , the Twins took home @-@ field advantage in this game , by virtue of winning the season series against the Tigers 11 – 7 . The game was the third MLB tie @-@ breaker in three seasons , a record number for the league . 
 While October 5 had been the original scheduled date for a potential tiebreaker game , a conflict with a Monday Night Football game between the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings being played at the Metrodome that night led to the baseball game being moved to the following day .

 Box score for Tuesday , October 6 , 2009 — 4 : 08 p.m. ( CT ) at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis , Minnesota 
 The game was scoreless through the first two innings . Detroit took a three @-@ run lead in the third inning which started when Curtis Granderson walked , advanced on a ground out , and scored on a single by Magglio Ordóñez to center field . Ordóñez was then brought home via a two @-@ run home run by Tigers ' first baseman Miguel Cabrera . The Twins responded in the bottom of the inning , with Matt Tolbert singling to lead off the inning , advancing to second base on a single by Denard Span , and then moving to third on a flyball out . Tigers ' starter Rick Porcello attempted a pickoff throw to first which hit the baserunner Span and went past the first baseman Cabrera . Span was out but Tolbert was able to score on Porcello 's throwing error . 
 The score remained 3 – 1 until the bottom of the 6th inning . Porcello got the first two batters of the inning out but then allowed a solo home run to Jason Kubel to bring the game within one run . Porcello then walked the next batter , Michael Cuddyer , and was relieved by Zach Miner . The Twins loaded the bases against Miner , but did not score again in the inning . Scott Baker , the Twins ' starter , walked the first batter of the 7th and was relieved by Jon Rauch though no runs scored . The Twins took a 4 – 3 lead in the bottom of the 7th with a leadoff single by Nick Punto and a two @-@ run home run by Orlando Cabrera . The Tigers responded , tying the game at 4 with a home run by Ordóñez in the top of the 8th off of Matt Guerrier . Guerrier allowed another two walks in the inning and was relieved by closer Joe Nathan who escaped the inning with no further scoring . 
 Nathan remained in the game , holding the Tigers scoreless in the 9th , while Tigers ' closer Fernando Rodney did the same to Minnesota to force extra innings . Jesse Crain replaced Nathan in the top of the 10th and hit Aubrey Huff who was pinch hitting for Wilkin Ramirez . Don Kelly then pinch ran for Huff , and scored on a double by Brandon Inge to give the Tigers a 5 – 4 lead . The Tigers inserted Clete Thomas for Ordóñez in right field as a defensive replacement in the bottom of the 10th . However the Twins <unk> the game at 5 – 5 as Cuddyer led off the inning with a triple and , following a Delmon Young groundout and a walk to Brendan Harris , scored on a single by Tolbert . Alexi Casilla pinch @-@ ran for Harris and advanced to third on Tolbert 's single . Nick Punto then hit a fly ball to left @-@ fielder Ryan <unk> . Casilla attempted to score on the play , but inadvertently inched off the base before the ball was caught , and had to return to the base before breaking for home . Catcher Gerald Laird successfully tagged out Casilla to complete the inning @-@ ending double play . 
 Both teams were held scoreless in the 11th . The Tigers threatened to score in the top of the 12th , with a walk by Cabrera and a single by Kelly with one out . Twins pitcher Bobby Keppel then intentionally walked <unk> to load the bases , hoping he could induce a double play . Then , Keppel threw a fastball close to batter Brandon Inge with his first pitch . Inge believed he was hit by the ball and should advance to first , which would force a go @-@ ahead run to score with the bases loaded , but home plate umpire Randy Marsh ruled the pitch did not hit Inge and allowed the at @-@ bat to continue . Tigers ' manager Jim Leyland would say later that " the replay kind of confirms that it did hit him , " but Marsh maintained that replays were " inconclusive . " Inge ultimately grounded into a force out at home and Laird would strikeout to close the top of the inning with no scoring . Carlos Gómez led off the bottom of the 12th with a single for the Twins and advanced to second on a ground @-@ out . With first base open , the Tigers intentionally walked Delmon Young to bring up Casilla . Casilla atoned for his earlier base @-@ running blunder by hitting a ground ball through the right side of the infield . The base hit allowed the speedy Gomez to score from second without a play , thus giving the Twins a 6 – 5 walk @-@ off victory .

 The tie @-@ breaker win clinched the American League Central for the Twins and earned them a spot in the 2009 AL Division Series ( ALDS ) against the New York Yankees . They were swept , losing the ALDS in three games . The Tigers became the first team in MLB history to have a three @-@ game division lead with four games remaining and lose the division . MLB tie @-@ breaker games count as regular season games and this game affected certain statistical races for the 2009 season . For example , Jason Beck of MLB.com noted that if the umpire agreed with Brandon Inge on the contentious 12th inning call Inge would have tied for the most hit by a pitch in the American League . Twins ' catcher Joe Mauer won the 2009 American League batting title , and his final batting average for the season moved from .364 to .365 in the game . 
 The game was later chosen by Sports Illustrated as the Best Regular @-@ Season Game of the Decade . 
 = Juggernaut ( wrestler ) = 
 Craig Renney ( born December 9 , 1975 ) is a Canadian professional wrestler best known by his ring name , Juggernaut . He has competed for several North American independent promotions and has competed in several wrestling tours in Asia . He also had a brief stint in World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) in 2000 . 
 Juggernaut is known both for his brawling and aerial abilities as well as his martial arts skills . He has competed against some of the most famous wrestlers in the business . His greatest success came in ECCW , where he had a long rivalry with Kurrgan and won the NWA / ECCW Heavyweight Championship on six occasions . Juggernaut announced his retirement in 2007 , as he wanted to quit wrestling while he was still healthy .

 Renney grew up in Cranbrook , British Columbia and became interested in wrestling at age seven while watching a televised match between Bruno Sammartino and Gorilla Monsoon . He gained combat sport experience by earning black belts in both judo and jujutsu , and he moved to Edmonton , Alberta to train as a wrestler . He made his debut in Edmonton and wrestled in several matches there before moving to Tampa , Florida . Starting out , he wrestled for Independent Pro Wrestling , making $ 30 per match or less and sometimes competing in exchange for food and drinks . Juggernaut became known for his hardcore wrestling abilities , but he also impressed observers with his ability to perform a moonsault .

 The following year , he wrestled against Jimmy Snuka at the Washington State Fair in Vancouver , Washington . He continued to compete in various independent promotions , facing such veterans as Greg Valentine , Jim Neidhart , and The Bushwhackers . At an event in Montana , he worked in a booked loss to The Honky Tonk Man . Juggernaut began competing regularly with Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling in 1999 and formed a tag team with Biohazard known as Toxic Insanity .

Kurrgan beat Juggernaut for the title on February 25 , 2000 , but Juggernaut won it back two months later . He held the belt for a day before dropping it back to Kurrgan . When Kurrgan was stripped of the title for being unable to compete at a show in July , Juggernaut won the vacant championship by defeating Leatherface ( Rick Patterson ) .

 Tekken Tag Tournament 2 ( <unk> , Tekken <unk> <unk> 2 ) is the eighth main installment in the Tekken fighting game series , originally released in Japanese arcades on September 14 , 2011 . It received an update , subtitled Unlimited , on March 27 , 2012 . A console version based on the update was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012 , accompanied by an extensive promotional campaign . It was also ported to the Wii U as one of the system 's launch titles in November 2012 , subtitled Wii U Edition . 
 Like the original Tekken Tag Tournament ( 1999 ) , the game includes almost every character from past Tekken games , giving it the largest playable roster in a Tekken game to date . Players can choose either a team of two characters on each side or a solo character . Tekken Tag Tournament 2 has been positively received by critics , earning averaged review scores in the range of 82 @-@ 83 % at both GameRankings and Metacritic for the PlayStation 3 , Wii U and Xbox 360 versions , as well as several fighting game of the year awards . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 As in the original Tekken Tag Tournament , matches involve each player selecting two fighters to fight with . Players are able to switch their fighters out at any time , allowing the inactive character to gradually recover some life they might have lost . At certain points , an inactive character 's life bar may flash , giving them a temporary boost in strength if they are tagged in . If the life bar of either of a player 's fighters runs out , that player loses the round . If time runs out , the player who has the most cumulative life remaining amongst their fighters wins the round . 
 The gameplay expands on the tag mechanics featured in the first Tekken Tag , allowing for extended tag combos and combined moves . New techniques include combined tag throws which , if timed properly , can be escaped from . Tag combos ( referred to as " Tag Assaults " ) can now be done simultaneously with both characters participating in the combo at the same time . The game inherits gameplay features from Tekken 6 , such as " Bound " hits ( hits that slam an airborne opponent to the ground and stun them so combos can be extended ) and walled arenas , some of which featuring walls and floors that can be broken through during the fight . Character customization is also featured , similar to past Tekken games . 
 Features suggested by Katsuhiro Harada include recording in Practice mode as well as a Tutorial to bring new players into the fold more smoothly than has been possible in the past . The game features a " stage gimmick " system . An example of the system shown in Famitsu has the player slamming his opponent into wall , which breaks and the opponent goes flying , landing in a new area where the fight continues . As the opponent falls , the tag partner is waiting at the bottom to continue the combo . 
 The game features various modes , allowing players to choose between Tag Team ( 2 vs 2 ) , Single ( 1 vs 1 ) , or Handicap Matches ( 2 vs 1 or 1 vs 2 ) , options for four players to play in a single match , and various online modes . Along with returning modes such as Arcade , Versus , Team Battle , Time Attack and Survival , a new mode called Fight Lab allows players to train a Combot through various challenges . The game also features various items that can alter the gameplay , ranging from weapons such as firearms and hammer hats to superficial items such as specialized KOs , and allows players to customize their fighters with various accessories . 
 The Wii U Edition includes the return of the mini @-@ game Tekken Ball from Tekken 3 and an exclusive Mushroom Battle mode in which various mushrooms from the Mario series litter the arena , causing players to grow or shrink in size or take extra damage . It also features optional touch @-@ based controls using the system 's gamepad , as well as exclusive costumes based on Nintendo media franchise . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Unlike the original Tekken Tag Tournament , the game 's sequel features a storyline although it is still not the series canon . Just like last time , it is more of a " dream match " , giving fans the opportunity to play as almost every character in the series up to that point , including some of those that had apparently been missing in the main Tekken storyline , in addition to the character roster of Tekken 6 . In the story , Heihachi Mishima has developed a rejuvenation serum , which , as it name suggests , has the ability to regress his appearance and power . After consuming it , Heihachi hosts another King of Iron Fist Tournament , sensing powerful challengers who would come to the tournament . 
 In " Fight Lab " section of the game , Lee <unk> , under the guise of Violet is working on a new version of Combot . As soon as Combot is complete , Violet begins its simulation test . After the simulation test , the Combot explodes and destroys the lab . Violet decides to use the other functioning Combot to complete the tests . After Combot completes five tests , Violet kidnaps Jin , Kazuya and Heihachi for Combot 's final test . Combot apparently has the upper hand , but Jin transforms into his Devil form and destroys it . Violet blows up the Combot , presumably taking the Mishima bloodline with it , and says , " Excellent ! " .

 The arcade version features all 41 playable characters from Tekken 6 ( including Panda except now with her own character slot ) along with Jun Kazama from Tekken 2 , True Ogre ( known in @-@ game as just " Ogre " ) from Tekken 3 and <unk> Mishima from Tekken 5 all with updated character designs . Devil Kazuya from the original Tekken also makes an appearance but as an in @-@ game transformation of Kazuya and Unknown from the original Tekken Tag Tournament also reappears as the unplayable final boss , though it became playable in the console version via an update patch . The game also introduces a masked character named Jaycee , an alter @-@ ego of Julia Chang . 
 The console release of the game features a total of 59 characters , including the return of Kunimitsu , Michelle Chang and Prototype Jack from the original Tekken , Angel and Alex from Tekken 2 , Tiger Jackson , Forest Law , Dr. Bosconovitch and Ancient Ogre ( originally known as just " Ogre " ) from Tekken 3 , as well as Tekken 4 's Miharu Hirano , Violet and Combot , the latter of which can be customized with various moves from other characters . A slim version of Bob from his Tekken 6 ending and Lili 's butler since Tekken 5 : Dark Resurrection , Sebastian make their debut as playable characters . 
 Unlike previous installments , certain characters who originally didn 't speak in their native language , now do . Characters include Lili and Sebastian who now speak French , Eddy and Christie speaking Portuguese , Dr. Bosconovitch speaking Russian , Leo speaking German and Miguel speaking Spanish .

There is also a Pair Play mode , which allows four players to fight simultaneously in pairs of two , much like the " Scramble Mode " in Street Fighter X Tekken . The Unlimited version features the Rage system from Tekken 6 for Solo mode characters , and the new tag partner Rage system from the original arcade version of Tag Tournament 2 for Tag mode characters only . Rage gives characters more damage per hit when their vitality is below a certain point . Once activated , a reddish energy aura appears around the character , and their health bar starts to flicker in red . The <unk> Power appears when an on @-@ screen character gets attacked a certain amount of times and the off @-@ screen character 's <unk> flashes . If the on @-@ screen character tags out while the off @-@ screen character 's <unk> is flashing , the tagged character becomes slightly stronger .

 Tekken Tag Tournament 2 has been met with a positive critical response , with aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic assigning the Wii U version 83 @.@ 15 % and 83 / 100 , Xbox 360 version 82 @.@ 93 % and 83 / 100 and PlayStation 3 version 82 @.@ 49 % and 82 / 100 .

 In Famitsu , the game scored a near @-@ perfect rating of 39 / 40 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions , which was the magazine 's highest score for a traditional fighting game since Dead or Alive 4 in 2005 . Joystiq applauded the game for including everything that makes Tekken good , stating " its surprisingly deep , accessible gameplay mechanics to its bombastic and hilarious attitude – all presented in a package more polished and refined than ever before . " GameSpot hailed this " well @-@ executed and punishing fighter " for its combat system , online play , the Fight Lab mode , and customizable soundtrack , but criticized the inadequate tutorial modes . According to Eurogamer , " It plays it a little safe in places and lacks a truly killer single @-@ player mode , but by broadening the versatility of the tag system while dramatically improving the online functionality , Namco has crafted a new teamwork seminar that builds upon the original in almost all the areas that matter . " IGN was more critical of the game that while approving the core gameplay and content , felt that the similar gameplay of its predecessors made it difficult for newcomers of the series . Game Informer noted that the game does not overhaul the franchise , but retains the series ' already solid gameplay , adding : " It offers a ton of fighters , the tag system is interesting , it plays well online , and it preserves the goofy sense of humor that defines the series . Even with a somewhat bare @-@ bones online offering , it ’ s still one of the most refined fighters on the market . " GameTrailers wrote : " Spinoff or not , this is the best Tekken game in years .

 = Banksia brownii = 
 Banksia brownii , commonly known as feather @-@ leaved banksia or Brown 's banksia , is a species of shrub that grows in southwest Western Australia . An attractive plant with fine feathery leaves and large red @-@ brown flower spikes , it usually grows as an upright bush around two metres ( 7 ft ) high , but can also occur as a small tree or a low spreading shrub . First collected in 1829 and published the following year , it is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia , section Oncostylis , series Spicigerae . There are two genetically distinct forms . 
 B. brownii occurs naturally only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range in southwest Western Australia . In the Stirling Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes ; further south it occurs among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient @-@ poor sand . It is rare and endangered in its natural habitat , with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback , a disease to which the species is highly susceptible . Other threats include loss of habitat , commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime . 
 Highly valued by Australia 's horticultural and cut flower industries , B. brownii is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback . It prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage , and must be provided with some moisture over summer . 
 = = Description = = 
 B. brownii usually grows as an upright bush between one and three metres ( 3 – 10 ft ) high , but it can also grow as an openly branched small tree to six metres ( 20 ft ) in sheltered gullies , or as a low , spreading shrub in exposed locations such as the peaks of the Stirling Range . The bark is a grey @-@ brown colour , smooth and thin , with lenticels . The leaves are long and thin , from three to ten centimetres ( 1 – 5 in ) long , and five to ten millimetres ( 3 ⁄ 16 – 3 ⁄ 8 in ) wide . Dark green and hairless above but with a hairy white underside , they are easily recognised by their feather @-@ like appearance , caused by the fact that they are finely divided almost back to the midrib , into as many as 70 thin tapered lobes . 
 Flowers occur in typical Banksia " flower spikes " , inflorescences made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis . B. brownii 's flower spike is a metallic red @-@ brown colour , roughly cylindrical , 6 to 19 centimetres ( 2 – 7 ½ in ) high and eight to ten centimetres ( 3 – 4 in ) wide . Each flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals , and one long wiry style . <unk> are cream at the base and grey @-@ brown at the end . Styles are rusty red @-@ brown with a cream tip , and <unk> hooked rather than straight . The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts , but breaks free at anthesis . 
 Flower spikes are held erect and are typically terminal on a branch ; often other branchlets grow up and around a spike from below . The fruiting structure is a stout woody " cone " , around five centimetres ( 2 inches ) in diameter , with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts . A " cone " may be embedded with up to 60 follicles , although usually there are very few or even none at all . Unusually for Banksia , each follicle contains just one seed . This is shiny black , oval in shape , about 20 millimetres ( ¾ in ) long , with a brown papery wing .
