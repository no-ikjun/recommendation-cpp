 Some forms of meningitis are preventable by immunization with the meningococcal , mumps , pneumococcal , and Hib vaccines . Giving antibiotics to people with significant exposure to certain types of meningitis may also be useful . The first treatment in acute meningitis consists of promptly giving antibiotics and sometimes antiviral drugs . Corticosteroids can also be used to prevent complications from excessive inflammation . Meningitis can lead to serious long @-@ term consequences such as deafness , epilepsy , hydrocephalus , or cognitive deficits , especially if not treated quickly . 
 In 2013 meningitis occurred in about 16 million people worldwide . This resulted in 303 @,@ 000 deaths – down from 464 @,@ 000 deaths in 1990 . With appropriate treatment the risk of death in bacterial meningitis is less than 15 % . Outbreaks of bacterial meningitis occur between December and June each year in an area of sub @-@ Saharan Africa known as the meningitis belt . Smaller outbreaks may also occur in other areas of the world . The word meningitis is from Greek <unk> <unk> , " membrane " and the medical suffix -itis , " inflammation " . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 = = = Clinical features = = = 
 In adults , the most common symptom of meningitis is a severe headache , occurring in almost 90 % of cases of bacterial meningitis , followed by nuchal rigidity ( the inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone and stiffness ) . The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of nuchal rigidity , sudden high fever , and altered mental status ; however , all three features are present in only 44 – 46 % of bacterial meningitis cases . If none of the three signs are present , acute meningitis is extremely unlikely . Other signs commonly associated with meningitis include photophobia ( intolerance to bright light ) and <unk> ( intolerance to loud noises ) . Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms , and may only be irritable and look unwell . The fontanelle ( the soft spot on the top of a baby 's head ) can bulge in infants aged up to 6 months . Other features that distinguish meningitis from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain , cold extremities , and an abnormal skin color . 
 <unk> rigidity occurs in 70 % of bacterial meningitis in adults . Other signs of meningism include the presence of positive Kernig 's sign or <unk> sign . Kernig 's sign is assessed with the person lying supine , with the hip and knee flexed to 90 degrees . In a person with a positive Kernig 's sign , pain limits passive extension of the knee . A positive <unk> 's sign occurs when flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip . Although Kernig 's sign and <unk> 's sign are both commonly used to screen for meningitis , the sensitivity of these tests is limited . They do , however , have very good specificity for meningitis : the signs rarely occur in other diseases . Another test , known as the " jolt accentuation maneuver " helps determine whether meningitis is present in those reporting fever and headache . A person is asked to rapidly rotate the head horizontally ; if this does not make the headache worse , meningitis is unlikely . 
 Meningitis caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis ( known as " meningococcal meningitis " ) can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a rapidly spreading petechial rash , which may precede other symptoms . The rash consists of numerous small , irregular purple or red spots ( " petechiae " ) on the trunk , lower extremities , mucous membranes , <unk> , and ( occasionally ) the palms of the hands or soles of the feet . The rash is typically non @-@ blanching ; the redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler . Although this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis , it is relatively specific for the disease ; it does , however , occasionally occur in meningitis due to other bacteria . Other clues on the cause of meningitis may be the skin signs of hand , foot and mouth disease and genital herpes , both of which are associated with various forms of viral meningitis . 
 = = = Early complications = = = 
 Additional problems may occur in the early stage of the illness . These may require specific treatment , and sometimes indicate severe illness or worse prognosis . The infection may trigger sepsis , a systemic inflammatory response syndrome of falling blood pressure , fast heart rate , high or abnormally low temperature , and rapid breathing . Very low blood pressure may occur at an early stage , especially but not exclusively in meningococcal meningitis ; this may lead to insufficient blood supply to other organs . Disseminated intravascular coagulation , the excessive activation of blood clotting , may obstruct blood flow to organs and paradoxically increase the bleeding risk . Gangrene of limbs can occur in meningococcal disease . Severe meningococcal and pneumococcal infections may result in hemorrhaging of the adrenal glands , leading to Waterhouse @-@ <unk> syndrome , which is often fatal . 
 The brain tissue may swell , pressure inside the skull may increase and the swollen brain may herniate through the skull base . This may be noticed by a decreasing level of consciousness , loss of the pupillary light reflex , and abnormal posturing . The inflammation of the brain tissue may also obstruct the normal flow of CSF around the brain ( hydrocephalus ) . Seizures may occur for various reasons ; in children , seizures are common in the early stages of meningitis ( in 30 % of cases ) and do not necessarily indicate an underlying cause . Seizures may result from increased pressure and from areas of inflammation in the brain tissue . Focal seizures ( seizures that involve one limb or part of the body ) , persistent seizures , late @-@ onset seizures and those that are difficult to control with medication indicate a poorer long @-@ term outcome . 
 Inflammation of the meninges may lead to abnormalities of the cranial nerves , a group of nerves arising from the brain stem that supply the head and neck area and which control , among other functions , eye movement , facial muscles , and hearing . Visual symptoms and hearing loss may persist after an episode of meningitis . Inflammation of the brain ( encephalitis ) or its blood vessels ( cerebral vasculitis ) , as well as the formation of blood clots in the veins ( cerebral venous thrombosis ) , may all lead to weakness , loss of sensation , or abnormal movement or function of the part of the body supplied by the affected area of the brain . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Meningitis is typically caused by an infection with microorganisms . Most infections are due to viruses , with bacteria , fungi , and protozoa being the next most common causes . It may also result from various non @-@ infectious causes . The term aseptic meningitis refers to cases of meningitis in which no bacterial infection can be demonstrated . This type of meningitis is usually caused by viruses but it may be due to bacterial infection that has already been partially treated , when bacteria disappear from the meninges , or pathogens infect a space adjacent to the meninges ( e.g. sinusitis ) . <unk> ( an infection of the heart valves which spreads small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream ) may cause aseptic meningitis . <unk> meningitis may also result from infection with spirochetes , a type of bacteria that includes Treponema pallidum ( the cause of syphilis ) and Borrelia burgdorferi ( known for causing Lyme disease ) . Meningitis may be encountered in cerebral malaria ( malaria infecting the brain ) or amoebic meningitis , meningitis due to infection with amoebae such as <unk> fowleri , contracted from freshwater sources . 
 = = = Bacterial = = = 
 The types of bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis vary according to the infected individual 's age group . 
 In premature babies and newborns up to three months old , common causes are group B streptococci ( subtypes III which normally inhabit the vagina and are mainly a cause during the first week of life ) and bacteria that normally inhabit the digestive tract such as Escherichia coli ( carrying the K1 antigen ) . Listeria monocytogenes ( serotype IVb ) is transmitted by the mother before birth and may cause meningitis in the newborn . 
 Older children are more commonly affected by Neisseria meningitidis ( meningococcus ) and Streptococcus pneumoniae ( serotypes 6 , 9 , 14 , 18 and 23 ) and those under five by Haemophilus influenzae type B ( in countries that do not offer vaccination ) . 
 In adults , Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae together cause 80 % of bacterial meningitis cases . Risk of infection with Listeria monocytogenes is increased in persons over 50 years old . The introduction of pneumococcal vaccine has lowered rates of pneumococcal meningitis in both children and adults . 
 Recent skull trauma potentially allows nasal cavity bacteria to enter the meningeal space . Similarly , devices in the brain and meninges , such as cerebral shunts , <unk> drains or <unk> reservoirs , carry an increased risk of meningitis . In these cases , the persons are more likely to be infected with <unk> , Pseudomonas , and other Gram @-@ negative bacteria . These pathogens are also associated with meningitis in people with an impaired immune system . An infection in the head and neck area , such as otitis media or <unk> , can lead to meningitis in a small proportion of people . Recipients of cochlear implants for hearing loss are more at risk for pneumococcal meningitis . 
 Tuberculous meningitis , which is meningitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , is more common in people from countries in which tuberculosis is endemic , but is also encountered in persons with immune problems , such as AIDS . 
 Recurrent bacterial meningitis may be caused by persisting anatomical defects , either congenital or acquired , or by disorders of the immune system . Anatomical defects allow continuity between the external environment and the nervous system . The most common cause of recurrent meningitis is a skull fracture , particularly fractures that affect the base of the skull or extend towards the sinuses and <unk> pyramids . Approximately 59 % of recurrent meningitis cases are due to such anatomical abnormalities , 36 % are due to immune deficiencies ( such as complement deficiency , which predisposes especially to recurrent meningococcal meningitis ) , and 5 % are due to ongoing infections in areas adjacent to the meninges . 
 = = = Viral = = = 
 Viruses that cause meningitis include enteroviruses , herpes simplex virus ( generally type 2 , which produces most genital sores ; less commonly type 1 ) , varicella zoster virus ( known for causing chickenpox and shingles ) , mumps virus , HIV , and <unk> . <unk> 's meningitis is a chronic recurrent form of herpes meningitis ; it is thought to be caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 . 
 = = = Fungal = = = 
 There are a number of risk factors for fungal meningitis , including the use of immunosuppressants ( such as after organ transplantation ) , HIV / AIDS , and the loss of immunity associated with aging . It is uncommon in those with a normal immune system but has occurred with medication contamination . Symptom onset is typically more gradual , with headaches and fever being present for at least a couple of weeks before diagnosis . The most common fungal meningitis is cryptococcal meningitis due to Cryptococcus neoformans . In Africa , cryptococcal meningitis is now the most common cause of meningitis in multiple studies , and it accounts for 20 – 25 % of AIDS @-@ related deaths in Africa . Other less common fungal pathogens which can cause meningitis include : <unk> immitis , Histoplasma capsulatum , <unk> <unk> , and Candida species . 
 = = = Parasitic = = = 
 A parasitic cause is often assumed when there is a predominance of eosinophils ( a type of white blood cell ) in the CSF . The most common parasites implicated are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Schistosoma , as well as the conditions <unk> , toxocariasis , <unk> , <unk> , and a number of rarer infections and <unk> conditions . 
 = = = Non @-@ infectious = = = 
 Meningitis may occur as the result of several non @-@ infectious causes : spread of cancer to the meninges ( malignant or neoplastic meningitis ) and certain drugs ( mainly non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs , antibiotics and intravenous immunoglobulins ) . It may also be caused by several inflammatory conditions , such as sarcoidosis ( which is then called <unk> ) , connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus , and certain forms of vasculitis ( inflammatory conditions of the blood vessel wall ) , such as Behçet 's disease . <unk> cysts and <unk> cysts may cause meningitis by releasing irritant matter into the subarachnoid space . Rarely , migraine may cause meningitis , but this diagnosis is usually only made when other causes have been eliminated . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 The meninges comprise three membranes that , together with the cerebrospinal fluid , enclose and protect the brain and spinal cord ( the central nervous system ) . The pia mater is a very delicate impermeable membrane that firmly adheres to the surface of the brain , following all the minor contours . The arachnoid mater ( so named because of its spider @-@ web @-@ like appearance ) is a loosely fitting sac on top of the pia mater . The subarachnoid space separates the arachnoid and pia mater membranes and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid . The outermost membrane , the dura mater , is a thick durable membrane , which is attached to both the arachnoid membrane and the skull . 
 In bacterial meningitis , bacteria reach the meninges by one of two main routes : through the bloodstream or through direct contact between the meninges and either the nasal cavity or the skin . In most cases , meningitis follows invasion of the bloodstream by organisms that live upon mucous surfaces such as the nasal cavity . This is often in turn preceded by viral infections , which break down the normal barrier provided by the mucous surfaces . Once bacteria have entered the bloodstream , they enter the subarachnoid space in places where the blood – brain barrier is vulnerable — such as the choroid plexus . Meningitis occurs in 25 % of newborns with bloodstream infections due to group B streptococci ; this phenomenon is less common in adults . Direct contamination of the cerebrospinal fluid may arise from indwelling devices , skull fractures , or infections of the nasopharynx or the nasal sinuses that have formed a tract with the subarachnoid space ( see above ) ; occasionally , congenital defects of the dura mater can be identified . 
 The large @-@ scale inflammation that occurs in the subarachnoid space during meningitis is not a direct result of bacterial infection but can rather largely be attributed to the response of the immune system to the entry of bacteria into the central nervous system . When components of the bacterial cell membrane are identified by the immune cells of the brain ( astrocytes and microglia ) , they respond by releasing large amounts of cytokines , hormone @-@ like mediators that recruit other immune cells and stimulate other tissues to participate in an immune response . The blood – brain barrier becomes more permeable , leading to " <unk> " cerebral edema ( swelling of the brain due to fluid leakage from blood vessels ) . Large numbers of white blood cells enter the CSF , causing inflammation of the meninges and leading to " interstitial " edema ( swelling due to fluid between the cells ) . In addition , the walls of the blood vessels themselves become inflamed ( cerebral vasculitis ) , which leads to decreased blood flow and a third type of edema , " cytotoxic " edema . The three forms of cerebral edema all lead to increased intracranial pressure ; together with the lowered blood pressure often encountered in acute infection , this means that it is harder for blood to enter the brain , consequently brain cells are deprived of oxygen and undergo apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) . 
 It is recognized that administration of antibiotics may initially worsen the process outlined above , by increasing the amount of bacterial cell membrane products released through the destruction of bacteria . Particular treatments , such as the use of corticosteroids , are aimed at dampening the immune system 's response to this phenomenon . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 = = = Blood tests and imaging = = = 
 In someone suspected of having meningitis , blood tests are performed for markers of inflammation ( e.g. C @-@ reactive protein , complete blood count ) , as well as blood cultures . 
 The most important test in identifying or ruling out meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid through lumbar puncture ( LP , spinal tap ) . However , lumbar puncture is contraindicated if there is a mass in the brain ( tumor or abscess ) or the intracranial pressure ( ICP ) is elevated , as it may lead to brain herniation . If someone is at risk for either a mass or raised ICP ( recent head injury , a known immune system problem , localizing neurological signs , or evidence on examination of a raised ICP ) , a CT or MRI scan is recommended prior to the lumbar puncture . This applies in 45 % of all adult cases . If a CT or MRI is required before LP , or if LP proves difficult , professional guidelines suggest that antibiotics should be administered first to prevent delay in treatment , especially if this may be longer than 30 minutes . Often , CT or MRI scans are performed at a later stage to assess for complications of meningitis . 
 In severe forms of meningitis , monitoring of blood electrolytes may be important ; for example , hyponatremia is common in bacterial meningitis , due to a combination of factors , including dehydration , the inappropriate secretion of the antidiuretic hormone ( <unk> ) , or overly aggressive intravenous fluid administration . 
 = = = Lumbar puncture = = = 
 A lumbar puncture is done by positioning the person , usually lying on the side , applying local anesthetic , and inserting a needle into the dural sac ( a sac around the spinal cord ) to collect cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . When this has been achieved , the " opening pressure " of the CSF is measured using a manometer . The pressure is normally between 6 and 18 cm water ( cmH2O ) ; in bacterial meningitis the pressure is usually elevated . In cryptococcal meningitis , intracranial pressure is markedly elevated . The initial appearance of the fluid may prove an indication of the nature of the infection : cloudy CSF indicates higher levels of protein , white and red blood cells and / or bacteria , and therefore may suggest bacterial meningitis . 
 The CSF sample is examined for presence and types of white blood cells , red blood cells , protein content and glucose level . Gram staining of the sample may demonstrate bacteria in bacterial meningitis , but absence of bacteria does not exclude bacterial meningitis as they are only seen in 60 % of cases ; this figure is reduced by a further 20 % if antibiotics were administered before the sample was taken . Gram staining is also less reliable in particular infections such as listeriosis . Microbiological culture of the sample is more sensitive ( it identifies the organism in 70 – 85 % of cases ) but results can take up to 48 hours to become available . The type of white blood cell predominantly present ( see table ) indicates whether meningitis is bacterial ( usually neutrophil @-@ predominant ) or viral ( usually lymphocyte @-@ predominant ) , although at the beginning of the disease this is not always a reliable indicator . Less commonly , eosinophils predominate , suggesting parasitic or fungal etiology , among others . 
 The concentration of glucose in CSF is normally above 40 % of that in blood . In bacterial meningitis it is typically lower ; the CSF glucose level is therefore divided by the blood glucose ( CSF glucose to serum glucose ratio ) . A ratio ≤ 0 @.@ 4 is indicative of bacterial meningitis ; in the newborn , glucose levels in CSF are normally higher , and a ratio below 0 @.@ 6 ( 60 % ) is therefore considered abnormal . High levels of lactate in CSF indicate a higher likelihood of bacterial meningitis , as does a higher white blood cell count . If lactate levels are less than 35 mg / dl and the person has not previously received antibiotics then this may rule out bacterial meningitis . 
 Various other specialized tests may be used to distinguish between different types of meningitis . A latex agglutination test may be positive in meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitidis , Haemophilus influenzae , Escherichia coli and group B streptococci ; its routine use is not encouraged as it rarely leads to changes in treatment , but it may be used if other tests are not diagnostic . Similarly , the <unk> lysate test may be positive in meningitis caused by Gram @-@ negative bacteria , but it is of limited use unless other tests have been unhelpful . <unk> chain reaction ( PCR ) is a technique used to amplify small traces of bacterial DNA in order to detect the presence of bacterial or viral DNA in cerebrospinal fluid ; it is a highly sensitive and specific test since only trace amounts of the infecting agent 's DNA is required . It may identify bacteria in bacterial meningitis and may assist in distinguishing the various causes of viral meningitis ( enterovirus , herpes simplex virus 2 and mumps in those not vaccinated for this ) . Serology ( identification of antibodies to viruses ) may be useful in viral meningitis . If tuberculous meningitis is suspected , the sample is processed for Ziehl @-@ Neelsen stain , which has a low sensitivity , and tuberculosis culture , which takes a long time to process ; PCR is being used increasingly . Diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis can be made at low cost using an India ink stain of the CSF ; however , testing for cryptococcal antigen in blood or CSF is more sensitive , particularly in people with AIDS . 
 A diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty is " partially treated meningitis " , where there are meningitis symptoms after receiving antibiotics ( such as for presumptive sinusitis ) . When this happens , CSF findings may resemble those of viral meningitis , but antibiotic treatment may need to be continued until there is definitive positive evidence of a viral cause ( e.g. a positive enterovirus PCR ) . 
 = = = Postmortem = = = 
 Meningitis can be diagnosed after death has occurred . The findings from a post mortem are usually a widespread inflammation of the pia mater and arachnoid layers of the meninges . Neutrophil granulocytes tend to have migrated to the cerebrospinal fluid and the base of the brain , along with cranial nerves and the spinal cord , may be surrounded with pus — as may the meningeal vessels . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 For some causes of meningitis , protection can be provided in the long term through vaccination , or in the short term with antibiotics . Some behavioral measures may also be effective . 
 = = = Behavioral = = = 
 Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious ; however , neither is as contagious as the common cold or flu . Both can be transmitted through droplets of respiratory secretions during close contact such as kissing , sneezing or coughing on someone , but cannot be spread by only breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been . Viral meningitis is typically caused by enteroviruses , and is most commonly spread through fecal contamination . The risk of infection can be decreased by changing the behavior that led to transmission . 
 = = = Vaccination = = = 
 Since the 1980s , many countries have included immunization against Haemophilus influenzae type B in their routine childhood vaccination schemes . This has practically eliminated this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in young children in those countries . In the countries in which the disease burden is highest , however , the vaccine is still too expensive . Similarly , immunization against mumps has led to a sharp fall in the number of cases of mumps meningitis , which prior to vaccination occurred in 15 % of all cases of mumps . 
 <unk> vaccines exist against groups A , B , C , <unk> and Y. In countries where the vaccine for meningococcus group C was introduced , cases caused by this pathogen have decreased substantially . A <unk> vaccine now exists , which combines all four vaccines . Immunization with the <unk> vaccine against four strains is now a visa requirement for taking part in Hajj . Development of a vaccine against group B meningococci has proved much more difficult , as its surface proteins ( which would normally be used to make a vaccine ) only elicit a weak response from the immune system , or cross @-@ react with normal human proteins . Still , some countries ( New Zealand , Cuba , Norway and Chile ) have developed vaccines against local strains of group B meningococci ; some have shown good results and are used in local immunization schedules . Two new vaccines , both approved in 2014 , are effective against a wider range of group B meningococci strains . In Africa , until recently , the approach for prevention and control of meningococcal epidemics was based on early detection of the disease and emergency reactive mass vaccination of the at @-@ risk population with bivalent A / C or trivalent A / C / <unk> polysaccharide vaccines , though the introduction of <unk> ( meningococcus group A vaccine ) has demonstrated effectiveness in young people and has been described as a model for product development partnerships in resource @-@ limited settings . 
 Routine vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) , which is active against seven common serotypes of this pathogen , significantly reduces the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis . The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine , which covers 23 strains , is only administered to certain groups ( e.g. those who have had a splenectomy , the surgical removal of the spleen ) ; it does not elicit a significant immune response in all recipients , e.g. small children . Childhood vaccination with Bacillus Calmette @-@ Guérin has been reported to significantly reduce the rate of tuberculous meningitis , but its waning effectiveness in adulthood has prompted a search for a better vaccine . 
 = = = Antibiotics = = = 
 Short @-@ term antibiotic prophylaxis is another method of prevention , particularly of meningococcal meningitis . In cases of meningococcal meningitis , preventative treatment in close contacts with antibiotics ( e.g. rifampicin , ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone ) can reduce their risk of contracting the condition , but does not protect against future infections . Resistance to rifampicin has been noted to increase after use , which has caused some to recommend considering other agents . While antibiotics are frequently used in an attempt to prevent meningitis in those with a basilar skull fracture there is not enough evidence to determine whether this is beneficial or harmful . This applies to those with or without a CSF leak . 
 = = Management = = 
 Meningitis is potentially life @-@ threatening and has a high mortality rate if untreated ; delay in treatment has been associated with a poorer outcome . Thus , treatment with wide @-@ spectrum antibiotics should not be delayed while confirmatory tests are being conducted . If meningococcal disease is suspected in primary care , guidelines recommend that <unk> be administered before transfer to hospital . Intravenous fluids should be administered if hypotension ( low blood pressure ) or shock are present . In children routine intravenous fluids for two days may improve outcomes in those who arrive at hospital after being sick for some time . Given that meningitis can cause a number of early severe complications , regular medical review is recommended to identify these complications early and to admit the person to an intensive care unit if deemed necessary . 
 Mechanical ventilation may be needed if the level of consciousness is very low , or if there is evidence of respiratory failure . If there are signs of raised intracranial pressure , measures to monitor the pressure may be taken ; this would allow the optimization of the cerebral perfusion pressure and various treatments to decrease the intracranial pressure with medication ( e.g. mannitol ) . Seizures are treated with anticonvulsants . <unk> ( obstructed flow of CSF ) may require insertion of a temporary or long @-@ term drainage device , such as a cerebral shunt . 
 = = = Bacterial meningitis = = = 
 = = = = Antibiotics = = = = 
 <unk> antibiotics ( treatment without exact diagnosis ) should be started immediately , even before the results of the lumbar puncture and CSF analysis are known . The choice of initial treatment depends largely on the kind of bacteria that cause meningitis in a particular place and population . For instance , in the United Kingdom empirical treatment consists of a third @-@ generation <unk> such as <unk> or ceftriaxone . In the USA , where resistance to <unk> is increasingly found in streptococci , addition of vancomycin to the initial treatment is recommended . <unk> , either alone or in combination with ampicillin , however , appears to work equally well . 
 Empirical therapy may be chosen on the basis of the person 's age , whether the infection was preceded by a head injury , whether the person has undergone recent neurosurgery and whether or not a cerebral shunt is present . In young children and those over 50 years of age , as well as those who are immunocompromised , the addition of ampicillin is recommended to cover Listeria monocytogenes . Once the Gram stain results become available , and the broad type of bacterial cause is known , it may be possible to change the antibiotics to those likely to deal with the presumed group of pathogens . The results of the CSF culture generally take longer to become available ( 24 – 48 hours ) . Once they do , empiric therapy may be switched to specific antibiotic therapy targeted to the specific causative organism and its sensitivities to antibiotics . For an antibiotic to be effective in meningitis it must not only be active against the pathogenic bacterium but also reach the meninges in adequate quantities ; some antibiotics have inadequate penetrance and therefore have little use in meningitis . Most of the antibiotics used in meningitis have not been tested directly on people with meningitis in clinical trials . Rather , the relevant knowledge has mostly derived from laboratory studies in rabbits . Tuberculous meningitis requires prolonged treatment with antibiotics . While tuberculosis of the lungs is typically treated for six months , those with tuberculous meningitis are typically treated for a year or longer . 
 = = = = Steroids = = = = 
 Additional treatment with corticosteroids ( usually dexamethasone ) has shown some benefits , such as a reduction of hearing loss , and better short term neurological outcomes in adolescents and adults from high @-@ income countries with low rates of HIV . Some research has found reduced rates of death while other research has not . They also appear to be beneficial in those with tuberculosis meningitis , at least in those who are HIV negative . 
 Professional guidelines therefore recommend the commencement of dexamethasone or a similar corticosteroid just before the first dose of antibiotics is given , and continued for four days . Given that most of the benefit of the treatment is confined to those with pneumococcal meningitis , some guidelines suggest that dexamethasone be discontinued if another cause for meningitis is identified . The likely mechanism is suppression of overactive inflammation . 
 Additional treatment with corticosteroids have a different role in children than in adults . Though the benefit of corticosteroids has been demonstrated in adults as well as in children from high @-@ income countries , their use in children from low @-@ income countries is not supported by the evidence ; the reason for this discrepancy is not clear . Even in high @-@ income countries , the benefit of corticosteroids is only seen when they are given prior to the first dose of antibiotics , and is greatest in cases of H. influenzae meningitis , the incidence of which has decreased dramatically since the introduction of the Hib vaccine . Thus , corticosteroids are recommended in the treatment of pediatric meningitis if the cause is H. influenzae , and only if given prior to the first dose of antibiotics ; other uses are controversial . 
 = = = Viral meningitis = = = 
 Viral meningitis typically only requires supportive therapy ; most viruses responsible for causing meningitis are not amenable to specific treatment . Viral meningitis tends to run a more benign course than bacterial meningitis . Herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus may respond to treatment with antiviral drugs such as aciclovir , but there are no clinical trials that have specifically addressed whether this treatment is effective . Mild cases of viral meningitis can be treated at home with conservative measures such as fluid , <unk> , and analgesics . 
 = = = Fungal meningitis = = = 
 Fungal meningitis , such as cryptococcal meningitis , is treated with long courses of high dose <unk> , such as <unk> B and <unk> . Raised intracranial pressure is common in fungal meningitis , and frequent ( ideally daily ) lumbar punctures to relieve the pressure are recommended , or alternatively a lumbar drain . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Untreated , bacterial meningitis is almost always fatal . Viral meningitis , in contrast , tends to resolve spontaneously and is rarely fatal . With treatment , mortality ( risk of death ) from bacterial meningitis depends on the age of the person and the underlying cause . Of newborns , 20 – 30 % may die from an episode of bacterial meningitis . This risk is much lower in older children , whose mortality is about 2 % , but rises again to about 19 – 37 % in adults . Risk of death is predicted by various factors apart from age , such as the pathogen and the time it takes for the pathogen to be cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid , the severity of the generalized illness , a decreased level of consciousness or an abnormally low count of white blood cells in the CSF . Meningitis caused by H. influenzae and meningococci has a better prognosis than cases caused by group B streptococci , coliforms and S. pneumonia . In adults , too , meningococcal meningitis has a lower mortality ( 3 – 7 % ) than pneumococcal disease . 
 In children there are several potential disabilities which may result from damage to the nervous system , including sensorineural hearing loss , epilepsy , learning and behavioral difficulties , as well as decreased intelligence . These occur in about 15 % of survivors . Some of the hearing loss may be reversible . In adults , 66 % of all cases emerge without disability . The main problems are deafness ( in 14 % ) and cognitive impairment ( in 10 % ) . 
 Tuberculous meningitis in children continues to be associated with a significant risk of death even with treatment ( 19 % ) , and a significant proportion of the surviving children have ongoing neurological problems . Just over a third of all cases survives with no problems . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Although meningitis is a notifiable disease in many countries , the exact incidence rate is unknown . In 2013 meningitis resulted in 303 @,@ 000 deaths – down from 464 @,@ 000 deaths in 1990 . In 2010 it was estimated that meningitis resulted in 420 @,@ 000 deaths , excluding cryptococcal meningitis . 
 Bacterial meningitis occurs in about 3 people per 100 @,@ 000 annually in Western countries . Population @-@ wide studies have shown that viral meningitis is more common , at 10 @.@ 9 per 100 @,@ 000 , and occurs more often in the summer . In Brazil , the rate of bacterial meningitis is higher , at 45 @.@ 8 per 100 @,@ 000 annually . Sub @-@ Saharan Africa has been plagued by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis for over a century , leading to it being labeled the " meningitis belt " . Epidemics typically occur in the dry season ( December to June ) , and an epidemic wave can last two to three years , dying out during the intervening rainy seasons . Attack rates of 100 – 800 cases per 100 @,@ 000 are encountered in this area , which is poorly served by medical care . These cases are predominantly caused by meningococci . The largest epidemic ever recorded in history swept across the entire region in 1996 – 1997 , causing over 250 @,@ 000 cases and 25 @,@ 000 deaths . 
 Meningococcal disease occurs in epidemics in areas where many people live together for the first time , such as army barracks during mobilization , college campuses and the annual Hajj pilgrimage . Although the pattern of epidemic cycles in Africa is not well understood , several factors have been associated with the development of epidemics in the meningitis belt . They include : medical conditions ( immunological susceptibility of the population ) , demographic conditions ( travel and large population displacements ) , socioeconomic conditions ( overcrowding and poor living conditions ) , climatic conditions ( drought and dust storms ) , and concurrent infections ( acute respiratory infections ) . 
 There are significant differences in the local distribution of causes for bacterial meningitis . For instance , while N. <unk> groups B and C cause most disease episodes in Europe , group A is found in Asia and continues to predominate in Africa , where it causes most of the major epidemics in the meningitis belt , accounting for about 80 % to 85 % of documented meningococcal meningitis cases . 
 = = History = = 
 Some suggest that Hippocrates may have realized the existence of meningitis , and it seems that meningism was known to pre @-@ Renaissance physicians such as Avicenna . The description of tuberculous meningitis , then called " dropsy in the brain " , is often attributed to Edinburgh physician Sir Robert <unk> in a posthumous report that appeared in 1768 , although the link with tuberculosis and its pathogen was not made until the next century . 
 It appears that epidemic meningitis is a relatively recent phenomenon . The first recorded major outbreak occurred in Geneva in 1805 . Several other epidemics in Europe and the United States were described shortly afterward , and the first report of an epidemic in Africa appeared in 1840 . African epidemics became much more common in the 20th century , starting with a major epidemic sweeping Nigeria and Ghana in 1905 – 1908 . 
 The first report of bacterial infection underlying meningitis was by the Austrian bacteriologist Anton <unk> , who in 1887 described the meningococcus . Mortality from meningitis was very high ( over 90 % ) in early reports . In 1906 , antiserum was produced in horses ; this was developed further by the American scientist Simon Flexner and markedly decreased mortality from meningococcal disease . In 1944 , penicillin was first reported to be effective in meningitis . The introduction in the late 20th century of Haemophilus vaccines led to a marked fall in cases of meningitis associated with this pathogen , and in 2002 , evidence emerged that treatment with steroids could improve the prognosis of bacterial meningitis . 
 = Walther Leisler Kiep = 
 Walther Gottlieb Louis Leisler Kiep ( 5 January 1926 – 9 May 2016 ) was a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) . He was a member of the Bundestag between 1965 and 1976 and again from 1980 to 1982 . After switching to state @-@ level politics , he served as minister of economy ( 1976 – 77 ) and minister of finance ( 1976 – 80 ) in Lower Saxony under Ernst Albrecht . In 1982 , Kiep was the leading candidate for the CDU in two successive state elections in Hamburg , losing both to incumbent Klaus von Dohnányi . From 1971 until 1992 , he was treasurer of his party at the federal level . In this position , Kiep installed a system of unreported income accounts , leading to the CDU donations scandal in 1999 . 
 = = Life and family = = 
 Coming from a liberal family , Kiep was born on 5 January 1926 in Hamburg to Louis Leisler Kiep , a navy captain and business man , and Eugenie Maria Anna vom Rath . Kiep went to school in Hamburg and Istanbul , achieving his Abitur in 1943 before joining the Wehrmacht . On 20 April 1944 , Adolf Hitler 's birthday , he joined the Nazi Party . In the same year his uncle , Otto Carl Kiep , was executed by the Nazis for his membership in the Kreisau Circle . After the war , he started to study history and economics , but did not graduate . 
 Before moving into politics , he worked for the Insurance Company of North America from 1948 to 1955 . Starting in 1955 , he worked for a company called Gradmann und Holler , an insurance broker company for large businesses . Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982 . His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy . When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976 , Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler , creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister . Kiep also served on Volkswagen 's board of directors . Kiep denied abusing his power as minister , saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company . Due to his successful business ventures , Kiep was considered to be one of the richest politicians in Germany . In an interview , Kiep told Playboy that he could live well just from the interest from his savings . 
 From 1950 , Kiep was married to Charlotte Kiep , born 1920 , daughter of IG Farben board member and convicted war criminal Fritz ter Meer . They met when Kiep was only thirteen years old . He needed to visit Fritz ter Meer in Landsberg Prison to ask for his daughter 's hand in marriage . They had four children together , sons Walther , Michael and daughters Charlotte and Christiane . Their second son , Michael Jürgen , died in 1975 , aged 24 . The parents started a foundation for young journalists in his name . From a previous marriage of his wife 's , Kiep is stepfather to another son , Edmund . 
 On 30 November 1974 , an assassination attempt was made on Kiep , during which a man fired three shots at the door of his sauna , though he remained uninjured . The assassin was never found and leads hinting towards involvement of the Red Army Faction proved inconclusive . As the German magazine Der Spiegel wrote a year later , some party colleagues allegedly considered it possible that Kiep had staged the attack himself .

 Kiep became a member of the CDU in the fall of 1961 , gaining a seat in the county council of <unk> in 1963 . Following the 1965 federal election , he became a member of the Bundestag , winning a mandate in the <unk> constituency . He retained his seat in 1969 and 1972 , this time as part of his party 's electoral list in Hessen . In 1972 , Kiep was one of only a few CDU parliamentarians who voted yes to the Basic Treaty ( <unk> ) between West and East Germany . Other supporters of Willy Brandt 's Ostpolitik were Richard von Weizsäcker , Karl Carstens and Olaf von Wrangel . During the 1972 federal elections , Kiep was named as prospective Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development in the shadow cabinet of Rainer Barzel . He left parliament on 24 February 1976 to join the state government in Lower Saxony . During his tenure as minister , he also held a seat in the Landtag of Lower Saxony from 1978 to 1980 . He regained a seat in the Bundestag following the 1980 election , entering through a place on the electoral list for Lower Saxony . In order to concentrate on his role as leading candidate in his home state of Hamburg , he once again left parliament on 26 April 1982 . 
 = = = Minister in Lower Saxony = = = 
 1976 saw the state government change in the German <unk> of Lower Saxony , when the coalition government of the SPD and FDP was unable to agree on a successor to minister @-@ president Alfred Kubel . As a consequence , the CDU used renegade votes from the government camp to elect Ernst Albrecht into office . Albrecht called Kiep into his government , as minister of economy and finance . After the CDU minority government was replaced by a coalition with the FDP in January 1977 , Kiep left his position in the ministry for economy , but continued to lead the ministry of finance until 1980 . 
 A controversial topic during his tenure as minister was the search for a radioactive waste site in Lower Saxony . In 1975 , three locations had been deemed suitable for further investigation : the salt domes <unk> , <unk> and Wahn . Two years later , however , the state government designated the Gorleben salt dome as a single location for the repository and waste disposal center . In 2011 , a commission of enquiry of the Bundestag investigated the award procedure . Journal entries of Kiep 's had implied that he was the driving force behind the decision to promote Gorleben , putting the idea forward at a meeting with Albrecht and three federal ministers in Hannover on 11 November 1976 . Since he had attended a meeting with delegates from the nuclear power industry on the same day , it was speculated that the lobby had exercised influence on Kiep . Appearing before the committee as a witness , Kiep claimed not to remember the events exactly but said that he considered it " unlikely " that he was the one who proposed Gorleben , because he did not have enough expertise in the matter . 
 Minister @-@ president Albrecht and Kiep were prominent representatives of the liberal wing of the CDU , who aimed to move their party towards support for the Ostpolitik of the SPD / FDP federal government . In 1976 , they lobbied for their party 's approval of new treaties with Poland , against conservative figures such as Alfred <unk> , Franz Josef Strauß and Hans <unk> . This was also considered to be part of a plan of CDU chairman Helmut Kohl to bring the liberal FDP back into a coalition with the Christian Democrats ( which was ultimately successful in 1982 ) . That Kiep 's work was popular with the FDP was proven in early 1976 : the party 's Theodor Heuss foundation ( de ) awarded him with their highest award , which <unk> refused in deference to his party affiliation . 
 In 1978 , Kiep served as a special representative for chancellor Helmut Schmidt during a debt crisis in Turkey , mediating between the government of <unk> Ecevit , with whom he developed a friendship , and the International Monetary Fund . Kiep eventually collected 910 million US $ for Turkey from various states . 
 In the 1980 federal election , Kiep was named as foreign minister in the shadow cabinet of Franz Josef Strauß . 
 = = = Candidate in Hamburg = = = 
 In 1982 , Kiep served as the leading candidate for the CDU in two separate state elections in his hometown of Hamburg . The first , regular election in June brought a majority of votes for Kiep and heavy losses for the SPD and incumbent First Mayor Klaus von Dohnányi . Since the Green Party gained enough votes to be represented in the <unk> , the political situation was at a deadlock . After von Dohnányi proved unsuccessful in forming a minority government tolerated by the Greens , new elections were called for December . Kiep was once again the CDU candidate , but in " an election upset " , the SPD was able to get enough votes to form a government on their own . This was seen as a sign of support of Hamburg 's population for former chancellor Helmut Schmidt ( born in Hamburg ) , who had been replaced in a constructive vote of no confidence by the CDU in October . 
 = = = Treasurer of the CDU and scandals = = = 
 Kiep served as federal treasurer of the CDU from 1971 to 1992 . During his tenure , the party was involved in several financial scandals . Shortly after taking over , Kiep brought in economist Uwe <unk> as general agent and public accountant Horst <unk> as a financial consultant . Together , the three started an elaborate system aimed at accumulating funding for the party . The <unk> Vereinigung 1954 e.V. ( de ) was used by major companies to donate money to the CDU anonymously , while the donations were fully tax deductible due to the Vereinigung being considered non @-@ profit . Just in the election year 1972 , 30 million Deutsche Mark are said to have been accumulated in this fashion . Over the course of its existence , the Vereinigung gave 214 million Deutsche Marks to political parties between 1969 and 1980 . The procedure was made public during the uncovering of the Flick affair in the early 1980s . Kiep was ultimately accused of having amassed 18 @.@ 5 million Deutsche Marks in illegal donations for the CDU , evading nine million Deutsche Marks in taxes . For his role , he was sentenced to a payment of 675 @,@ 000 Deutsche Marks in 1991 , but the verdict was revoked a year later by the Federal Court of Justice . 
 In 1995 , the public prosecution department of the city of Augsburg obtained the calendars of Karlheinz Schreiber , a German arms dealer . With the help of the documents , the persecutors were able to decipher a code of aliases and money movements , leading to Kiep . On 4 November 1999 , the prosecution office issued an arrest warrant against Kiep , charging him with having accepted a payment of one million Deutsche Marks from Schreiber in 1991 without subjecting the money to taxes . After turning himself in a day later , Kiep declared during his interrogation that he had accepted the money , with Horst <unk> present , as a donation for the CDU . This started the CDU donations scandal , in which a system of illegal accounts was uncovered . On 30 November , former chancellor Helmut Kohl took full responsibility for the accounts and later admitted to having personally accepted a total sum of up to two million Deutsche Marks from anonymous sponsors , which were not declared . As a consequence of the illegal proceedings , the CDU was sentenced to a payment of 41 million Deutsche Marks by President of the Bundestag Wolfgang <unk> on 15 February 2000 . Kiep was ultimately involved in several lawsuits concerning tax evasion . One was closed in January 2004 , after Kiep paid a monetary condition of 75 @,@ 000 Euro . In another trial in 2001 , he was sentenced to pay 45 @,@ 000 Deutsche Marks . In early 2004 , Kiep accepted a sentence of 40 @,@ 500 Euro for a false statement given at the enquiry commission on the donations scandal .

 = The Double ( Seattle Mariners ) = 
 The Double was a double hit by the Seattle Mariners ' Edgar Martínez in Game 5 of Major League Baseball 's 1995 American League Division Series on October 8 , 1995 . Trailing by one run in the bottom half of the 11th inning , with Joey Cora on third base and Ken Griffey , Jr. on first , Martinez 's hit drove in Cora and Griffey , giving the Mariners a 6 – 5 victory over the New York Yankees to clinch the series , 3 – 2 . The play is held to be the " biggest hit in franchise history . " 
 Amid rumors that the team would be sold and / or relocated , the Mariners — who had had only two winning seasons ( 1991 and 1993 ) since beginning play in 1977 — mounted a late @-@ season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history . They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS , first overcoming a 2 @-@ game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5 , then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings , and finally a one @-@ run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double . 
 The hit is regarded as the defining moment of Martinez 's 18 @-@ year Major League Baseball career . Mariners broadcaster Dave Niehaus ' call of the play — which is equally memorable to Seattle fans as the play itself — is also regarded as the highlight of his career . The play is also credited with keeping a Major League Baseball team in the city of Seattle , as it helped garner support for a new taxpayer @-@ funded stadium for the Mariners . That stadium , known today as Safeco Field , opened in 1999 , with the Double depicted in a mural as part of the stadium 's art collection .

 For several years the Mariners had been dogged by rumors that the team 's ownership group led by Jeff Smulyan had been considering selling and / or relocating the team to a different city . This was primarily due to low attendance and revenue , the team 's losing ways ( prior to 1995 , they only had two seasons with a winning percentage over .500 ) , and the Kingdome 's drab baseball environment . 
 In 1992 , Smulyan 's ownership group sold the Mariners to the Baseball Club of Seattle , a consortium led by Hiroshi Yamauchi and later Nintendo of America . As of 2014 , they are still the Mariners ' owners . Almost immediately , the new ownership group began campaigning with local and state governments to gain public funding for a new stadium . 
 In an election held on September 19 , 1995 , the residents of King County voted against a 1 @-@ percentage @-@ point sales tax increase to fund the building of a replacement stadium . As a result , the ownership group set an October 30 deadline for local leadership to come up with a plan to finance a new stadium , or they would put the team up for sale .

 After the Yankees took a 4 – 2 lead on a Don Mattingly 2 @-@ RBI double in the 6th inning , the Mariners came back to tie the score at 4 in the 8th inning and eventually forced extra innings . In the top of the 11th inning , the Yankees scored a run on an RBI single by Randy Velarde and were three outs from reaching the American League Championship Series . 
 In the bottom half of the inning , Yankees ace Jack McDowell , who had entered the game in the 9th inning for a rare relief appearance , faced Joey Cora , Ken Griffey , Jr . , and Edgar Martínez — the second , third , and fourth batters in the Mariners ' order , respectively . Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit . Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call , believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines ; however , the umpires ' ruling stood . Center fielder Griffey singled to short right @-@ center field , allowing Cora to reach third base . Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line , scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the winning run . The Mariners ' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey , Martinez , and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise 's first ever playoff series victory .

" Soon after the events of October 8 , the Washington State Legislature held a special session and approved an alternative funding package to enable the building of a new ballpark , which culminated in the construction of Safeco Field . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 The Double is regarded by Seattle fans and Martinez himself as the defining moment of Martinez 's 18 @-@ year Major League Baseball career – which was played exclusively with the Mariners – and was one of several highlights of Mariners franchise history in which Martinez played a major role . In 2004 , the city of Seattle renamed a street near Safeco Field " Edgar Martínez Drive " to honor Martinez 's contributions to the Mariners , including his double that " saved baseball in Seattle . " Martinez was inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame in 2007 . 
 The image of Griffey at the bottom of the <unk> after scoring the winning run is one of the most memorable images of Griffey 's storied career with the Mariners . In 2007 , when Griffey returned to Seattle for the first time since his 1999 trade to the Cincinnati Reds , that image was included in a photo collage of highlights of Griffey 's Mariners career that was presented to him by former teammates Martinez and Jay <unk> ( both retired by then ) . 
 The image of Griffey sliding into home plate has been immortalized in a mural at Safeco Field called The Defining Moment . 
 Griffey 's slide into home plate was also the inspiration behind the title of the 1996 video game Ken Griffey , Jr . ' s Winning Run . 
 = Cultivar = 
 A cultivar is a plant or grouping of plants selected for desirable characteristics that can be maintained by propagation . Most cultivars have arisen in cultivation but a few are special selections from the wild . Popular ornamental garden plants like roses , camellias , daffodils , rhododendrons , and azaleas are cultivars produced by careful breeding and selection for flower colour and form . Similarly , the world 's agricultural food crops are almost exclusively cultivars that have been selected for characteristics such as improved yield , flavour , and resistance to disease : very few wild plants are now used as food sources . Trees used in forestry are also special selections grown for their enhanced quality and yield of timber . 
 Cultivars form a major part of Liberty Hyde Bailey 's broader grouping , the cultigen , defined as a plant whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity . Cultivar was coined by Bailey and it is generally regarded as a portmanteau of " cultivated " and " variety " , but could also be derived from " cultigen " and " variety " . A cultivar is not the same as a botanical variety , and there are differences in the rules for the formation and use of the names of botanical varieties and cultivars . In recent times the naming of cultivars has been complicated by the use of statutory plant patents and plant breeders ' rights names . 
 The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants ( UPOV – French : Union internationale pour la protection des <unk> végétales ) offers legal protection of plant cultivars to people or organisations who introduce new cultivars to commerce . UPOV requires that a cultivar be distinct , uniform and stable . To be distinct , it must have characteristics that easily distinguish it from any other known cultivar . To be uniform and stable , the cultivar must retain these characteristics under repeated propagation . 
 The naming of cultivars is an important aspect of cultivated plant taxonomy , and the correct naming of a cultivar is prescribed by the Rules and Recommendations of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ( the <unk> , commonly known as the Cultivated Plant Code ) . A cultivar is given a cultivar name , which consists of the scientific Latin botanical name followed by a cultivar epithet . The cultivar epithet is usually in a vernacular language . For example , the full cultivar name of the King Edward potato is Solanum tuberosum ' King Edward ' . The ' King Edward ' part of the name is the cultivar epithet which , according to the Rules of the Cultivated Plant Code , is bounded by single quotation marks . 
 = = Origin of term = = 
 The origin of the term " cultivar " arises from the need to distinguish between wild plants and those with characteristics that have arisen in cultivation ( what we now call cultigens ) . This distinction dates back to the Greek philosopher Theophrastus ( 370 – 285 BCE ) , the " Father of Botany " , who was keenly aware of this difference . Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that Theophrastus in his Enquiry into Plants " had an inkling of the limits of culturally induced ( phenotypic ) changes and of the importance of genetic constitution " ( Historia Plantarum III , 2 @,@ 2 and Causa Plantarum I , 9 @,@ 3 ) . 
 The International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants uses as its starting point for modern botanical nomenclature those Latin names that appeared in Linnaeus ' publications Species Plantarum ( 10th ed . ) and Genera Plantarum ( 5th ed . ) . In Species Plantarum , Linnaeus ( 1707 – 1778 ) listed all the plants known to him , either directly or from his extensive reading . He recognised the rank of <unk> ( in English this is the botanical " variety " , a rank below that of species and subspecies ) and he indicated these varieties by using letters of the Greek alphabet such as α , β , λ in front of the variety name , rather than using the abbreviation var . , which is the current convention . Most of the varieties listed by Linnaeus were of " garden " origin rather than being wild plants . 
 Over time there was an increasing need to distinguish between plants growing in the wild , and those with variations that had been produced in cultivation . In the nineteenth century many " garden @-@ derived " plants were given horticultural names , sometimes in Latin and sometimes in a local language . From about the 1900s , plants produced in cultivation in Europe were recognised in the Scandinavian , Germanic , and Slavic literature through the words <unk> or sorte but these words could not be used internationally since , by international agreement , any new terms had to be based in Latin . In the twentieth century an improved international terminology was proposed for the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants . 
 The word cultivar was coined in 1923 by Liberty Hyde Bailey of Cornell University , New York State , when he wrote : 
 The cultigen is a species , or its equivalent , that has appeared under domestication – the plant is <unk> . I now propose another name , cultivar , for a botanical variety , or for a race subordinate to species , that has originated under cultivation ; it is not necessarily , however , referable to a recognized botanical species . It is essentially the equivalent of the botanical variety except in respect to its origin . 
 In this paper Bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen but it was clear to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species , and that appears to have motivated the suggestion of the new classification category cultivar , which is generally assumed to be a contraction of the words cultivated and variety . However , Bailey was never explicit about the etymology of the word , and it has been suggested that it is a contraction of the words cultigen and variety , which seems more appropriate . 
 The new word cultivar was promoted as " euphonious " and " free from ambiguity " . It serves a purpose . Its use was subsequently recommended by the first Cultivated Plant Code , which was published in 1953 , and by 1960 it had achieved wide international acceptance . 
 = = = Cultigens = = = 
 The terms cultigen and cultivar may be confused with each other . A cultigen is any plant deliberately altered or selected for cultivation by humans ; the Cultivated Plant Code states that cultigens are " maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation " . A cultigen or a component of a cultigen , which is recognisable and stable , can be accepted as a cultivar . 
 Cultigens can have names at any of various ranks , including cultivar names , names in the classification categories of grex and group , binomial Latin species names , variety names , forma names , and they may be plants that have been altered by humans ( including genetically modified plants ) but which have not been given formal names . 
 = = Formal definition = = 
 The Cultivated Plant Code notes that the word cultivar is used in two different senses : first , as a " classification category " the cultivar is defined in Article 2 of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ( 2009 , 8th edition ) as follows : The basic category of cultivated plants whose nomenclature is governed by this Code is the cultivar . There are two other classification categories for cultigens , the grex and the group . The Code then defines a cultivar as a " taxonomic unit within the classification category of cultivar " . This is the sense of cultivar that is most generally understood and which is used as a general definition . 
 A cultivar is an assemblage of plants that ( a ) has been selected for a particular character or combination of characters , ( b ) is distinct , uniform and stable in those characters , and ( c ) when propagated by appropriate means , retains those characters . 
 = = Different kinds = = 
 Which plants are chosen to be named as cultivars is simply a matter of convenience as the category was created to serve the practical needs of horticulture , agriculture , and forestry . 
 Members of a particular cultivar are not necessarily genetically identical . The Cultivated Plant Code emphasizes that different cultivated plants may be accepted as different cultivars , even if they have the same genome , while cultivated plants with different genomes may be regarded as the same cultivar . The production of cultivars generally entails considerable human involvement although in a few cases it may be as little as simply selecting variation from plants growing in the wild ( whether by collecting growing tissue to propagate from or by gathering seed ) . 
 Cultivars generally occur as ornamentals and food crops : Malus ' Granny Smith ' and Malus ' Red Delicious ' are cultivars of apples propagated by cuttings or grafting , Lactuca ' Red Sails ' and Lactuca ' Great Lakes ' are lettuce cultivars propagated by seeds . Named cultivars of Hosta and <unk> plants are cultivars produced by micropropagation or division . 
 = = = Clones = = = 
 Cultivars that are produced asexually are genetically identical and known as clones ; this includes plants propagated by division , layering , cuttings , grafts , and budding . The propagating material may be taken from a particular part of the plant , such as a lateral branch , or from a particular phase of the life cycle , such as a juvenile leaf , or from aberrant growth as occurs with witch 's broom . Plants whose distinctive characters are derived from the presence of an intracellular organism may also form a cultivar provided the characters are reproduced reliably from generation to generation . Plants of the same chimera ( which have mutant tissues close to normal tissue ) or graft @-@ chimeras ( which have vegetative tissue from different kinds of plants and which originate by grafting ) may also constitute a cultivar . 
 = = = Seed @-@ produced = = = 
 Some cultivars " come true from seed " , retaining their distinguishing characteristics when grown from seed . Such plants are termed a " variety " , " selection " or " strain " but these are ambiguous and confusing words that are best avoided . In general , asexually propagated cultivars grown from seeds produce highly variable seedling plants , and should not be labelled with , or sold under , the parent cultivar 's name . 
 Seed @-@ raised cultivars may be produced by uncontrolled pollination when characteristics that are distinct , uniform and stable are passed from parents to progeny . Some are produced as " lines " that are produced by repeated self @-@ fertilization or inbreeding or " multilines " that are made up of several closely related lines . Sometimes they are F1 hybrids which are the result of a deliberate repeatable single cross between two pure lines . A few F2 hybrid seed cultivars also exist , such as Achillea ' Summer Berries ' . 
 Some cultivars are <unk> plants , which retain their genetic composition and characteristics under reproduction . Occasionally cultivars are raised from seed of a specially selected provenance – for example the seed may be taken from plants that are resistant to a particular disease . 
 = = = Genetically modified = = = 
 Genetically modified plants with characteristics resulting from the deliberate implantation of genetic material from a different germplasm may form a cultivar . However , the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants notes , " In practice such an assemblage is often marketed from one or more lines or multilines that have been genetically modified . These lines or multilines often remain in a constant state of development which makes the naming of such an assemblage as a cultivar a futile exercise . " However , retired transgenic varieties such as the Fish tomato , which are no longer being developed , do not run into this obstacle and can be given a cultivar name . 
 Cultivars may be selected because of a change in the ploidy level of a plant which may produce more desirable characteristics . 
 = = Cultivar names = = 
 Every unique cultivar has a unique name within its denomination class ( which is almost always the genus ) . Names of cultivars are regulated by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants , and may be registered with an International Cultivar Registration Authority ( ICRA ) . There are sometimes separate registration authorities for different plant types such as roses and camellias . In addition , cultivars may be associated with commercial marketing names referred to in the Cultivated Plant Code as " trade designations " ( see below ) . 
 = = = Presenting in text = = = 
 A cultivar name consists of a botanical name ( of a genus , species , infraspecific taxon , interspecific hybrid or <unk> hybrid ) followed by a cultivar epithet . The cultivar epithet is enclosed by single quotes ; it should not be italicized if the botanical name is italicized ; and each of the words within the epithet is capitalized ( with some permitted exceptions such as conjunctions ) . It is permissible to place a cultivar epithet after a common name provided the common name is botanically unambiguous . Cultivar epithets published before 1 January 1959 were often given a Latin form and can be readily confused with the specific epithets in botanical names ; after that date , newly coined cultivar epithets must be in a modern vernacular language to distinguish them from botanical epithets .

 = = Legal protection of cultivars and their names = = 
 Since the 1990s there has been an increasing use of legal protection for newly produced cultivars . Plant breeders expect legal protection for the cultivars they produce . If other growers can immediately propagate and sell these cultivars as soon as they come on the market , the breeder 's benefit is largely lost . Legal protection for cultivars is obtained through the use of Plant breeders ’ rights and plant Patents but the specific legislation and procedures needed to take advantage of this protection vary from country to country . 
 = = = Controversial use of legal protection for cultivars = = = 
 The use of legal protection for cultivars can be controversial , particularly for food crops that are staples in developing countries , or for plants selected from the wild and propagated for sale without any additional breeding work ; some people consider this practice unethical . 
 = = = Trade designations = = = 
 The formal scientific name of a cultivar , like Solanum tuberosum ‘ King Edward ’ , is a way of uniquely designating a particular kind of plant . This scientific name is in the public domain and cannot be legally protected . Plant retailers wish to maximize their share of the market and one way of doing this is to replace the cumbersome Latin scientific names on plant labels in retail outlets with appealing marketing names that are easy to use , pronounce and remember . Marketing names lie outside the scope of the Cultivated Plant Code which refers to them as " trade designations " . If a retailer or wholesaler has the sole legal rights to a marketing name then that may offer a sales advantage . Plants protected by Plant breeders ’ rights ( PBR ) may have a " true " cultivar name – the recognized scientific name in the public domain , and a " commercial synonym " an additional marketing name that is legally protected : an example would be Rosa Fascination = ' <unk> ' , the ‘ <unk> ’ being the true scientific name . Because a name that is attractive in one language may have less appeal in another country , a plant may be given different selling names from country to country . Quoting the original cultivar name allows the correct identification of cultivars around the world . The peak body coordinating Plant breeders rights is the Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants ( Union internationale pour la protection des <unk> végétales , UPOV ) and this organization maintains a database of new cultivars protected by PBR in all countries . 
 = = International Cultivar Registration Authorities = = 
 An International Cultivar Registration Authority ( ICRA ) is a voluntary , non @-@ statutory organization appointed by the Commission for Nomenclature and Cultivar Registration of the International Society of Horticultural Science . ICRAs are generally formed by societies and institutions specializing in particular plant genera such as Dahlia or Rhododendron and are currently located in Europe , North America , China , India , Singapore , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and Puerto Rico . 
 Each ICRA produces an annual report and its reappointment is considered every four years . The main task is to maintain a register of the names within the group of interest and where possible this is published and placed in the public domain . One major aim is to prevent the duplication of cultivar and Group epithets within a genus , as well as ensuring that names are in accord with the latest edition of the Cultivated Plant Code . In this way , over the last 50 years or so , ICRAs have contributed to the stability of cultivated plant nomenclature . In recent times many ICRAs have also recorded trade designations and trademarks used in labelling plant material , to avoid confusion with established names . 
 New names and other relevant data are collected by and submitted to the ICRA and in most cases there is no cost . The ICRA then checks each new epithet to ensure that it has not been used before and that it conforms with the Cultivated Plant Code . Each ICRA also ensures that new names are formally established ( i.e. published in hard copy , with a description in a dated publication ) . They record details about the plant , such as parentage , the names of those concerned with its development and introduction , and a basic description highlighting its distinctive characters . ICRAs are not responsible for assessing the distinctiveness of the plant in question . Most ICRAs can be contacted electronically and many maintain web sites : for an up @-@ to @-@ date listing .

He was re @-@ elected in 1902 , but defeated in 1905 . The following year , he was elected as a ULP candidate , and retained his seat for that party ( the Australian Labor Party from 1917 ) until 1931 . Along with the rest of the cabinet , he was ejected from the Australian Labor Party in 1931 , and was a member of the Parliamentary Labor Party until his electoral defeat at the hands of a Lang Labor Party candidate in 1933 . 
 Denny was the Attorney @-@ General of South Australia and Minister for the Northern Territory in the government led by John Verran ( 1910 – 12 ) . In August 1915 , Denny enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force to serve in World War I , initially as a trooper in the 9th Light Horse Regiment . After being commissioned in 1916 , he served in the 5th Division Artillery and 1st Divisional Artillery on the Western Front . He was awarded the Military Cross in September 1917 when he was wounded while leading a convoy into forward areas near Ypres , and ended the war as a captain . 
 He was again Attorney @-@ General in the Labor governments led by John Gunn ( 1924 – 26 ) , Lionel Hill ( 1930 – 33 ) and Robert Richards ( 1933 ) , and held other portfolios in those governments , including housing , irrigation and repatriation .

 William Joseph Denny was born in Adelaide , South Australia , on 6 December 1872 , one of three children of Thomas Joseph Denny , a publican , and his wife Annie ( née Dwyer ) . He attended Christian Brothers College , Adelaide , then worked as a weather clerk at the General Post Office , Adelaide under the Postmaster General , Sir Charles Todd . According to a contemporary source , in 1893 he became the editor of the Catholic The Southern Cross newspaper , which published news about and for the Catholic community of South Australia . A more recent source states he commenced as editor of The Southern Cross in 1896 . He replaced James O <unk> , who later became a United Labor Party ( ULP ) senator for South Australia . Denny was a councillor of the Adelaide City Council from 1898 , representing Grey Ward . During his early twenties he was active in the literary and debating societies of Adelaide , was Chairman of the Christian Brothers Old Collegians Association , and captain of two city rowing clubs . He unsuccessfully contested the two @-@ member seat of West Adelaide in the 1899 South Australian colonial election as a ULP candidate , gaining 27 @.@ 7 per cent of the vote . 
 When a by @-@ election was held for West Adelaide on 17 March 1900 , Denny was elected to the single vacancy created by the resignation of the former Premier of South Australia , Charles Kingston . He ran as an " independent liberal " candidate , gaining 66 @.@ 8 per cent of the vote . Prior to the 1902 state election the electoral district of West Adelaide was abolished . Denny contested the new four @-@ member electoral district of Adelaide , and was elected second in the count with 14 @.@ 3 per cent of the votes cast . He was defeated at the 1905 state election , gaining only 9 @.@ 9 per cent of the votes . The following year , having abandoned his former liberalism , he contested the seat of Adelaide at the state election as a ULP candidate , and was elected first , receiving 19 @.@ 3 per cent of the votes cast . He was again returned first at the 1910 state election , after which the ULP led by John Verran formed the first Labor government of South Australia on 3 June . Having begun studying law at the University of Adelaide in 1903 , Denny was articled to J.R. Anderson KC , and was admitted as a solicitor in the Supreme Court of South Australia in 1908 . 
 = = Attorney @-@ General = = 
 Denny was appointed Attorney @-@ General of South Australia and Minister controlling the Northern Territory on 3 June 1910 . After conducting negotiations with the Commonwealth Government , he relinquished his ministerial responsibility for the Northern Territory on 31 December 1910 , when its administration was transferred to the Commonwealth . During his time as Attorney @-@ General , Denny drafted and led several important legislative reforms . These included the Advances for Homes Act 1910 , which allowed for 80 per cent of the value of a property to be advanced to a worker at 4 @.@ 5 per cent interest over 36 @.@ 5 years . In his speeches Denny highlighted that many workers were faced with high rents and poor conditions . He also sponsored the Female Law Practitioners Act 1911 , which enabled women to practice law in South Australia for the first time . Tall , with " long , spindly legs " , Denny was a favourite of cartoonists . 
 Verran called an election in February 1912 , and the ULP were defeated by the Liberal Union , although Denny was again returned first in the seat of Adelaide with 15 @.@ 8 per cent of votes cast . He became a member of the University of Adelaide Council in April 1912 , as a representative of the Parliament . In 1913 , a referendum to fix the closing time of licensed premises was proposed by the ULP . Even after the governing Liberal Union agreed to the conduct of the referendum at the next state election , Denny attacked them , claiming that they had no intention of implementing the outcome of the referendum if they were re @-@ elected . Denny was returned unopposed at the March 1915 state election . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Denny enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) on 17 August 1915 at the age of 43 , initially as a trooper . Before departing overseas , Denny had always been an advocate of conscription . He was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 9th Light Horse Regiment . While in Egypt , he transferred to the divisional artillery of the 5th Division , which then shipped to France , and he was promoted to lieutenant in June 1916 . In January 1917 , despite his previous stance on conscription , Denny refused requests to endorse it , instead stating that he did not think that intervention would be compatible with his duties as a soldier . He also considered that the majority of soldiers voted against it , and deplored the split in the Labor Party that conscription had created . In mid @-@ 1917 he was attached to the divisional artillery of the 1st Division . On the night of 15 September 1917 , he was leading a convoy carrying water to forward areas when it was hit by a heavy artillery barrage , and he was wounded . His recommendation for the Military Cross read : 
 For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst engaged in pack transport work near <unk> on the night of 15 September 1917 . Lieutenant DENNY showed great coolness and initiative throughout , especially when his convoy came under very heavy barrage in the vicinity of <unk> <unk> . Although wounded himself , Lieut . DENNY personally obtained assistance for two of his men who were wounded . He then reorganised his command and succeeded in reaching his destination . Lieut . DENNY after delivering this water then went to the dressing station where he dictated a report to <unk> before being evacuated . 
 He was invested with the Military Cross by King George V at Buckingham Palace in November 1917 . After recovering from his wounds , he was attached to the repatriation section of AIF Administrative Headquarters in London from January 1918 . He was promoted to captain in September that year . He resigned his commission in the AIF in 1919 and published a memoir titled The Diggers , the foreword of which was written by General Sir William Birdwood , who had commanded the AIF from 1915 until the end of the war . 
 = = Return to Parliament = = 
 Still serving overseas at the time of the 1918 state election , Denny was returned first of three in Adelaide with 30 @.@ 2 per cent of the ballots cast . He was repatriated to Australia via the United States on 2 August 1919 , returning to his seat . While in the United States , he had been regularly published in the New York Herald . He married Winefride Mary Leahy , a pianist and singer , on 15 January 1920 at St. Ignatius Church , Norwood . His brother , the Reverend Richard Denny , officiated at their wedding . He was elected second of two in 1921 and second of three in 1924 with similar proportions of the vote . He was appointed Attorney @-@ General in the Labor government of John Gunn in April 1924 , and was also Minister for Housing , and initially , Assistant Minister for Repatriation . In January 1925 he was appointed as Minister for Irrigation and Minister for Repatriation , while retaining his Attorney @-@ General and housing portfolios . 
 During this period he carried out several significant legislative changes . In 1924 , as Minister for Housing , Denny was closely associated with the Thousand Homes Scheme , which aimed to provide affordable housing , particularly for returned soldiers and their families , and lower income groups . The land used for this development was the site of the Mitcham military camp at which Denny had trained before embarking for service overseas . Denny 's work on the Scheme resulted in a clash with former Premier Sir Henry Barwell , whom he sued for libel after Barwell made statements suggesting that Denny had made false statements to induce merchants to provide goods and services . Barwell later apologised for his comments . 
 Another change was the transition to the use of judges as the electoral returning officer for South Australia . This was done to impose state control on a system which had effectively combined the administration of the national and state electoral rolls . On 27 May 1925 , Denny arranged the appointment of Judge Herbert Kingsley Paine of the <unk> Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state , replacing Charles Mathews , a state public servant who had held the position since 1907 . Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate . 
 As a returned soldier , Denny was an exception among Labor politicians at both state and federal level in the 1920s . Willing and able to speak about his personal war experiences , he was one of the few Labor politicians invited to unveil memorials . He performed this role for the Soldiers ' Memorial Hall at <unk> in 1926 , where his " address was punctuated with applause " . When his political enemies persistently queried the circumstances under which he was awarded the Military Cross , he published the citation in response . Despite Labor 's loss in the 1927 state election , Denny was returned first of three in the seat of Adelaide , with over 25 per cent of the vote . At the April 1930 state election , he was returned first of three with nearly 82 per cent of the ballots cast . Appointed Attorney @-@ General in the Labor government of Lionel Hill , Denny was also Minister of Railways , and for the first six months he was also Minister of Local Government . On Anzac Day 1931 , acting as Premier in Hill 's absence , he officiated at the unveiling of the National War Memorial at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue , Adelaide , before a crowd of about 75 @,@ 000 . Denny is one of only a few South Australian ministers to have ever had military experience . 
 In 1931 , Denny was expelled from the Labor Party , along with Hill and the rest of the cabinet , for supporting the " Premiers ' Plan " , which sought to impose austerity measures due to the poor economic conditions . The cabinet formed the Parliamentary Labor Party which continued to govern the state , led by Hill and then by Robert Richards , with the support of the opposition until the 1933 state election . At the 1933 election , Denny lost his seat to a Lang Labor Party candidate . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In September 1936 , Bill 's brother , the Catholic priest Reverend Denny , and his sister , Mary Catherine Denny , were involved in a vehicle accident in which Mary received fatal injuries . Reverend Denny suffered from an illness that resulted from the accident which contributed to his death in June 1941 . Denny wrote a further autobiographical book , A Digger at Home and Abroad , which was published in 1941 . He continued to practice law until his death , despite difficulties associated with rheumatoid arthritis . He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace , Norwood , after he returned from his office in Adelaide . He was survived by his wife , one son and three daughters . He was accorded a state funeral , and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery . 
 Denny was the patron of the West Adelaide Football Club for 20 years ending in 1930 . He enjoyed diving for crayfish under the rocks at the back of Rosetta Head near Victor Harbor on Encounter Bay , and was often accompanied by <unk> " Brownie " Tripp , an Aboriginal man from the Point <unk> Aboriginal Mission . According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography , " his preferred reading was Shakespeare and the Bible and he quoted liberally from both . His integrity , versatility and wide knowledge were unquestioned , and he was proud of the democratic legislation he had sponsored . "

On 13 May , Hooper scored all five goals for Celtic as they beat Hearts 5 – 0 in the final SPL match of the season , securing his position as the top scorer in the Scottish Premier League with 24 goals and winning the Golden Boot . 
 After Southampton had won promotion to the Premier League there was speculation linking them with a £ 7m for Hooper at the start of the 2012 – 13 season . However , Hooper stated that he was happy at Celtic and was looking forward to playing Champions League football . On 1 August 2012 , Hooper started the season in scoring form , in Celtic 's 2 – 1 victory against HJK Helsinki in the first leg of the Champions League Third Qualifying Round . On 25 September 2012 , Hooper scored all 4 goals in Celtic 's Scottish League Cup tie against Raith Rovers at Celtic Park , the match finished 4 – 1 . On 29 September 2012 , Hooper scored the first goal in a 2 – 0 victory over Motherwell at Fir Park , this resulted in Celtic going to first spot in the Scottish Premier League . Hooper scored his seventh goal in four matches , against Spartak Moscow in the UEFA Champions League ; Celtic won the match 3 – 2 at Spartak Stadium ( Moscow ) , recording their first ever away victory in the UEFA Champions League proper . During January 2013 , Hooper scored braces against Hearts and Dundee United in high scoring wins at home for Celtic , and also scored the only goal in a 1 – 0 away win at Motherwell . That run of goalscoring saw him win the SPL Player of the Month Award . Celtic clinched their second successive Scottish Premier League title on 21 April 2013 with a 4 – 1 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle at Parkhead . Hooper scored twice in the game . On 26 May 2013 , Hooper scored twice for Celtic in their 3 – 0 win over Hibernian in the Scottish Cup Final . 
 On 12 June 2013 , English Premier League club Hull City made an undisclosed bid , believed to be about £ 4.5m , for Hooper which Celtic rejected . As transfer speculation increased over the summer , Hooper played what proved to be his final game for Celtic on 23 July when he came on a second @-@ half substitute in a Champions League qualifier against Cliftonville . He replaced Anthony Stokes on 65 minutes and almost scored nine minutes later with an overhead kick that hit the post . 
 = = = Norwich City = = = 
 On 26 July 2013 , Hooper signed a three @-@ year contract with English Premier League club Norwich City for an undisclosed fee believed to be £ 5m with Norwich having the option of a further year to Hooper 's contract . Hooper made his competitive début for Norwich on 21 September 2013 in a Premier League 1 – 0 home loss to Aston Villa as a 63rd @-@ minute substitute . In his first start for the club , Hooper scored a brace to secure a 3 – 2 victory over Watford in the third round of the League Cup on 24 September . 
 On 9 November 2013 , Hooper scored his first Premier League goal from the penalty spot against West Ham United at Carrow Road to level the scores at 1 – 1 . Norwich City won the game 3 – 1 , with Hooper being voted as Man of the Match . Due to this goal , he became the first player to score in the top 4 divisions of the English league , the top division of the Scottish League and two cup competitions in each country , as well as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League . Hooper scored his second Premier League goal and fourth goal in all competitions in just his seventh start for Norwich City , on 30 November 2013 against Crystal Palace , which Norwich City won 1 – 0 for a vital 3 points . On 7 December , Hooper scored his fifth Norwich City goal and third Premier League goal against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns , a first time angled shot across goalkeeper Boaz Myhill into the corner after a through ball from Leroy Fer , the match ended in a 0 – 2 Norwich City victory . On 15 December , Hooper scored in consecutive Premier League matches , the one @-@ time Scunthorpe United frontman took one touch on his chest after a Johan Elmander lay off , before hitting a superb volley 30 yards out over Michel Vorm and into the roof of the net , levelling the score at 1 – 1 . Hooper would score again on the Boxing Day fixture against Fulham as his shot deflected off of Aaron Hughes and past goalkeeper David Stockdale , thus making Hooper the first ever Norwich City player to score in four successive Premier League matches at Carrow Road . 
 Hooper finished his first season at Norwich as the club 's top scorer with eight goals , but was unable to prevent his side 's relegation from the Premier League down into the Championship . A calf injury then saw Hooper miss the first couple of months of the following season . After returning to the side in October , he finally scored his first goal of the season on 22 November 2014 in a 3 – 3 draw at home against Brighton . The goals then began to flow for Hooper ; the striker scoring twice in a 6 – 1 win over Millwall on Boxing Day where he was described as " outstanding " by manager Neil Adams , then after being dropped from the side he returned to score a hat trick on 7 February 2015 in a 4 – 0 win over Blackpool , taking his total for the season to date up to nine goals . Hooper eventually scored 12 goals in the league , and helped Norwich to third place in the league . Hooper only appeared briefly as a substitute during the promotion play @-@ off ties against Ipswich Town and was an unused substitute in the play @-@ off final at Wembley against Middlesbrough . Norwich , however , won the final 2 – 0 to regain their place in the Premier League . 
 With Norwich back in the Premier League , Hooper was struggling to hold down a place in the team . By September 2015 he had only played ten minutes in the opening league match against Crystal Palace , and an 89th @-@ minute substitute appearance against Southampton . A loan move to Sheffield Wednesday fell through despite the Yorkshire club agreeing to pay Norwich £ 500 @,@ 000 and match Hooper 's £ 32 @,@ 000 weekly wage . Hooper denied press reports that the move collapsed due to his demand for Sheffield Wednesday to provide him with a VIP box at their stadium for his family and friends . He remained at Norwich for a few more weeks , but sustained an ankle injury in training . Sheffield Wednesday made a further attempt to sign Hooper on loan , and on 27 October he agreed to join them until January 2016 . 
 Hooper made his first appearance for Sheffield Wednesday on 31 October 2015 , coming on as a late substitute in a 1 – 0 win at home against Nottingham Forest in the Championship . In his seventh appearance in all competitions for the club , Hooper scored his first goal for Sheffield Wednesday in a 2 – 1 defeat at away against MK Dons . In Hooper 's final two games for Sheffield Wednesday before his loan expired , he managed to score four goals which contributed hugely in Wednesday 's victories against Bolton Wanderers and Leeds United .

 On 22 January 2016 , Hooper joined Sheffield Wednesday in a full transfer signing a three and a half year deal . The fee was undisclosed but believed to be around £ 3 million . 
 = = International career = = 
 Hooper has not represented England at any level . His paternal grandfather William Hooper was raised in the Scottish Borders , and this led to hopes that Hooper could be eligible to play for Scotland . Then Scotland head coach Craig Levein sought clarification as to the place of birth his grandfather 's birth certificate recorded , as he had been born in a hospital in the English border town Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed . The possibility was closed off when it was confirmed that his grandfather was included in the English Births Index . On 13 March 2011 , Hooper was included by Stuart Pearce in his 31 @-@ man squad for the England under @-@ 21 team to play Denmark and Iceland . However , Hooper pulled out of the squad due to injury . On 3 May 2011 , he was named in the 40 @-@ man provisional squad for the UEFA Under @-@ 21 Championship , but did not make the final selection . 
 In February 2012 , BBC Sport reported that the Football Association of Wales were investigating his eligibility , but Hooper was unaware of having any Welsh ancestry . Hooper declared his desire to play for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics , but was not selected . 
 In November 2012 , Hooper was set to join team mate Fraser Forster in the England squad for their upcoming friendly against Sweden in Stockholm , after it was revealed The Football Association had contacted Celtic about the fitness of Hooper . They were handed a bleak prognosis by Celtic 's medical team , meaning Hooper couldn 't make the squad through injury . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Hooper has all the main attributes to play as a striker , he is strong and can hold up the ball well . He is also a good finisher , he has been described as being a ' penalty box striker ' . However , he can also pass the ball well and this allows midfielders to play @-@ off him . He has received praise since moving to Scotland . Newspaper The Daily Record described him as being one of the most skilled attackers in the SPL . They also said that he had shown that he could deal with the physical nature of the Scottish game , due to his ability to ride a challenge well . He is able to play the game at a very high tempo and has a very good first touch . 
 One criticism that Steve Claridge had when analysing Hooper 's game was that " [ he often ] played at either breakneck speed when involved in play or at walking pace when not " , Claridge noted that Hooper needed to work harder to make himself available to his teammates for passes , especially long balls out from defence . 
 While at Celtic , Hooper struck up an excellent partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes . They scored over 40 goals between them in their first season together and were considered to be Celtic 's best strike partnership , although on many occasions , especially for big matches , Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper . Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes . In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role , playing off the shoulder of the last defender , or in the box , and making runs in behind . His strength , pace , finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role . Stokes usually played a deeper role , coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing . Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role , and Stokes to a deeper one , they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role . This made it very hard for defenders to mark them . 
 During his time as manager at Rangers , Ally McCoist showed his players footage of a goal Hooper scored against them at Celtic Park . " He makes a run from the halfway line on the left hand side . I watched it and I showed our players it " , said McCoist , adding that " he [ Hooper ] just has a desire to run and run and just get on the end of a cross . You can 't buy that , you can 't teach that " .

 = River Weaver = 
 The River Weaver is a river , navigable in its lower reaches , running in a curving route anti @-@ clockwise across west Cheshire , northern England . Improvements to the river to make it navigable were authorised in 1720 and the work , which included eleven locks , was completed in 1732 . An unusual clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that profits should be given to the County of Cheshire for the improvement of roads and bridges , but the navigation was not initially profitable , and it was 1775 before the first payments were made . Trade continued to rise , and by 1845 , over £ 500 @,@ 000 had been given to the county . 
 The major trade was salt . The arrival of the Trent and Mersey Canal at Anderton in 1773 was detrimental to the salt trade at first , but ultimately beneficial , as salt was tipped down chutes from the canal into barges on the river navigation . Access to the river was improved in 1810 by the Weston Canal , which provided a link to Weston Point , where boats could reach the River Mersey at most states of the tide , as the water was deeper . The navigation was completely reconstructed between 1870 and 1900 , with the original locks being replaced by five much larger locks , capable of handling 1000 @-@ tonne coasters . With the opening of the Manchester Ship Canal , a new lock was constructed at Weston Marsh , which gave direct access to the ship canal without having to pass through the docks at Weston Point . All water from the river entered the canal nearby , and any surplus was released into the Mersey through the Weaver sluices , which were located just upstream of the junction . 
 A notable feature is the Anderton Boat Lift , which is near Northwich , and links the Weaver with the Trent and Mersey Canal some 50 feet ( 15 m ) above . It was opened in 1875 , to allow canal boats to reach the Weaver , and although closed on safety grounds in 1983 , it was refurbished and reopened in 2002 . Many of the structures of the navigation are of historical importance , and are grade II listed . They include the Hayhurst swing bridge and Northwich Town bridge , which are believed to be the earliest swing bridges powered by electricity . Both have a sectional pontoon , which is immersed in the river and carries about 80 per cent of the weight of the bridge . Dutton Horse Bridge , which carries the towpath over the weir stream at Dutton , is one of the earliest surviving laminated timber structures . Dutton railway viaduct , which was built by Joseph Locke and George Stephenson for the Grand Junction Railway , is grade II * listed , and a civic celebration was held on its completion , as there had been no deaths and no serious injuries to the workers during its construction .

 The River Weaver is slightly more than 50 miles ( 80 km ) long . From its source in the hills of west Cheshire near Peckforton Castle , it initially flows in a south @-@ easterly direction towards the border with Shropshire , fed by tributaries some of which rise in north Shropshire . The first of three canal crossings occurs just before the village of <unk> , when the Llangollen Canal crosses its course . After flowing through the village , it passes to the west of the Cheshire village of <unk> , where it starts to flow approximately northwards across the Cheshire Plain . Shortly afterwards , the Shropshire Union Canal is carried over it on Moss Hall aqueduct . The first significant town on the river is the market town of Nantwich , where an early 19th @-@ century stone bridge , with a single span , crosses the river . Continuing northwards , it passes under the Middlewich Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal before the village of Church Minshull . The aqueduct carrying the canal was designed by Thomas Telford and was built of brick with stone bands between 1827 and 1833 . The river flows through a central arch , and there are flood relief arches on each side of the channel . The two waterways run roughly parallel for several miles . They diverge near Winsford , the current head of navigation , and at Northwich the river turns to flow north @-@ west across north Cheshire . 
 Below Winsford , the course of the river has been altered several times , by the construction of cuts and locks , to enable small ships to trade on it . The river formerly joined the River Mersey at Weston Marsh , but since the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal , begun in 1887 , it has flowed into the canal , from where surplus water enters the Mersey by the Weaver sluices , just upstream of the junction . The tidal river section below Frodsham has been bypassed by the Weston Canal since 1810 , and is no longer navigable , as Frodsham Lock is derelict . 
 = = History = = 
 The river runs through the Cheshire salt @-@ producing area , but was not deep enough to allow boats to reach the salt mines . It was tidal for around 7 miles ( 11 km ) to Pickering 's wharf , and salt from the mines was carried by pack horse to the wharf , where it was loaded into barges . These used the ebbing tide to carry them back down the river . By the early 17th century , coal was being transported into the area so that it could be used to evaporate the brine , and as the industry expanded , there were calls to improve the river to simplify this trade . There was opposition to the initial schemes , however , from landowners who feared flooding and from carriers who feared a loss of trade , which resulted in Bills laid before Parliament in 1711 , 1715 , 1718 and 1720 being defeated . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 In 1720 the first Act of Parliament to authorise improvements to the river was obtained by three gentlemen of Cheshire . The act was dated 23 March 1720 and authorised work between Frodsham bridge and Winsford bridge . Rates for tolls were set , which were to be reduced by 20 per cent once the cost of construction had been met , and profits were then to be used to maintain bridges and highways within Cheshire . Each year the Justices of the Peace were to meet to decide which structures should benefit from this source of revenue . The Act included powers to improve the Witton Brook from the Weaver to Witton Bridge . Following a plea by the owner of brine workings near Middlewich , who felt they would be disadvantaged by the new navigation , a separate Act was obtained on 7 June 1721 to authorise improvements to the River Dane , but did not result in any work being undertaken . 
 Progress was slow , as only Richard Vernon of the original three undertakers was actively engaged on the project , and he could not reach agreement with the Commissioners . The stalemate was broken when Vernon died in 1726 , and new undertakers were appointed . The work on the Weaver was completed by 1732 , at a cost of £ 15 @,@ 885 . Eleven timber locks and weirs had been constructed , but no work had been carried out on the Witton Brook . The river had been improved by dredging and the construction of a series of cuts , with locks and weirs to manage the drop of around 50 feet ( 15 m ) over the 20 miles ( 32 km ) between Winsford and the River Mersey . Barges of up to 40 tons could reach Winsford , and boats called Weaver flats were the predominant vessels . These either sailed up the river , or were bow @-@ hauled by teams of men . 
 The navigation was not initially profitable , and the amount of money owing to the undertakers gradually rose to a peak of £ 19 @,@ 659 by 1740 . Toll receipts improved , and by 1757 , the debts had been reduced to £ 9 @,@ 809 . In September 1757 , merchants from Liverpool complained about the run @-@ down state of the navigation to Liverpool Corporation , who offered to pay for a survey . The merchants then offered to take over the navigation , but the commissioners wanted to keep control of it , and paid £ 17 @,@ 000 to the undertakers , which repaid the outstanding debt and bought the navigation rights . The deal was completed on 11 October 1758 . The commissioners largely ignored the survey which had been carried out by Henry Berry , and decided to enlarge the locks to 17 @.@ 3 feet ( 5 @.@ 3 m ) wide . Work began on a new cut , lock and weir at Pickerings , but in 1759 , the navigation was cut in half by the collapse of a salt pit at Northwich . The commissioners discovered that they could not sue for damages , as the provisions of the 1721 Act no longer covered the way in which they were operating , and so a second Act of Parliament was obtained on 22 May 1760 . This changed the way in which the debts were managed , and gave the commissioners powers to sue and to appoint a management committee . It also stipulated that all locks should be 90 by 17 @.@ 3 feet ( 27 @.@ 4 by 5 @.@ 3 m ) with a draught of 4 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) , but the actual depth exceeded 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . 
 Debts continued to increase , as the commissioners borrowed more money to fund the improvements . The new weir and lock at Pickerings failed in 1761 and both had to be rebuilt . Work had started on Witton Brook in 1756 , but the plans were revised in 1764 to increase the navigable depth to 4 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) , and this work was completed in 1765 . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The proposed Trent and Mersey Canal was seen as a threat by the Trustees of the Navigation , for it ran parallel to the River Weaver for some distance near Anderton . However , the commissioners pressed on with upgrading the river , completing new locks at Barnton in 1771 and at Acton Bridge in 1778 . They also set about repaying their debts , which were liquidated in July 1775 , resulting in some of the profits being given to the County of Cheshire , as stated in the original Act . 
 The Trent and Mersey was completed in May 1777 , and had an immediate effect on trade , which dropped by 25 per cent , particularly in the Winsford area . The downturn was short lived , as the salt trade developed , figures reaching their former levels by 1783 , and climbing another 40 per cent to 171 @,@ 719 tons by 1790 . Ultimately , the Trent and Mersey generated significant trade for the Navigation , for in 1793 a system of chutes was constructed at Anderton , to enable salt from narrow boats on the canal to be tipped into Weaver flats moored in a dock some 50 feet ( 15 m ) below the level of the canal . 
 The steady increase in traffic encouraged the trustees to press on with improvements . Witton Brook was widened in 1788 , and the lock was raised , but subsidence caused by the salt mining resulted in a new lock being needed in 1826 . A longer @-@ term solution was provided by the decision to move Northwich lock to a new site below the town . When the work was finished in 1829 , Witton Brook lock was no longer necessary , and was removed . New cuts and locks were built through the 1790s at Vale Royal , Newbridge , Hartford and Hunts , and Butty Meadow lock was removed . In response to petitions , the construction of a towing path suitable for horses was started in 1792 , and was completed as far as Anderton by mid @-@ 1793 . It was later extended to Winsford , and bow @-@ hauling of boats by men was ended . 
 = = = The Weston Canal = = = 
 Below Frodsham , barges carrying salt had to negotiate a tidal section of the river to reach the Mersey , from where the cargo would be taken to Liverpool or Manchester for distribution worldwide . Water levels were inadequate for the Mersey Flats at neap tides , resulting in them having to wait for days at Frodsham . In 1796 , users of the navigation suggested that it should be extended to Weston Point , where the water was deeper . The trustees wanted to pay for this extension by raising tolls , but the users objected , and it took several years to work out a deal which suited both parties . Finally , the Trustees obtained a third Act on 8 August 1807 , which authorised the construction of a cut from Frodsham to Weston Point . The trustees insisted that their own engineer , John Johnson , should oversee the work , but the project was too large for him , and ran over time and budget . He was sacked in 1809 , after serving the navigation for 29 years , and Thomas Telford was asked to complete the work . He managed the project with Samuel Fowls as engineer . At Weston Point , a new lock connected the cut to a basin , and tide gates connect the basin to the Mersey . This cut was called the Weston Canal and was completed in 1810 . A fourth Act was obtained on 2 May 1825 , which altered some of the details of the previous Act , and an Act of 22 May 1829 noted that the Weston Canal had been completed . It stated that the Trustees had built a basin , piers and a lighthouse at Weston Point , that the Weston Canal was officially a branch of the River Weaver , and that the Trustees would make no additional charges for using the section . No tolls had been collected since 1816 , once the construction costs had been repaid . 
 = = = Progress = = = 
 The trustees investigated the idea of a junction canal from Winsford to the Middlewich branch of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal in 1830 , but felt that water supply would be a problem . New cuts were constructed at Barnton , Crowton and Aston Grange between 1832 and 1835 , and they then planned to construct a second lock beside each of the original locks . William <unk> was asked for advice on whether the river could be adapted for seagoing ships , and although he said it could , he did not think it would be cost effective . Work was then started on making the river 7 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) deep throughout , and building double locks suitable for 100 @-@ ton vessels which were 88 by 18 feet ( 26 @.@ 8 by 5 @.@ 5 m ) . By 1845 , Winnington , Acton and Hunts locks had been improved . Trade was good , with tolls generating £ 38 @,@ 363 in 1845 from the carriage of 778 @,@ 715 tons of goods . All of the improvements had been funded from the toll revenue , and over £ 500 @,@ 000 had been given to the County of Cheshire , in line with the original Act . 
 Further improvements to make the river suitable for coasters began in 1856 , when Edward Leader Williams was appointed as engineer . He oversaw the complete reconstruction of the navigation between 1870 and 1900 , a programme which was designed to ensure that the river remained attractive to carriers , and which ensured its profitability . The 12 locks of the 1830s were replaced by five much larger locks , and most of the bridges were replaced by swing bridges , which enabled coasters of up to 1000 tons to use the river . 
 Construction of a connection between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875 . Because of the difference in level , a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark , using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system . A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank . The design was a success , but the fluid became contaminated , resulting in corrosion of the pistons . The lift was replaced by a new design , where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys , with small electric motors to overcome friction . The new lift was built over the top of the old one , so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready , and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation , supervised by the engineer J A Saner . It was completed in 1906 , and continued in use until 1983 , when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion . 
 It had been expected that use of the chutes to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened , but by the turn of the 19th century , although there were 190 @,@ 000 tons of cargo using the lift each year , 38 @,@ 000 tons of salt were still being transferred by chute . From the middle of the 19th century , some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways , and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade , but as that source of revenue declined , a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich , which became the major source of income for the Navigation . 
 = = = Locks = = = 
 The locks on the river are paired , with two lock chambers side @-@ by @-@ side , and in most cases the larger lock also has intermediate gates , so that ships of varying length can be accommodated , without undue waste of water . The maximum size of the locks is 196 by 35 feet ( 60 by 11 m ) above the Anderton boat lift , and 213 by 37 feet ( 65 by 11 m ) below it . The lock at Weston Point Docks is slightly narrower , at 213 by 36 feet ( 65 by 11 m ) . The boat lift is designed for canal craft rather than ships , and so can hold vessels up to 72 by 14 feet ( 21 @.@ 9 by 4 @.@ 3 m ) with a draught of 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) . 
 = = Connections = = 
 Access to the navigation was improved for traditional canal boats with the opening of the Runcorn and Weston Canal , which was completed in 1859 . The canal left the Weston Canal at Weston Point , and provided a link to Runcorn Docks , near which two flights of locks connected to the Bridgewater Canal . This link was severed in 1966 , when the Runcorn to Widnes road bridge was constructed . Half of the Runcorn and Weston Canal was filled in at the same time . 
 Significant change occurred when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894 . The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal , rather than the River Mersey , and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary . A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh , which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks . The Weston Canal has been little used since . Although it is possible for pleasure craft to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal , it is a commercial waterway , and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company . 
 Situated just below Northwich , the Anderton Boat Lift is now the normal route for leisure boats to reach the river . Following its closure in 1983 , a Trust was created to campaign for its restoration . The lift became a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1994 , and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999 . It reopened in 2002 , and is once more hydraulically powered . The use of modern hydraulic fluids is expected to prevent the problem of corrosion suffered when it was originally built . 
 The Navigation is managed by British Waterways , as far as Winsford Bridge . Beyond this are Winsford Bottom Flash and Winsford Top Flash . Both are shallow lakes , resulting from subsidence in the underlying salt mines . It is possible for some canal boats to explore the Bottom Flash , but the depth of water is limited , and great care is needed . The Flash is used for yacht racing by the Winsford Flash Sailing Club , which is based on the 90 @-@ acre ( 36 ha ) lake . 
 = = Tourism = = 
 The Weaver is a river of contrasts , with quiet wooded reaches and heavily industrialised sites . Commercial shipping has largely ceased , but the ship @-@ sized locks remain . For leisure boaters , most of the movable bridges provide a clearance of 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) , although the swing bridge at Newbridge , on the Vale Royal cut , only has headroom of 6 @.@ 3 feet ( 1 @.@ 9 m ) . Boats which require the bridges to be opened must give prior notice . There is a salt museum at Northwich , which was renamed as the Weaver Hall Museum and Workhouse in 2010 , to reflect its expanding scope and the historic building in which it is housed , and a visitor centre at the Anderton lift , which is popular with boaters and non @-@ boaters alike . There are , however , few facilities for the recreational boater . 
 Rowing is popular on the River Weaver , with competitive clubs in Runcorn , Northwich , and Acton Bridge ( The Grange School ) . Fishing is another pastime which takes place along the river . Several clubs lease fishing rights for different parts of the river from British Waterways , as it holds populations of bream , three types of carp , chub , dace , eels , perch , pike , roach , rudd and tench . Fishing matches are regularly organised at weekends . 
 The lower reaches of the Weaver between Frodsham railway viaduct and the Manchester Ship Canal are used for sailing . The Weaver Sailing Club is based at Frodsham , and uses a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) stretch of the river for activities which include youth training and racing of several types of dinghy sailboats .

 The navigation has a number of structures which , because of their age , have historic value and are listed on the Listed Building register . At Vale Royal , the lock built in 1860 was retained as a sluice channel when a new lock was built in the 1890s . A swing bridge crosses the chamber . The sluice at the upstream end is supported by two cast iron arches on rusticated piers . A swing bridge , made of wood and iron , crosses the small lock , which was the large lock until the construction of the new large lock in the 1890s . This has three sets of gates , and could accommodate a train of four barges when the outer gates were used . Again , a swing bridge crosses the lock . The gates are opened by a Pelton water turbine mechanism , and other features include a water levelling mechanism and a system for removing rubbish from behind the gates using jets of water which are controlled mechanically . The lock keeper 's cottage is also grade II listed . It was built in the 1850s , but was moved northwards by 20 yards ( 18 m ) during the 1890 reconstruction . 
 Below the locks , a five @-@ arched red sandstone viaduct , constructed in 1837 , crosses the valley . It was built by Joseph Locke , and carried the Grand Junction Railway . Hunt 's locks also consist of a pair , the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one , with three sets of gates , from the 1890s . Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks , and again the movement of the gates employs a Pelton turbine . The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches , which also support the floodgates . The structure is Baroque in style . 
 Northwich railway viaduct spans both the lock cut and the weir stream , and was built in the 1860s . It consists of 48 round arches , constructed of blue bricks and red sandstone , with iron spans over the channels . It is around 980 yards ( 900 m ) long , provides 39 feet ( 12 m ) of headroom over the navigation , and also crosses the River Dane . Hayhurst swing bridge carries the <unk> road over the navigation , and was manufactured by A Handyside and Co . Ltd . , of Derby and London , in 1899 . It is an asymmetric bowstring lattice girder bridge , and its timber @-@ framed <unk> control cabin is also listed . This and Town bridge , which is located a little further downstream and is of a similar design , are believed to be the two earliest swing bridges in Britain to be powered by electricity . Both bridges were designed by J. A. Saner , who was the Navigation 's engineer , and incorporate a sectional pontoon , which is immersed in the river and carries about 80 per cent of the weight of the bridge . Because of the risk of subsidence from the salt workings , the bridges are fitted with screw jacks which allow the deck level to be maintained . Hayhurst bridge was refurbished in 2004 at a cost of £ 33 @.@ 5 million . Winnington bridge , the next downstream , was built between 1908 and 1909 , to replace the first bridge which was built in 1901 . The original design was flawed , and hence the bridge was replaced after only 7 years . A pedestrian walkway was later fitted on the downstream side of the new bridge . 
 <unk> locks were built in 1874 , using red sandstone and limestone , and replaced a lock built on the Barnton cut between 1832 and 1835 . The Pelton turbines which control the gates were built to Stoney 's patent , and carry plates which indicate that they were manufactured by Hanna , Donald & Wilson of Paisley . Acton Bridge is a symmetrical bowstring girder swing bridge , which was built in situ between 1931 and 1933 , on an island in the centre of the river . It was first swung across the channel on 10 August 1933 . J. A. Saner was again the designer . Dutton locks are of a similar design and age to those at <unk> , and the Pelton turbines were made by Northern Foundry Co . Ltd. of Oldham , who are described as turbine makers on the cast @-@ iron covers . Dutton sluice , some 160 yards ( 150 m ) to the north @-@ east of the lock , was built in the 1870s , in a similar Baroque style to Hunt 's weir , but is larger , with eight arches each carrying a sluice gate . Where the weir stream rejoins the main channel , the towpath is carried over it on Horse Bridge , which was designed by J. A. Saner , the Navigation 's engineer , in 1915 , and erected in 1916 . It is one of the earliest surviving laminated timber structures , and consists of two arches , both over 100 feet ( 30 m ) long . Below the locks , Joseph Locke and George Stephenson built another viaduct for the Grand Junction Railway , which was completed in 1836 and is grade II * listed . It has 20 arches , and was built at a cost of £ 54 @,@ 440 by a London civil engineering contractor called David McIntosh . A civic celebration was held on its completion , as there had been no deaths and no serious injuries to the workers during its construction . The navigation has since been re @-@ routed , and now passes through a different arch of the structure . 
 The weir at Frodsham was built in 1785 , although it has been altered subsequently . The main curved section is 49 yards ( 45 m ) wide , and there are two 16 @-@ foot ( 5 m ) sluices at the southern end . The adjacent lock , which was designed by Robert Pownall and George Leigh in 1781 , was modified in 1830 and later , but most traffic was using the Weston cut by the time of the 1890s upgrade , and so it retained some of its original features . It is derelict , and water flow is controlled by a concrete and steel sluice erected in the mid 20th century . A red sandstone and limestone bridge carries the A56 road over the channel below the lock . It was built in 1850 , and has three 27 @-@ yard ( 25 m ) arches . The A56 crosses the main channel on Sutton swing bridge , which was built in the 1920s . There have been problems with the stability of the road surface , and options to secure its long @-@ term future and appearance were discussed in 2010 . Frodsham viaduct , completed in 1850 and built in brown bricks with a cast @-@ iron central arch , was built for the Birkenhead , Lancs & Cheshire Junction Railway by the contractor Thomas Brassey . The engineer for the project was Alexander Rendel . 
 = = Oxygen levels = = 
 In August 2012 , oxygen levels in the river were found to be low , following the death of thousands of fish . The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem . This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae , which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend , and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide , which is used to improve oxygen levels in the water , and traces of detergent . The reaction results in an unpleasant @-@ looking foam building up on the surface , although the foam is not hazardous . The Winsford and District Angling Association , who use the river for fishing , believe it will take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident .

 = Indiana in the American Civil War = 
 Indiana , a state in the Midwest , played an important role in supporting the Union during the American Civil War . Despite anti @-@ war activity within the state , and southern Indiana 's ancestral ties to the South , Indiana was a strong supporter of the Union . Indiana contributed approximately 210 @,@ 000 Union soldiers , sailors , and marines . Indiana 's soldiers served in 308 military engagements during the war ; the majority of them in the western theater , between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains . Indiana 's war @-@ related deaths reached 25 @,@ 028 ( 7 @,@ 243 from battle and 17 @,@ 785 from disease ) . Its state government provided funds to purchase equipment , food , and supplies for troops in the field . Indiana , an agriculturally rich state containing the fifth @-@ highest population in the Union , was critical to the North 's success due to its geographical location , large population , and agricultural production . Indiana residents , also known as Hoosiers , supplied the Union with manpower for the war effort , a railroad network and access to the Ohio River and the Great Lakes , and agricultural products such as grain and livestock . The state experienced two minor raids by Confederate forces , and one major raid in 1863 , which caused a brief panic in southern portions of the state and its capital city , Indianapolis . 
 Indiana experienced significant political strife during the war , especially after Governor Oliver P. Morton suppressed the Democratic @-@ controlled state legislature , which had an anti @-@ war ( Copperhead ) element . Major debates , which lead to violence , related to the issues of slavery and emancipation , military service for African Americans , and the draft . In 1863 , after the state legislature failed to pass a budget and left the state without the authority to collect taxes , Governor Morton acted outside his state 's constitutional authority to secure funding through federal and private loans to operate the state government and avert a financial crisis . 
 The American Civil War altered Indiana 's society , politics , and economy , beginning a population shift to central and northern Indiana , and contributed to a relative decline in the southern part of the state . Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth in Hoosier cities and towns ushered in a new era of economic prosperity . By the end of the war , Indiana had become less rural state than it previously had been . Indiana 's votes were closely split between the parties for several decades after the war , making it one of a few key swing states that often decided national elections . Between 1868 and 1916 , five Indiana politicians were vice @-@ presidential nominees on the major party tickets . In 1888 Benjamin Harrison , one of the state 's former Civil War generals , was elected president of the United States . 
 = = Indiana 's contributions = = 
 Indiana was the first of the country 's western states to mobilize for the Civil War . When news reached Indiana of the attack on Fort Sumter , South Carolina , on April 12 , 1861 , many Indiana residents were surprised , but their response was immediate . On the following day , two mass meetings were held in Indianapolis , the state capital of Indiana , and the state 's position was decided : Indiana would remain in the Union and would immediately contribute men to suppress the rebellion . On April 15 , Indiana 's governor , Oliver P. Morton , issued a call for volunteer soldiers to meet the state 's quota set by President Abraham Lincoln . 
 Indiana 's geographical location in the Midwest , its large population , and its agricultural production made the state 's wartime support critical to the Union 's success . Indiana , with the fifth @-@ largest population of the states that remained in the Union , could supply much @-@ needed manpower for the war effort , its railroad network and access to the Ohio River and the Great Lakes could transport troops and supplies , and its agricultural yield , which became even more valuable to the Union after the loss of the rich farmland of the South , could provide grain and livestock . 
 = = = Military service = = = 
 On April 15 , 1861 , President Lincoln called for a total of 75 @,@ 000 volunteers to join the Union army . On the same day , Governor Morton telegraphed the president offering 10 @,@ 000 Indiana volunteers . The state 's initial quota was set at six regiments ( a total of 4 @,@ 683 men ) for three months of service . Orders were issued on April 16 to form the state 's first regiments and to gather at Indianapolis . On the first day , five hundred men were encamped in the city ; within a week more than 12 @,@ 000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up to fight for the Union , nearly three times as many needed to meet the state 's initial quota . 
 Governor Morton and Lew Wallace , Indiana 's adjutant general , established Camp Morton at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis as the initial gathering place and training camp for the state 's Union volunteers . ( Camp Morton was converted to a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp in 1862 . ) By April 27 , Indiana 's first six regiments were fully organized as the First Brigade , Indiana Volunteers , under the command of Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris . Members of companies not selected for these first regiments were given the option of volunteering for three years of service or returning home until they were needed ; some companies formed into regiments in the state militia and were called into federal service within a few weeks . 
 Indiana ranked second among the states in terms of the percentage of its men of military age who served in the Union army . Indiana contributed 208 @,@ 367 men , roughly 15 percent of the state 's total population to serve in the Union army , and 2 @,@ 130 to serve in the navy . Most of Indiana 's soldiers were volunteers ; 11 @,@ 718 were re @-@ enlistments . Deserters numbered 10 @,@ 846 . 
 Indiana 's volunteers responded to requests for military service in the early months of the war ; however , as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased , the state government had to resort to conscription ( the draft ) to fill its quotas . Military conscription , which began in October 1862 , was a divisive issue within the state . It was especially unpopular among Democrats , who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $ 300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute . A total of 3 @,@ 003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862 ; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17 @,@ 903 . 
 Indiana 's volunteers and draftees provided the Union army with 129 infantry regiments , 13 cavalry regiments , 3 cavalry companies , 1 regiment of heavy artillery , and 26 light artillery batteries . In addition to providing Union troops , Indiana also organized its own volunteer militia , known as the Indiana Legion . Formed in May 1861 , the Legion was responsible for protecting Indiana 's citizens from attack and maintaining order within the state . 
 By the end of the war , Indiana could claim 46 general officers in the Union army who had at one time resided in the state . These men included Don Carlos Buell , Ambrose Burnside , Lew Wallace , Robert H. <unk> , and Joseph J. Reynolds , among others . 
 More than 35 percent of the Hoosiers who joined the Union army became casualties : 24 @,@ 416 , roughly 12 @.@ 6 percent of Indiana 's soldiers who served , lost their lives in the conflict . An estimated 48 @,@ 568 soldiers , double the number of Hoosiers killed in the war , were wounded . Indiana 's war @-@ related death toll eventually reached 25 @,@ 028 ( 7 @,@ 243 from battle and 17 @,@ 785 from disease ) . 
 = = = Training and support = = = 
 Slightly more than 60 percent of Indiana 's regiments mustered into service and trained at Indianapolis . Other camps for Union soldiers were established elsewhere in the state , including Fort Wayne , Gosport , Jeffersonville , <unk> , Lafayette , Richmond , South Bend , Terre Haute , Wabash , and in LaPorte County . 
 Governor Morton was called the " Soldier 's Friend " because of his efforts to equip , train , and care for Union soldiers in the field . Indiana 's state government financed a large portion of the costs involved in preparing its regiments for war , including housing , feeding , and equipping them , before their assignment to the standing Union armies . To secure arms for Indiana 's troops , the governor appointed purchasing agents to act on the state 's behalf . Early in the war , for example , Robert Dale Owen purchased more than $ 891 @,@ 000 in arms , clothing , blankets , and cavalry equipment for Indiana troops ; the state government made additional purchases of arms and supplies exceeding $ 260 @,@ 000 . To provide ammunition , Morton established a state @-@ owned arsenal at Indianapolis served the Indiana militia , home guard , and as a backup supply depot for the Union army . The state arsenal operated until April 1864 , employing 700 at its peak ; many of its employees were women . A federal arsenal was also established in Indianapolis in 1863 . 
 The Indiana Sanitary Commission , created in 1862 , and soldiers ' aid societies throughout the state raised funds and gathered supplies for troops in the field . Hoosiers also provided other forms of support for soldiers and their families , including a Soldiers ' Home and a Ladies ' Home , and Orphans ' Home to help meet the needs of Indiana 's soldiers and their families as they passed through Indianapolis . 
 During the war some women took on the added responsibility of running family farms and businesses . Hoosier women also contributed to the war effort as nurses and volunteers in charitable organizations , most commonly the local Ladies ' Aid Societies . In January 1863 Governor Morton and the Indiana Sanitary Commission began recruiting women to work as nurses in military hospitals and on ships . 
 Wounded soldiers were cared for at Indiana facilities in Clark County ( Port Fulton , near Jeffersonville and New Albany ) , Jefferson County ( Madison ) , Knox County ( Vincennes ) , Marion County ( Indianapolis ) , Warrick County ( Newburgh ) , and Vanderburgh County ( Evansville ) . Jefferson General Hospital at Port Fulton , Indiana , now a part of present @-@ day Jeffersonville , was briefly the third @-@ largest hospital in the United States . Between 1864 , when Jefferson General opened , and 1866 , when it closed , the hospital treated 16 @,@ 120 patients .

 Indianapolis was the site of Camp Morton , one of the Union 's largest prisons for captured Confederate soldiers . Lafayette , Richmond , and Terre Haute , Indiana , occasionally held prisoners of war as well . 
 = = = Military cemeteries = = = 
 Two national military cemeteries were established in Indiana as a result of the war . In 1882 the federal government established in New Albany , Indiana , the New Albany National Cemetery , one of fourteen national cemeteries established that year . In 1866 the federal government authorized a national cemetery for Indianapolis ; Crown Hill National Cemetery was established within the grounds of Crown Hill Cemetery , a privately owned cemetery northwest of downtown . 
 = = Conflicts = = 
 Indiana troops participated in 308 military engagements , the majority of them between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains . Soldiers from Indiana were present on most of the Civil War battlefields , beginning with the first engagement involving Hoosier troops at the Battle of Philippi ( West Virginia ) on June 3 , 1861 , to the Battle of Palmetto Ranch ( Texas ) on May 13 , 1865 . Nearly all the fighting was outside of the state 's boundaries . Only one significant conflict , known as Morgan 's Raid , occurred on Indiana soil during the war . The raid , which caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and southern Indiana , was preceded by two minor incursions into Indiana . 
 = = = Raids = = = 
 On July 18 , 1862 , during the Newburgh Raid , Confederate officer Adam Johnson briefly captured Newburgh , Indiana , after convincing the town 's Union garrison that he had cannon on the surrounding hills ( they were merely camouflaged stovepipes ) . The raid convinced the federal government of the need to supply Indiana with a permanent force of regular Union Army soldiers to counter future raids . 
 On June 17 , 1863 , in preparation for a planned cavalry offensive by Confederate troops under the command of John Hunt Morgan , one of his officers , Captain Thomas Hines and approximately 80 men crossed the Ohio River to search for horses and support from Hoosiers in southern Indiana . During the minor incursion , which became known as Hines ' Raid , local citizens and members of Indiana 's home guard pursued the Confederates and succeeded capturing most of them without a fight . Hines and a few of his men escaped across the river into Kentucky . 
 Morgan 's Raid , the Confederate army 's major incursion into Indiana , occurred a month after Hines ' raid . On July 8 , 1863 , General Morgan crossed the Ohio River , landing at Mauckport , Indiana , with 2 @,@ 400 troopers . Their arrival was initially contested by a small party from the Indiana Legion , who withdrew after Morgan 's men began firing artillery from the river 's southern shore . The state militia quickly retreated towards Corydon , Indiana , where a larger body was gathering to block Morgan 's advance . The Confederates advanced rapidly on the town and engaged in the Battle of Corydon . After a brief but fierce fight , Morgan took command of high ground south of town , and Corydon 's local militia and citizens promptly surrendered after Morgan 's artillery fired two warning shots . Corydon was sacked , but little damage was done to its buildings . Morgan continued his raid north and burned most of the town of Salem . 
 When Morgan 's movements appeared to be headed toward Indianapolis , panic spread through the capital city . Governor Morton had called up the state militia as soon as Morgan 's intention to cross into the state was known , and more than 60 @,@ 000 men of all ages volunteered to protect Indiana against Morgan 's men . Morgan considered attacking Camp Morton , the prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp in Indianapolis , to free more than 5 @,@ 000 Confederate prisoners of war imprisoned there , but decided against it . Instead , his raiders turned abruptly east and began moving towards Ohio . With Indiana 's militia in pursuit , Morgan 's men continued to raid and pillage their way toward the Indiana @-@ Ohio border , crossing into Ohio on July 13 . By the time Morgan left Indiana , his raid had become a desperate attempt to escape to the South . He was captured on July 26 in Ohio . 
 = = = Indiana regiments = = = 
 Many of Indiana 's regiments served with distinction in the war . The 19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment , 20th Indiana Infantry Regiment , and 27th Indiana Infantry Regiment suffered the highest casualties of the state 's infantry regiments as a percentage of the regiment 's total enrollment . 
 Indiana 's first six regiments organized during the Civil War were the 6th , 7th , 8th , 9th , 10th , and 11th Indiana infantry regiments . The men in these regiments volunteered for three months of service at the start of the war , but their brief terms provided inadequate ; most of these soldiers re @-@ enlisted for three additional years of service . 
 By the end of 1861 , forty @-@ seven Indiana regiments had mustered into service ; most of the men enlisted for terms of three years . The majority of the three @-@ year regiments were deployed in the western theater . In 1862 another forty @-@ one regiments from Indiana were mustered into service ; about half were sent to the eastern theater and the other half remained in the west . During 1863 six more regiments were mustered into service to replace the casualties of the first two years ' fighting , and on July 8 , 1863 , and additional thirteen temporary regiments were established during Morgan 's Raid into southern Indiana . The men in these temporary regiments enlisted for terms of three months , but the regiments disbanded once the threat posed by Morgan 's troops was gone . In 1864 twenty @-@ one Indiana regiments mustered into service . As the fighting declined , most of Indiana 's regiments mustered out of service by the end of 1864 , but some continued to serve . During 1865 fourteen additional Indiana regiments were mustered into a year of service . On November 10 , 1865 , the 13th Regiment Indiana Cavalry became the state 's final regiment to be mustered out of the U.S. Army . 
 The 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment , also known as the Indiana Zouaves , under the command of Lew Wallace , was the first regiment organized in Indiana during the Civil War and the first one to march into battle . The 11th Indiana fought in the Battle of Fort Donelson , the Siege of Vicksburg , the second day of the Battle of Shiloh , and elsewhere . In 1861 the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment became one of the first Hoosier regiments to see action in the war . The 9th Indiana fought in many major battles , including the Battle of Shiloh , the Battle of Stones River , the Atlanta Campaign , and the Battle of Nashville , among others . 
 The 14th Indiana Infantry Regiment was nicknamed the " <unk> Brigade " for maintaining its position at the Battle of Antietam . It secured Cemetery Hill on the first day of the three @-@ day fight at the Battle of Gettysburg , where it lost 123 of its men . The 19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment , part of the Iron Brigade , made critical contributions to some of the most important engagements of the war , including the Second Battle of Bull Run , but was almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Gettysburg , where it sustained 210 casualties . The 19th Indiana suffered the heaviest battle losses of any Indiana unit ; 15 @.@ 9 percent of its men were killed or mortally wounded during the war . The 27th Indiana Infantry Regiment earned the nickname " giants in the cornfield " at the Battle of Antietam . The regiment also fought at the Battle of Chancellorsville , the Battle of Gettysburg , and in the Atlanta Campaign . The 27th Indiana 's casualties were 15 @.@ 3 percent of its total enrollment , nearly as many as the 19th Indiana . 
 Most of Indiana 's regimental units were organized within towns or counties , but ethnic units were also formed , including the 32nd Indiana , a German @-@ American infantry regiment , and the 35th Indiana , composed of Irish Americans . The 28th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops , formed at Indianapolis between December 24 , 1863 , and March 31 , 1864 , was the only black regiment formed in Indiana during the war . It trained at Indianapolis 's Camp Fremont , near Fountain Square , and included 518 enlisted men who signed on for three years of service . The regiment lost 212 men during the conflict . The 28th participated in the Siege of Petersburg and at the Battle of the Crater , where twenty @-@ two of its men were killed . At the end of the war the regiment served in Texas , where it mustered out of service on November 8 , 1865 . 
 The last casualty of the Civil War was a Hoosier serving in the 34th Regiment Indiana Infantry . Private John J. Williams died at the Battle of Palmetto Ranch on May 13 , 1865 . 
 = = Politics = = 
 Hoosiers voted in favor of the Republicans in 1860 , and in January 1861 , Indiana 's newly elected lieutenant governor , Oliver P. Morton , became governor after Henry Smith Lane resigned from the office to take a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate . Hoosiers also helped Abraham Lincoln win the presidency in the 1860 election and voted in favor of his re @-@ election in 1864 . Although Lincoln won only 40 percent of the country 's popular vote in the U.S. presidential election in 1860 , he earned Indiana 's 13 electoral votes with 51 @.@ 09 percent of its popular vote , compared to Stephen Douglas 's 42 @.@ 44 percent , John Breckenridge 's 4 @.@ 52 percent , and John Bell 's 1 @.@ 95 percent . In the 1864 presidential election , Lincoln once again carried the state , this time by a wider margin , earning Indiana 's electoral votes with 53 @.@ 6 percent of the state 's popular vote compared to George McClellan 's 46 @.@ 4 percent . 
 As one of Lincoln 's " war governors " , Morton and the president maintained a close alliance throughout the war ; however , as war casualties mounted , Hoosiers began to doubt the necessity of war and many became concerned over the increase in governmental power and the loss of personal freedom , which resulted in major conflicts between the state 's Republicans and Democrats . 
 = = = Southern influence = = = 
 The Civil War era showed the extent of the South 's influence on Indiana . Much of southern and central Indiana had strong ties to the South . Many of Indiana 's early settlers had come from the Confederate state of Virginia and from Kentucky . Governor Morton once complained to President Lincoln that " no other free state is so populated with southerners " , which Morton believed kept him from being as forceful as he wanted to be . 
 Due to their location across the Ohio River from Louisville , Kentucky , the Indiana cities of Jeffersonville , New Albany , and Port Fulton saw increased trade and military activity . Some of this increase was due to Kentucky 's desire to stay neutral in the war . In addition , Kentucky was home to many Confederate sympathizers . Military bases in southern Indiana were needed to support Union operations against Confederates in Kentucky , and it was safer to store war supplies in towns on the north side of the River . Jeffersonville served as an important military depot for Union troops heading south . Towards the end of the war , Port Fulton was home to the third @-@ largest hospital in the United States , Jefferson General Hospital . 
 In 1861 , Kentucky 's governor Beriah Magoffin refused to allow pro @-@ Union forces to mobilize in his state and issued a similar order regarding Confederate forces . Governor Morton , who repeatedly came to the military rescue of Kentucky 's pro @-@ Union government during the war and became known as the " Governor of Indiana and Kentucky " allowed Kentuckians to form Union regiments on Indiana soil . Kentucky troops , especially from Louisville , which included the 5th Kentucky Infantry and others , at Indiana 's Camp Joe Holt . Camp Joe Holt was established in Clarksville , Indiana , between Jeffersonville and New Albany . 
 Jesse D. Bright , who represented Indiana in the United States Senate had been a leader among the state 's <unk> for several years prior to the outbreak of the war . In January 1862 , Bright was expelled from the Senate on allegations of disloyalty to the Union . He had written a letter of introduction for an arms merchant addressed to " His Excellency , Jefferson Davis , President of the Confederation . " In the letter , Bright offered the merchant 's services as a firearms supplier . Bright 's Senate replacement was Joseph A. Wright , a pro @-@ Union Democrat and former Indiana governor . As of 2015 , Bright was the last senator to be expelled by the Senate . 
 = = = Political conflict = = = 
 Hoosiers cooperated in support of the war effort at its outset , but political differences soon erupted into the " most violent political battles " in state 's history . The major debates , which also lead to violence , related to the issues of slavery and emancipation ; military service for African Americans ; and the draft . 
 On April 24 , 1861 , Morton addressed a special session of the Indiana General Assembly to obtain the legislature 's approval to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana 's troops . Morton also urged Indiana 's legislators to set aside party considerations for the duration of the war and unite in defense of the Union , but the Republicans and Democrats did not cooperate for long . Initially , the Democratic @-@ controlled legislature was supportive of Morton 's measures and passed the legislation he requested . After the state legislature adjourned in May , however , some of the state 's prominent Democrats changed their opinion about the war . In January 1862 the Democrats clarified their position at a state convention chaired by Thomas Hendricks . Indiana 's Democrats stated that their support for the integrity of the Union and the war effort , but opposed emancipation of black and the abolition of slavery . 
 After the elections in the fall of 1862 , Governor Morton feared that the legislature 's Democratic majority would attempt to hinder the war effort , reduce his authority , and vote to secede from the Union . After the legislative session convened in 1863 , all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation , including funding the state government or making tax provisions . This rapidly led to a crisis as the state government began to run out of money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt . Going beyond his constitutional powers , Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis . To obtain funds to run the state government , Morton turned to James Lanier , a wealthy banker from Madison , Indiana . On two occasions , Lanier provided the state with more than $ 1 million ( USD ) in unsecured loans . Morton 's move was successful , he was able to fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana . There was little the legislature could do but watch . 
 Indiana 's political polarity continued to worsen after the Emancipation Proclamation ( 1863 ) made freeing the slaves a war goal . Many of the formerly pro @-@ war Democrats moved to openly oppose the war , and Governor Morton began a crackdown on dissidents . During one notorious incident in May 1863 , the governor had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention in Indianapolis , causing what would latter be referred to as the Battle of Pogue 's Run . No regular session of the Indiana General Assembly was convened until June 1865 . 
 While most of the state was decidedly pro @-@ Union , a group of Southern sympathizers known as the Knights of the Golden Circle had a strong presence in northern Indiana . The group proved enough of a threat that General Lew Wallace , commander of Union forces in the region , spent considerable time countering their activities . By June 1863 , the group was successfully broken up . Many Golden Circle members were arrested without formal charges , the pro @-@ Confederate press was prevented from printing anti @-@ war material , and the writ of habeas corpus was denied to anyone suspected of disloyalty . In reaction to Governor Morton 's actions against dissenters , Indiana 's Democrats Party called him a " dictator " and an " underhanded mobster ; " Republicans countered that the Democrats were using treasonable and obstructionist tactics in the conduct of the war . 
 Confederate special agent Thomas Hines went to French Lick in June 1863 , seeking support for Confederate General John Hunt Morgan 's eventual raid into Indiana . Hines met with Sons of Liberty " major general " William A. Bowles , to inquire if Bowles could offer any support for Morgan 's upcoming raid . Bowles claimed he could raise a force of 10 @,@ 000 , but before the deal was finalized , Hines was informed that a Union force was approaching and fled the state . As a result , Bowles provided no support for Morgan 's raiders , which caused Morgan to harshly treat anyone in Indiana who claimed to be sympathetic to the Confederacy . 
 Large @-@ scale support for the Confederacy among Golden Circle members and Southern Hoosiers in general declined after Morgan 's Confederate raiders ransacked many homes bearing the banners of the Golden Circle , despite their proclaimed support for the Confederates . As Confederate Colonel Basil W. Duke recalled after the incident , " The Copperheads and <unk> fought harder than the others " against Morgan 's raiders . When Hoosiers failed to support Morgan 's men in <unk> numbers , Governor Morton slowed his crackdown on Confederate sympathizers , theorizing that because they had failed to come to Morgan 's aid in large numbers , they would similarly fail to aid a larger invasion . 
 Although raids into Indiana were infrequent , smuggling goods into Confederate territory was common , especially in the early days of the war when the Union army had not yet pushed the front lines far to the south of the Ohio River . New Albany and Jeffersonville , Indiana , were origination points for many Northern goods smuggled into the Confederacy . The Cincinnati Daily Gazette pressured both towns to stop trading with the South , especially with Louisville , because Kentucky 's proclaimed neutrality was perceived as sympathetic to the South . A fraudulent steamboat company was established to ply the Ohio River between Madison , Indiana , and Louisville ; its boat , the Masonic Gem , made regular trips to Confederate ports . 
 = = = Southern sympathizers = = = 
 While it is believed that they were not particularly numerous , the exact number of Hoosiers to serve in Confederate armies is unknown . It is likely that most traveled to Kentucky to join Confederate regiments formed in that state . At least one Hoosier , Sgt. Henry L. Stone of Greencastle , Indiana , rode with John Hunt Morgan when he raided Indiana . Former U.S. Army officer Francis A. Shoup , who briefly led the Indianapolis Zouave militia unit , left for Florida prior to the war , and ultimately become a Confederate brigadier general . 
 = = = Republican legislative majority = = = 
 After the elections in 1864 the state 's Republican legislative majority arrived at a critical turning point , as the North was slowly tightening its blockade of the South . The new Republican @-@ controlled legislature fully supported Morton 's policies and worked to meet the state 's commitments to the war effort . In 1865 the Indiana General Assembly validated the loans Morton had secured to run the state government , assumed them as state debt , and commended Morton for his actions during the interim . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 News of Confederate General Robert E. Lee 's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse , Virginia , reached Indianapolis at 11 p.m. on April 9 , 1865 , causing immediate and enthusiastic public celebrations that the Indianapolis Journal characterized as " demented " . A week later , the community 's excitement turned to sadness when news of Lincoln 's assassination arrived on April 15 . Lincoln 's funeral train passed through the capital city on April 30 , and 100 @,@ 000 people attended his bier at the Indiana Statehouse . 
 = = = Economic = = = 
 The Civil War forever altered Indiana 's economy . Despite hardships during the war , Indiana 's economic situation improved . Farmers received higher prices for their agricultural products , railroads and commercial businesses thrived in the state 's cities and towns , and manpower shortages gave laborers more bargaining power . The war also helped establish a national banking system to replace state @-@ chartered banking institutions ; by 1862 there were thirty @-@ one national banks in the state . Wartime prosperity was particularly evident in Indianapolis , whose population more than doubled during the war , reaching 45 @,@ 000 at the end of 1864 . 
 Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth in Hoosier cities and towns ushered in a new era of economic prosperity . By the end of the war , Indiana had become less rural that it previously had been . Overall , the war caused Indiana 's industries to grow exponentially , although the state 's southern counties experienced growth after the war at a slower rate than its other counties . The state 's population shifted to central and northern Indiana as new industries and cities began to develop around the Great Lakes and the railroad depots erected during the war . In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory in Indianapolis , founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company . Indianapolis was also the wartime home of Richard Gatling , inventor of the Gatling Gun , one of the world 's first machine guns . Although his invention was used in some Civil War @-@ era campaigns , it was not fully adopted for use by the U.S. Army until 1866 . Charles Conn , another war veteran , founded C. G. Conn Ltd. in Elkhart , Indiana , where the manufacturing of musical instruments became a new industry for the town . 
 Post @-@ war development was different in southern Indiana . The state 's commerce along the Ohio River was reduced during the war , especially after the closure of the Mississippi River to commercial trade with the South and increased competition from the state 's expanding railroad network . Some of Indiana 's river towns , such as Evansville , recovered by providing transport to Union troops across the Ohio River , but others did not . Before the war , New Albany was the largest city in the state , primarily due to its commerce with the South , but its trade dwindled during the war . After the war much of Indiana viewed New Albany as too friendly to the South . New Albany 's formerly robust steamboat @-@ building industry ended in 1870 ; the last steamboat built in New Albany was named the Robert E. Lee . New Albany never regained its pre @-@ war stature ; its population leveled off at 40 @,@ 000 , and only the antebellum , early @-@ Victorian Mansion Row district remains from its boom period . 
 = = = Political = = = 
 When the war ended , the state 's Democrats were upset about their wartime treatment by the Republicans , but they staged a quick comeback . Indiana became the first state after the Civil War to elect a Democratic governor , Thomas Hendricks . His rise to the governor 's office initiated a period of Democratic control in the state that reversed many of the political gains made by the Republican Party during the war . 
 Indiana 's U.S. senators were strong supporters of the radical Reconstruction plans proposed by Congress . Senators Oliver Morton , who was elected to the Senate after serving as Indiana 's governor , and Schuyler Colfax voted in favor of President Andrew Johnson 's impeachment . Morton was especially disappointed in Congress 's failure to remove him . 
 When the South returned to firm Democratic control at the end of the 1870s , Indiana , which was closely split between the two parties , was one of a few key swing state that often decided the balance of power in Congress and the presidency . Five Hoosier politicians were vice @-@ presidential nominees on the major party tickets held between 1868 and 1916 , as the nation 's political parties vied for the support of the state 's electorate . In 1888 , at the height of the state 's post @-@ war political influence , former Civil War general Benjamin Harrison was elected president , and served in that capacity from 1889 to 1893 . 
 = = = Social = = = 
 More than half of the state 's households , based on an average family size of four persons , contributed a family member to fight in the war , making the effects of the conflict widely felt throughout the state . More Hoosiers died in the Civil War than in any other conflict . Although twice as many Hoosiers served in World War II , almost twice as many died in the Civil War . After the war , veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing , food , and other basic needs . In addition , orphanages and asylums were established to assist women and children . 
 After the war , some women who had been especially active in supporting the war on the home front turned their organizational skills to other concerns , especially prohibition and woman suffrage . In 1874 , for example , Zerelda Wallace , the wife of former Indiana governor David Wallace and stepmother of General Lew Wallace , became a founder of the Indiana chapter of the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union and served as its first president . 
 = = = Memorials = = = 
 Numerous war memorials were erected to honor the Indiana veterans of the Civil War . Among the largest in Indiana is the Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Monument in downtown Indianapolis . After two decades of discussion , construction for the monument began in 1888 ; it was finally completed in 1901 .

 = Saw II = 
 Saw II is a 2005 American horror film , a sequel to 2004 's Saw and the second installment in the seven @-@ part Saw franchise , directed and co @-@ written by Darren Lynn Bousman . Co @-@ written with series creator Leigh Whannell , it stars Donnie Wahlberg , Franky G , Glenn Plummer , Beverley Mitchell , Dina Meyer , Emmanuelle Vaugier , Erik Knudsen , Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell . 
 The film features Jigsaw being apprehended by the police , but trapping the arresting officer in one of his own games while showing another game of eight people — including the officer 's son — in progress on TV monitors at another location . It also explores some of John Kramer 's backstory , providing a partial explanation of his reason for becoming Jigsaw . 
 After the financial success of Saw , a sequel was immediately green @-@ lit . Leigh Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing for their next film and were unable to write or direct . Bousman wrote a script called " The Desperate " before Saw was released and was looking for a producer but many studios rejected it . Hoffman received the script and showed it to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules . It was decided that , with some changes , it could be made into Saw II . Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script . The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto . 
 Saw II was released on October 28 , 2005 and , despite mixed reviews from critics , was a financial success , with opening takings of $ 31 @.@ 9 million and grossing $ 88 million in the United States and Canada . It has remained the highest grossing Saw film in those countries . Bell was nominated for " Best Villain " at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards for his role as Jigsaw in the film . Saw II was released to DVD on February 14 , 2006 and topped charts its first week , selling more than 3 million units . At the time , it was the fastest @-@ selling theatrical DVD in Lionsgate 's history . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As police investigate the scene of a Jigsaw " game " , in which an informant named Michael Marks was killed by a spike @-@ filled mask locked to his neck , Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner and lover , Eric Matthews , and calls him in . Despite not wanting to be involved with the case , already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel , Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks ' trap . There they find and apprehend John Kramer , the Jigsaw Killer , who is weak from cancer . He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house ; among them are Amanda Young , the only known survivor , and Daniel . A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours , but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game , simply sitting and chatting with Kramer , will see Daniel returned to him unharmed . At Kerry 's urging , Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal . 
 The victims are informed by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house ; one is in the room 's safe , and a cryptic clue is provided . Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door , which fires a bullet through the peephole and kills Gus . They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out , with no success : Obi , who is revealed by tape to have helped with the abductions , is burned alive in a furnace trap which contained two antidotes ; Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe @-@ filled pit intended for himself , and though she is able to retrieve the key , he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires . Throughout the game , they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before ; the sole exception is Daniel , who has nonetheless been arrested before . 
 Meanwhile , Kramer passes the time with both idle and cryptic chat , eventually telling Eric that his survival of a suicide attempt after his diagnosis is the true reason for his games . With the little time left to him , he wants to inspire in others the new appreciation for life he had found . Eric , not interested in any of this , runs out of patience and returns to the monitors . He destroys several of Kramer 's documents and sketches at Kerry 's suggestion , but fails to provoke Kramer . As the tech team arrives , Kramer reveals the connection between the victims : Eric has framed all of them for various crimes , and Daniel will be in danger if his identity is discovered . 
 Having left the others , Xavier returns to the safe room and finds a colored number on Gus ' neck . He kills Jonas , who followed him to the room , and begins hunting the others . Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding the clue revealing Daniel 's identity . Addison and Amanda abandon him , but Amanda returns after finding Jonas ' body . Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote , but her arms become trapped in the bladed arm holes , and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number . Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses . Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them . Amanda notes that he can 't read his own number , and he cuts the skin from his neck . As he approaches , Daniel , who feigned his collapse , jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw , killing him . 
 Having seen Xavier chasing his son , Eric brutally assaults Kramer and forces him to lead Eric to the house . Kramer 's sitting area is revealed to be a lift , which they use to leave the factory . The tech team tracks the video 's source and Rigg leads his team to a house , where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images . As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found Kramer , the timer expires and a large safe opens , revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask . Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom , where he is attacked by a pig @-@ masked figure . He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe ; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she intends to continue Kramer 's work after he dies . Amanda appears in the doorway and seals the door , leaving Eric to die . Outside , Kramer hears Eric 's screams and slowly smiles .

 Saw II was immediately green @-@ lit after Saw 's successful opening weekend a year earlier . Producers needed a script for a sequel but James Wan and Leigh Whannell , director and writer of Saw , were working on Universal Pictures 's Dead Silence . Music video director Darren Lynn Bousman had just completed a script for his first film The Desperate , and was trying to sell it to studios but was getting reactions that the script was very similar to Saw . A German studio eventually approached him with an offer to produce the film for $ 1 million . Just as they were looking for a cinematographer , the American cinematographer David A. Armstrong , who had worked on Saw , arrived on the scene and suggested showing the script to Saw producer Gregg Hoffman . Hoffman read the script and called Bousman wanting to produce " The Desperate " . After Hoffman showed the script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules , the two decided that " The Desperate " was the starting script they needed for Saw II and two months later , Bousman was flown to Toronto to direct . 
 Whannell polished the script , with input from Wan , in order to bring it into the Saw universe , but kept the characters , traps and deaths from " The Desperate " script . Bousman said , " But you could read the script for " The Desperate " and watch Saw II , and you would not be able to draw a comparison " . Wan and Whannell also served as executive producers . All the previous film 's crew members returned : editor Kevin Greutert , cinematographer Armstrong , and composer Charlie Clouser . This was to be Hoffman 's last film . He died unexpectedly on December 4 , 2005 . 
 Only those key cast and crew members who were involved in the film 's ending were given the full script ; the rest received only the first 88 pages . If a particular page was rewritten , the old page was shredded . Members were also required to sign confidentiality agreements requiring them not to release any plot details . Reportedly , " four or five " alternate endings were shot in order to keep the ending a surprise . Bousman gave the actors freedom to change dialogue in the script . He said that 95 % of the time , the actors went by the script , with about 5 % being adlibs , which he said " made all of the difference in the world " . Hoffman said in an interview with Fangoria that they listened to fans ' suggestions . For instance , instead of only showing the aftermath of a character violently dying in a flashback , they would allow it to unfold as it happened . This was in contrast to Saw , in which most of the violence was implied off @-@ screen . 
 = = = Filming and post @-@ production = = = 
 Saw II was given a larger production budget of $ 4 million , compared to Saw 's budget of a little over $ 1 million . The marketing budget was an additional $ 2 million . The first shot , which involved shooting police cars and a SWAT van driving around the industrial docklands outside the soundstage , was filmed on April 29 , 2005 in Toronto . After two months of pre @-@ production , principal photography took place over 25 days at Toronto 's Cinespace Film Studios from May 2 , 2005 to June 6 , 2005 . The ending was filmed on May 25 and 26 . The music and sound was recorded in July and Saw II was locked on July 16 . It was completely finished by September 9 . Visual effects were performed by <unk> Digital Pictures and post @-@ production services were provided by Deluxe . 
 = = = Trap designs = = = 
 David Hackl , the film 's production designer , took three weeks to construct 27 sets on a single sound stage . The puppet Billy , used in the series to give instructions to Jigsaw 's victims , was originally created by Wan out of paper towel rolls and papier @-@ mâché . Given the larger budget for the sequel , Billy was upgraded with remote @-@ controlled eyes and a servo @-@ driven mouth . In one trap , " The Needle Room " , Smith 's character Amanda is thrown into a pit of needles to find a key . In order for this to be done safely , four people , over a period of four days , removed the needle tips from syringes and replaced them with fiber optic tips . They modified a total of 120 @,@ 000 fake needles . However , this number was insufficient and the pit had to be filled with styrofoam and other materials to make it appear to have more needles . The needles that were apparently stuck into Smith were actually blunted syringes stuck into padding under her clothing . For certain shots , a fake arm was used . 
 Bousman came up with an idea whereby a character 's hands would get stuck in some sort of vessel and this resulted in the " Hand Trap " . It proved to be a challenge but after much discussion , Hackl , property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design . They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand @-@ holes on the underside . As soon as Vaugier 's character Addison put her hands into the holes razor blades would close in on her hands and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death . In order for the trap to be used safely , the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress 's hands , thus allowing her to slide her hands out . Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her hands into the trap as there was a lock with a key on the other side box that would have opened the contraption . 
 The original idea for the " Furnace Trap " came from the house having been a crematorium at some point , but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor , so it was instead decided that the furnace would be part of the house 's boiler system . The furnace was visualized in the form of a computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed . Using the computer model as a guide , the furnace was constructed in three days using cement board and tin with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd ( Obi ) could be filmed crawling inside . The furnace produced real flames and , in place of Burd , a stunt man using a fire @-@ retardant gel crawled into the fire .

 Saw II was released in New Zealand , the United States , and the United Kingdom on October 28 , 2005 ; and November 17 , 2005 in Australia . The original teaser poster showing two bloody , severed fingers was rejected by the Motion Picture Association of America . Since the poster was already released and managed to " slip by " the MPAA , they issued a release stating the poster was not approved and was unacceptable ; Lionsgate removed the poster from their websites . The image was used instead for the film 's soundtrack cover . Lionsgate held the second annual " Give Til It Hurts " blood drive for the Red Cross and collected 10 @,@ 154 pints of blood .

 The film received generally mixed reviews from critics , who praised the acting , particularly the performances of Bell and Wahlberg , while criticizing the gruesome nature of the story . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 36 % of 117 critics have given the film a positive review , with a rating average of 4 @.@ 6 out of 10 .

Metacritic , which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , gives the film a score of 40 based on 28 reviews . 
 Robert Koehler of Variety gave the film a negative review , saying " cooking up new Rube Goldberg torture contraptions isn 't enough to get Saw II out of the shadow of its unnerving predecessor " . Gregory Kirschling of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus , saying " Saw II is just barely a better B flick than Saw " and that both films are " more clever and revolting than they are actually chilling " . He praised Bell 's performance as Jigsaw , saying " As the droopy @-@ lidded maniac in the flesh , Tobin Bell is , for all the film 's <unk> , Saw II 's <unk> horror , a Terence Stamp look @-@ alike who calls to mind a seedy General Zod lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoer 's lair " . He ended his review : " Where Saw II lags behind in Saw 's novelty , it takes the lead with its smoother landing , which is again primed to blow the movie wide open , but manages a more compelling job of it than the original 's cheat finish " . 
 Kevin Crust of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review , calling Saw II a " worthy follow @-@ up to its grisly predecessor " . He said the story was " much more focused on an endgame than the original film . There are fewer credibility gaps and there are plenty of reversals to satisfy fans " . He criticized the use of numerous flashbacks , saying that it " rob [ s ] us of the pleasure of actually remembering for ourselves " . Laura Kern , writing for The New York Times , gave it a mixed review , saying that Bousman " delivers similar hard @-@ core , practically humorless <unk> and hair @-@ raising tension , but only after getting past a shaky beginning that plays more like a forensics @-@ themed television show than a scary movie " and called Greutert 's editing " crafty " .

 Kenneth George Doane ( born March 16 , 1986 ) is an American professional wrestler best known for his time with World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) where he wrestled on its Raw and SmackDown brands under the ring names Kenny and Kenny Dykstra . 
 Doane was trained by former professional wrestler Killer Kowalski , and made his wrestling debut at the age of fifteen in 2001 . He began working for Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) , per WWE request . In May 2003 , Doane made his WWE television debut as " Ken Phoenix " . During his time in OVW , he won the Television Championship once . After losing the title , Doane became part of the Spirit Squad faction . The team debuted on Raw in January 2006 , and won the World Tag Team Championship three months later . 
 Following the split of the Spirit Squad , Doane was the only member to remain on WWE television . He debuted to a new ring name " Kenny Dykstra " . In June 2007 , he was drafted to the SmackDown ! brand , but was released from his WWE contract in November 2008 . He later began working on the independent circuit , wrestling for promotions including Dragon Gate USA and Evolve .

 Doane made his professional wrestling debut in 2001 at the age of fifteen . He started his professional wrestling career in the New England area under the name " Broadway " Kenn Phoenix . He was later trained by professional wrestler and trainer Killer Kowalski in Malden , Massachusetts . After being contacted by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , he was asked to make appearances for their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling ( OVW ) . Doane made his first national television appearance in WWE at the age of 17 on the May 12 , 2003 episode of WWE Raw as Ken Phoenix . Along with his brother , Mike Phoenix , he was a participant in Rodney Mack 's ongoing " 5 @-@ Minute White Boy Challenge " where Mack defeated Caucasian wrestlers in under five minutes . Mack defeated the pair in 1 : 31 , forcing them both to submit to his new Blackout finishing hold . He made another appearance , losing to Lance Storm on an episode of Sunday Night Heat before being officially signed to a developmental deal and to OVW full @-@ time on June 4 , 2004 . On June 3 , 2005 , Doane had his first match , at the promotion , against Kenzo Suzuki , whom Doane defeated . Three weeks later , on June 25 , 2005 , he won the Television Championship from Deuce Shade . He had successful title defenses , but Doane lost the title to CM Punk on November 9 , 2005 .

 After losing the Television Championship , Doane became a part of the Spirit Squad , a faction using the in @-@ ring personas of male cheerleaders , using the name " Kenny " . On the January 23 , 2006 , episode of Raw , the group helped Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry " The King " Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler . They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels . The villainous McMahon brought in the Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions , including placing them in multiple handicap matches . 
 They also continued wrestling in the tag team division , and on April 3 , on Raw , the Squad won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey , with outside help from the other three Squad members , defeated the team of Big Show and Kane . After winning the championship , all five members of the team were recognized as the champions , allowing any combination of them to defend the championship . 
 Three weeks later , McMahon scheduled another handicap match , with the Spirit Squad facing Michaels . The match never started , however ; instead the Spirit Squad brutally beat down Michaels , ripping apart his ring attire and , as part of the storyline , shattered his knee with a steel chair . McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer ; however , Kenny snatched the sledgehammer away from him , disrespecting Triple H , which led to him attacking the group . Triple H and Michaels revived their former team , D @-@ Generation X ( DX ) , and began a feud with the Spirit Squad . DX played various sophomoric pranks on the team and the McMahons ( Vince and his son Shane ) , as well as defeating the Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night 's Main Event . 
 At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon , the team also wrestled other teams in Raw 's tag division over the World Tag Team Championship . The group successfully defended the tag team championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene , Charlie Haas and Viscera , and Snitsky and Val Venis . They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders , whom they eventually defeated to retain the title at Unforgiven . 
 The Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of Raw . After two consecutive losses to the debuting Cryme Tyme , Kenny attacked Mikey on the October 23 episode of Raw , and announced that he was going to defeat Flair . Kenny was successful , despite Flair attempting to even the odds by bringing other WWE Legends ( Dusty Rhodes , Sgt. Slaughter , and " Rowdy " Roddy Piper ) to the ring with him . It was then announced that Flair and a legend , selected by interactive voting , would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay @-@ per @-@ view in early November . The fans chose Piper , and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship . 
 The group disbanded on the November 27 Raw after losing a five @-@ on @-@ three match against Flair and DX . Later that night , DX placed all five members into a crate stamped " OVW , Louisville , Kentucky " , a reference to the developmental territory from which the Squad had come . 
 After the breakup of the Spirit Squad , he debuted new attire , new theme music , and a new name ; Kenny Dykstra , which was an homage to baseball player Lenny Dykstra . He became interested in joining the group Rated @-@ RKO , which consisted of Edge and Randy Orton . In order to join , he was told to prove himself first . He continued the feud with Ric Flair that led to the breakup of the Spirit Squad , managing to pick up three straight victories over Flair before finally losing to him . After the feud with Flair , Dykstra become a mainstay on Raw 's sister show Heat , having feuds with both Eugene and Val Venis . 
 He then formed a tag team with Johnny Nitro , but the duo split when Kenny was drafted to the SmackDown ! brand on June 17 , 2007 , as part of the WWE Supplemental Draft while Nitro was drafted to ECW .

 Dykstra made his debut on the July 6 , 2007 episode of SmackDown ! in a losing effort to the re @-@ debuting Chuck Palumbo . On the July 20 , 2007 episode of SmackDown ! , Dykstra participated in a 20 @-@ man battle royal for the World Heavyweight Championship and was eliminated by Chris Masters ; later on that evening , he lost to Matt Hardy in singles competition . 
 Dykstra formed an on @-@ screen relationship with Victoria on the July 27 episode of SmackDown ! . The two teamed together in mixed tag team matches , usually against Jimmy Wang Yang and Torrie Wilson or Chuck Palumbo and Michelle McCool . They also regularly accompanied each other to the ring for matches . 
 After a leave of absence from television in the first half of 2008 , Dykstra made his return on the August 15 episode of SmackDown , losing to WWE Champion Triple H. On November 10 , 2008 , WWE announced Doane had been released from his contract .

 On March 9 , 2010 , Doane , under his real name , wrestled in a tryout dark match for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling , losing to Homicide . On November 1 , 2010 , Doane announced that he had turned down a chance to wrestle another tryout match for TNA . On November 15 , 2011 , Doane wrestled a dark match for WWE at the SmackDown tapings in Bridgeport , Connecticut , losing to Justin Gabriel .

 Aucanquilcha ( pronounced : OW @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is a massive stratovolcano located in the Antofagasta Region of northern Chile , just west of the border with Bolivia and within the Alto Loa National Reserve . Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , the stratovolcano has the form of a ridge with a maximum height of 6 @,@ 176 metres ( 20 @,@ 262 ft ) . The volcano is embedded in a larger cluster of volcanoes known as the Aucanquilcha cluster . This cluster of volcanoes was formed in stages over eleven million years of activity with varying magma output , including lava domes and lava flows . Aucanquilcha volcano proper is formed from four units that erupted between 1 @.@ 04 @-@ 0 @.@ 23 million years ago . During the ice ages , both the principal Aucanquilcha complex and the other volcanoes of the cluster were subject to glaciation , resulting in the formation of moraines and cirques . 
 The cluster has generated lava ranging in composition from andesite to dacite , with the main volcano being exclusively of dacitic composition . Systematic variations in temperature , crystal and biotite content have been recorded during the evolution of the cluster . 
 At Aucanquilcha volcano there is some fumarolic activity , and sulfur deposits are found at the summit . Several sulfur mines lie in the complex . One mine at an altitude of 5 @,@ 950 metres ( 19 @,@ 520 ft ) was opened in 1913 and remained in use from 1950 to 1992 . It was the world 's highest mine during that period . Originally , sulfur obtained at the mine was transported down with llamas . Subsequently , an aerial cableway was employed to transport the sulfur to the town of Amincha . To bring the sulfur down , a road network to the summit was constructed in 1972 , although it is now impassable . 
 In 1986 , four men were reported to be living at an altitude of 5 @,@ 900 metres ( 19 @,@ 400 ft ) , making them the highest permanent residents on Earth . 
 = = Geography and geology = = 
 = = = Regional setting = = = 
 Aucanquilcha is part of the Central Volcanic Zone ( CVZ ) of the Andes , a highly silicic volcanic zone in South America . The CVZ generates magmas at a rate of 0 @.@ 11 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 026 cubic miles per millennium ) , one tenth of the global average of arc magma production , and lies about 135 – 180 kilometres ( 84 – 112 mi ) above the <unk> – Benioff zone . The arc has migrated eastward towards the high Andes from the Pacific Ocean coast since the Jurassic . The arc contains andesitic volcanoes , ignimbrites and compound volcanoes and has generated over 3 @,@ 000 cubic kilometres ( 720 cu mi ) of eruption products over 28 million years . 
 The Aucanquilcha complex lies northwest of the Altiplano – Puna volcanic complex ( APVC ) , a local large igneous province . The APVC is underpinned below at a depth of 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) by a slow seismic velocity zone that has been linked to the presence of 15 – 25 % of partial melts in the zone . The Aucanquilcha complex is much smaller <unk> than the APVC ignimbrites , but the duration of activity and the location indicate that Aucanquilcha is a <unk> of the APVC complex . 
 The long @-@ term magma output of Aucanquilcha is comparable to the magma output of other long @-@ term active volcanoes in the central Andes such as Ollagüe and <unk> . In all such cases , an early peak in magma output is followed by later lower @-@ volume activity ( 0 @.@ 1 – 0 @.@ 2 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 024 – 0 @.@ 048 cubic miles per millennium ) , followed by 0 @.@ 01 – 0 @.@ 02 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 0024 – 0 @.@ 0048 cubic miles per millennium ) ) . Unzen in Japan and Mount Duff and Lassen Peak in California have similar eruption histories . Such decreases may occur because of the <unk> load imposed by the edifices on the magma chambers and the increased travel distance of the magma through the edifice . 
 = = = Local setting = = = 
 Aucanquilcha is part of a cluster of volcanoes located between the Rio Loa and the Chile – Bolivia border . Aucanquilcha sits on top of a 2 @.@ 7 – 3 @.@ 3 mya andesite platform and rises more than 1 @,@ 400 metres ( 4 @,@ 600 ft ) over it . The main volcano is composed of an east @-@ west 8 @-@ kilometre ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) long chain of stratovolcanoes and has an estimated volume of 37 cubic kilometres ( 8 @.@ 9 cu mi ) . The maximum slope of the summit area is 25 ° . During the Cumbre Negra stage , a pyroclastic flow occurred on the northwestern side of the volcano . It covered 34 square kilometres ( 13 sq mi ) on a run of 10 square kilometres ( 3 @.@ 9 sq mi ) and now has a volume of 0 @.@ 3 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 072 cu mi ) . It was at first identified as a debris avalanche , but the lack of hummocky topography and the presence of large juvenile blocks identify it as a pyroclastic flow . One block in the flow and the lava dome from which the flow originated have been dated at 0 @.@ 6 mya . Lava flows , mostly from the summit areas , are dark to grey in colour and extend as far as 2 – 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 9 mi ) from their vents . It is likely that two small lava domes ( Cerro Cumbre Negra and Summit <unk> ) on the northwest flank occupy flank vents . To the north lies the 3 @.@ 3 mya old andesite Cerro Tres Monos ridge ; to the west lies the east @-@ west Cerro Polan and La Luna ridge . 
 The volcanic cluster of which Aucanquilcha is a part contains about 19 – 20 volcanoes and has generated about 340 cubic kilometres ( 82 cu mi ) of andesite and dacite over eleven million years . Covering a surface area of 700 square kilometres ( 270 sq mi ) , the cluster is surrounded on its northern , western and eastern sides by salt flats and alluvial deposits . On its southern side lies the Cerro Chela volcano . The cluster lies on a 70 @-@ kilometre ( 43 mi ) thick crust , and arid conditions since the Miocene have preserved its structures . Its volcanoes are arranged in north @-@ south and northwestern alignments , which may indicate a rupture of the crust above shallow magma reservoirs . 
 Aucanquilcha underwent a northwestward flank collapse , generating a debris avalanche deposit . The debris avalanche descended 2 @,@ 100 metres ( 6 @,@ 900 ft ) and ran for 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) with an azimuth of 211 ° , eventually covering an area of 59 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) . The flow was channeled between Miño Volcano and Cerro Cumbre Negra ( an eroded lava massif ) towards the dry Rio Loa valley , favouring the preservation of the slide deposit . The proximal parts of the slide are covered by younger eruptive products and also by moraines , indicating that the slide was followed by at least one glacial episode . The slide lacks the hummocky topography usually found on debris avalanches but has radial ridges and grooves . Another landslide occurred during the Redondo stage on the eastern side of the main volcano into the Salar de <unk> . It has the classic hummocky topography of landslides and covers a length of 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) and a surface area of 35 square kilometres ( 14 sq mi ) , roughly half of the surface area of the Mount St Helens avalanche of 1980 and one @-@ third of the surface area of the Ollagüe avalanche . A volume of 0 @.@ 35 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 084 cu mi ) is assumed based on a probable thickness of 10 metres ( 33 ft ) . 
 <unk> , the composition of the cluster ranges from andesite to dacite with SiO2 ranging from 62 @.@ 8 % to 65 @.@ 7 % . <unk> appear as lava flows while dacites form lava domes and dome complexes . The rocks from the main Aucanquilcha volcano are uniformly dacitic and show little evidence of temporal variation in their composition . Potassium content ranges from 1 @.@ 5 to 4 % . <unk> is the dominant component of the magma . <unk> + orthopyroxene + amphibole ( hornblende and <unk> ) or amphibole + biotite + minor amounts of pyroxene are subordinate components . <unk> , ilmenite , magnetite and zircon can also be found . There is evidence of magma mixing and mingling . 
 Rocks have a porphyritic texture . Basaltic andesites typically contain less than 10 % crystals while dacites generally have more than 20 % crystals . The Alconcha group lavas of the first one million years are crystal @-@ poor and lack biotite ; later lavas contain biotite and more crystals . Based on <unk> data , the highest temperatures occurred during phases of high activity and lower temperatures are associated with low output periods . It is likely that crustal feedback and increased deep crustal influx of mantle @-@ derived basalts drive increased magmatic flux . During the time of the Polan eruption on the west flank , magma output was spatially segregated with the peripheral Miño Volcano generating andesite lavas and the more central volcanos generating dacites . 
 Various parts of the main volcano have been subjected to hydrothermal alteration . The Azufrera stage edifice was subject to the most alteration ; especially in the summit area and between the Angulo and Azufrera summits lie sulfur rich talus deposits . The central part of the complex is heavily altered by fumarole activity . Hydrothermal alteration may be driven by the formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting hydrothermal circulation in overlying rocks . 
 = = = Eruptive history = = = 
 Eruption rates increased 6 million years ago , coinciding with magmas becoming more uniform in composition and the onset of strong hydrothermal alteration . It is possible that solidification of magmas below the volcano insulated the feeding channels from heat loss and caused the temperatures in the system to increase . Activity waned again 2 million years ago , with magma and included crystals being drawn from depths of 3 – 23 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 – 14 @.@ 3 mi ) and forming the Aucanquilcha volcano proper . The 10 @-@ million @-@ year duration of activity of the Altiplano – Puna volcanic complex systems is comparable to the duration of Aucanquilcha activity . The age of the lava flows ranges from heavily glaciated andesite flows overlying less @-@ eroded ones to possibly postglacial lava flows that may be tens of thousands of years old . 
 = = = = Aucanquilcha cluster = = = = 
 The Aucanquilcha cluster formed in four stages , each corresponding to a group . The Alconcha group , with seven volcanoes , is constructed from pyroxene , andesite and dacite and formed 11 – 8 mya . It is constructed from two northern composite cones , Alconcha and Volcan Tuco ( also known as Cerro Garage , dated 10 @.@ 96 @-@ 10 @.@ 51 mya ) , and five lava domes on the northeastern side of the cluster . Alconcha has a large breach on the southern side of its crater that is likely the product of a flank collapse but the avalanche deposit may be buried beneath younger material . Lavas within the breach are dated 10 @.@ 78 – 10 @.@ 43 mya . The centres of Volcan Tuco and Alconcha are heavily eroded , and Alconcha 's lavas and scoria lie on top of Tuco . The Ujina ignimbrite was erupted 9 @.@ 4 mya from an unknown vent and has a volume of 2 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 48 cu mi ) of dacite . While the vent location is unknown , the composition of the ignimbrite , and its dating and distribution , indicate an association with this group . The domes are poorly researched , with the <unk> dome dated 8 @.@ 9 – 8 @.@ 7 mya and Cerro Amincha 8 @.@ 01 . The total volume of this group is 46 cubic kilometres ( 11 cu mi ) , indicating a flux rate of 0 @.@ 013 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 0031 cubic miles per millennium ) . 
 The Gordo group , which erupted 6 – 4 mya following a probable 2 @-@ million @-@ year hiatus , is located in the southern and western parts of the cluster . Cerro Gordo itself ( 5 @.@ 49 mya ) has a crater that is breached westwards , exposing about twelve radial dykes but with no trace of a debris avalanche . One of the larger centres of the cluster , Gordo is associated with a lava field on its western side that is dated 4 @.@ 9 mya . Cerro Puquíos and Cerro Negro ( 5 @.@ 81 – 5 @.@ 28 mya ) lie on the southern side of the cluster , and glacial cirques cutting their northeastern flanks reveal layers of scoria and lavas . Puquíos has an amphitheatre structure on its western side . Paco Paco ( 4 @.@ 41 – 4 @.@ 27 mya ) is located north of most Gordo group volcanoes . It forms a 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) wide <unk> with a lava @-@ filled crater , and layers of scoria and agglutinated lavas dip from it . Volcan <unk> ( 4 @.@ 14 – 4 @.@ 12 mya ) sits southwest of the Puquíos @-@ Negro ridge . The Las <unk> lava field ( 5 @.@ 23 – 5 @.@ 13 mya ) is associated with the Gordo group but the vent locations are unknown . The total volume of this group is 55 cubic kilometres ( 13 cu mi ) , indicating a flux rate of 0 @.@ 027 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 0065 cubic miles per millennium ) . 
 The 3 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 3 mya Polan group , with ten dispersed volcanoes including Miño Volcano , is the largest group in the cluster and includes Tres Monos , La Luna , Cerro Polan , <unk> , Miño Volcano and the lavas of the Aucanquilcha platform . Cerro Polan 's ( 3 @.@ 5 – 3 mya ) eastern side is deeply dissected , and the exposed materials are heavily altered in the deeper sections . Lava fields to Polan 's west and southwest ( 2 @.@ 6 mya on one western field ) are associated with it . La Luna ( 2 @.@ 97 – 2 @.@ 57 ) lies just east of Polan ; these two volcanoes were probably one volcano in the past . La Luna has a lava dome surrounded by a glaciated but unaltered lava table . Cerro Tres Monos ( 3 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 78 mya ) forms a northbound 14 @-@ kilometre ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) long ridge with at least six vents . Hydrothermal alteration has affected some lavas and pyroclastics from Tres Monos , and the western side has lateral and terminal moraines . The Aucanquilcha platform ( 3 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 7 mya ) sits underneath the main Aucanquilcha volcano , and its lava mostly flowed north . Its southern side is a 4 @,@ 500 @-@ metre ( 14 @,@ 800 ft ) table with one hill , Cerro Campana , dated to 3 @.@ 3 mya . The platform presumably forms one third of the total volume of the Aucanquilcha cluster and may have originated from a part of the ridge of the La Luna @-@ Polan trend , now buried beneath Aucanquilcha . <unk> ( 2 @.@ 39 mya ) is a lava dome with moraines and two short lava flows ; it is the youngest Polan group volcano . The total volume of this group is 154 cubic kilometres ( 37 cu mi ) , indicating a flux rate of 0 @.@ 077 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 018 cubic miles per millennium ) . 
 After the four main phases , some scoria cones of basaltic composition , including <unk> and Luna de Tierra , formed between Aucanquilcha and Ollagüe . 
 = = = = Aucanquilcha proper = = = = 
 The main Aucanquilcha volcano formed in four stages . Between 1 @.@ 04 – 0 @.@ 92 mya the bulk of the volcano formed in the Azufrera stage . One lava flow toward the southwest is unusually long at 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) . A vent at 6 @,@ 116 metres ( 20 @,@ 066 ft ) altitude fed most of this edifice ; a second vent on the northern flank at the 5 @,@ 887 metres ( 19 @,@ 314 ft ) summit generated three lava flows , two shorter ones and a long one to the northwest . The Azufrera stage lavas are blocky dacites with large clasts and flow fronts up to 20 metres ( 66 ft ) high . These flows are moderately altered and have oxidation rinds . There is little evidence of explosive activity , but it may have been obscured by glacial erosion . The total volume is 21 @.@ 1 cubic kilometres ( 5 @.@ 1 cu mi ) , indicating a flux rate of 0 @.@ 16 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 038 cubic miles per millennium ) . This volcano was probably an isolated cone , but the existence of a previous stage cannot be excluded . 
 The second stage , named Rodado , lasted from 0 @.@ 95 to 0 @.@ 85 mya . It formed on the eastern slopes of the Azufrera volcano , with one vent at the 6 @,@ 073 metres ( 19 @,@ 925 ft ) summit . Rodado stage lavas are blocky and platy and usually thicker than Azufrera stage lavas . Some of the summit vent lavas are among the most vesicular of this stage . They are also less weathered ( oxidation rinds are c . 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) thick ) and less subject to <unk> alteration . The Cerro <unk> lavas are the oldest of this stage ; erupted from an unknown vent , they lack <unk> . The total volume is 9 @.@ 1 cubic kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 cu mi ) , indicating a flux rate of 0 @.@ 09 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 022 cubic miles per millennium ) . A flank collapse , possibly triggered by a large earthquake , occurred during this stage . 
 The third stage is the Cumbre Negra stage , named after the westernmost summit and principal vent of this stage , Cerro Cumbre Negra ( 5 @,@ 670 metres ( 18 @,@ 600 ft ) ) . The time course of its activity is less defined than the previous two stages ; it may have occurred between 1 – 0 @.@ 47 mya , but most likely 0 @.@ 6 – 0 @.@ 5 mya based on potassium – argon dating . Four lava flows derived from the main vent , all less than one kilometre long and 40 – 60 metres ( 130 – 200 ft ) thicker than previous stages . They all have hydration rinds but no native sulfur deposits . This stage generated Aucanquilcha 's only pyroclastic flow during a lava dome collapse as occurred on Merapi in Indonesia . The total volume of this stage is 0 @.@ 7 cubic kilometres ( 0 @.@ 17 cu mi ) , indicating a flux rate of 0 @.@ 005 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 0012 cubic miles per millennium ) . 
 The youngest stage , known as Angulo , lasted from 0 @.@ 66 to 0 @.@ 24 mya . It was centered between the Azufrera and Rodado stage edifices 0 @.@ 35 – 0 @.@ 23 mya . Most lava flows from this stage originate on a 1 @-@ kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) long ridge that includes Aucanquilcha 's highest summit . One crater on the northeast side of the ridge fed lavas to the north . Other than that , most flows extend southwards 4 – 9 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 6 mi ) from the vent , and with the exception of a due south flow 50 metres ( 160 ft ) thick they are thin , with thicknesses of 15 – 20 metres ( 49 – 66 ft ) . One of the oldest flows has been compared in length to the 50 % longer Chao Dacite flow but is much thinner . The flows from this stage are weakly weathered and partially overlie glacial deposits . The total volume is 5 @.@ 8 cubic kilometres ( 1 @.@ 4 cu mi ) , indicating a flux rate of 0 @.@ 015 cubic kilometres per millennium ( 0 @.@ 0036 cubic miles per millennium ) . 
 The volcano has active fumaroles though the low @-@ temperature fumaroles are not visible through short wavelength infrared data from satellites . <unk> activity was observed in 1962 . 
 = = Glaciation and hydrology = = 
 The volcano is currently <unk> despite its height , due to the aridity of the climate . The Quebrada de <unk> valley originates at the foot of Aucanquilcha . The Rio Loa river drains the western and northwestern sides of the volcano ; the eastern side drains into the Salar de Ollagüe salt pan , the northeastern into the Salar de <unk> , and the southeastern into the Salar de <unk> . Most valleys only intermittently transport water , if at all . 
 The volcanic cluster was modestly glaciated during the Quaternary , as evidenced by glacial striations and moraines at elevations above 4 @,@ 500 metres ( 14 @,@ 800 ft ) . The western Azufrera edifice was heavily glaciated in the past . At least three moraine stages have been mapped on that edifice , and on its southern side is found a modest cirque with glacially polished lavas on the floor . The Rodado stage edifice has several moraine stages on its southern slopes . Another small cirque with a moraine has been found in the northeastern side of the Cerro Cumbre Negra summit next to an Azufrera stage lava flow . A small moraine lies on the south side of the Angulo edifice ; some lavas from that edifice overlie glacial deposits . 
 = = Human activity and mining = = 
 A mine at 5 @,@ 950 metres ( 19 @,@ 520 ft ) altitude that yielded ore with 30 % sulfur was opened by Julian B. Carrasco in 1913 , who subsequently established the Compañía Minera y Azufrera Carrasco S.A in 1933 . The sulfur was transported down first with llamas , later through an aerial cableway system and finally by trucks . The sulfur was then transported to Chuquicamata to be converted into sulfuric acid . The mine was active from 1950 to 1992 . The last reported mining activity on the mountain was in 1994 . In 1977 other sulfur mines were present to the west between Cerro Polan and Cerro Gordo and south of the main Aucanquilcha massif . The cableway runs from the mine to a mining camp ( 5 @,@ 300 metres ( 17 @,@ 400 ft ) ) and from there to Amincha ( 3 @,@ 900 metres ( 12 @,@ 800 ft ) ) . The road leading up to the mine is dated 1972 and is now impassable because of rock falls . There is still a relic network of roads leading up to 5 @,@ 900 metres ( 19 @,@ 400 ft ) . 
 <unk> and other copper sulfides found in the area appear to have formed through <unk> <unk> mineralization above deep porphyry copper mineralization . The sulfur itself formed at temperatures of 450 ° C ( 842 ° F ) in a now extinct fumarole . 
 = = = Altitude and habitation = = = 
 The sulfur mine is notable for being the highest mine in the world at 5 @,@ 950 metres ( 19 @,@ 520 ft ) and the highest permanently inhabited area . An expedition in 1935 , part of the International High Altitude Expedition , found that miners lived at an altitude of 5 @,@ 300 metres ( 17 @,@ 500 ft ) in the town of <unk> and reached the higher mine on foot . The expedition found that an even higher abandoned village at 5 @,@ 639 metres ( 18 @,@ 501 ft ) existed , but miners refused to live there . The conclusion taken from the expedition was that 5 @,@ 334 metres ( 17 @,@ 500 ft ) was the highest habitable altitude . 
 West in 1986 reported that a few miners permanently lived in the mine area . A small group of men , caretakers of the mine , has lived at an altitude of 5 @,@ 900 metres ( 19 @,@ 500 ft ) in a galvanized iron hut . One of them reportedly had spent two years there . These are considered to be the highest human inhabitants on Earth . Research performed on Aymara miners of the Aucanquilcha mine indicates that they are fully acclimatized to the altitude , with less hyperventilation and higher hemoglobin than acclimatized people from lower areas . Their families are born and raised at lower altitudes , however . 
 = Harold A. Lafount = 
 Harold Arundel Lafount ( January 5 , 1880 – October 21 , 1952 ) was an American businessman who served on the Federal Radio Commission from 1927 to 1934 . He was the father of Lenore Romney ; the father @-@ in @-@ law of businessman and politician George W. Romney ; and the maternal grandfather of businessman and politician Mitt Romney . 
 English @-@ born , Lafount moved to the United States as a teenager and grew up in Utah . He managed several local businesses and was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints . Appointed to the Federal Radio Commission by President Calvin Coolidge , he was in charge of the zone covering the Western United States . Lafount played an important part in developments and decisions regarding the regulation of the broadcasting industry in the U.S. , favoring perspectives that saw radio broadcasting as a fundamentally commercial enterprise . He was also an early influence in making radio airtime available to political candidates and parties . 
 Lafount later managed a number of well @-@ known radio stations in the northeastern United States on behalf of Arde Bulova and served as president of the National Independent Broadcasters . A licensing issue regarding a station Lafount co @-@ owned resulted in a protracted regulatory and legal matter that was finally decided in the U.S. Supreme Court . 
 = = Early life and education , marriage and family = = 
 Lafount was born in Aston town within Birmingham , England , on January 5 , 1880 , the son of Robert Arthur Lafount , originally from <unk> , Worcestershire , and mother Emily . He had at least one sibling , a sister called Elsie . The family came with Mormon missionaries to the United States in 1893 and settled in Utah . 
 Lafount gained a degree in civil engineering from Utah State Agricultural College . He returned to England as a Mormon missionary himself , arriving in Liverpool in August 1902 and being dispatched to Sheffield . However , he returned to the U.S. from Sheffield ahead of schedule in May 1903 due to illness . 
 On October 28 , 1903 , Lafount married Alma Luella Robison ( born in Montpelier , Idaho , in 1882 ) . They had four daughters : Elsie ( born c . 1906 ) , Lenore ( born 1908 ) , Constance ( born c . 1911 ) , and Ruth ( born c . 1913 ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Lafount first worked as an assistant in his father 's hardware store in Logan , Utah , known as the Lafount Hardware Company , and then worked as its manager . He was in the hardware business for twelve years starting in 1903 . 
 Beginning in 1909 , while still living in Logan , Lafount held the position of general manager at the newly founded Pacific Land & Water Company of Salt Lake City , which acquired and developed land for agricultural and mining purposes . The company also had offices in Logan ; on one trip between the two cities , he escaped with only bruises when the gasoline tank of his automobile exploded , hurling him some forty feet . Lafount worked at Pacific Land & Water for ten years . He was then a receiver for the Sevier River Land and Water Company from 1923 to 1927 . By the mid @-@ 1920s , he was a manufacturer of earphones for crystal radio receivers . He knew prominent people socially , including LDS Church President Heber J. Grant and U.S. Senator from Utah Reed Smoot . 
 During the 1910s , the Lafount family had moved from Logan to Salt Lake City , where they lived in a large brick house located at Fifteenth South and Ninth East . From 1919 to 1924 , Lafount was bishop of the ward ( ecclesiastical and administrative head of his congregation ) in the same area where he lived . His wife worked for the church , was a leader in social charities , and gave well @-@ received dramatic readings . Daughter Lenore later described Harold as " a man of temper and drive " who was prone to angry outbursts . 
 = = Federal Radio Commission = = 
 Upon the recommendation of Senator Smoot , in November 1927 , President Calvin Coolidge appointed Lafount to the Federal Radio Commission ( FRC ) , a new federal body created by the Radio Act of 1927 to regulate radio use in the United States , and the first such separate agency . The commission had gotten off to a slow start earlier that year due to problems with vacancies ; Lafount was slotted for the Fifth Zone of the new entity , to replace original commissioner John F. Dillon , who had died shortly after taking that position . News of the appointment came as a surprise to the other members of the commission , since Lafount had little presence in the radio industry . 
 Upon arriving in Washington , D.C. , for his new position , Lafount wanted to thank the president personally . Told by an appointment secretary that he would need a new morning suit , Lafount spent $ 175 to get one . After Lafount went to the White House and gave a brief speech of thanks , President Coolidge in response said only , " In case of doubt read the law . Good @-@ day , sir . " Lafount began traveling and working for the commission right away . The United States Senate subsequently confirmed Lafount by voice vote on March 30 , 1928 . Three other commissioners were confirmed at the same time , two by voice votes . 
 Lafount 's zone covered the Rocky Mountain and Pacific states as well as the territories of Hawaii and Alaska . He traveled frequently , as part of visiting all kinds of radio stations in his large territory . At one point during 1927 – 1928 he took an 8 @,@ 200 miles ( 13 @,@ 200 km ) trip in the zone , where he interviewed over 700 people , including over 100 listeners , representing over 100 radio stations . At another time during 1930 he climbed to high elevations in southern Colorado to hear the reception that ranchers , sheepherders , and rangers received . Some smaller radio stations had unsponsored time available , and he proposed the creation of citizen @-@ based advisory boards to create programming for the benefit of community interests for such stations . Overall , however , he felt that too many small stations with weak signals were blocking reception of larger stations , and came to the conclusion that the number of stations should be reduced and the signals of the larger stations strengthened . 
 Over time , the commissioners ' activities became less bound to their particular <unk> . Accordingly , Lafount became responsible for coordinating FRC activities with other government agencies and entities . Lafount was in the public eye ; The New York Times ran 140 stories that mentioned him during his stint on the FRC . 
 During his first months on the commission , Lafount was an informal member of the allocating committee that led to the FRC 's 1928 reallocation of the commercial broadcast radio spectrum under General Order 40 . Lafount subsequently supported the action , which enabled the growth of advertiser @-@ based broadcasting but was criticized by some as a giveaway of a public resource ( in the form of clear @-@ channel frequencies ) to large business and media interests . By 1931 , Lafount was referring to General Order 40 as " the structure or very foundation upon which broadcasting has been built , and upon which the success or failure of every branch of the radio industry must depend . " 
 Lafount believed that radio could help bring about a sense of national unity , which he favored , and that " common sources of entertainment " were among those characteristics that " constitute [ d ] bonds for making our people homogenous . " However , he believed that radio programming should be based upon what listeners in the mass wanted to hear , and not upon what some central authority ( such as the BBC in the English model ) thought they would be best off hearing . Overall , Lafount was quite satisfied with the work of the FRC , writing in 1931 that " experts everywhere " agreed that the U.S. broadcasting system " is as perfect as it could be made . " 
 The question of the educational value of radio was a constant issue , and by 1931 Lafount was strongly in the camp of those who believed that educational programming was on the increase . He said that there were adequate frequencies and hours for such content and defended the FRC 's role in this regard . But he stressed that radio was fundamentally an instrument of commerce and that the FRC should take no action that might imperil that . In an oft @-@ quoted 1931 statement , Lafount said , " Commercialism is at the heart of the broadcasting industry in the United States . What has education contributed to radio ? Not one thing . What has commercialism contributed ? Everything – the lifeblood of the industry . " 
 However , the extent to which broadcast radio was dominated by advertising and by commercial interests became a hot topic , with members of the public requesting that Congress step in and take action . Lafount often warned commercial broadcasters that they faced a dismal future unless they mended their ways in this regard . In a 1932 speech before a St. Louis meeting of the National Association of Broadcasters , he said that " <unk> " was indeed a problem , and that radio broadcasters were " selling their birthright for a mess of pottage . " 
 After witnessing early mechanical television in action , Commissioner Lafount said that the FRC was doing all it could to help develop the still @-@ infant technology in terms of regulatory issues . He wrote in 1931 that , " I believe that television is destined to become the greatest force in the world . I think it will have more influence over the lives of individuals than any other single force . " This remark has been quoted in several books about the history of television . He at the same time proposed the censorship of television , in order that objectionable images not be seen and the amount of advertising not be excessive . 
 Lafount became acting chairman of the commission during the latter part of 1932 . Believing that the radio broadcasting system in the U.S. was " typically American " and " suits our democratic temperament as no other system I have yet encountered would , " he urged broadcasters to air political programming and advertising during the 1932 U.S. presidential election . He thus became influential in the development of federal regulations specifying that candidates and parties receive equal airtime . Although a Republican , Lafount told broadcasters that they should supply free airtime and publicity to the subsequent Roosevelt administration 's programs created under the National Industrial Recovery Act , in an effort to help the nation recover from the Great Depression . He refuted Republican accusations in 1933 that the Roosevelt administration was trying to censor radio broadcasts . 
 = = Subsequent radio industry career ; second marriage = = 
 Lafount stayed on the FRC until its replacement by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) in 1934 , but was not appointed to that body . The FRC role had enabled Lafount to know not just many government figures but also the people running the growing broadcasting industry . Upon leaving the FRC , he became head of the broadcasting interests of the Bulova Watch Company . Arde Bulova , chairman of the company , either owned or partly owned several radio stations . 
 On September 8 , 1938 , Lafount 's wife Alma died in Washington , D. C. at the age of 56 . He then married Gladys MacDonald on September 6 , 1939 , but she died in New York on June 14 , 1943 , at the age of 40 . During these years , Lafount split his time among residences in New York , Washington , and Salt Lake City . 
 By 1941 , Lafount was president of the National Independent Broadcasters , which represented some 200 radio stations ( out of 800 total in the nation ) , focusing on those that were not affiliated with any network . During World War II , Lafount served as chairman of the radio committee within the New York City War Fund and subsequently was a member of the radio committee within the National War Fund . 
 In 1942 , Lafount became president of the newly founded , New York @-@ based Atlantic Coast Network , a regional network of radio stations , most of which Arde Bulova had an interest in . These included the well @-@ known stations WNEW in New York , <unk> in Philadelphia , <unk> in New Haven , WNBC in Hartford , <unk> in Providence , and <unk> in Boston with <unk> in Baltimore and WWDC in Washington soon joining . He maintained this position through at least the late 1940s . He served as vice @-@ president of the <unk> Corporation , which ran <unk> , and the Greater New York Broadcasting Corporation , which ran WNEW ; both were part of the larger Bulova interests . He was also vice president of WNBC , a different station with those call letters in New Britain , Connecticut , and the Fifth @-@ Forty @-@ Sixth Corporation . 
 Lafount was also president of the Broadcasting Service Organization in Boston , which ran <unk> . As such , he was a principal in a long @-@ running regulatory and legal case . In 1937 , Lafount and two others , Sandford H. Cohen and George Cohen , had acquired 70 percent of <unk> , a radio station in Boston , with Lafount becoming president . Accordingly , effective control of the station passed to Bulova . But Lafount and the others allegedly concealed the transaction from the FCC . During 1943 and 1944 , the United States House Select Committee to Investigate the Federal Communications Commission , commonly referred to as the Lea Committee , held hearings on various aspects of broadcasting regulation . Lafount 's matter was the subject of several days ' investigation by that committee in Spring 1944 . By late 1945 , the FCC was threatening to not renew the station 's license . The three co @-@ owners said they had not consciously violated any regulations , because they thought FCC notification was only necessary if a single person gained more than half @-@ control of a station . The commission claimed that deception and false reports had continued throughout the 1937 to 1943 period . 
 In April 1947 , the FCC denied the license renewal , saying that Lafount and the other owners had shown " gross carelessness and willful disregard [ of facts ] " in giving false information about the ownership structure and financial status of the station . The agency sought other applicants for the 950 AM band frequency , while Lafount appealed their decision in federal court . In December 1948 , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the FCC on a 2 – to @-@ 1 decision , saying that the FCC had acted " arbitrarily , capriciously , and unreasonably " in refusing the renewal . The U.S. Justice Department appealed , however , and in May 1949 , the United States Supreme Court handed down a brief , unsigned , unanimous decision that overturned the appeals court and stated that the FCC acted within its power when it refused the license renewal for Lafount and the other owners . The station , which had stayed on the air via temporary licenses , went off the air on May 30 , 1949 . ( The station returned in October 1950 , under new ownership . ) 
 = = Death and family legacy = = 
 Lafount died in Detroit , Michigan , on October 21 , 1952 , at age 72 in the home of his daughter Lenore . He was survived by his mother , his sister , and his four daughters . Broadcasting magazine wrote upon his passing that " Lafount was an important influence in the early development of radio regulation . " 
 George Romney had first moved to Washington , D.C. , in 1929 in order to remain near Lenore Lafount following her father 's appointment to the FRC . They married in 1931 . Social connections through the <unk> enabled George to gain greater visibility in Washington business and political circles during the 1930s . By the late 1940s , Harold Lafount had been so impressed with his son @-@ in @-@ law that he asked lawyers to investigate whether the latter 's Mexican birth would still make him eligible to run for president ; they reported in the affirmative . 
 Following Lafount 's death , George became chairman and president of American Motors Corporation and Governor of Michigan . He did indeed run for president in 1968 , but the campaign was unsuccessful , after which he became U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . However , George 's son , Mitt Romney ( of whom Lafount is the maternal grandfather ) , became cofounder and CEO of Bain Capital , president and CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics , and Governor of Massachusetts , and was the nominee of the Republican Party in the 2012 U.S. presidential election . 
 = Baynard 's Castle = 
 Baynard 's Castle refers to buildings on two neighbouring sites in London , between where Blackfriars station and St Paul 's Cathedral now stand . The first was a Norman fortification constructed by Ralph Baynard and demolished by King John in 1213 . The second was a medieval palace built a short distance to the southeast and destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 . According to Sir Walter Besant , " There was no house in [ London ] more interesting than this " . The original castle was built at the point where the old Roman walls and River Fleet met the River Thames , just east of what is now Blackfriars station . The Norman castle stood for over a century before being demolished by King John in 1213 . It appears to have been rebuilt after the barons ' revolt , but the site was sold in 1276 to form the precinct of the great priory of Blackfriars . 
 About a century later , a new mansion was constructed on land that had been reclaimed from the Thames , southeast of the first castle . The house was rebuilt after 1428 , and became the London headquarters of the House of York during the Wars of the Roses . Both King Edward IV and Queen Mary I of England were crowned at the castle . 
 The house was reconstructed as a royal palace by Henry VII at the end of the 15th century , and Henry VIII gave it to Catherine of Aragon on the eve of their wedding . After Henry 's death the house came into the hands of Catherine Parr 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , the Earl of Pembroke who built a large extension around a second courtyard in about 1551 . The Pembroke family took the side of Parliament in the Civil War , and after the Restoration the house was occupied by the Earl of Shrewsbury , a Royalist . Baynard 's Castle was left in ruins after the Great Fire of London in 1666 , although fragments survived into the 19th century . The site is now occupied by a BT office called Baynard House , but the castle is commemorated in Castle Baynard Street and the Castle Baynard ward of the City of London .
