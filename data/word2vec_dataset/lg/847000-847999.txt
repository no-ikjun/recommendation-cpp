 The leaves of N. rajah are very distinctive and reach a large size . They are leathery in texture with a wavy outer margin . The leaves are characteristically peltate , whereby the tendril joins the lamina on the underside , before the apex . This characteristic is more pronounced in N. rajah than in any other Nepenthes species , with the exception of N. <unk> . However , it is not unique to these two taxa , as mature plants of many Nepenthes species display slightly peltate leaves . The tendrils are inserted ≤ 5 cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50 cm . Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the lamina and <unk> ( branching ) veins run towards the margin . The lamina is oblong to lanceolate @-@ shaped , ≤ 80 cm long and ≤ 15 cm wide . 
 = = = Pitchers = = = 
 All Nepenthes pitchers share several basic characteristics . Traps consist of the main pitcher cup , which is covered by an operculum or lid that prevents rainwater from entering the pitcher and displacing or diluting its contents . A reflexed ring of hardened tissue , known as the peristome , surrounds the entrance to the pitcher ( only the aerial pitchers of N. inermis lack a peristome ) . A pair of fringed wings run down the front of lower traps and these presumably serve to guide terrestrial insects into the pitchers ' mouth . Accordingly , the wings are greatly reduced or completely lacking in aerial pitchers , for which flying insects constitute the majority of prey items . 
 Nepenthes rajah , like most species in the genus , produces two distinct types of traps . " Lower " or " terrestrial " pitchers are the most common . These are very large , richly coloured , and ovoid in shape . In lower pitchers , the tendril attachment occurs at the front of the pitcher cup relative to the peristome and wings . Exceptional specimens may be more than 40 cm in length and hold 3 @.@ 5 litres of water and in excess of 2 @.@ 5 litres of digestive fluid , although most do not exceed 200 ml . 
 The largest recorded pitcher of N. rajah , measuring 41 cm , was found on March 26 , 2011 , during a trip to Mesilau organised by The Sabah Society . The trap was discovered next to a steep <unk> of the Mesilau nature trail and was measured by Alex Lamb , son of Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb , who were also on the trip . It was collected for preservation at Mesilau Headquarters . Another trap measuring 40 cm was spotted on the same day . The previous record for a N. rajah pitcher was 38 cm . 
 The lower pitchers of N. rajah are probably the largest in the genus by volume , rivaled only by those of N. <unk> , N. truncata and the giant form of N. rafflesiana . These traps rest on the ground and are often reclined , leaning against surrounding objects for support . They are usually red to purple on the outside , whilst the inside surfaces are lime green to purple . This contrasts with all other parts of the plant , which are yellow @-@ green . The lower pitchers of N. rajah are unmistakable and for this reason it is easy to distinguish it from all other Bornean Nepenthes species . 
 Mature plants may also produce " upper " or " aerial " pitchers , which are much smaller , funnel @-@ shaped , and usually less colourful than the lowers . The tendril attachment in upper pitchers is normally present at the rear of the pitcher cup . True upper pitchers are seldom seen , as the stems of N. rajah rarely attain lengths greater than a few metres before dying off and being replaced by off @-@ shoots from the main rootstock . 
 Upper and lower pitchers differ significantly in morphology , as they are specialised for attracting and capturing different prey . Pitchers that do not fall directly into either category are simply known as " intermediate " pitchers . 
 The peristome of N. rajah has a highly distinctive scalloped edge and is greatly expanded , forming an attractive red lip around the trap 's mouth . A series of raised protrusions , known as ribs , intersect the peristome , ending in short , sharp teeth that line its inner margin . The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 80 % of its total cross @-@ sectional surface length in this species . Two fringed wings run from the tendril attachment to the lower edge of the peristome . 
 The huge , vaulted lid of N. rajah , the largest in the genus , is another distinguishing characteristic of this species . It is ovate to oblong in shape and has a distinct keel running down the middle , with two prominent lateral veins . The spur at the back of the lid is approximately 20 mm long and unbranched . 
 Nepenthes rajah is noted for having very large nectar @-@ secreting glands covering its pitchers . These are quite different from those of any other Nepenthes and are easily recognisable . The inner surface of the pitcher , in particular , is wholly glandular , with 300 to 800 glands / cm ² . 
 = = = Flowers = = = 
 Nepenthes rajah seems to flower at any time of the year . Flowers are produced in large numbers on inflorescences that arise from the apex of the main stem . N. rajah produces a very large inflorescence that can be 80 cm , and sometimes even 120 cm tall . The individual flowers of N. rajah are produced on partial peduncles ( twin stalks ) and so the inflorescence is called a raceme ( as opposed to a panicle for multi @-@ flowered bunches ) . The flowers are reported to give off a strong sugary smell and are brownish @-@ yellow in colour . <unk> are elliptic to oblong and ≤ 8 mm long . Like all Nepenthes species , N. rajah is dioecious , which means that individual plants produce flowers of a single sex . Fruits are orange @-@ brown and 10 to 20 mm long ( see image ) . A study of 300 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen ( <unk> <unk> , collected at an altitude of 1930 – 2320 m ) found the mean pollen diameter to be 34 @.@ 7 μm ( SE 
 = 0 @.@ 3 ; CV = 
 7 @.@ 0 % ) . 
 = = = Other characteristics = = = 
 The root system of N. rajah is notably extensive , although it is relatively shallow as in most Nepenthes species . 
 All parts of the plant are covered in long , white hairs when young , but mature plants are virtually glabrous ( lacking hair ) . This covering of hair is known as the indumentum . 
 The colour of herbarium specimens is dark @-@ brown in varying hues ( see image ) . 
 Little variation has been observed within natural populations of Nepenthes rajah and , consequently , no forms or varieties have been described . Furthermore , N. rajah has no true nomenclatural synonyms , unlike many other Nepenthes species , which exhibit greater variability .

 Nepenthes rajah is a carnivorous plant of the pitfall trap variety . It is famous for occasionally trapping vertebrates , even small mammals . There exist at least two records of drowned rats found in N. rajah pitchers . The first observation dates from 1862 and was made by Spenser St. John , who accompanied Hugh Low on two ascents of Mount Kinabalu . In 1988 , Anthea Phillipps and Anthony Lamb confirmed the plausibility of this record when they managed to observe drowned rats in a large pitcher of N. rajah . In 2011 , the discovery of a drowned mountain treeshrew ( Tupaia montana ) in a N. rajah pitcher was reported . 
 Nepenthes rajah is also known to occasionally trap other small vertebrates , including frogs , lizards and even birds , although these cases probably involve sick animals , or those seeking shelter or water in the pitcher , and certainly do not represent the norm . Insects , and particularly ants , comprise the majority of prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers . Other arthropods , such as centipedes , also fall prey to N. rajah . 
 Nepenthes rafflesiana is one of the few other Nepenthes species reliably documented as having caught mammalian prey in its natural habitat . In Brunei , frogs , geckos and skinks have been found in the pitchers of this species . The remains of mice have also been reported . On September 29 , 2006 , at the Jardin botanique de Lyon in France , a cultivated N. truncata was photographed containing the decomposing corpse of a mouse . 
 = = = Mutualism with mammals = = = 
 Nepenthes rajah has evolved a mutualistic relationship with mountain treeshrews ( Tupaia montana ) in order to collect their droppings . The inside of the reflexed lid exudes a sweet nectar . The distance from the pitcher mouth to the exudate is the same as the average body length of the mountain treeshrew . These proportions also hold true for N. lowii and N. macrophylla . As it feeds , the treeshrew defecates , apparently as a method of marking its feeding territory . It is thought that in exchange for providing nectar , the faeces provide N. rajah with the majority of the nitrogen it requires . In N. lowii , N. macrophylla and N. rajah , the colour of the lower lid surface corresponds to visual sensitivity maxima of the mountain treeshrew in the green and blue <unk> , making the lid underside stand out against adjacent parts of the pitcher . Of the three species , N. rajah shows the tightest ' fit ' , particularly in the green waveband . 
 In 2011 , it was reported that N. rajah has a similar mutualistic relationship with the summit rat ( Rattus <unk> ) . Whereas the mountain treeshrew visits pitchers during daylight hours , the summit rat is primarily active at night ; this may be an example of resource partitioning . Daily scat deposition rates were found to be similar for both mammalian species . 
 = = Other interactions with animals = = 
 = = = Pitcher infauna = = = 
 Although Nepenthes are most famous for trapping and digesting animals , their pitchers also play host to a large number of other organisms ( known as infauna ) . These include fly and midge larvae , spiders ( most notably the crab spider <unk> <unk> ) , mites , ants , and even a species of crab , <unk> <unk> . The most common and conspicuous predators found in pitchers are mosquito larvae , which consume large numbers of other larvae during their development . Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else , and are referred to as <unk> . 
 The complex relationships between these various organisms are not yet fully understood . The question of whether infaunal animals " steal " food from their hosts , or whether they are involved in a mutually beneficial ( symbiotic ) association has yet to be investigated experimentally and is the source of considerable debate . Clarke suggests that mutualism is a " likely situation " , whereby " the infauna receives domicile , protection and food from the plant , while in return , the infauna helps to break down the prey , increase the rate of digestion and keep bacterial numbers low " . 
 = = = Species specific = = = 
 As the size and shape of Nepenthes pitchers vary greatly between species , but little within a given taxon , it is not surprising that many infaunal organisms are specially adapted to life in only the traps of particular species . N. rajah is no exception , and in fact has two mosquito taxa named after it . Culex ( <unk> ) rajah and Toxorhynchites ( Toxorhynchites ) rajah were described by <unk> Tsukamoto in 1989 , based on larvae collected in pitchers of N. rajah on Mount Kinabalu three years earlier . The two species were found to live in association with larvae of Culex ( <unk> ) <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> and an undescribed taxon , <unk> ( <unk> ) sp . No. 2 . Concerning C. rajah , Tsukamoto noted that the " body surface of most larvae are covered in <unk> @-@ like protozoa " . At present , nothing is known of this species with regards to its adult biology , habitat , or medical importance as a vector of diseases . The same is true for T. rajah ; nothing is known of its biology except that adults are not <unk> . 
 Another species , Culex shebbearei , has also been recorded as an infaunal organism of N. rajah in the past . The original 1931 record by F. W. Edwards is based on a collection by H. M. Pendlebury in 1929 from a plant growing on Mount Kinabalu . However , Tsukamoto notes that in light of new information on these species , " it seems more likely to conclude that the species [ C. rajah ] is a new species which has been <unk> as C. shebbearei for a long time , rather than to think that both C. shebbearei and C. rajah n. sp. are living in pitchers of Nepenthes rajah on Mt . Kinabalu " . 
 = = = Pests = = = 
 Not all interactions between Nepenthes and fauna are beneficial to the plant . Nepenthes rajah is sometimes attacked by insects which feed on its leaves and damage substantial portions of the lamina . Also , monkeys and tarsiers are known to occasionally rip pitchers open to feed on their contents .

 See also : Timeline of Nepenthes rajah and its natural hybrids 
 Due to its size , unusual morphology and striking colouration , N. rajah has always been a very popular and highly sought @-@ after insectivorous plant . However , despite its popularity amongst pitcher plant enthusiasts , N. rajah remains a little @-@ known species outside the field of carnivorous plants . Due to its specialised growing requirements , it is not a suitable candidate for a houseplant and , as such , is only cultivated by a relatively small number of hobbyists and professional growers worldwide . This being the case , N. rajah is nonetheless probably the most famous of all pitcher plants . Its reputation for producing some of the most magnificent pitchers in the genus dates back to the late 19th century . 
 Nepenthes rajah was first collected by Hugh Low on Mount Kinabalu in 1858 . It was described the following year by Joseph Dalton Hooker , who named it after James Brooke , the first White Rajah of Sarawak . The description was published in The Transactions of the Linnean Society of London :

LXXII . ) 
 Hab . — Borneo , north coast , on Kina Balu , alt . 5 @,@ 000 feet ( Low ) . This wonderful plant is certainly one of the most striking vegetable productions hitherto discovered , and , in this respect , is worthy of taking place side by side with the Rafflesia <unk> . It hence bears the title of my friend Rajah Brooke , of whose services , in its native place , it may be commemorative among botanists . . . . I have only two specimens of leaves and pitchers , both quite similar , but one twice as large as the other . Of these , the leaf of the larger is 18 inches long , exclusive of the petioles , which is as thick as the thumb and 7 – 8 broad , very <unk> and glabrous , with indistinct nerves . The stipes of the pitcher is given off below the apex of the leaf , is 20 inches long , and as thick as the finger . The broad ampullaceous pitcher is 6 inches in diameter , and 12 long : it has two fimbriated wings in front , is covered with long rusty hairs above , is wholly studded with glands within , and the broad annulus is everted , and 1 – 1 ½ inch in diameter . Operculum shortly stipitate , 10 inches long and 8 broad . 
 The inflorescence is hardly in proportion . Male raceme , 30 inches long , of which 20 are occupied by the flowers ; upper part and flowers clothed with short rusty pubescence . Peduncles slender , simple or bifid . Fruiting raceme stout . Peduncles 1 ½ inches long , often bifid . Capsule , ¾ inch long , ⅓ broad , rather turgid , densely covered with rusty tomentum . 
 Spenser St. John wrote the following account of his encounter with N. rajah on Mount Kinabalu in Life in the Forests of the Far East published in 1862 : 
 Another steep climb of 800 feet brought us to the <unk> <unk> spur , to the spot where the ground was covered with the magnificent pitcher @-@ plants , of which we had come in search . This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah , and is a plant about four feet in length , with broad leaves stretching on every side , having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it . Their shape and size are remarkable . I will give the measurement of one , to indicate the form : the length along the back nearly fourteen inches ; from the base to the top of the column in front , five inches ; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad , and of an oval shape . Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile , which near the column was two inches broad , lessening in its narrowest part to three @-@ quarters of an inch . The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves . Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep , so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner . The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple , but that of the others is generally mauve outside , very dark indeed in the lower part , though lighter towards the rim ; the inside is of the same colour , but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance . The lid is mauve in the centre , shading to green at the edges . The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male , and the former were far less numerous than the latter . It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature . [ ... ] The pitchers , as I have before observed , rest on the ground in a circle , and the young plants have cups of the same form as those of the old ones . While the men were cooking their rice , we sat before the tent enjoying our chocolate and observing one of our followers carrying water in a splendid specimen of the Nepenthes Rajah , desired him to bring it to us , and found that it held exactly four pint bottles . It was 19 inches in circumference . We afterwards saw others apparently much larger , and Mr. Low , while wandering in search of flowers , came upon one in which was a drowned rat . 
 Nepenthes rajah was first collected for the Veitch Nurseries by Frederick William Burbidge in 1878 , during his second trip to Borneo . Shortly after being introduced into cultivation in 1881 , N. rajah proved very popular among wealthy Victorian horticulturalists and became a much sought @-@ after species . A note in The Gardeners ' Chronicle of 1881 mentions the Veitch plant as follows : " N. rajah at present is only a young Rajah , what it will become was lately illustrated in our columns ... " . A year later , young N. rajah plants were displayed at the Royal Horticultural Society 's annual show for the first time . The specimen exhibited at the show by the Veitch Nurseries , the first of this species to be cultivated in Europe , won a first class certificate . In Veitch 's catalogue for 1889 , N. rajah was priced at £ <unk> per plant . During this time , interest in Nepenthes had reached its peak . The Garden reported that Nepenthes were being propagated by the thousands to keep up with European demand . 
 However , dwindling interest in Nepenthes at the turn of the century saw the demise of the Veitch Nurseries and consequently the loss of several species and hybrids in cultivation , including N. <unk> and N. rajah . By 1905 , the final N. rajah specimens from the Veitch nurseries were gone , as the cultural requirements of the plants proved too difficult to reproduce . The last surviving N. rajah in cultivation at this time was located at the National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin in Ireland , however this soon perished also . It would be many years before N. rajah was reintroduced into cultivation . 
 = = = Recent popularity = = = 
 In recent years there has been renewed interest in Nepenthes worldwide . Much of the plants ' current popularity can probably be attributed to Shigeo Kurata , whose book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu ( 1976 ) , which featured the best colour photography of Nepenthes to date , did much to bring attention to these unusual plants . 
 Not surprisingly , N. rajah is a relatively well known plant in Malaysia , especially its native Sabah . The species is often used to promote Sabah , and specifically Kinabalu National Park , as a tourist destination , and features prominently on postcards from the region . Nepenthes rajah has appeared on the covers of several popular Nepenthes publications , including Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu ( Kurata , 1976 ) and Nepenthes of Borneo ( Clarke , 1997 ) , both published in Kota Kinabalu , Malaysia . On April 6 , 1996 , Malaysia issued a series of four postage stamps depicting some of its more famous Nepenthes species . Two 30 ¢ stamps , featuring N. <unk> and N. sanguinea , as well as two 50 ¢ stamps , depicting N. lowii and N. rajah , were released . The N. rajah stamp has been assigned a unique identification number in two popular stamp numbering systems : Scott # 580 and <unk> # 600 . Curiously , the peltate leaf attachment that is so characteristic of this species is not shown . Nepenthes rajah was featured in the first episode of Kingdom of Plants 3D , a natural history documentary series presented by David Attenborough . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Nepenthes rajah is not generally considered to be closely related to any other species , due to its unusual pitcher and leaf morphology . However , several attempts have been made to deduce natural groupings within the Nepenthes genus , which have grouped N. rajah with other species thought to share certain traits with it . 
 The Nepenthes were first split up in 1873 , when Hooker published his monograph on the genus , titled " Nepenthaceae " . Hooker distinguished N. <unk> from all other taxa based on its seeds , which lack the appendages typical of most Nepenthes . He placed it in the monotypic subgenus <unk> . All other species were subsumed in the second subgenus , Eunepenthes . 
 A second attempt to establish a natural subdivision within the genus was made in 1895 by Günther Beck von <unk> und <unk> in " Die Gattung Nepenthes " . Beck kept the two subgenera created by Hooker , but divided Eunepenthes into three subgroups : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Nepenthes rajah formed part of the <unk> ( Latin : pl. of <unk> : not frosted ) . 
 Nepenthes taxonomy was once again revised in 1908 by John Muirhead Macfarlane in his own monograph , " Nepenthaceae " . Oddly , Macfarlane did not name the groups he distinguished . His revision is not generally considered to be a natural division of the genus . 
 In 1928 , B. H. Danser published his seminal monograph , " The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies " , in which he divided Nepenthes into six clades , based on observations of herbarium material . The clades were : the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Regiae , Insignes and <unk> . Danser placed N. rajah in the Regiae ( Latin : pl. of <unk> : royal ) . The Regiae clade as proposed by Danser is shown in the table to the right . 
 Most of the species in this clade are large plants with <unk> leaves , an indumentum of coarse reddish @-@ brown hairs , raceme @-@ like inflorescence , and funnel @-@ shaped ( <unk> ) upper pitchers . All bear a characteristic appendage on the lower surface of the lid near the apex . With the exception of N. lowii , the Regiae all have a mostly flattened or expanded peristome . The majority of species comprising Regiae are endemic to Borneo . Based on current understanding of the genus , Regiae appears to reflect the relationships of its members quite well , although the same cannot be said for the other clades . Despite this , Danser 's classification was undoubtedly a great improvement on previous attempts . 
 The taxonomical work of Danser ( 1928 ) was revised by Hermann Harms in 1936 . Harms divided Nepenthes into three subgenera : Anurosperma <unk> ( 1873 ) , Eunepenthes <unk> ( 1873 ) and Mesonepenthes Harms ( 1936 ) ( Latin : meso : middle ; " middle " Nepenthes ) . The Nepenthes species found in the subgenera Anurosperma and Mesonepenthes differ from those in the <unk> , where Danser had placed them . Harms included N. rajah in the subgenus Eunepenthes together with the great majority of other Nepenthes ; Anurosperma was a monotypic subgenus , while Mesonepenthes contained only three species . He also created an additional clade , the <unk> ( after N. <unk> ) . 
 In his 1976 book , Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu , Shigeo Kurata presented detailed photographs of lid nectar glands and the digestive glands of the trap interior . He divided the latter into the " lower " , " upper " and " middle " parts . 
 = = = Biochemical analysis = = = 
 More recently , biochemical analysis has been used as a means to determine cladistical relationships between Nepenthes species . In 1975 , David E. <unk> et al. first suggested a link between chemical properties and certain morphological groupings , based on the theory that morphologically similar plants produce chemical constituents with similar therapeutic effects . 
 In 2002 , <unk> screening and analytical chromatography were used to study the presence of phenolic compounds and <unk> in several naturally @-@ occurring hybrids and their putative parental species ( including N. rajah ) from Sabah and Sarawak . The research was based on leaf material from nine dry herbarium specimens . Eight spots containing phenolic acids , flavonols , flavones , <unk> and ' unknown flavonoid ' 1 and 3 were identified from chromatographic profiles . The distributions of these in the hybrid N. × alisaputrana and its putative parental species N. rajah and N. burbidgeae are shown in the table to the left . A specimen of N. × alisaputrana grown from tissue culture ( in vitro ) was also tested . 
 Phenolic and <unk> acids were undetected in N. rajah , while concentrations of <unk> were found to be very weak . Chromatographic patterns of the N. × alisaputrana samples studied showed complementation of its putative parental species . 
 <unk> was found to be absent from all studied taxa . This agrees with the findings of previous authors ( R. M. Som in 1988 ; M. Jay and P. <unk> in 1972 ) and suggests that the absence of a widely distributed compound like <unk> among the Nepenthes examined might provide " additional diagnostic information for these six species " . 
 Several proteins and nucleotides of N. rajah have been either partially or completely sequenced . These are as follows : 
 translocated tRNA @-@ Lys ( trnK ) pseudogene ( <unk> ) 
 trnK gene & maturase K ( matK ) gene ( <unk> ) 
 trnK gene & maturase K ( matK ) gene ( <unk> )

 In 1998 , a striking new species of Nepenthes was discovered in the Philippines by Andreas <unk> . Temporarily dubbed N. sp . Palawan 1 , it bears a close resemblance to N. rajah in terms of pitcher and leaf morphology . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In 2007 , the species was described by <unk> and Joachim <unk> as N. <unk> .

 = = = Kinabalu = = = 
 Nepenthes rajah has a very localised distribution , being restricted to Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon , both located in Kinabalu National Park , Sabah , Malaysian Borneo . Mount Kinabalu is a massive granitic dome structure that is geologically young and formed from the intrusion and uplift of a granitic batholith . At <unk> @.@ 2 m , it is by far the tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in Southeast Asia . The lower slopes of the mountain are mainly composed of sandstone and shale , transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago . <unk> ultramafic ( serpentine ) rock was uplifted with the core of the batholith and forms a collar around the mountain . It is on these ultramafic soils that the flora of Mount Kinabalu exhibits the greatest levels of endemicity and many of the area 's rarest species can be found here . 
 = = = Substrate = = = 
 Nepenthes rajah seems to grow exclusively on serpentine soils containing high concentrations of nickel and chromium , which are toxic to many plant species . Its tolerance of these , therefore , means that it can grow in an ecological niche where it faces less competition for space and nutrients . The root systems of N. × alisaputrana and N. villosa are also known to be resistant to the heavy metals present in serpentine substrates . These soils are also rich in magnesium and are slightly alkaline as a result . They often form a relatively thin layer over a base of ultramafic rock and are thus known as ultramafic soils . <unk> soils are thought to cover approximately 16 % of Kinabalu National Park . These soils have high levels of endemicity in many taxonomic groups , not least the Nepenthes . Four species in the genus , including N. rajah , can only be found within the boundaries of the park . 
 Nepenthes rajah usually grows in open , grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops , particularly in areas of seeping ground water , where the soil is loose and permanently moist . Although these sites can receive very high rainfall , excess water drains away quickly , preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged . N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth , especially among sedges . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Nepenthes rajah has an altitudinal distribution of 1500 – 2650 m a.s.l. and is thus considered an ( ultra ) highland or Upper Montane plant . In the upper limit of its range , night @-@ time temperatures may approach freezing and day @-@ time maximums rarely exceed 25 ℃ . Due to the night @-@ time temperature drop , relative air humidity increases significantly , rising from 65 – 75 % to over 95 % . Vegetation at this height is very stunted and slow @-@ growing due to the extreme environmental conditions that prevail . Plants are often subjected to fierce winds and driving rain , as well as exposure to intense direct sunlight . The relatively open vegetation of the upper montane forest also experiences greater fluctuations in temperature and humidity compared with lower altitudes . These changes are largely governed by the extent of cloud cover . In the absence of clouds , temperatures rise rapidly , humidity drops , and light levels may be very high . When cloud cover returns , temperatures and light levels fall , while humidity levels increase . Average annual precipitation in this region is around 3000 mm . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 = = = Endangered species = = = 
 Nepenthes rajah is classified as Endangered ( EN – B1 + 2e ) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . It is also listed on Schedule I , Part II of the Wildlife Conservation Enactment ( <unk> ) 1997 and CITES Appendix I , which prohibits international trade in plants collected from the wild . However , due to its popularity among collectors , many plants have been removed from the wild illegally , even though the species ' distribution lies entirely within the bounds of Kinabalu Park . This led to some populations being severely depleted by over @-@ collection in the 1970s and eventually resulted in the species ' inclusion in CITES Appendix I in 1981 . Together with N. <unk> , it is one of only two species in the genus to feature on this list ; all other Nepenthes species are covered by Appendix II . 
 This being the case , however , the short @-@ term future of N. rajah seems to be relatively secure and it would perhaps be more accurately classified as Vulnerable ( VU ) or , taking into account protected populations in National Parks , Lower Risk conservation dependent ( LR ( cd ) ) . This agrees with the conservation status of N. rajah according to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre ( <unk> ) , under which it is also considered Vulnerable . Furthermore , the species was originally treated as Vulnerable ( V ) by the IUCN prior to the introduction of the 1994 threat categories . 
 Although N. rajah has a restricted distribution and is often quoted as a plant in peril , it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now off @-@ limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park . Furthermore , N. rajah has a distinctive leaf shape making it difficult to illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed , as an informed customs official should be able to identify it . 
 The recent advent of artificial tissue culture , or more specifically in vitro , technology in Europe and the United States has meant that plants can be produced in large numbers and sold at relatively low prices ( ~ US $ 20 – $ 30 in the case of N. rajah ) . In vitro propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants ( generally seeds ) . This technology has , to a large extent , removed the incentive for collectors to travel to Sabah to collect the plant illegally , and demand for wild @-@ collected plants has fallen considerably in recent years . 
 Rob Cantley , a prominent conservationist and artificial propagator of Nepenthes plants , assesses the current status of plants in the wild as follows : 
 This species grows in at least 2 distinct sub @-@ populations , both of which are well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority . One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit . However , there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site . This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants . Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years as a result of the availability of inexpensive clones from tissue culture . I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible . 
 This being the case , however , it appears that the genetic variability of cultivated N. rajah plants is very small , as all commercially available tissue @-@ cultured plants are thought to belong to just four clones originating from the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew in London , England . 
 However , illegal collection is not the only threat facing plants in the wild . The El Niño climatic phenomenon of 1997 / 98 had a catastrophic effect on the Nepenthes species on Mount Kinabalu . The dry period that followed severely depleted some natural populations . Forest fires broke out in 9 locations in Kinabalu Park , covering a total area of 25 square kilometres and generating large amounts of smog . During the El Niño period , many plants were temporarily transferred to the park nursery to save at least some individuals . These were later replanted in the " Nepenthes Garden " in Mesilau ( see below ) . In spite of this , N. rajah was one of the less affected species and relatively few plants perished as a result . Since then , <unk> <unk> has established a nursery close to the Mesilau Lodge at the base of Kinabalu Park to protect the endangered species of that area , including N. rajah . 
 = = = Restricted distribution = = = 
 The newly opened Mesilau Nature Resort , which lies near the golf course behind the village of Kundasang , is now the only place where regular visitors can hope to see this species in its natural habitat . Here , several dozen N. rajah plants grow near the top of a steep landslide . Both young and mature plants are present , some with sizable pitchers that may occasionally exceed 40 cm in height ( see image ) . Daily guided tours are organised to the " Nepenthes Garden " where these plants are located . The " Nepenthes rajah Nature Trail " is subject to a fee and operates daily from 9 : 00 am to 4 : 00 pm . Almost all other natural populations of this species occur in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park , which are off @-@ limits to tourists . Visitors to the park can also see N. rajah on display in the nursery adjoining the " Mountain Garden " at Kinabalu Park Headquarters . 
 Other known localities of wild N. rajah populations include the <unk> <unk> plateau , Mesilau East River near Mesilau Cave , the Upper <unk> River , and the eastern slope of Mount Tambuyukon . On Pig Hill , N. rajah grows at 1950 – 2320 m and is sympatric with N. burbidgeae , N. <unk> , and the natural hybrid N. × alisaputrana . 
 = = Natural hybrids = = 
 Nepenthes rajah is known to hybridise with several other species with which it is sympatric . It seems to flower at any time of year and for this reason it hybridises relatively easily . Charles Clarke also notes that " N. rajah , more than any other species , appears to have been successful in having its pollen transported over considerable distances . Consequently , a number of putative N. rajah hybrids exist without the parent plant growing nearby " . However , it appears that the limit as to how far pollen can be transported is approximately 10 km . Hybrids between N. rajah and all other Nepenthes species on Mount Kinabalu have been recorded . Due to the slow @-@ growing nature of N. rajah , few hybrids involving it have been artificially produced yet . 
 At present , the following natural hybrids are known : 
 N. burbidgeae × N. rajah [ = N. × alisaputrana <unk> & Wilcock ( 1992 ) ] 
 N. <unk> × N. rajah 
 N. fusca × N. rajah 
 N. lowii × N. rajah 
 N. <unk> × N. rajah 
 N. rajah × N. stenophylla 
 N. rajah × N. <unk> 
 N. rajah × N. villosa [ = N. × kinabaluensis <unk> ( 1976 ) <unk> ] 
 The " Mountain Garden " of Kinabalu National Park contains a number of well @-@ grown Nepenthes , including the rare hybrid N. rajah × N. stenophylla . This plant has leaves resembling those of N. stenophylla , but the lid and wings are typical of N. rajah . The peristome is strongly influenced by N. stenophylla and bristles are present at the border of the lid , a unique characteristic of this hybrid . It occurs at an altitude of 1500 – 2600 m . 
 A single example of N. lowii × N. rajah grows along the Mesilau nature trail . 
 Two hybrids of N. rajah have been formally described and given specific names : N. × alisaputrana and N. × kinabaluensis . Both are listed on CITES Appendix II and the latter is also considered Endangered ( EN ( D ) ) under current IUCN criteria . 
 = = = Nepenthes × alisaputrana = = = 
 Nepenthes × alisaputrana ( originally published as " Nepenthes × <unk> " ) is named in honour of Datuk <unk> Ali , Director of Sabah Parks . It is only known from a few remote localities within Kinabalu National Park where is grows in stunted , open vegetation over serpentine soils at around 2000 m above sea level , often amongst populations of N. burbidgeae . This plant is notable for combining the best characters of both parent species , not least the size of its pitchers , which rival those of N. rajah in volume ( ≤ 35 cm high , ≤ 20 cm wide ) . The other hybrids involving N. rajah do not exhibit such impressive proportions . The pitchers of N. × alisaputrana can be distinguished from those of N. burbidgeae by a broader peristome , larger lid and simply by their sheer size . The hybrid differs from its other parent , N. rajah , by its lid structure , indumentum of short , brown hairs , narrower and more cylindrical peristome , and pitcher colour , which is usually yellow @-@ green with red or brown <unk> . For this reason , Phillipps and Lamb ( 1996 ) gave it the common name Leopard pitcher @-@ plant , though this is rarely used . The peristome is green to dark red and striped with purple bands . Leaves are often slightly peltate . The plant climbs well and aerial pitchers are frequently produced . N. × alisaputrana more closely resembles N. rajah than N. burbidgeae , but it is difficult to confuse this plant with either . However , this mistake has previously been made on at least one occasion ; a pitcher illustrated in Insect Eating Plants & How To Grow Them ( Slack , 1986 ) as being N. rajah was in fact N. burbidgeae × N. rajah . 
 = = = Nepenthes × kinabaluensis = = = 
 Nepenthes × kinabaluensis is another impressive plant . The pitchers get large also , but do not compare to those of N. rajah or N. × alisaputrana . It is a well @-@ known natural hybrid of what many consider to be the two most spectacular Nepenthes species of Borneo : N. rajah and N. villosa . Nepenthes × kinabaluensis is only found on Mount Kinabalu ( hence the name ) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon , where the two parent species are occur sympatrically . More specifically , plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an <unk> route on a south @-@ east ridge , which lies on the west side of the Upper <unk> River . The only accessible location from which this hybrid is known is the Kinabalu summit trail , between <unk> @-@ <unk> and the helipad , where it grows at about 2900 m in a clearing dominated by Dacrydium <unk> and Leptospermum <unk> trees . Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an altitudinal distribution of <unk> to 3030 m . It grows in open areas in cloud forest . This hybrid can be distinguished from N. rajah by the presence of raised ribs that line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth . These are more prominent than those found in N. rajah and are clue as to the hybrid 's parentage ( N. villosa has highly developed peristome ribs ) . The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin ( but not scalloped like that of N. rajah ) , the lid <unk> or <unk> and almost flat . In general , pitchers are larger than those of N. villosa and the tendril joins the apex about 1 – 2 cm below the leaf tip , a feature which is characteristic of N. rajah . In older plants , the tendril can be almost woody . Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an indumentum of villous hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins , which is approximately intermediate between the parents . Lower pitchers have two fringed wings , whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these . The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet . Nepenthes × kinabaluensis seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents . In all respects N. × kinabaluensis is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other Nepenthes of Borneo . However , it has been confused once before , when the hybrid was labelled as N. rajah in Letts Guide to Carnivorous Plants of the World ( Cheers , 1992 ) . 
 Nepenthes × kinabaluensis was first collected near <unk> by Lilian Gibbs in 1910 and later mentioned by Macfarlane as " Nepenthes sp . " in 1914 . Although Macfarlane did not formally name the plant , he noted that " [ a ] ll available morphological details suggest that this is a hybrid between N. villosa and N. rajah " . The name N. × kinabaluensis was first published in Shigeo Kurata 's 1976 book , Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu , but was a nomen nudum at the time as it lacked an adequate description and information on the type specimen . The name was subsequently published validly by Kurata in 1984 . 
 = = = Hybrid or species ? = = = 
 Nepenthes × alisaputrana and N. × kinabaluensis are often fertile and thus may breed among themselves . Clive A. Stace writes that we may speak of " stabilised hybrids when they have developed a distributional , morphological or genetic set of characters which is no longer strictly related to that of its parents , ... if the hybrid has become an independent , recognisable , self @-@ producing unit , it is de facto a separate species " . Nepenthes <unk> and N. <unk> are two examples of species that have a putative hybrid origin . Nepenthes × alisaputrana and N. × kinabaluensis are sufficiently stabilised that a species status has been discussed . Indeed , N. kinabaluensis was described as a species by Adam & Wilcock in 1996 . 
 Due to their dioecious nature , a hybrid involving a pair of Nepenthes species can represent one of two possible crosses , depending on which species was the female and which was the male . When the cross is known , the female ( or pod ) parent is usually referred to first , followed by the male ( or pollen ) parent . This is an important distinction , as the hybrid will usually display different morphological features according to the type of cross ; the pod parent is thought to be dominant in most cases and hybrid offspring usually resemble it more than the pollen parent . Most wild plants of N. × kinabaluensis , for example , show a greater affinity to N. rajah than N. villosa and are thus thought to represent the cross N. rajah × N. villosa . However , specimens have been found that seem to be more similar to N. villosa , suggesting that they might be the reverse cross ( see [ 4 ] ) . The same is true for other hybrids involving N. rajah .

 Nepenthes rajah has always been considered to be one of the more difficult Nepenthes species to cultivate . However , in recent years , it has become apparent that the plant may not be deserving of its reputation . 
 = = = Environmental factors = = = 
 Nepenthes rajah is a montane species or " highlander " , growing at altitudes ranging from 1500 to 2650 m . As such , it requires warm days , with temperatures ranging ( ideally ) from approximately 25 to 30 ℃ , and cool nights , with temperatures of about 10 to 15 ℃ . Here , it is important to note that the temperatures themselves are not vital ( when kept within reasonable limits ) , but rather the temperature drop itself ; N. rajah needs considerably cooler nights , with a drop of 10 ℃ or more being preferable . Failure to observe this requirement will almost certainly doom the plant in the long term or , at best , limit it to being a small , unimpressive specimen . 
 In addition , like all Nepenthes , this plant needs a fairly humid environment to grow well . Values in the region of 75 % R.H. are generally considered optimal , with increased humidity at night ( ~ 90 % R.H. ) . However , N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in humidity , especially when young , provided that the air does not become too dry ( below 50 % R.H. ) . Humidity can be easily controlled using an ultrasonic <unk> in conjunction with a <unk> . 
 In its natural habitat , N. rajah grows in open areas , where it is exposed to direct sunlight – it therefore needs to be provided with a significant amount of light in cultivation as well . To meet this need , many growers have used metal halide lamps in the 500 – 1000 watt range , with considerable success . The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source , 1 to 2 m is recommended . Depending on location , growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination . However , this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions , where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant . A photoperiod of 12 hours is comparable to that experienced in nature , since Borneo lies on the equator . 
 = = = <unk> and watering = = = 
 Pure long @-@ fibre Sphagnum moss is an excellent potting medium , though combinations involving any of the following – peat , perlite , vermiculite , sand , lava rock , pumice , Osmunda fibre , orchid bark and horticultural charcoal – may be used with equal success . The potting medium should be well @-@ drained and not too compacted . Moss is useful for moisture retention near the roots . The mix should be thoroughly soaked in water prior to potting the plant . 
 It has been noted that N. rajah produces a very extensive root system ( for a Nepenthes ) and , for this reason , it is recommended that a wide pot be used to allow for proper development of the root system . This also eliminates the need for frequent re @-@ potting , which can lead to transplant shock and the eventual death of the plant . 
 Purified water should be used for watering purposes , although ' hard water ' is tolerated . This is done to minimise the build @-@ up of minerals and chemicals in the soil . Water purity greater than 100 <unk> of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal . A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or , alternatively , bottled distilled water can be purchased . Watering should be done regularly . However , plants should not be allowed to sit in water , as this may lead to root rot . 
 = = = Feeding and fertilising = = = 
 Nepenthes rajah is a carnivorous plant and , as such , supplements nutrients gained from the soil with captured prey ( especially insects ) to alleviate deficiencies in important elements such as nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium . Just as in nature , a cultivated plant 's ' diet ' may include insects and other prey items , although this is not necessary for successful cultivation . Crickets are recommended for their size and low cost . These can be purchased online or at specialist pet stores . They can simply be dropped into the pitchers by hand or placed inside using metal tongs or similar , whether dead or alive . 
 From trials carried out by a commercial Nepenthes nursery , it appears that micronutrient solutions have " a beneficial effect on plants of improved leaf colouration , with no deleterious effects " as far as can be seen . However , more research is required to verify these results . Actual fertilisers ( containing <unk> ) were , on the other hand , found to " cause damage to plants , promote pathogens and have no observable benefits " . Hence , the use of chemical fertilisers is usually not advised . 
 Nepenthes rajah is a slow growing Nepenthes . Under optimal conditions , N. rajah can reach flowering size within 10 years of seed germination . 
 = = Common misconceptions = = 
 Nepenthes rajah has been a well known and highly sought after species for over a century and , as a result , there are many stories woven around this plant . One such example is the famous legend that N. rajah grows exclusively in the spray zones of waterfalls , on ultramafic soils . Although the latter is true , N. rajah is certainly not found solely in the spray zones of waterfalls and this statement seems to have little basis in fact . It is likely this misconception was popularised by Shigeo Kurata 's 1976 book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu , in which he states that " N. rajah is rather fond of wet places like swamps or the surroundings of a waterfall " . 
 This being the case , certain N. rajah plants do in fact grow in the vicinity of waterfalls ( as noted by H. Steiner , 2002 ) " providing quite a humid microclimate " , which may indeed be the source of this particular misconception . 
 Another myth surrounding this species is that it occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers . Such tales have persisted for a very long time , but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species . It is interesting to note that one common name for Nepenthes plants is ' Monkey Cups ' . The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants .

 = Northwest Airlines Flight 253 = 
 Northwest Airlines Flight 253 was an international passenger flight from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in <unk> , Netherlands , to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Romulus , Michigan , United States . The flight was the target of a failed al @-@ Qaeda bombing attempt on Christmas Day , December 25 , 2009 , in which a passenger tried to set off plastic explosives sewn to his underwear . There were 290 people on board the aircraft — an Airbus A330 @-@ <unk> operated by Northwest Airlines , which had merged with Delta Air Lines the year before . Had the attempt succeeded , it would have surpassed American Airlines Flight 191 as the deadliest aviation occurrence on U.S. soil and tied Iran Air Flight 655 as the eighth @-@ deadliest of all time . The incident was also the second in 2009 involving an Airbus A330 , after Air France Flight 447 on 1 June . This was also the final accident / incident involving Northwest Airlines as it closed down a month later when it merged with Delta Airlines . 
 The convicted bomber in the " Christmas Day bombing attempt " was 23 @-@ year @-@ old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a Nigerian who had concealed plastic explosives in his underwear but failed to detonate them properly . A Dutch passenger , Jasper Schuringa , tackled and restrained him and put out the fire with the aid of others . Abdulmutallab was handcuffed while the pilot safely landed the plane . In all , three people were injured : Abdulmutallab , Schuringa , and one other passenger . Upon landing in Detroit , Abdulmutallab was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment of his burns . On December 28 , 2009 , al @-@ Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing . On January 6 , 2010 , a federal grand jury indicted Abdulmutallab on six criminal charges , including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder . 
 Reports indicated that the U.S. had received intelligence regarding a powder bomb planned attack by a Yemen @-@ based Nigerian man . While describing security measures taken by U.S. and foreign governments in the immediate aftermath of the attack , U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security , Janet Napolitano , said , " once the incident occurred , the system worked . " She cited " the actions of the passengers and the crew on this flight " to show " why that system is so important . " After heavy criticism , she stated the following day that the system " failed miserably " , this time referring to Abdulmutallab 's boarding the flight with an explosive device . U.S. President Barack Obama called the U.S. ' s failure to prevent the bombing attempt " totally unacceptable " , and ordered an investigation . 
 On April 6 , 2010 , it was reported that President Obama had authorized the assassination of Anwar al @-@ Awlaki , a Muslim cleric who was accused by the Obama administration of being a Yemen @-@ based al @-@ Qaeda commander behind the plot . Al @-@ Awlaki was killed on September 30 , 2011 .

 = = = Getting on Flight 253 = = = 
 On Christmas Eve , December 24 , 2009 , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a 23 @-@ year @-@ old Nigerian , boarded Virgin Nigeria Flight 804 at Accra Airport in Accra , Ghana and arrived at <unk> Muhammed Airport in Lagos , Nigeria . Eight days earlier at the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines office in Accra , Ghana , he had paid $ 2 @,@ 831 in cash for his Lagos @-@ Amsterdam @-@ Detroit round @-@ trip ticket with a January 8 , 2010 return date . Kevin Drum , a political blogger for Mother Jones , said that Ghana and Nigeria are largely cash @-@ based economies , so it would be normal for someone to buy an airplane ticket with cash in those countries . 
 Abdulmutallab left Lagos on Christmas Eve at 23 : 00 aboard KLM Flight 588 , a Boeing 777 bound for Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam . In Amsterdam , on Christmas Day , Abdulmutallab checked in for Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit with only carry @-@ on luggage . On March 24 , 2011 , the Associated Press reported that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket there was the least expensive of tickets to potential US targets , which included Chicago and Houston . Initially , some media rumored that Abdulmutallab tried to fly to Detroit because it was a major hub of the U.S. automotive industry . 
 = = = = Pre @-@ boarding event = = = = 
 Kurt and Lori Haskell , an American couple , said that while waiting to board Flight 253 at Schiphol Airport , they saw a " poor @-@ looking African @-@ American teenager around 16 or 17 , " who Kurt Haskell claims was Abdulmutallab , with a second man , who was " sharp @-@ dressed " , possibly of Indian descent , around 50 years old , and who spoke " in an American accent similar to my own . " 
 According to Lori Haskell , the second man told the ticket agent : " We need to get this man on the plane . He doesn 't have a passport . " The ticket agent said nobody was allowed to board without a passport . The well @-@ dressed man replied : " We do this all the time ; he 's from Sudan . " Lori Haskell said the two men were directed down a corridor , to talk to a manager . " We never saw him again until he tried to blow up our plane , " Lori Haskell said of Abdulmutallab . 
 Only U.S. citizens are permitted to board international flights to the U.S. without passports , and even then only if the airline confirms their identity and citizenship , said a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) . A CBP official and spokesman confirmed there were not any Sudanese refugees on the plane . The Dutch counter @-@ terror agency said that Abdulmutallab presented a valid Nigerian passport and U.S. entry visa when he boarded Flight 253 . 
 Haskell suggested authorities should , " Put the video out there to prove I 'm wrong . " Federal agents later said they were trying to identify and find the well @-@ dressed man . U.S. authorities had initially discounted the passenger accounts , but agents later said there was a growing belief that the man played a role in ensuring Abdulmutallab " did not get cold feet " . 
 = = = Bombing attempt = = = 
 Flight 253 , a Northwest Airlines Airbus A330 @-@ <unk> twinjet , registered <unk> , with 279 passengers , 8 flight attendants , and 3 pilots aboard , left Amsterdam around 08 : 45 local time . The plane was scheduled to arrive in Detroit at 11 : 40 EST , and was painted in Delta Air Lines ' livery , as Northwest was a subsidiary of Delta at the time . 
 Witnesses reported that as the plane approached Detroit , Abdulmutallab went into the plane 's lavatory for about 20 minutes . After returning to his seat at 19A ( near the fuel tanks and wing , and against the skin of the plane ) , he complained that he had an upset stomach . He was seen pulling a blanket over himself . 
 About 20 minutes before the plane landed , on its final descent , he secretly ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid . Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear , and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction . While there was a small explosion and fire , the device failed to detonate properly . Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers , smelled an odor , and saw the suspect 's pants , leg and the wall of the plane on fire . 
 There were no air marshals on the flight , but several passengers and crew noticed the explosion . Jasper Schuringa from the Netherlands , a passenger on the other end of the same row , saw Abdulmutallab sitting and shaking . He tackled and overpowered him . Schuringa saw the suspect 's pants were open , and that he was holding a burning object . " I pulled the object from him and tried to extinguish the fire with my hands and threw it away , " said Schuringa , who suffered burns to his hands . Meanwhile , flight attendants extinguished the fire with a fire extinguisher and blankets , and a passenger removed the partially melted , smoking syringe from Abdulmutallab 's hand . 
 Schuringa grabbed the suspect , and pulled him to the business class area at the front of the plane . A passenger reported that Abdulmutallab , though burned " quite severely " on his leg , seemed " very calm , " and like a " normal individual . " Schuringa stripped off the suspect 's clothes to look for additional weapons , and he and a crew member restrained Abdulmutallab with plastic handcuffs . " He was staring into nothing " and shaking , said Schuringa . 
 Passengers applauded as Schuringa walked back to his seat . The suspect was isolated from other passengers until after the plane landed . A flight attendant asked Abdulmutallab what he had in his pocket , and the suspect replied : " Explosive device . " When the attack triggered a fire indicator light within the cockpit , the pilot requested rescue and law enforcement . The plane made an emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in the Downriver Detroit community of Romulus , Michigan , just before 13 : 00 local time . 
 The Toronto Star reported that the plane 's flight route would have had it over Canadian airspace when the attempted bombing occurred . Representatives of two pilot associations told the Star that Detroit Metro airport would have been the nearest suitable airport at which to attempt an emergency landing . 
 While the plane suffered relatively little damage , the suspect incurred first and second degree burns to his hands , as well as second @-@ degree burns to his right inner thigh and genitalia . Two other passengers were also injured . When the plane landed , Abdulmutallab was handed over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) officers , and taken into custody for questioning and treatment of his injuries in a secured room of the burn unit of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor . Schuringa was also taken to the hospital . One other passenger incurred minor injuries . 
 Immediately after his arrest , Abdulmutallab talked to authorities about the plot for about 50 minutes , without having been informed of his Miranda rights . After emerging from surgery , he was informed of his rights and stopped talking to investigators for several weeks . 
 Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) agents arrived at the airport after the plane landed . The aircraft was moved to a remote area so authorities could re @-@ screen the plane , the passengers , and the baggage on board . A bomb @-@ defusing robot was first used to board the plane , and the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) interviewed all passengers . Another passenger from the flight was placed in handcuffs after a dog alerted officers to his carry @-@ on luggage ; he was searched , and released without charges . For several days following , federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred , they later reversed this position , confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed . 
 = = = Analysis of explosives = = = 
 The substance that the suspect tried to detonate was more than 80 grams ( 2 @.@ 8 oz ) of <unk> <unk> ( PETN ) , a crystalline powder that is often the active ingredient of plastic explosives , the high explosive <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , and other ingredients . PETN is among the most powerful of explosives , and chemically resembles nitroglycerin . The powder was analyzed by the FBI at Quantico , and an FBI affidavit filed in the Eastern District of Michigan reflected preliminary findings that the device contained PETN . The authorities also found the remains of the syringe . The suspect apparently carried the PETN onto the plane in a 6 @-@ inch ( 15 cm ) -long soft plastic container , possibly a condom , attached to his underwear . Much of the container was lost in the fire . ABC News cited a government test indicating that 50 grams ( 1 @.@ 8 oz ) of PETN can blow a hole in the side of an airliner , and posted photos of the remains of Abdulmutallab 's underwear and explosive packet . 
 In a public test conducted by the BBC , the test plane 's fuselage remained intact , indicating that the bomb would not have destroyed the aircraft , though it did show window damage that would likely have led to cabin depressurization . This test was undertaken at ground level , with zero pressure differential between the cabin and the surrounding environment . This was claimed to have no effect on the overall result of the test , which aimed to simulate the explosion at 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) . It was not demonstrated what would happen at a typical cruising altitude of between 31 @,@ 000 feet ( 9 @,@ 400 m ) and 39 @,@ 000 feet ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) , where the pressure differential would have caused the fuselage to be under a far greater stress than at ground level . 
 Al @-@ Qaeda member Richard Reid ( the " Shoe Bomber " ) had tried to detonate 50 grams of the same explosives in his shoes during an American Airlines flight on December 22 , 2001 . 
 = = = <unk> disruptive passenger incident = = = 
 On December 27 , 2009 , two days after the original incident , the crew of another Flight 253 requested emergency assistance with a Nigerian passenger whom they said had become " verbally disruptive " . The crew questioned the passenger after other passengers expressed concern that he had been in the lavatory for over an hour . It was later determined that the man was a businessman who had fallen ill from food poisoning during the flight , and did not pose any security risk . 
 = = Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab = = 
 The suspect in the attempted bombing was Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a 23 @-@ year @-@ old Nigerian born into a middle @-@ class family . Abdulmutallab was raised in Kaduna , in Nigeria 's Muslim @-@ dominated north , a place he returned to on his vacations . 
 In high school at the British International School in Lomé , Togo , Abdulmutallab was known to be a devout Muslim , who frequently discussed Islam with schoolmates . He visited the U.S. for the first time in 2004 . 
 For the 2004 – 05 academic year , Abdulmutallab studied at the San 'a Institute for the Arabic Language in Sana 'a , Yemen , and attended lectures at Iman University . He began his studies at University College London in September 2005 , where he was president of the school 's Islamic society in 2006 and 2007 , during which time he participated in , along with political discussions , such activities as martial arts and paintballing . During those years , he came to the attention of MI5 , the UK 's domestic counter @-@ intelligence and security agency , for radical links and connections with Islamic extremists . To protect his privacy , they did not pass the information along to American officials . 
 On June 12 , 2008 , Abdulmutallab applied for and received from the U.S. consulate in London a U.S. multiple @-@ entry visa , valid to June 12 , 2010 , with which he visited Houston , Texas , from August 1 – 17 , 2008 . In May 2009 , Abdulmutallab tried to return to Britain , supposedly for a six @-@ month " life coaching " program at what the British authorities concluded was a fictitious school ; accordingly , his visa application was denied by the United Kingdom Border Agency . His name was placed on a UK Home Office security watch list , which meant he was not permitted to enter the UK , though he could pass through the country in transit and was not permanently banned . The UK did not share the information with other countries . 
 Abdulmutallab returned to the San 'a Institute to study Arabic from August to September 2009 . " He told me his greatest wish was for sharia and Islam to be the rule of law across the world " , said one of his classmates at the Institute . Abdulmutallab left the Institute after a month , but remained in Yemen . 
 Earlier , his family had become concerned in August when he called them to say he had dropped the course , but was remaining there . By September , he routinely skipped his classes at the institute and attended lectures at Iman University , which intelligence officials from the United States suspected to have links to terrorism . 
 The San 'a Institute obtained an exit visa for him at his request , and arranged for a car that took him to the airport on September 21 , 2009 ( the day his student visa expired ) , but the school 's director said , " After that , we never saw him again , and apparently he did not leave Yemen " . In October , Abdulmutallab told his father via text message saying that he did not want to attend business school in Dubai , and wanted instead to study Islamic law and Arabic in Yemen . When his father refused to pay for it , Abdulmutallab said he was " already getting everything for free " . He text @-@ messaged his father , saying " I 've found a new religion , the real Islam " , " You should just forget about me , I 'm never coming back " , and " Forgive me for any wrongdoing , I am no longer your child " . The family was last in contact with their son in October 2009 . 
 On November 11 , 2009 , British intelligence officials sent the U.S. a message indicating that a man named " Umar Farouk " had spoken to Anwar al @-@ Awlaki , a Muslim spiritual leader supposedly tied to al @-@ Qaeda , pledging to support jihad , but the notice did not mention Abdulmutallab by name . 
 On November 19 , his father reported to two CIA officers at the U.S. Embassy in Abuja , regarding his son 's " extreme religious views " , and told the embassy that Abdulmutallab might be in Yemen . Acting on the report , the US added Abdulmutallab 's name in November 2009 to its 550 @,@ 000 @-@ name Terrorist Identities <unk> Environment , a database of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center . It was not added , however , to the FBI 's 400 @,@ 000 @-@ name Terrorist Screening Database , the terror watch list that feeds both the 14 @,@ 000 @-@ name Secondary Screening <unk> list and the U.S. ' s 4 @,@ 000 @-@ name No Fly List . Abdulmutallab 's U.S. visa was not revoked either . 
 Yemeni officials said that Abdulmutallab left Yemen on December 7 ( flying to Ethiopia , and two days later to Ghana ) . Ghanaian officials said Abdulmutallab was there from December 9 until December 24 , when he flew to Lagos . 
 Two days after the attack , Abdulmutallab was released from the hospital in which he had been treated for burns sustained during the attempted bombing . He was taken to the Federal Correctional Institution , Milan , a federal prison in York Charter Township , Michigan , near Milan . 
 = = = Ties to Anwar al @-@ Awlaki = = = 
 A number of sources reported contacts between Abdulmutallab and Anwar al @-@ Awlaki , the late Muslim lecturer and spiritual leader who the US accused as a senior al @-@ Qaeda talent recruiter and <unk> al @-@ Awlaki , previously an imam in the U.S. , who had moved to Yemen , also had links to three of the 9 / 11 hijackers , the 2005 London subway bombers , a 2006 Toronto terror cell , a 2007 plot to attack Fort Dix , and the 2009 suspected Fort Hood shooter , Nidal Malik Hasan . In 2006 , he was banned from entering the UK ; al @-@ Awlaki repeatedly used a video link for public speeches from 2007 to 2009 . 
 The Sunday Times reported that Abdulmutallab first met and attended lectures by al @-@ Awlaki in 2005 , when he was in Yemen to study Arabic . He attended a sermon by al @-@ Awlaki at the Finsbury Park Mosque . The two are also " thought to have met " in London , according to The Daily Mail . Fox News reported that Abdulmutallab repeatedly visited Awlaki 's website and blog . CBS News and The Daily Telegraph reported that Abdulmutallab attended a video teleconference talk by al @-@ Awlaki at the East London Mosque . University of Oxford historian and professor of international relations Mark Almond wrote that the suspect was " on American security watch @-@ lists because of his links with ... Al Awlaki " . 
 CBS News reported that the two had communicated in the months before the bombing attempt , and other sources have said that at a minimum , al @-@ Awlaki was providing spiritual support for Abdulmutallab and the attack . According to federal sources , over the year prior to the attack , Abdulmutallab had repeatedly communicated with al @-@ Awlaki . 
 Intelligence officials suspected that al @-@ Awlaki may have told Abdulmutallab to go to Yemen for al @-@ Qaeda training . One government source described intercepted " voice @-@ to @-@ voice communication " between the two during the fall of 2009 , saying that al @-@ Awlaki " was in some way involved in facilitating [ Abdulmutallab ] ' s transportation or trip through Yemen . It could be training , a host of things . " 
 Abdulmutallab reportedly told the FBI that he had trained under al @-@ Awlaki at an al @-@ Qaeda training camp in Yemen . 
 Yemen 's Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and Security Affairs , Rashad Mohammed al @-@ Alimi , said Yemeni investigators believe the suspect traveled in October to <unk> , where he may have obtained the explosives and received training . He met with suspected al @-@ Qaida members in a house built by al @-@ Awlaki and used by al @-@ Awlaki to hold religious meetings . " If he went to <unk> , for sure he would have met Anwar al @-@ Awlaki , " al @-@ Alimi said . Al @-@ Alimi also said he believed al @-@ Awlaki was alive . And Abdul Elah al @-@ Shaya , a Yemeni journalist , said a healthy al @-@ Awlaki called him on December 28 and said that the Yemeni government 's claims as to his death were " lies " . Shaya declined to comment as to whether al @-@ Awlaki had told him about any contacts he may have had with Abdulmutallab . According to Gregory Johnsen , a Yemeni expert at Princeton University , Shaya is generally reliable . 
 At the end of January 2010 , a Yemeni journalist , <unk> <unk> Sha ’ ea , said he met with al @-@ Awlaki , who told Sha <unk> that he had met and spoken with Abdulmutallab in Yemen in late 2009 . Al @-@ Awlaki also reportedly called Abdulmutallab one of his students , said that he supported what Abdulmutallab did but did not tell him to do it , and that he was proud of Abdulmutallab . A New York Times journalist who listened to a digital recording of the meeting said that while the tape 's authenticity could not be independently verified , the voice resembled that on other recordings of al @-@ Awlaki . 
 Al @-@ Awlaki released a tape in March 2010 , in which he said , in part : 
 To the American people ... nine years after 9 / 11 , nine years of spending , and nine years of <unk> up security you are still unsafe even in the holiest and most sacred of days to you , Christmas Day .... 
 Our brother Umar Farouk has succeeded in breaking through the security systems that have cost the U.S. government alone over 40 billion dollars since 9 / 11 . 
 Beginning December 18 , 2009 , President Obama authorized attacks on suspected Al @-@ Qaeda bases in Yemen . On April 6 , 2010 , The New York Times reported that President Obama had authorized the targeted killing of al @-@ Awlaki . Al @-@ Qaeda in Yemen released a video in 2010 that showed Abdulmutallab and others training in a desert camp . The tape includes a statement from Abdulmutallab justifying his actions against " the Jews and the Christians and their agents . " Al @-@ Awlaki was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Yemen on September 30 , 2011 . 
 = = = Al @-@ Qaeda involvement = = = 
 On December 28 , 2009 , Obama , in his first address after the incident , said that the event " demonstrates that an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist " . On the same day , Al @-@ Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) announced that it was responsible for the attempted bombing . AQAP said that the attack , during " their [ Americans ' ] celebration of the Christmas holidays " , was to " avenge U.S. attacks on the militants in Yemen " . 
 On January 24 , an audio tape said to be from Osama bin Laden praised the bombing attempt and warned of further attacks against the United States , but did not claim responsibility for it . The short recording , which was broadcast on Al Jazeera television , said : " The message delivered to you through the plane of the heroic warrior Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was a confirmation of the previous messages sent by the heroes of the September 11 . " An adviser to the U.S. President said he could not confirm whether the voice was that of bin Laden . In the past , the CIA has usually confirmed Al Jazeera reports on tapes attributed to bin Laden . 
 While in custody , Abdulmutallab told authorities he had been directed by al @-@ Qaeda . He said he had obtained the device in Yemen , and was told to detonate it when the plane was over the United States . Abdulmutallab said he had contacted al @-@ Qaeda through a radical Yemeni imam ( who according to The New York Times on December 26 was not believed to be al @-@ Awlaki ) whom he had reached through the internet . 
 The New York Times reported on December 25 that a counter @-@ terrorism official had told them Abdulmutallab 's claim of connection with al @-@ Qaeda " may have been aspirational " . But U.S. Representative Jane Harman ( D @-@ Calif . ) , Chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence , Information Sharing , and Terrorism Risk Assessment , said the following day that a federal official briefed lawmakers about " strong suggestions of a Yemen @-@ al Qaeda connection " with the suspect . On January 2 , 2010 , President Obama said that AQAP trained , equipped , and dispatched Abdulmutallab , and vowed retribution . 
 In reaction to suggestions that the U.S. launch a military offensive against the alleged terrorists ' sanctuary in Yemen , The Washington Post noted that Yemeni forces equipped with U.S. weapons and intelligence had carried out two major raids against AQAP shortly before the bombing attempt , and that the terror group may have lost top leaders in a December 24 , 2009 airstrike . 
 On March 24 , 2011 , the Associated Press reported that before Abdulmutallab set off on his mission , he visited the home of al @-@ Qaeda manager Fahd al @-@ Quso to discuss the plot and the workings of the bomb . In addition , the AP said that Abdulmutallab targeted Detroit because the plane ticket there was cheaper than the tickets to either Houston or Chicago . This suggests that al @-@ Qaeda in Yemen chose to attack " targets of opportunity , " rather than Osama bin Laden 's preference of " symbolic targets . " 
 = = Jasper Schuringa = = 
 Jasper Schuringa , who was en route to Miami , Florida for a vacation , stopped Abdulmutallab from causing too much damage and received burn injuries in the process . In a statement , Schuringa , who was in seat <unk> on the flight , said he was able to locate Abdulmutallab , help to extinguish the fire that the explosive had caused , and helped to restrain Abdulmutallab using plastic cuffs . Schuringa lives in Amsterdam , and was born in 1977 in Curaçao , Netherlands Antilles . Schuringa is a graduate of Leiden University , Leiden . He is a film director of low @-@ budget Dutch films for an Amsterdam @-@ based media company , and was the assistant director for National Lampoon 's <unk> Off Too . 
 Dutch Deputy Prime Minister Wouter Bos phoned Schuringa on behalf of the Dutch government the day after the attack , and conveyed the government 's compliments and gratitude for Schuringa 's part in overpowering the suspect . Dutch Member of Parliament Geert Wilders called Schuringa " a national hero " who " deserves a royal honor " , which Wilders said he would ask the Dutch government to award . According to the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant , Queen Beatrix expressed her feelings of gratitude towards Schuringa . On May 21 , 2010 , Schuringa received the Honorary Medal of the city Amsterdam from then @-@ acting mayor of Amsterdam , Lodewijk Asscher , for his " extraordinary heroism . " In December 2010 , Schuringa was also awarded the Silver Carnegie Medal from the Dutch division of the Carnegie Hero Fund .

 The U.S. investigation into the incident is being managed by the Detroit Joint Terrorism Task Force , which is led by the FBI and includes U.S. Customs and Border Protection , U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , the Federal Air Marshal Service , and other law enforcement agencies . Among other questions , they were attempting to find out what training he received , who else ( if anyone ) was in the training program , are others preparing to launch similar attacks , was the attack part of a larger plot , was it a test run , and who assisted him . 
 President Barack Obama was notified of the incident by an aide while on a vacation in Kailua , Hawaii , and spoke with officials from the Department of Homeland Security . He instructed that all appropriate measures be taken in response to the incident . While the White House called the attack an act of terrorism , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has not declared the incident an official terrorist act . 
 The U.S. is examining what information it had before the attack , why its National Counterterrorism Center did not make a connection between the warning from Abdulmutallab 's father and intercepts by the National Security Agency of conversations among Yemeni al @-@ Qaida leaders about a " Nigerian " to be used for an attack ( months before the attack took place ) , and why the suspect 's U.S. visa was not withdrawn . 
 On January 7 , 2010 , James L. Jones , the National Security Advisor , said Americans would feel " a certain shock " when a report detailing the intelligence failures that could have prevented the Christmas Day attack were released that day . He said that President Obama would be " legitimately and correctly alarmed that things that were available , bits of information that were available , patterns of behavior that were available , were not acted on . " 
 The U.S. also increased the installation and use of full @-@ body scanners in many of its major airports as a result of the attack . The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing , and 11 airports , including O 'Hare International Airport in Chicago , began to receive the machines in March 2010 . The TSA said that it had plans to have 1 @,@ 000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011 . Before , the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports . The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following fiscal year , starting October 2010 . It costs around an estimated $ 530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5 @,@ 300 workers to operate them . However , the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat @-@ down search or be searched with hand @-@ held detectors . Under new rules prompted by the incident , airline passengers traveling to the U.S. from 14 nations would undergo extra screening : Afghanistan , Algeria , Cuba , Iran , Iraq , Lebanon , Libya , Nigeria , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Somalia , Sudan , Syria , and Yemen . The inclusion of non @-@ Muslim Cuba on the list was criticized .

 Gordon Brown , Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , said that the UK would take " whatever action was necessary " . The day after the attack , British police searched a family @-@ owned flat where Abdulmutallab had lived while in London . 
 Dutch counter @-@ terrorism agency <unk> said that it had started a probe into where the suspect originated . Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full @-@ body scanning X @-@ ray technology on flights departing to the U.S. , despite protests from privacy advocates . Dutch officials said that security must take priority over the privacy of the individuals being scanned , but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual 's privacy , as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non @-@ metallic objects under clothing , such as powdered explosives . Members of the Second Chamber ( Lower House ) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin , asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board , despite Schiphol 's reportedly strict security measures . 
 The incident also raised concerns regarding security procedures at Nigeria 's major international airports in Lagos and Abuja . In response to criticism , Nigerian civil aviation officer Harold <unk> announced that Nigeria would also set up full @-@ body scanning X @-@ ray machines in Nigerian airports . 
 In response to the incident and to comply with new U.S. regulations , the Canadian government said it would install full body scanners at major airports . The first 44 scanners were planned to be installed at airports in Vancouver , Calgary , Edmonton , Winnipeg , Toronto , Ottawa , Montreal , and Halifax .

 Delta Air Lines , which owned Northwest until all operations were merged into Delta on January 31 , 2010 , said its Detroit group did not handle security for the flight . It released a statement calling the incident a " disturbance , " and saying that Delta was " cooperating fully with authorities " . Delta 's CEO , Richard Anderson , said in an internal memo that " Having this occur again [ after 9 / 11 ] is disappointing to all of us ... You can be certain we will make our points very clearly in Washington . " 
 In January 2010 , ICTS International , a security firm that provides security services to Schiphol airport , and <unk> ( Group 4 Securicor Aviation Security B.V. ) , another security firm , traded blame over the security oversight , as did authorities at Schiphol Airport , the Federal Aviation Authority , and U.S. intelligence officials . According to Haaretz , the failure was twofold : An intelligence failure , as Obama stated , in the poor handling of information that arrived at the State Department and probably also the CIA from both the father of the would @-@ be bomber and the British security service ; and a failure within the security system , including that of ICTS .

 On December 26 , a criminal complaint was filed against Abdulmutallab in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan , charging him with two counts : placing a destructive device in , and attempting to destroy , a U.S. civil aircraft . Abdulmutallab was arraigned and officially charged by U.S. District Court Judge Paul D. Borman later the same day at the University of Michigan Hospital . 
 On January 6 , 2010 , a federal grand jury indicted Abdulmutallab on six criminal counts including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder . " Not guilty " pleas were entered on the behalf of Abdulmutallab at the hearing . If convicted , Abdulmutallab could face a life sentence plus 90 years . He faced his first court hearing , a detention hearing , on January 8 , 2010 . 
 When asked about his decision to prosecute Abdulmutallab in federal court rather than have him detained under the law of war , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder defended his position , saying that it was " fully consistent with the long @-@ established and publicly known policies and practices of the Department of Justice , the FBI , and the United States Government as a whole , " and that he was confident that Abdulmutallab would be successfully prosecuted under the federal criminal law . Holder had originally been asked by U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell , as well as several others , about his choice . 
 On February 16 , 2012 , Abdulmutallab , who had pleaded guilty but remained unrepentant , was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole .

 The U.S. government did not raise the Homeland Security Advisory System terrorist threat level , orange at the time ( high risk of terrorist attacks ) , following the attack . The Department of Homeland Security said that additional security measures would be in place for the remainder of the Christmas travel period . The TSA detailed several of the measures , including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace . The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports . 
 On December 28 , Transport Canada announced that for several days it would not allow passengers flying to the U.S. from Canada a carry @-@ on bag , with some exceptions . British Airways said that passengers flying to the U.S. would only be permitted one carry @-@ on item . Other European countries increased baggage screening , pat @-@ down searches , and random searches for passengers traveling to the U.S. A spokesperson for Schiphol Airport said that heightened security would be in place for " an indefinite period " . However , in spite of the extra measures said to have been put in place to prevent a follow @-@ up attack , Stuart Clarke , a <unk> from the British newspaper Daily Express , claimed to have smuggled a syringe containing fluid , which could have been a liquid bomb detonator onto another plane . On January 3 , 2010 , Clarke said he boarded a jet from Schiphol Airport bound for Heathrow Airport just five days after the Christmas Day attack , and that the airport appeared to have imposed no additional security , such as precautionary pat @-@ downs which could easily have discovered the syringe which he claimed he kept in his jacket pocket throughout .

 White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said several times on Sunday talk shows that " the system had worked " , a statement that engendered some controversy . The next day they retracted the statements , saying that the system had in fact " failed miserably . " According to Napolitano , her initial statement had referred to the rapid response to the attack that included alerts sent to the 128 other aircraft in U.S. airspace at the time , and new security requirements for the final hour of flight , rather than the security failures that allowed the attack to happen . Napolitano had originally stated on This Week that " once this incident occurred , everything went according to clockwork " and that " once the incident occurred , the system worked " . 
 The day after the attack , the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee and Senate Commerce , Science , and Transportation Committee both announced that they would hold hearings in January 2010 to investigate how the device passed through security , and whether further restrictions should be placed on air travel ; the Senate hearings began on January 21 . 
 Four days after the attack , Obama said publicly that Abdulmutallab 's ability to board the aircraft was the result of a systemic failure that included an inadequate sharing of information among U.S. and foreign government agencies . He called the situation " totally unacceptable . " He ordered that a report be delivered detailing how some government agencies had failed to share or highlight potentially relevant information about the suspect before he allegedly tried to blow up the airliner . Two days later Obama received the briefing , which included statements that information about the suspect had failed to cross agency lines , and that the failures to communicate within the U.S. government had led to the threat posed by Abdulmutallab not being known by certain agencies until the attack . Obama said he would meet with security officials and specifically question why Abdulmutallab was not placed on the U.S. no @-@ fly list , despite the government having received warnings about his potential al @-@ Qaeda links . 
 On January 27 , 2010 , an official from the U.S. State Department said that Abdulmutallab 's visa was not revoked because federal authorities believed that it would have compromised a larger investigation . The official , Patrick F. Kennedy , said intelligence officials had told the State Department that letting Abdulmutallab keep his visa would allow for a greater chance of exposing the terrorist network .

 On May 7 , 2012 , American officials claimed that they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253 . American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb , also planted in undergarments , and would have been deployed near the anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden . Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation . 
 An American official told MSNBC that the bomb was received by American security personnel in April , " was never near a plane " and " never posed a risk . " They speculated that the bomb might have been constructed by Ibrahim al @-@ <unk> , who is accused of constructing the explosives used by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in 2009 . 
 = Psychedelic music = 
 Psychedelic music ( sometimes psychedelia ) covers a range of popular music styles and genres influenced by the 1960s psychedelic culture , a subculture of people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD , psilocybin mushrooms , mescaline and DMT to experience visual and auditory hallucinations , synesthesia and altered states of consciousness . Psychedelic music attempted to replicate the hallucinogenic experience of using these drugs or enhance the experience of using them . Psychedelic music emerged during the mid @-@ 1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United States and Britain . 
 Psychedelic bands often drew on non @-@ Western sources such as the ragas , drones and sitars of Indian music and they used electric instruments and electronic effects – notably the lead electric guitar played with heavy distortion – and new , unorthodox recording techniques , such as playing tapes backwards or panning the music from one side to the other . Psychedelic influences spread into folk , rock , and soul , creating the subgenres of psychedelic folk , psychedelic rock , psychedelic pop and psychedelic soul in the late 1960s before declining in the early 1970s . Psychedelic music bands expanded their musical horizons , and went on to create and influence many new musical genres including progressive rock , kosmische musik , electronic rock , jazz rock , heavy metal , glam rock , funk , electro and bubblegum pop . Psychedelic music was revived in a variety of forms of neo @-@ psychedelia from the 1980s , in psychedelic hip hop and re @-@ emerged in electronic music in genres including acid house , trance music and new rave . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 A number of features are often included in psychedelic music . Exotic instrumentation , with a particular fondness for the sitar and tabla are common . Songs often have more complex song structures , key and time signature changes , modal melodies and drones than contemporary pop music . Surreal , whimsical , <unk> or literary @-@ inspired , lyrics are often used . There is often a strong emphasis on extended instrumental solos or jams , typically featuring a heavily distorted electric guitar as the main instrument . Electric guitars are plugged into large , powerful guitar amplifiers and speakers , which are turned up to a high volume and used with distortion to create feedback . Electric guitars are typically played through a wah wah pedal , usually with heavy fuzzbox or distortion effects . There is a strong keyboard presence , in the 1960s this especially using electronic organs , harpsichords , or the Mellotron , an early tape @-@ driven ' sampler ' keyboard . 
 Elaborate studio effects are often used , such as backwards tapes , panning the music from one side to another of the stereo track , using the " <unk> " sound of electronic phasing , long delay loops , and extreme reverb . In the 1960s there was a use of primitive electronic instruments such as early synthesizers and the theremin . Later forms of electronic psychedelia also employed repetitive computer @-@ generated beats . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 1960s : Origins = = = 
 From the second half of the 1950s , Beat Generation writers like William Burroughs , Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg wrote about and took drugs , including cannabis and Benzedrine , raising awareness and helping to popularise their use . In the early 1960s the use of LSD and other hallucinogens was advocated by new proponents of consciousness expansion such as Timothy Leary , Alan Watts , Aldous Huxley and Arthur Koestler , and , according to L. R. <unk> , they profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth . 
 The psychedelic life style had already developed in California , particularly in San Francisco , by the mid @-@ 1960s , with the first major underground LSD factory established by Owsley Stanley . From 1964 the Merry Pranksters , a loose group that developed around novelist Ken Kesey , sponsored the Acid Tests , a series of events involving the taking of LSD ( supplied by Stanley ) , accompanied by light shows , film projection and discordant , improvised music known as the psychedelic symphony . The Pranksters helped popularise LSD use , through their road trips across America in a psychedelically @-@ decorated converted school bus , which involved distributing the drug and meeting with major figures of the beat movement , and through publications about their activities such as Tom Wolfe 's The Electric Kool @-@ Aid Acid Test ( 1968 ) . 
 San Francisco also had an emerging music scene of folk clubs , coffee houses and independent radio stations that catered to the population of students at nearby Berkeley and the free thinkers that had gravitated to the city . There was already a culture of drug use among jazz and blues musicians , and in the early 1960s use of drugs including cannabis , peyote , mescaline and LSD began to grow among folk and rock musicians . Soon musicians began to refer ( at first indirectly , and later explicitly ) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music , just as it was reflected in psychedelic art , literature and film . 
 = = = = Folk = = = = 
 One of the first musical uses of the term " psychedelic " in the folk scene was by the New York @-@ based folk group The Holy Modal Rounders on their version of Lead Belly 's ' Hesitation Blues ' in 1964 . Folk / avant @-@ garde guitarist John Fahey recorded several songs in the early 1960s experimented with unusual recording techniques , including backwards tapes , and novel instrumental accompaniment including flute and sitar . His nineteen @-@ minute " The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party " " anticipated elements of psychedelia with its nervy improvisations and odd guitar tunings " . Similarly , folk guitarist Sandy Bull 's early work " incorporated elements of folk , jazz , and Indian and Arabic @-@ influenced <unk> modes " . His 1963 album <unk> for Guitar and Banjo explores various styles and " could also be accurately described as one of the very first psychedelic records " . 
 This trend ran in parallel in both America and Britain and as part of the inter @-@ related folk , folk rock and rock scenes . Blues , drugs , jazz and eastern influences had featured since 1964 in the work of Davy Graham and Bert Jansch . Folk artists who were particularly significant in the psychedelic movement included the Scottish performers Donovan , who combined influences of American artists like Bob Dylan with references to flower power , and the Incredible String Band , who from 1967 incorporated a range of influences into their acoustic instrument @-@ based music , including medieval and eastern instruments . 
 = = = = Rock and pop = = = = 
 In terms of bridging the relationship between music and hallucinogens , the Beatles and the Beach Boys were the most pivotal . The Beatles introduced guitar feedback with " I Feel Fine " ( 1964 ) . Drug references began to appear in their songs , in " Day Tripper " ( 1965 ) , and more explicitly in " Tomorrow Never Knows " ( 1966 ) . The Beach Boys ' Brian Wilson attempted to translate the effects of LSD into music for the group 's album Pet Sounds ( 1966 ) , which significantly heightened the visibility of psychedelic rock . As psychedelia emerged as a mainstream and commercial force , it would be reflected in pop music . Pet Sounds is credited for sparking a psychedelic pop revolution , inspiring mainstream pop acts to take part in the psychedelic culture . Pink Floyd 's " Arnold Layne " and " See Emily Play " , both written by Syd Barrett , helped set the pattern for pop @-@ psychedelia in Britain . 
 The first use of the term " psychedelic rock " is generally attributed to Austin , Texas band The 13th Floor Elevators , whose early tours would inspire San Francisco 's still @-@ incubating psychedelic scene . The Byrds rapidly progressed away from purely folk rock in 1966 with their single " Eight Miles High " , widely taken to be a reference to drug use . In 1966 , the UK underground scene based in North London supported new acts with psychedelic influences , including Pink Floyd , Traffic and Soft Machine . The same year saw the début albums of rock bands Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience which featured extended solo improvisation sections using heavily distorted and sound @-@ processed electric guitar , which went on to become a key feature of psychedelic music . 
 Psychedelic rock reached its peak in the last years of the decade . In America the Summer of Love was prefaced by the Human Be @-@ In event and reached its peak at the Monterey Pop Festival , the latter helping to make major American stars of Hendrix and The Who . Key recordings included Jefferson Airplane 's Surrealistic Pillow and The Doors ' Strange Days . These trends climaxed in the 1969 Woodstock festival , which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts , including Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin and Santana . 
 = = = = Soul = = = = 
 In the late 1960s , psychedelic music began to influence African American musicians , particularly the stars of the Motown label . Influenced by the civil rights movement , psychedelic soul had a darker and more political edge than much acid rock . Building on the funk sound of James Brown , it was pioneered by Sly and the Family Stone with songs like " Dance to the Music " ( 1968 ) , " Everyday People " ( 1968 ) and " I Want to Take You Higher " ( 1969 ) and The Temptations with " Cloud Nine " ( 1968 ) , " Runaway Child , Running Wild " ( 1969 ) and " Psychedelic Shack " ( 1969 ) . Others soon followed like the Supremes with " Love Child " ( 1968 ) and " Stoned Love " ( 1970 ) , The Chambers Brothers with " Time has come today " ( 1966 , but charting in 1968 ) , The 5th Dimension with a cover of Laura Nyro 's " Stoned Soul Picnic " ( 1968 ) , Edwin Starr 's " War " ( 1970 ) and the Undisputed Truth 's " Smiling Faces Sometimes " ( 1971 ) . George Clinton 's interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin @-@ offs , took the genre to its most extreme lengths making funk almost a religion in the 1970s , producing over forty singles , including three in the US top ten , and three platinum albums . 
 = = = Late 1960s : Decline = = = 
 By the end of the 1960s , the trend of exploring psychedelia in music was largely in retreat . LSD was declared illegal in the US and UK in 1966 . The linking of the murders of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by The Manson Family to Beatles songs such as " Helter Skelter " contributed to an anti @-@ hippie backlash . The Altamont Free Concert in California , headlined by The Rolling Stones on December 6 , 1969 , did not turn out to be a positive milestone in the psychedelic music scene , as was anticipated ; instead , it became notorious for the fatal stabbing of a black teenager Meredith Hunter by Hells Angel security guards . 
 Early " acid casualties " in the music scene , including Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys , Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones , Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd , helped to shift the focus of the respective bands of which they had been leading figures away from psychedelia . Some bands which had earlier led the psychedelic rock trends , such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream , broke up . Jimi Hendrix died in London in September 1970 , shortly after recording Band of Gypsies ( 1970 ) , Janis Joplin died of a heroin overdose in October 1970 . Jim Morrison of the Doors died in Paris in July 1971 . Many surviving acts moved away from psychedelia into either more back @-@ to @-@ basics " roots rock " ; into traditional @-@ based , pastoral or whimsical folk ; the wider experimentation of progressive rock ; or into riff @-@ laden heavy rock . By the early 1970s psychedelic @-@ soul influenced records were losing their grip on the charts and most of the major artists began to look for inspiration elsewhere . 
 After the death of Brian Epstein and the unpopular surreal television film , Magical Mystery Tour ( 1967 ) , the Beatles returned to a raw style with The Beatles ( 1968 ) and Let It Be ( 1970 ) , before their eventual break @-@ up . The " back to basics " trend was also evident in the Rolling Stones ' subsequent albums , from Beggar 's Banquet ( 1968 ) to Exile on Main St. ( 1972 ) . English folk rock outfit Fairport Convention released Liege and Lief in 1969 , turning away from American @-@ influenced folk rock toward a sound based on traditional British music and founding the subgenre of electric folk , to be followed by bands like Steeleye Span and <unk> . The psychedelic @-@ influenced and whimsical strand of British folk continued into the 1970s with acts including Comus , Mellow Candle , Nick Drake , The Incredible String Band , Forest and Trees , Kevin Ayers of Soft Machine and with Syd Barrett 's two solo albums . 
 = = = 1970s – present : Influence and revival = = = 
 Many of the British musicians and bands that had embraced psychedelia moved into creating the progressive rock genre in the 1970s , including Pink Floyd , Soft Machine and members of Yes . King Crimson 's album In the Court of the Crimson King ( 1969 ) , has been seen as an important link between psychedelia and progressive rock . While some bands such as Hawkwind maintained an explicitly psychedelic course into the 1970s , most bands dropped the psychedelic elements in favour of embarking on wider experimentation . As German bands from the psychedelic movement moved away from their psychedelic roots and placed increasing emphasis on electronic instrumentation , these groups , including Kraftwerk , Tangerine Dream , Can and Faust , developed a distinctive brand of electronic rock , known as kosmische musik , or in the British press as " Krautrock " . Their adoption of electronic synthesisers , along with the musical styles explored by Brian Eno in his keyboard playing with Roxy Music , had a major influence on subsequent development of electronic rock . The incorporation of jazz styles into the music of bands like Soft Machine and Can , also contributed to the development of the emerging jazz rock sound of bands such as Colosseum . 
 Psychedelic rock , with its distorted guitar sound , extended solos , and adventurous compositions , was an important bridge between blues @-@ oriented rock and the later emergence of the heavy metal genre . Two former guitarists with the Yardbirds , Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page , moved on to form key acts in the new blues rock @-@ heavy metal genre , The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin , respectively . Other major pioneers of the heavy metal genre had begun as blues @-@ based psychedelic bands , including Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , Judas Priest and UFO . 
 Psychedelic music also contributed to the origins of glam rock . In 1970 , when Marc Bolan moved away from his psychedelic folk style and formed the rock band T. Rex , he became the first " glam " rock star . From 1971 , David Bowie moved on from his early psychedelic explorations to develop his Ziggy Stardust persona , which incorporated elements of professional make @-@ up , mime and performance into his act . Psychedelic influences lasted a little longer in pop music , stretching into the early 1970s and playing a major part in the creation of Bubblegum pop . Similarly , psychedelic soul continued into the early 1970s , and its sounds were incorporated into funk music and eventually became part of the disco music style . 
 = = = = Neo @-@ psychedelia = = = = 
 Neo @-@ psychedelia ( or acid punk ) is a diverse subgenre of alternative / indie rock that originated in the 1970s as an outgrowth of the British post @-@ punk scene . Its practitioners drew from the unusual sounds of 1960s psychedelic music , either updating or copying the approaches from that era . Neo @-@ psychedelia may include forays into psychedelic pop , jangly guitar rock , heavily distorted free @-@ form jams , or recording experiments . 
 = = = = Hip hop = = = = 
 Psychedelic hip hop emerged at the end of the 1980s as rappers began to sample mellower grooves , with De La Soul 's debut album 3 Feet High and Rising ( 1989 ) . White rappers Beastie Boys double album Paul 's Boutique ( 1989 ) moved towards a more sophisticated sound that incorporated diverse influences , including Curtis Mayfield and Pink Floyd . In the 1990s there was considerable experimentation and cross @-@ fertilisation between psychedelia and rap . The Jungle Brothers merged hip hop and acid house on " I 'll House You " ( 1990 ) and A Tribe Called Quest used samples of jazz and Lou Reed on " I Left My Wallet in El Segundo " ( 1990 ) . Digital Underground incorporated elements of sex , science fiction and druggy in @-@ jokes of P @-@ Funk into their stage shows , while Arrested Development were influenced by Sly and the Family Stone . Other acts influenced by psychedelia included Digable Planets , Divine <unk> and Cypress Hill . P.M. Dawn , an ensemble formed by brothers <unk> and Jarrett Cordes drew on diverse samples of modern pop music from the Beatles , through Sly and the Family Stone to Spandau Ballet . Their Of the Heart , of the Soul and of the Cross : The Utopian Experience ( 1991 ) and The Bliss Album ... ? ( Vibrations of Love and Anger and the <unk> of Life and Existence ) ( 1993 ) were hits in the US and UK and crossed over into the rave scene . From the late 1990s other artists working in this area included RZA , The Roots , D 'Angelo and Erykah Badu . 
 = = = = Electronic music = = = = 
 Rave music may either refer to the late 1980s / early 1990s genres of house , acid house and techno , the first genres of music in the world to be played at raves , or any other genre of electronic dance music that may be played at a rave . The genre " rave " , also known as " hardcore " by early ravers , first appeared amongst the UK acid movement during the late 1980s at warehouse parties and other underground venues , as well as on UK pirate radio stations . The genre would develop into oldschool hardcore , which lead onto newer forms of rave music such as drum and bass and 2 @-@ step , as well as other hardcore techno genres , such as <unk> , <unk> and happy hardcore . In the late 1980s , rave culture began to filter through from English expatriates and disc jockeys who would visit Continental Europe . American raves began in the 1990s in New York City . 
 = = = = = Acid house = = = = = 
 Acid house originated in the mid @-@ 1980s in the house music style of Chicago DJs like DJ Pierre , Adonis , Farley <unk> Funk and <unk> , the last of which coined the term on his " Acid Trax " ( 1987 ) . It mixed elements of house with the " squelchy " sounds and deep basslines produced by the Roland TB @-@ 303 synthesizer . As singles began to reach the UK the sound was re @-@ created , beginning in small warehouse parties held in London in 1986 – 87 . During 1988 in the Second Summer of Love it hit the mainstream as thousands of clubgoers travelled to mass raves . The genre then began to penetrate the British pop charts with hits for M / A / R / R / S , S 'Express , and <unk> by the early 1990s , before giving way to the popularity of trance music . 
 = = = = = Trance = = = = = 
 Trance music originated in the German techno and hardcore scenes of the early 1990s . It emphasized brief and repeated synthesizer lines with minimal rhythmic changes and occasional synthesizer atmospherics , with the aim of putting listeners into a trance @-@ like state . Derived from acid house and techno music , it developed in Germany and the Netherlands with singles including " Energy Flash " by Joey Beltram and " The <unk> " by CJ Bolland . This was followed by releases by Robert <unk> , Sun Electric , Aphex Twin and most influentially the techno @-@ trance released by the <unk> label , including the much emulated " <unk> 1 " ( 1992 ) by duo <unk> . Having gained some popularity in the UK in the early 1990s it was eclipsed by the appearance of new genres of electronic music such as trip hop and jungle , before taking off again towards the end of the decade and beginning to dominate the clubs , with DJs including Paul Oakenfold , Pete Tong , Tony De Vit , Danny Rampling , Sasha , Judge Jules and in the US Christopher Lawrence and Kimball Collins . It soon began to fragment into a number of subgenres , including progressive trance , acid trance , <unk> trance , psychedelic trance , hard trance and uplifting trance . 
 = = = = = New rave = = = = = 
 In Britain in the 2000s ( decade ) , the combination of indie rock with dance @-@ punk was dubbed " new rave " in publicity for The Klaxons , and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to a number of bands , including Trash Fashion , New Young Pony Club , Hadouken ! , Late of the Pier , Test <unk> , and <unk> . It formed a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier rave music , emphasizing visual effects : glowsticks , neon and other lights were common , and followers of the scene often dressed in extremely bright and fluorescent coloured clothing . 
 = Tyson Gay = 
 Tyson Gay ( born August 9 , 1982 ) is an American track and field sprinter , who competes in the 100 and 200 meters dash . His 100 m personal best of 9 @.@ 69 seconds is the American record and makes him tied for second fastest athlete ever , after Usain Bolt . His 200 m time of 19 @.@ 58 makes him the sixth fastest athlete in that event . He has since received a one @-@ year ban for doping . 
 Gay has won numerous medals in major international competitions , including a gold medal sweep of the 100 m , 200 m and 4 × 100 m relay at the 2007 Osaka World Championships . This made him the second man to win all three events at the same World Championships , after Maurice Greene ( Usain Bolt duplicated the feat two years later ) . Gay is a four @-@ time U.S. champion in the 100 m . 
 At the 2008 Olympic Trials , he ran a wind assisted 9 @.@ 68 seconds in the 100 m . Days after he suffered a severe hamstring injury in the 200 m trials and did not win any medals at the Beijing Olympics . His performance of 9 @.@ 71 seconds to win the 100 m silver medal in the 2009 World Championships is the fastest non @-@ winning time for the event . 
 In July 2013 , it was announced that Gay had tested positive for a banned substance , following which he withdrew from consideration for the World Championships in Moscow . The United States Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( USADA ) suspended him until June 23 , 2014 , and stripped him of his silver medal from the 2012 Summer Olympics as a result . 
 Gay is a two @-@ time winner of the Jesse Owens Award , was the 2007 IAAF World Athlete of the Year , won Best Track and Field Athlete for Track & Field News in 2007 and for ESPY Award in 2008 and 2011 . He has also achieved multiple Men 's season 's best performances in the 100 m and 200 m . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born on August 9 , 1982 in Lexington , Kentucky , Tyson Gay is the only son of Daisy Gay and Greg Mitchell . Athletic prowess was part of his family life ; Gay 's grandmother ran for Eastern Kentucky University and his mother Daisy also competed in her youth , though she was pregnant with her first child by her early teens . Gay 's older sister , Tiffany , was a keen sprinter and had a successful high school career . Tiffany and Tyson Gay , encouraged by their mother , raced at every opportunity , training hard at school and on the hills in their neighborhood . There was strong competition between the two , and Gay later said that his sister 's quick reaction time inspired him to improve . 
 = = Amateur career = = 
 Although Gay tended to be a slow starter on the track , he worked hard to improve and broke the Lafayette High School stadium record for the 200 meters . Under the tutelage of Ken Northington , a former 100 yard dash state champion , Gay began working on his technique and rhythm . By his senior year he was a more composed athlete and he focused on the 100 meters , winning the state championship in the event and setting a new championship record of 10 @.@ 60 s . In spite of this , his mother noted that he was not fully applying himself and was taking his abilities for granted . Gay was also not a studious child and he failed to achieve the grades needed to enter a Division I sports college . However , the Kentucky High School State Championships in June 2001 demonstrated his abilities : he won gold in the 100 m , setting a new personal best and state record with 10 @.@ 46 s , a record which stands to this day . In the 200 m he took silver with another new personal best of 21 @.@ 23 s . At a 2001 track event , Gay met trainer Lance Brauman and the college coach convinced him to attend Barton County Community College . It was here that Gay first met Jamaican sprinter Veronica Campbell @-@ Brown , and the two formed a close bond , becoming training partners . 
 The move to the college in Great Bend , Kansas , marked further progression for Gay : in 2002 his 100 m and 200 m times dropped to 10 @.@ 08 s and 20 @.@ 21 s respectively , albeit with wind assistance . He improved upon his legal personal bests too , recording a 100 m run of 10 @.@ 27 s and 20 @.@ 88 s in the 200 m . He also continued to outstrip the competition , winning the 100 m at the NJCAA National Championship . Returning to the NJCAA event the following year , with the wind in his favour , Gay took bronze in the 100 m with 10 @.@ 01 s and silver in the 200 m with 20 @.@ 31 s . Injuries upset the rest of 2003 for Gay , and his coach Brauman moved on to work as the sprint coach at the University of Arkansas . Gay decided to follow his tutor and he was keen to join the university 's highly successful amateur track and field program ; 
 = = = National debut = = = 
 Gay chose to study sociology and marketing , and the university environment gave the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sprinter his first opportunity to compete in NCAA events . In the NCAA Men 's Indoor Track and Field Championship in March , Gay finished fourth in the 60 meters , with 6 @.@ 63 s , and fifth in the closely fought 200 m with a time of 20 @.@ 58 s ( he missed out on second place by only two hundredths of a second ) . The NCAA Men 's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in June proved far more fruitful , however , as Gay became Arkansas ' first 100 m NCAA champion , setting a school record of 10 @.@ 06 s . Furthermore , his efforts in the event helped the Arkansas athletic team win the NCAA Championship . 
 The results of Gay 's first 2004 US Olympic Trials confirmed his status as a rising contender in the 100 m and 200 m events . Although he did not reach the final of either event , he reached the semis of the highly competitive 100 m and posted a 200 m personal best of 20 @.@ 07 s in the qualifying stages . A hamstring injury due to dehydration prevented Gay from competing in the 200 m final , but he did not see the trials as a missed opportunity , rather a springboard for future events : " I was really focused upon the team , had a great shot , but it was a learning experience — how to take care of my body . " The end of year Track and Field News rankings for United States sprinters showed him to be the eighth fastest 100 m runner and the fourth fastest sprinter over 200 m that year — indicative of his potential , he was younger than all those ranked ahead of him . 
 In Gay 's final year as an amateur athlete he started well , setting a personal best and school record of 6 @.@ 55 s in the 60 m at the 2005 Championship Series . He helped the University team to another NCAA outdoor victory , setting a new personal best of 19 @.@ 93 s in the 200 m qualifiers and placing third in the finals . Training partner and friend Wallace Spearmon took first place with 19 @.@ 91 s — his time and Gay 's 19 @.@ 93 s were the second and third @-@ fastest 200 m times in the world that year . The pair teamed up for the 4 x 100 m relay , along with Michael Grant and Omar Brown , and won with an Arkansas @-@ record @-@ breaking time of 38 @.@ 49 s . With the NCAA Championships behind him , in June 2005 Gay decided to become a professional athlete , setting his sights on a place in the US 200 m team for the Helsinki World Championships . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 = = = Debut season = = = 
 Upon turning professional , Gay entered the USA Outdoor Championships , where he took silver in the 200 m with 20 @.@ 06 s . He was selected for the 200 m at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki and finished fourth , beaten by three of his compatriots ( Justin Gatlin , Spearmon and John Capel ) . This completed the unprecedented feat of a single nation taking the top four positions at the championship event . Gay formed part of the 4 x 100 m relay team but a poor baton exchange between Mardy Scales and Leonard Scott resulted in disqualification . Later in the month , Gay briefly turned his attentions to the 100 m and scored a season 's best of 10 @.@ 08 s at the Rieti Grand Prix . 
 He ended the 2005 season on a positive note by winning the gold medal in the 200 m at the World Athletics Final , his first major championship title . His time of 19 @.@ 96 s was his second fastest that year and fourth fastest of any sprinter that season . Although he stated that the quality of the competition and memories of Helsinki had made him nervous beforehand , he went on to beat all three American sprinters he had lost to in the World Championships , becoming the first athlete to beat Gatlin over 200 m that season . It was not only his rival sprinters that would cause future difficulties , however , as Gay 's coach Brauman was indicted for various crimes relating to his time at Barton College and the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville . He had helped athletes gain funds and credits that they were not entitled to . Following Gay 's testimony , the courts ruled that Brauman was guilty and , as a result , Arkansas ' two NCAA titles and all of Gay 's college track times were annulled . None of the athletes were charged with any wrongdoing . Although he was imprisoned for 10 months , Brauman continued to train Gay , periodically updating him with coaching routines and techniques .

 The 2006 athletics season saw Gay rise to the top of the rankings for the first time and become a genuine contender in the 100 m . He became the 2006 US Outdoor Champion in unfortunate circumstances : Gay originally finished second in 10 @.@ 07 s with a strong headwind , but Justin Gatlin 's first @-@ place finish was later rescinded for use of a banned substance . Gay significantly improved upon his previous 200 m personal best by over two @-@ tenths of a second at the IAAF Grand Prix in Lausanne . However , his time of 19 @.@ 70 s was not enough to beat newcomer Xavier Carter who ran the second fastest time ever with 19 @.@ 63 s . Improvements in the 100 m followed , as he won the Rethymno track meet and set another personal best with 9 @.@ 88 s . Gay scored another sub @-@ 10 second 100 m at the Stockholm Grand Prix , finishing second to Asafa Powell with a 9 @.@ 97 s , and beating Michael Johnson 's British all @-@ comers 200 m record with a 19 @.@ 84 s win in London . Gay continued to improve at the 100 m , revising his personal best to 9 @.@ 84 s at the Zürich Golden League meet , but it was not enough to beat Powell , who equaled his own world record of 9 @.@ 77 s . 
 Gay 's 200 m performance at the 2006 IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart was the culmination of a highly successful year . He became the World Athletics Final champion with another improved personal best of 19 @.@ 68 s , making him the joint third @-@ fastest 200 m sprinter with Namibian Frankie Fredericks . Gay was pleased that Fredericks was on site to see his best equaled : " To run that time in front of Frankie is a privilege . He 's someone I admire a great deal both as an athlete and as a man . " Gay also won a bronze medal in the 100 m , finishing behind Powell and Scott . However , Gay proved himself over 100 m at the 2006 IAAF World Cup , taking gold with a 9 @.@ 88 s run . At the end of the season , with Gatlin banned from competition , Gay dominated the Track and Field News US 2006 list , having run six of the seven fastest 100 m , with Scott in third , and four of the top six 200 m times ( behind Carter and Spearmon ) . Furthermore , he was the second fastest 100 m runner in the world that year , second only to world record holder Powell . Having proven himself to be adept at both 100 and 200 m , Gay reflected upon his development as a sprinter : 
 = = = 2007 Osaka World Championships = = = 
 With Brauman still serving his sentence , Gay began working with a new coach – Olympic gold medalist Jon Drummond . Drummond was renowned for being quick off the mark , and Gay hoped that he could help improve his starting times . Gay aimed to challenge World Record holder Powell 's dominance of the 100 m event , stating : " I want this to be a rivalry . I want to step up to the plate " . His performances backed up his remarks , as he started the 2007 outdoor season with two wind @-@ assisted runs of 9 @.@ 79 s and 9 @.@ 76 s . The latter time was recorded with a wind only 0 @.@ 2 m / s over the allowed limit , and was superior to Powell 's record of 9 @.@ 77 s . 
 At the US National Championships he equaled his 100 m best of 9 @.@ 84 s while running into the wind . This was a meeting record and the second fastest 100 m time with a headwind after Maurice Greene 's 9 @.@ 82 s run . He followed this with a new 200 m personal best in the finals , again facing an impeding wind . His time of 19 @.@ 62 s was the second fastest ever ; only Johnson 's 19 @.@ 32 s run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was faster . Gay was happy with the achievement but noted that the competition was still strong : " I wasn 't thinking about any time . I was trying to get away from Spearmon as fast as I could . " After noting that he was feeling worn out , Gay had a brief recuperation period in preparation for the 2007 World Championships in Osaka , Japan . He returned to the track in Europe and , while weather conditions were poor , he won the 200 m in Lausanne with 19 @.@ 78 s and had wins at 100 m events in Sheffield and London . He relished the opportunity to face Powell at the World Championships : both sprinters were undefeated that year and Gay said that he felt ready for the challenge . 
 Facing each other for the first time that year , the IAAF described the 100 m final in Osaka as " the season 's most eagerly @-@ anticipated battle " . Gay won with a time of 9 @.@ 85 s , sprinting ahead of Derrick Atkins and third @-@ placed Powell to become the new 100 m world champion . Although this was the American 's first major 100 m title , he remained respectful of Powell : 
 Gay doubled his gold medal count in the 200 m event . He ran a new championship record time of 19 @.@ 76 s to win a second gold medal , beating Usain Bolt and Spearmon to the post . Bolt was clear to point out that he lost to the better athlete : " I got beaten by the No. 1 man in the world . For the moment , he is unbeatable . " Only Maurice Greene and Gatlin had won the sprint double at the Championships before , but Gay eyed a third gold in the 4 x 100 meters relay . The Americans faced stiff competition from the Jamaican team , which included Powell and Bolt . The Jamaicans set a national record , but it was not enough to beat the United States team , who finished in a world @-@ leading time of 37 @.@ 78 s . Gay won his third gold medal alongside Darvis Patton , Spearmon and Leroy Dixon . The triple @-@ gold haul repeated the feat achieved by Maurice Greene at the 1999 Seville World Championships and Carl Lewis in 1983 and 1987 . 
 Although Gay had been bullish in victory on the track , the achievement did not change him — he remained humble and appreciative to his rivals . In November he was chosen as the IAAF Male World Athlete of the Year for 2007 and in his acceptance speech he paid tribute to his peers , encouraging Powell to remain focused and saying that he highly regarded the Jamaican . He also dismissed comparisons to his forebears , commenting : " I honestly believe that I need to have the World record like some of the other great sprinters like Carl Lewis , Maurice Greene . I think that sets you apart , having medals and having the World record . " At the end of the season Gay was elected 2007 Men 's Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News ( topping the year 's list as the fastest 100 m and 200 m sprinter ) , and he won the USATF 's Harrison Dillard award as the top US male sprinter .

 Following Brauman 's release from prison , Gay set out preparing for the Beijing Olympics , training with both Brauman and Jon Drummond in the off @-@ season . Returning to competition in May , he continued as he had left off in 2007 : winning the 200 m in Kingston , taking gold in both sprints at the Adidas Track Classic , and finishing second in the 100 m at the Reebok Grand Prix with a 9 @.@ 85 s run . However , Gay now faced a new , emerging challenger in Usain Bolt ; at the latter event Bolt had beaten Gay with a world @-@ record @-@ setting 9 @.@ 72 s . Taking this into consideration , he realized that a world record time would be needed to beat both Bolt and Powell at the Olympics ; Gay aimed to run below 9 @.@ 70 s . With athletes running such quick times , the US Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( USADA ) sought to counter claims of performance @-@ enhancing drugs use through " Project Believe " , a regular , extensive drugs testing program . The BALCO scandal and the banning of high @-@ profile athletes , including Gatlin and Marion Jones , had damaged the public 's perception of sprinting and the USADA recruited Gay to prove clean athletes could be just as successful . 
 The favorite for qualification in both the 100 m and 200 m at the US Olympic Trials , Gay put in a strong performance in the heats . After a misjudgement in the first round almost caused him to miss out on qualification , Gay resolved to step up his pace , and he won the 100 m quarter @-@ final with a US record @-@ setting run of 9 @.@ 77 s . Breaking Maurice Greene 's nine @-@ year @-@ old record , this made Gay the third fastest 100 m sprinter ever , after rivals Bolt and Powell . In the final the following day , Gay finished first in a wind @-@ aided 9 @.@ 68 s ( + 4 @.@ 1 m / s ) . This was the fastest ever 100 m time under any conditions , bettering the 9 @.@ 69 s record which Obadele Thompson had set 12 years earlier . The 200 m event was a significant setback for Gay as he suffered a hamstring injury in the qualifiers and was subsequently ruled out of the event for the Olympics . The injury persisted for several weeks and he dropped out of track meetings in order to recover in time for the Olympics . 
 Gay made his track return in Beijing but his injury had reduced his 100 m medal chances and Bolt and Powell were more favored to win the event . The much anticipated Gay , Bolt and Powell final never materialised , however , as Gay failed to qualify in the semi @-@ finals . Finishing fifth after recording 10 @.@ 05 s , Gay denied that he was still injured , but claimed the hamstring problem had upset his training schedule . 
 Further disappointment followed as the American 4 x 100 m relay team , with Gay as anchor , failed to qualify for the final . Darvis Patton and Gay failed to pass on the baton in the heat . Gay personally took responsibility for the dropped baton but Patton denied this was true , saying " That 's Tyson Gay . He 's a humble guy , but I know it 's my job to get the guy the baton and I didn 't do that . " After stating his desire to win four Olympic gold medals ( by adding the 400 metres to his repertoire ) earlier in the year , Gay finished the 2008 Olympics without a single medal . Having failed to reach the finals of the 100 m sprint or relay , he reflected upon his failure to make the podium in Beijing : " [ I felt the baton ] then I went to grab it and there was nothing . It 's kind of the way it 's been happening to me this Olympics . " 
 Gay rounded off the season in Europe , winning in the 200 m at Gateshead , but he had to withdraw from a ÅF Golden League race against Bolt and Powell due to his hamstring injury .

 At the start of the 2010 outdoor season , Gay ran a new 400 m best time of 44 @.@ 89 seconds . This run , which improved upon his previous record by nearly seven tenths of a second , made him the first sprinter ever to run under the significant time barriers in the three sprints – under ten seconds for the 100 m , twenty seconds for the 200 m , and 45 seconds for the 400 m . 
 At the Great City Games in Manchester , England in May , he set his sights on breaking Tommie Smith 's 44 @-@ year @-@ old world best mark over a 200 m straight . He beat Smith 's time of 19 @.@ 5 by finishing in 19 @.@ 41 seconds – including a first 100 m of 9 @.@ 88 and a first 150 m of 14 @.@ 41 seconds . He suffered from hamstring difficulty after the run but returned to compete at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene , Oregon in July – his first meeting of the 2010 IAAF Diamond League . Running over 200 m , he finished in 19 @.@ 76 seconds but was beaten to the line by Walter Dix , who returned from a year @-@ long hiatus .

He set a meet record of 19 @.@ 72 seconds at the Herculis meeting in Monaco later that month , but expressed disappointment with his race execution as Yohan Blake came close to overhauling him at the finish . 
 The 100 m at the DN Galan meeting in Stockholm saw Gay 's first match @-@ up of the year against Bolt . He surprised the Olympic and World champion with a resounding victory , beating him with 9 @.@ 84 to Bolt 's 9 @.@ 97 seconds . This was only the second time Bolt had lost a 100 m final – the first occurring in July 2008 against Powell ( also at Stockholm Olympic Stadium ) . Gay broke Powell 's stadium record and earned a one carat diamond for the feat . Gay chose not to overstate the significance of the win , acknowledging that Bolt was far from peak fitness : " It feels great to beat Usain but deep down inside I know he is not 100 % . I look forward to beating him when he is " . With Bolt and Powell both out with injuries , Gay won unchallenged at the London Grand Prix the following week , running a world leading time of 9 @.@ 78 seconds despite poor weather .

 = Forage War = 
 The Forage War was a partisan campaign consisting of numerous small skirmishes that took place in New Jersey during the American Revolutionary War between January and March 1777 , following the battles of Trenton and Princeton . After both British and Continental Army troops entered their winter quarters in early January , Continental Army regulars and militia companies from New Jersey and Pennsylvania engaged in numerous scouting and harassing operations against the British and German troops quartered in New Jersey . 
 The British troops wanted to have fresh provisions to consume , and also required fresh forage for their draft animals and horses . General George Washington ordered the systematic removal of such supplies from areas easily accessible to the British , and companies of American militia and troops harassed British and German forays to acquire such provisions . While many of these operations were small , in some cases they became quite elaborate , involving more than 1 @,@ 000 troops . The American operations were so successful that British casualties in New Jersey ( including those of the battles at Trenton and Princeton ) exceeded those of the entire campaign for New York . 
 = = Background = = 
 In August 1776 the British army began a campaign to gain control over New York City , which was defended by George Washington 's Continental Army . Over the next two months , General William Howe quickly gained control of New York , pushing Washington into New Jersey . He then chased Washington south toward Philadelphia . Washington retreated across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania , taking with him all the boats for miles in each direction . Howe then ordered his army into winter quarters , establishing a chain of outposts across New Jersey , from the Hudson River through New Brunswick to Trenton and Bordentown on the Delaware River . The occupation of New Jersey by British and German troops caused friction with the local communities and led to a rise in Patriot militia enlistments . As early as mid @-@ December , these militia companies were harassing British patrols , leading to incidents like Geary 's ambush , in which a dragoon leader was killed , and increasing the level of tension in the British and German quarters . 
 On the night of December 25 – 26 , 1776 , Washington crossed the Delaware and surprised the Trenton outpost the following morning . Over the next two weeks , he went on to win two further battles at Assunpink Creek and Battle of Princeton , leading the British to retreat to northern New Jersey . 
 = = Disposition of the armies = = 
 General Washington established his headquarters at Morristown , separated from the coast by the Watchung Mountains , a series of low ridges . He established forward outposts to the east and south of these ridges that served not only as a defensive bulwark against potential British incursions across the hills , but also as launch points for raids . Over the course of January and February , Washington 's Continental Army shrank to about 2 @,@ 500 regulars after Washington 's incentives for many men to overstay their enlistment periods ran out . A large number of militia from New Jersey , New York , and Pennsylvania bolstered these forces , and played a significant role that winter . 
 The British army was initially deployed from posts as far north as Hackensack to New Brunswick . The garrison , numbering about 10 @,@ 000 , was concentrated between New Brunswick and Amboy , with a sizable contingent farther north , from Elizabethtown to Paulus Hook . Militia pressure in January led General Cornwallis to withdraw most of the northern troops to the shores of the Hudson . The resulting concentration of troops overflowed the available housing , which had been entirely abandoned by its residents , with some of the troops even living aboard ships anchored nearby ; the cramped quarters led to an increase in camp @-@ related illnesses throughout the winter , and morale was low . The area had been heavily plundered during the American retreat in the fall , so there was little in the way of local provisions . The men subsisted largely on rations such as salt pork , but their draft animals required fresh fodder , for which they sent out raiding expeditions . 
 = = Tactics = = 
 Early in the winter , Washington sent out detachments of troops to systematically remove any remaining provisions and livestock from convenient access by the British . General Cornwallis sent out small foraging and raiding parties in January . These were met by larger formations ( numbering 300 and up ) of American militia companies , sometimes with Continental Army support , that led on occasion to significant casualties . In one early example , Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson mustered 450 militia and drove off a British foraging expedition in the Battle of Millstone on January 20 . Washington gave his commanders wide latitude in how to act , issuing commands that they were to be " constantly harassing the enemy " , and that they should be aggressive in their tactics . These early successes depended in part on successful intelligence ; one British commander reported being met with force " notwithstanding the Orders were given , but a few hours before the Troops moved . " Even supply convoys bringing provisions from outside the state to the large garrison at New Brunswick were not immune to the American attacks , where the Raritan River and the roads from Perth Amboy offered opportunities for sniping and raiding . Their difficulties led British commanders to change tactics , attempting to lure these militia units into traps involving larger numbers of British regulars . 
 But even this was not entirely successful , as wily militia and Continental commanders including Continental Army General William Maxwell used superior knowledge of the geography to set even more elaborate traps . In one encounter in late February , British Colonel Charles Mawhood , thinking he had flanked a party of New Jersey militia , suddenly found his advance force flanked by another , larger force . As they were driven back toward Amboy , more and more Americans appeared , ultimately inflicting about 100 casualties . The elite grenadiers of the 42nd Foot , part of Mawhood 's vanguard , were badly mauled in the encounter . A British force of 2 @,@ 000 was repulsed by Maxwell in another well @-@ organized attack a few weeks later . 
 The ongoing tensions took their toll on the beleaguered British . Johann Ewald , captain of a company of German jägers ( essentially light infantry ) who were often on the front lines , observed that " the men have to stay dressed day and night ... the horses constantly saddled " , and that " the army would have been gradually destroyed through this foraging " . Some forage was provided from New York , but it was never sufficient for the army 's needs . As a consequence , the British were forced to provide many supplies from Europe , at great cost and risk to the Royal Navy .

 A regiment of Waldeck infantry , a few companies of the 71st Foot and a troop of British light dragoons were stationed at Elizabethtown , New Jersey in the winter of 1776 – 1777 . On 5 January 1777 , a British cavalry patrol was ambushed by militia near the town . One trooper was killed and a second was wounded . The next day , about 50 Waldeck infantry emerged from the town with a small escort of light dragoons with instructions to clear the country . Led by Captain Georg von Haacke , the strong patrol was attacked near Springfield by New Jersey militia . In Elizabethtown , the soldiers heard distant gunfire . Hours later the bedraggled British horsemen came back without the foot soldiers . Eight or 10 of the <unk> were shot down and the entire party captured by the militia . Ordered to pull back to Amboy , the garrison hurriedly left on 7 January . As the troops evacuated Elizabethtown , the militia attacked the rear guard . In the confused retreat , the Americans captured 100 soldiers , the baggage trains of two regiments , and food supplies .

 At the Battle of Millstone , Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey militia scored a brilliant success .

The British lost 25 casualties , 12 prisoners , 43 wagons , 104 horses , 115 cattle and about 60 sheep . The Americans admitted losses of four or five men . Afterward , the British refused to believe that had been beaten by militia . On 23 January two British regiments were waylaid by Brigadier General William Maxwell near Woodbridge . The 200 New Jersey Continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded .

 On 1 February 1777 , Brigadier General Sir William Erskine , 1st Baronet set up a clever trap . He sent a party of foragers to Drake 's Farm near Metuchen . When Scott 's 5th Virginia tried to gobble up the small party , Erskine rushed his large force into action . Battalions of grenadiers , light infantry , 42nd Foot and Hessians appeared , supported by eight artillery pieces . Instead of fleeing , the Virginians launched a vicious attack which momentarily broke a grenadier battalion . Under intense cannon fire , the American attack was stopped , but the soldiers fought tenaciously until the British fell back toward Brunswick . The Americans admitted 30 to 40 casualties while claiming to have killed 36 British and wounding 100 more . The action was marred by an ugly incident when Lieutenant William Kelly and six other wounded Americans were abandoned during a tactical withdrawal . The frustrated British fell upon the seven helpless men with bayonets and musket butts and slaughtered them all . When the Americans recovered the mangled bodies they were infuriated . Brigadier General Adam Stephen exchanged a series of irate letters with Erskine , who denied all responsibility for the incident .

 On 23 February 1777 , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood was sent with a reinforced brigade to destroy any rebel forces he could catch . He set out with a battalion each of light infantry and grenadiers , plus the 3rd Brigade . The latter formation consisted of the 10th Foot , 37th Foot , 38th Foot and 52nd Foot , recently transferred from the Rhode Island garrison . Near <unk> , now Rahway , New Jersey , Mawhood found a group of militia herding some livestock covered by a larger body of Americans waiting on a nearby hill . The British officer sent the grenadier company of the 42nd Foot on a wide flanking maneuver . Just as the grenadiers prepared to launch their assault , they were fired on from ambush and routed with the loss of 26 men . At this moment , Maxwell sent his superior force forward to envelop Mawhood 's force . The American force included the 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 4th New Jersey Regiments , the 1st and 8th Pennsylvania Regiments , and the German Battalion . Mawhood 's surprised men were hounded all the way back to Amboy , which they reached at 8 : 00 PM . The Americans lost 5 killed and 9 wounded , and claimed to have inflicted 100 casualties . Mawhood admitted losing 69 killed and wounded and 6 missing .

 Historian David Hackett Fischer compiled a list that he describes as " incomplete " , consisting of 58 actions that occurred between January 4 and March 21 , 1777 . The documented British and German casualties numbered more than 900 ; a number of the events do not include any casualty reports . Combined with their losses at Trenton and Princeton , the British lost more men in New Jersey than they did during the campaign for New York City . Fischer does not estimate American casualties , and other historians ( e.g. Ketchum and <unk> ) have not compiled any casualty estimates . Fischer notes that relatively few official reports of American ( either militia or Continental Army ) unit strengths for this time period have survived .

 The 1777 military campaigns began to take shape in April . General Charles Cornwallis punctuated the winter skirmishes with an attack on the Continental Army outpost at Bound Brook on April 13 . In the Battle of Bound Brook , he very nearly captured its commander , Benjamin Lincoln . <unk> the Americans 2 @,@ 000 to 500 , the British scattered the militia but met stubborn resistance from the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment . The British captured three 3 @-@ pound guns and 20 or 30 men and killed six Americans , but the bulk of Lincoln 's force got away . General Washington moved his army from its winter quarters at Morristown to a more forward position at Middlebrook in late May to better react to British moves . As General Howe prepared his Philadelphia campaign , he first moved a large portion of his army to Somerset Court House in mid @-@ June , apparently in an attempt to draw Washington from the Middlebrook position . When this failed , Howe withdrew his army back to Perth Amboy , and embarked it on ships bound for the Chesapeake Bay . Northern and coastal New Jersey continued to be the site of skirmishing and raiding by the British forces that occupied New York City for the rest of the war . 
 = Hurricane Barbara ( 1953 ) = 
 Hurricane Barbara was the second named tropical cyclone of the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season . Forming from a tropical wave on August 11 in the southern Bahamas , Barbara moved northward and attained hurricane status the next day . Ultimately peaking with winds corresponding to Category 2 status on the modern @-@ day Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , Barbara moved ashore in eastern North Carolina and curved back out to sea . The storm passed to the southeast of the New England region and dissipated on August 16 . Damage from the hurricane was fairly minor , totaling around $ 1 @.@ 3 million ( 1953 USD , $ 11 @.@ 5 million 2016 USD ) . Most of it occurred in North Carolina and Virginia from crop damage . The hurricane left several injuries , some traffic accidents , as well as seven fatalities in the eastern United States ; at least two were due to electrocution from downed power lines . Offshore Atlantic Canada , a small boat sunk , killing its crew of two .

 In the days preceding the storm 's formation , a tropical wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean . The wave was initially weak as it tracked toward Cuba , but on August 10 , there were indications of a closed circulation center over the eastern portion of the island . The low deepened a bit as it moved northward to a position near Eleuthera Island in the Bahamas on August 11 , at which time the disturbance organized into a tropical storm . The storm intensified throughout the day , and on the morning of August 12 , reconnaissance aircraft found winds of about 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) in the northeastern section of the circulation , although the southwestern portion was still weak and disorganized . It is estimated that Barbara became a hurricane at around 1200 UTC . 
 Moving north @-@ northwestward , the hurricane continued to mature , and it attained an intensity corresponding to Category 2 status on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale early on August 13 as it approached eastern North Carolina . Shortly thereafter , Barbara reached its peak winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) while located south of Cape Hatteras . The cyclone moved over the Outer Banks of North Carolina overnight , crossing the shore between Morehead City and Ocracoke . It weakened as it progressed northward , and curved eastward out to sea due to a building ridge . It passed just southeast of the Mid @-@ Atlantic states and New England , brushing Cape Cod , Massachusetts as it began to accelerate northeastward . 
 As Barbara moved toward the Canadian Maritimes , it began to undergo an extratropical transition , completing the transition by late on August 15 just south of Nova Scotia . However , the Canadian Hurricane Centre assessed Barbara as remaining tropical until after it turned northward and struck eastern Nova Scotia on August 16 . At this time , a trough developed to the southeast of the storm , and Barbara later tracked just west of Newfoundland . A new low formed in association with the trough , and as Barbara rapidly headed northward , the developing center moved more slowly . However , the new low quickly gained strength and became the more intense of the two storm systems . Barbara then stalled near Goose Bay and lost its tropical identity , dissipating late on August 16 .

 Before the hurricane began affecting land , the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Myrtle Beach , South Carolina to Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . The agency also advised small boats in the region to remain at port during the storm . Evacuations were ordered for a few islands in the Outer Banks , and several thousand tourists voluntarily left the coastline for safer areas . Overall , about 50 @,@ 000 people evacuated due to the hurricane . Further north , the Coast Guard advised people to avoid swimming along the coast of Long Island . 
 The lowest pressure on land related to the storm was 988 hPa ( 29 @.@ 19 inHg ) at <unk> , North Carolina . Wind gusts of up to 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) were recorded at Hatteras and Nags Head . Torrential rainfall , unofficially exceeding 9 in ( 0 @.@ 23 m ) at Nags Head , fell across the state and extending northward into Virginia . The maximum rainfall associated with Barbara was 11 @.@ 1 in ( 280 mm ) near Onley along the Eastern Shore of Virginia . Offshore , a freighter rode out the storm after losing power . As the storm passed southeast of New England , winds reached up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . 
 Along the coastline , Barbara flooded roads and houses . Strong winds downed trees and power lines , leaving some cities isolated from communication . Some of the downed trees were large and had survived the Great Atlantic Hurricane of 1944 . The combination of winds and rainfall left some damage to crops and structures . The storm 's impact along the coast was light to moderate , with monetary damage estimated around $ 1 @.@ 3 million ( 1953 USD , $ 11 @.@ 5 million 2016 USD ) , mostly from the crop damage . Four marines in the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point were injured , as was a Coast Guard worker . One person died at Wrightsville Beach , North Carolina , after winds blew him off of a pier . A report on the cyclone by the U.S. Weather Bureau indicates that this is the only causality associated with Barbara . However , newspaper articles subsequent to the storm report several more fatalities , with one paper reporting a total of seven deaths ; two of them were from electrocutions . The rainfall from Barbara was blamed for traffic accidents further north in New Jersey and New York City , causing four deaths . There was also an indirect death in New York when a man had a heart attack while securing his boat . In Atlantic City , New Jersey , there was damage to storefronts . Along Nantucket , the hurricane washed several boats ashore , although there was little damage in the region . 
 In the Grand Banks offshore Atlantic Canada , Barbara sunk a dory , killing two people . Along the Canadian mainland , ships were advised to stay at port during the storm . Barbara produced tropical storm force winds across the region , peaking at 63 mph ( 102 km / h ) when it moved ashore .

 Peterson spent ten years working at the Jolly Green Giant Co . , rising to eastern regional manager in charge of 17 food processing plants in the United States and Canada . However , the western regional manager was the son of the company 's president , so in 1963 Peterson obtained a franchise from Muntz television , sold his home for US $ 10 @,@ 000 , which he put into the business , and moved with Gloria to Portland on the advice of friends . 
 He opened his first store at Southeast 82nd and Foster Road in 1964 . Peterson paid himself a salary of $ 100 a week and $ 50 a week to Gloria , who was the controller of the business . In 1964 , his first year in business , Peterson had revenues of $ 300 @,@ 000 . By 1989 , Peterson was selling $ 30 million per year . It was during this period that Peterson first achieved fame in Portland and throughout the Pacific Northwest . 
 By the early 1980s , Peterson had become one of the largest home electronics dealerships in Portland , alongside Smith 's Home Furnishings , Stereo Super Stores , Montgomery Ward and Sears . Peterson went on to open stores in Eugene , Gresham , Hillsboro , North Portland and as far away as Spokane , Washington but later closed these stores , citing an inability to offer the personal service by appearing on the floor alongside his sales staff . The Petersons ' children also worked in the business , daughter Kathy as a personnel manager and son Keith as a partner in an affiliated electronics import @-@ export business , operating out of Boston . 
 = = = Bankruptcy and reorganization = = = 
 In September 1989 , Peterson outbid two challengers to acquire Stereo Super Stores , whose parent company had filed for bankruptcy the month before , paying $ 940 @,@ 000 plus another million for inventory . The acquisition included a car stereo specialty shop at Mall 205 , Car Stereo East . Peterson continued to operate the franchise 's locations at Jantzen Beach and Washington Square Too without a branding change until March 1991 , when he renamed them Tom Peterson Super Stores , as he did his original home electronics store at 82nd and Foster . Peterson explained that the original stores were performing better than the newly acquired outlets , so he decided to combine them . His other two stores and car specialty store were unaffected . 
 In August 1991 Peterson closed his Jantzen Beach location and in October filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , listing liabilities of $ 7 @.@ 5 million owed to 283 creditors on assets of $ 2 @.@ 7 million . He also faced lawsuits from suppliers and AT & T Commercial Finance . At the time of the filing , Peterson said : " I should have listened to my wife . She said , ' Don 't buy Stereo Super Stores . ' She was right . " Peterson said sales shrank 16 percent in the company 's 1991 fiscal year compared to 1990 , and that his business had been in the red every month but one in the 25 months since the buyout . Peterson said at the time : " They should have been called Stereo Stupid Stores . " 
 Peterson closed his furniture store at 82nd and Foster , consolidating all operations in his two remaining stores , but kept his ads on the air . At Gloria 's suggestion , immediate subsequent television spots referred to the bankruptcy , spelling out the troubles and asking customers to please buy today . A crisis manager took control of operations , leaving Peterson to work the sales floors until the stores closed in March 1992 . Peterson said in 1995 , " The big nationals make it very tough on the regional , like Smith 's , and on the locals , like us . " However , Peterson did not lay all of the blame on national retailers , saying " In life , we are all carpenters of our own crosses . Don 't blame someone else . "

 In September 1992 Peterson reopened for business at his original location , an 11 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 000 m2 ) showroom at <unk> Southeast Foster Road , under the name Tom Peterson & Gloria 's Too ! Peterson 's son @-@ in @-@ law Robert Condon became president , daughter Kathy the store 's accountant and Gloria Peterson resumed duties as chief financial officer . Peterson himself remained the primary public face of the company , and resumed his familiar advertising . Condon raised a portion of the new venture 's seed money from the sale of Tom Peterson memorabilia , having bought hundreds of wristwatches and alarm clocks from the bankruptcy trustee , then reselling them at a profit . 
 By 1995 Peterson and a staff of 18 were selling $ 5 million worth of household <unk> per year , having shown a profit in 23 of 25 years . As of 2002 , Peterson was working " part time " 44 hours per week , half of what he once had put in , and booking $ 4 million in sales per year . In the mid @-@ 2000s , the Petersons sold their last remaining property at the corner of Southeast 82nd and Foster and moved the store to a side street a block away , just off 82nd Avenue . The final location closed on February 28 , 2009 . 
 = = Television advertising = = 
 Peterson is widely known in Portland for writing and starring in his own low @-@ budget commercials , for his trademark flattop haircut , catch phrases including " Free is a very good price " and referring to his store as " the happy place to buy . " In the 1980s , Peterson was described by Oregonian columnist Margie Boulé as " arguably , the most recognizable man in Portland . " 
 Peterson 's most famous commercials were his " Wake up ! Wake up ! " spots , which began airing in the mid @-@ 1970s . Peterson borrowed the idea from another retailer in Corpus Christi , Texas . Said Peterson , " Somebody told me about it and I followed it up . Ours was much more successful than theirs . They didn 't have the store owner or a strong personality doing theirs . " Peterson kept his stores open from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. to accommodate customers inspired by the ad to visit his store late at night . The commercial ran less frequently in the 1980s , and last aired in 1988 . 
 In 1987 , Peterson experimented with hiring an outside firm to produce a series of commercials , a first in 23 years on the air . The new commercials parodied daytime soap operas , featuring a housewife named Monica whose domestic problems are solved by merchandise from Peterson 's stores . 
 Of his television spots , Peterson said in 1987 : " It 's probably the best @-@ known commercial in town , but not the best @-@ liked one . " Peterson continued writing and starring in his own commercials into the early 2000s .

 In July 1986 , Peterson offered a free flattop haircut to anyone who attended the opening of his third store at 82nd and Foster . Peterson , who got his first flattop haircut in 1952 , hired three barbers to give haircuts on the floor of his showrooms . They gave about 50 haircuts the first day , and Peterson decided to make the gimmick a weekly event . He continued offering the haircuts for two decades and as of 2002 was still giving away about ten haircuts per week .

 Starting Halloween 1986 , Peterson offered visitors free cardboard masks with his face on it . All 5 @,@ 000 went in a single year .

 In October 1990 , after he had ceased running the " Wake up !

" Peterson said of the promotion at the time : " If you can put your face in 5 @,@ 000 homes in Portland , it certainly can 't hurt . "

 Peterson has cited as his most successful promotion the Tom Peterson watch , also featuring his face . Peterson said in 1988 : " It particularly went well with college youth .

 Production company <unk> had pitched the series to CBS as early as March 2010 ; however , it was not until two years later that Beat the Chefs first appeared at GSN 's upfront presentation in New York City as an original green @-@ lit series on March 21 , 2012 . GSN later put out a one @-@ month casting call from May 25 to June 25 , looking for " great cooks " who had never been " formally trained " . On July 2 , 2012 , GSN announced the series ' premiere date as August 23 , 2012 , right after the premiere of The American Bible Challenge . GSN then released the cast for the series on July 24 , 2012 , announcing former American Idol contestant Matt Rogers as the host of the show . The press release also revealed Beau MacMillan , Antonia <unk> and Jeff Henderson as the professional chefs , as well as Brad A. Johnson and Christy Jordan as judges . In addition , Johnson and Jordan were joined by a guest judge each episode ; these judges included Eric Roberts , Julie Powell , Richie Palmer , and Melissa Rycroft . 
 The series premiered on August 23 , 2012 immediately following the premiere of The American Bible Challenge . GSN continued to air one new episode a week until September 13 , 2012 . Although no official cancelation announcement was made , the series has not been seen since then . The show also was not mentioned or discussed in GSN 's most recent upfront presentation and is therefore assumed to be canceled .

 = Isa ibn Muhanna = 
 Sharaf ad @-@ Din Isa ibn Muhanna at @-@ Ta 'i , better known as Isa ibn Muhanna ( d . 1284 / 85 ) , was an emir ( commander / prince ) of the Al Fadl , a Bedouin dynasty that dominated the Syrian Desert and steppe during the 13th – 15th centuries . He was appointed amir al @-@ ʿarab ( commander of the Bedouin ) by the Mamluks after their conquest of Syria in 1260 . Isa 's father served the same post under the Ayyubids . His assignment gave him command over the nomadic Arab tribes of Syria and obliged him to provide auxiliary troops in times of war and guard the desert frontier from the Mongol Ilkhanate in Iraq . As part of his emirate , he was granted Salamiyah and Sarmin . He participated in numerous campaigns against the Ilkhanate during Sultan Baybars ' reign ( 1260 – 1277 ) . 
 In 1379 / 80 , Isa defected from Baybars ' successor , Qalawun , and joined the rebellion of the Mamluk viceroy of Syria , Sunqur al @-@ Ashqar . However , Isa dissuaded Sunqur from joining the Ilkhanids ' army , and was dismissed from his post when Qalawun 's forces suppressed the rebellion . Isa was reinstalled by 1280 , and in the following year , played a decisive role as a commander in the Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanate at the Second Battle of Homs . After his death , Isa was succeeded by his son Muhanna , and throughout the 14th century , Isa 's direct descendants held the office of amir al @-@ ʿarab with occasional interruption . 
 = = Ancestry = = 
 Isa 's clan , the Al Fadl , were direct descendants of the Jarrahid ruler of Palestine , Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ( d . 1013 ) , himself a member of the ancient tribe of Tayy ; Isa 's laqab was " Sharaf ad @-@ Din al @-@ Tayyi " , denoting his <unk> roots . By the early 13th century , the Al Fadl dominated the desert region between Homs in the west to the Euphrates valley in the east and from Qal 'at Ja 'bar southward through central Najd . Isa 's great @-@ grandfather , Haditha ( grandson of the Al Fadl 's progenitor , Fadl ibn Rabi 'ah ) , served as the first amir al @-@ ʿarab ( commander of the Bedouin tribes ) under Ayyubid sultan al @-@ Adil ( r . 1200 – 1218 ) , beginning a tradition of Al Fadl tribesmen being appointed to the office . Isa 's father Muhanna and grandfather Mani ( d . 1232 ) both served the post . 
 = = Amir al @-@ ʿarab = = 
 It is not evident in medieval Muslim sources when Muhanna died or when the post of amir al @-@ ʿarab was stripped from him . It is known for certain that prior to the Mamluk conquest of Syria in 1260 , the amir al @-@ ʿarab was Muhanna 's uncle Ali ibn Haditha . The circumstances of Isa 's replacement of Ali are also unclear . In some versions , Isa was appointed by Sultan Qutuz as a reward for his support in the Battle of Ain Jalut against the Mongols in the latter half of 1260 , though the sources indicate that Isa and his Bedouin horsemen refrained from actually participating in the battle . In another version , Qutuz 's successor Baybars appointed Isa as a reward for assisting him during his 1250s exile in Syria ( in this version , Ali was stripped of the title as punishment for denying Baybars refuge ) . In any case , it is known that Baybars issued a diploma confirming Isa as amir al @-@ ʿarab and recognizing his iqtaʿat ( fiefs ) in 1260 / 61 . Among his iqta 'at were half of Salamiyah , which was separated from the iqtaʿ of Hama , and Sarmin . Baybars also entrusted the Al Fadl and the other Bedouin tribes of the Syrian desert and steppe with guarding the Syrian frontier with Mongol Ilkhanid @-@ held Iraq . 
 = = = Service with Baybars = = = 
 Isa 's relations with Baybars were generally on good terms , though there were occasional exceptions . Isa accompanied al @-@ Mustansir , the newly @-@ inaugurated Abbasid caliph , on his Mamluk @-@ sponsored campaign to reclaim Iraq from the Mongols in 1260 . However , al @-@ Mustansir was killed en route to Baghdad in a Mongol ambush . The next year , Isa was present in Cairo to bear witness that al @-@ Mustansir 's successor and kinsman , al @-@ Hakim , was indeed a member of the Abbasid line . 
 Isa 's assignment to the post was opposed by some of his kinsmen from the start . The strongest opposition came from Ahmad ibn Hajji of the Al Mira , relatives of the Al Fadl through their shared ancestor Rabi 'ah ibn <unk> , whose descendants were collectively known as the Banu Rabi 'ah . Ahmad ibn Hajji and his tribe were considered by the historians of their day as the kings of the Arabs ( <unk> al @-@ ʿarab ) of the southern Syrian Desert , and Ahmad ibn Hajji led the struggle against Isa for the official post of amir al @-@ ʿarab . Their conflict dissipated as the Mamluks gave the Al Mira virtual independence in the southern desert , while maintaining Isa as amir al @-@ ʿarab . Isa also faced opposition from Ahmad ibn Tahir ibn Ghannam , another distant relative from the Banu Rabi 'ah , and from his Al Fadl kinsman Zamil ibn Ali ibn Haditha . The latter coveted the post , viewing himself as the rightful heir to the office that had been held by his father . In his conflict with Isa , Zamil was defeated , imprisoned , then released after a reconciliation between the chieftains of the Banu Rabi 'ah in 1264 . Ahmad ibn Tahir , whose demand of a share in Isa 's emirate was denied by Baybars , desisted from further opposition when he was given a smaller emirate elsewhere in Syria . In early 1265 , Isa was dispatched by Baybars to lead a raid against Ilkhanid @-@ held Harran as a diversion for a Mamluk expedition aimed at relieving their Anatolian fortress of al @-@ <unk> from an Ilkhanid siege ; al @-@ <unk> 's defenders withstood the siege and the Ilkhanids retreated in haste with the arrival of Mamluk forces in February . 
 In 1268 / 69 , Baybars took hostage some of the Bedouin chieftains ' sons as leverage to ensure that their fathers did not defect to the Ilkhanids . That same year , he halved Isa 's annual grant of 130 @,@ 000 silver dirhams . Baybars ' actions backfired when Isa made it apparent that he would defect to the Ilkhanids ; the Bedouin tribes ' defection to the Ilkhanids was a constant possibility and gave Isa considerable leverage with Baybars . News of this turn of events prompted Baybars to secretly rush to Syria from Egypt on 15 September 1270 and secure Isa 's commitment to the Mamluks . He arrived in Hama on 4 October and summoned Isa . During the meeting , Baybars asked Isa whether rumors of his planned defection were true and Isa answered in the affirmative . Afterward , Baybars honored him and and agreed to free the hostages , restore Isa 's grant , and distribute to the Bedouin tribes large amounts of wheat . As a result , Isa swore an oath of loyalty to Baybars and afterward participated in every Mamluk campaign against the Ilkhanids . The first of these campaigns occurred soon after Isa 's meeting with Baybars , when he led raids against the Ilkhanids in Edessa and Harran in southern Anatolia . 
 In 1273 , Isa led raids against Ilkhanid @-@ held Anbar in western Iraq on orders from Baybars , possibly to divert Ilkhanid forces from an expedition against Syria . The Mongols at Anbar retreated without resistance as Isa advanced . Months later , in March 1274 , Isa 's forces confronted a group of Khafaja Bedouin in Anbar , though there was no conclusive victory after a daylong battle . Isa commanded a contingent of Baybars ' army in the 1277 campaign against the Mongols at the Battle of <unk> . He visited Egypt later that year with Ahmad ibn Hajji , and the two were well @-@ received by Baybars . 
 = = = Career during Qalawun 's reign = = = 
 Baybars died in July 1277 and was succeeded by his sons who ruled in name only while Baybars ' closest subordinate , Qalawun , acted as strongman . Qalawun usurped the throne in 1279 and soon after faced a rebellion by his viceroy in Syria , Sunqur al @-@ Ashqar , who was joined by Isa . The Ilkhanids and their Armenian and Georgian allies took advantage of the intra @-@ Mamluk strife and an invitation by Sunqur to invade Syria , and sacked Aleppo . Isa reprimanded Sunqur for inciting the Muslims ' enemies to attack and urged him not to betray Islam in his late age . Isa persuaded Sunqur not to join the Ilkhanids and the latter escaped Qalawun 's advancing army . Isa also sought to evade Qalawun 's troops and barricaded himself in the desert fortress of al @-@ Rahba . He was replaced by his relative Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr as punishment by Qalawun for supporting Sunqur 's revolt . Muhammad 's appointment was likely in name only , and in any case , Isa reconciled with Qalawun by 1280 , when the sultan received him in Cairo . 
 During the Second Battle of Homs between the Mamluks and the Ilkhanids in October 1281 , Isa commanded the right flank of the Mamluk army . Under his command were the horsemen of Al Fadl , Al Mira and Banu Kilab among other Syrian tribes . During the course of the battle , the Mamluk right held firm against the Ilkhanid right 's assault and then the Mamluk divisions ( excluding Isa 's right flank ) led a joint counterattack against the Ilkhanid right . It was during this counterattack that Isa 's forces mounted a major assault against the Ilkhanid left ending in a rout . Afterward , the Mamluk divisions destroyed the Ilkhanid center and forced the latter 's retreat , resulting in a decisive Mamluk victory . Isa was praised in Mamluk histories of the battle for securing the Mamluk victory . In reward for his performance , he was made the lord of Palmyra in late 1281 . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Isa died in May 1284 . He was succeeded by his son Muhanna ibn Isa , who inherited his emirate , and became the lord of the ancient oasis town of Palmyra . For the next quarter century , Muhanna and another of Isa 's sons , Fadl , held the office of amir al @-@ ʿarab with minor interruptions . Isa 's branch of the Al Fadl dynasty , sometimes referred to as " Al Isa " , served the office through much of the 14th century .

 Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy ( ディシディア <unk> ファイナルファンタジー , <unk> <unk> Fainaru Fantajī , pronounced " Dissidia <unk> Final Fantasy " ) is a 2011 fighting game published by Square Enix for the PlayStation Portable as part of the Final Fantasy series . It was developed by the company 's 1st Production Department and released in Japan on March 3 , 2011 . The game is both a prequel and remake of Dissidia Final Fantasy , revealing what occurred before the events of its predecessor , and was released on March 22 , 2011 in North America . 
 The game initially focuses on the twelfth war between the gods Chaos and Cosmos who have summoned several warriors from parallel worlds to fight for them . Upon ending the twelfth cycle , the game remakes the thirteenth war from the original Dissidia Final Fantasy and adds multiple <unk> . Fights in Dissidia 012 were given the ability to counteract enemies ' strongest attacks by using assisting characters , while navigation is now done through a traditional @-@ styled Final Fantasy world map . 
 Development of the game started in August 2009 with the Square staff wishing to improve the gameplay from the first game to provide players with more entertaining features as well as balance several parts . Dissidia 012 has been well received , with publications calling it one of the best PlayStation Portable games . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Gameplay is largely reminiscent of Dissidia Final Fantasy along with a few changes . The game consists primarily of one @-@ on @-@ one battles , taking place on what is known as a battle map where the two characters duel . Players are able to perform two types of attacks : a Bravery attack and an HP attack . Both characters start with a set amount of Bravery points , the number of Bravery points being equivalent to the amount of damage dealt by an HP attack . Thus , the player must perform several Bravery attacks to steal Bravery points from the opponent so as to increase the power of their HP attack , as Bravery attacks do not cause any damage . 
 = = = Additional mechanics = = = 
 The mechanics of the battle system include " EX Revenge " and " Assist . " EX Mode functions exactly the same as the first game by collecting EX Cores around the battle map to fill up the EX gauge and transform the character into a more powerful state , which allows players to perform a powerful EX Burst attack should an HP attack land during EX Mode . The Assist system is a new element to the game which allows the player to summon an additional ally into battle to either assist in attacking the enemy or defend from an oncoming attack . It is performed using the Assist Gauge , which is built up by using Bravery Attacks . Both modes are supposed to balance each other , because when an EX Burst is executed , the opponent 's Assist Gauge is reduced to zero . 
 The three main countering systems are Assist Breaks , EX Breaks and EX Revenge . An Assist Break is performed by attacking the opponent 's Assist character while the player is in EX Mode , causing him / her to be unable to call out the Assist character for a brief period ; this also passes the stage 's Bravery points to the character . An EX Break is performed by stopping an opponent 's EX Mode through the use of an Assist attack which forces the opponent out of EX Mode , additionally passing the stage 's Bravery points to the player . Lastly , EX Revenge occurs when trying to activate EX Mode while being attacked . While in the first game it would simply halt the opponent 's attack , it now slows down time allowing the player to pummel the opponent instead , though it sacrifices the player 's ability to use an EX Burst as it uses up the entire EX Gauge . 
 = = = Single @-@ player mode = = = 
 The biggest addition is within the single @-@ player story mode of the game , taking place on a traditional @-@ styled Final Fantasy world map , with players being able to experience a story while exploring a world with scenarios and events taking place as the story progresses . Players traverse the 3D world map with parties consisting of up to five characters , with players being able to interact in conversations with the characters . When roaming the map , players will encounter enemies known as " Manikins " ; when attacked by an enemy , players will be transported to a battle map where battles will take place . There are specially marked shops on the map . The story mode is also party based , similar to the story progression of Final Fantasy VI . In certain scenarios , parties will be predetermined , but in most cases players are free to select their own party . Alongside the game 's new story mode , the game also includes the first game 's story , which has been remade with the 3D world map as well as additional elements added for the new storyline . Tetsuya Nomura , producer and character designer for the game , has said that both storylines played together would result in approximately 60 hours of gameplay .

 The game 's main story revolves around the twelfth cycle of the eternal conflict between the gods Cosmos and Chaos , who have both summoned several warriors from different worlds to fight for them in " World B " , a mirror dimension to the realm of World A. It features the entire cast of the original Dissidia with new and tweaked abilities . The game also introduces nine new playable characters . Six of the new characters are available from the start of the game : Lightning , a former soldier and the protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII ; Vaan , a sky pirate and the protagonist of Final Fantasy XII ; Laguna Loire , the man who appears in Squall 's dreams and the secondary protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII ; Yuna , Tidus 's love interest and female protagonist of Final Fantasy X ; Kain Highwind , Cecil Harvey 's childhood friend and rival from Final Fantasy IV ; and Tifa Lockhart , Cloud Strife 's childhood friend from Final Fantasy VII . The remaining three characters , which can be unlocked through various means of gameplay , are Prishe , a supporting character from Final Fantasy XI ; Gilgamesh , a recurring villain from Final Fantasy V ; and Feral Chaos ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , an alternate form of Chaos .

 During the twelfth cycle , the war is turning in favor of Chaos . Therefore , Cosmos entrusts her warriors — the Warrior of Light , Lightning , Vaan , Jecht , Yuna , Zidane , Squall , Laguna , Tifa , Bartz , Cecil , Kain , Onion Knight , and Firion — with the task of retrieving the crystals that will help them defeat Chaos . However , Cosmos was not able to foresee Chaos 's forces employing an unworldly army of crystalline soldiers known as Manikins , which pose a threat due to their ability to negate the gods ' power to revive the warriors after they are killed . Believing their defeat to be inevitable , Kain and the Warrior of Light defeat most of their own allies to stop them from fighting the Manikins and return in an upcoming war . Lightning opposes this plan and leads the other active warriors ( Vaan , Yuna , Laguna , Tifa , and Kain ) to stop the Manikins once and for all by sealing the portal from which they emerge . Though they succeed , Cosmos is reduced to a weakened state after using much of her power to diminish the <unk> army when they attempted to kill her and the Warrior of Light , while Lightning and her group succumb to the Manikins ' power and fade away . 
 From there , the game retells the events of Dissidia Final Fantasy where returning warriors for Cosmos participate in the thirteenth cycle that ends the conflict between the gods . Once completing the thirteenth cycle , the player also has access to the third and final arc " Confessions of the Creator " in which supporting character <unk> , a powerful entity that absorbs the warriors ' memories and experiences following each cycle , traps Cosmos ' comrade , Cid of the <unk> , in a nightmare world where cycles as a punishment for saving Cosmos ' warriors from the thirteenth cycle following Chaos ' defeat . The player selects five characters to fight Feral Chaos , a stronger incarnation of Chaos , and save the imprisoned Cid the nightmare world . 
 In addition to the main story is a set of " Reports , " most of which follow the other warriors who participate in the thirteenth cycle , explaining their roles before and during that cycle . Prominent characters in these reports include warriors of Cosmos — Terra , Cloud and Tidus — who fight for the side of Chaos during the twelfth cycle , and Chaos ' warrior Jecht , who appears on the side of Cosmos , with the reports detailing how these characters came to switch sides . Furthermore , the Reports cover other events as how the Warrior of Light entered the conflict and met Cosmos 's previous warriors Prishe and Shantotto along with Gilgamesh 's misadventures upon stumbling into World B.

 Ideas for a sequel to Dissidia Final Fantasy were already conceived shortly after its release in Japan with producer Tetsuya Nomura wishing to feature Kain Highwind on it . Development of the game started in August 2009 shortly before the release of Dissidia Final Fantasy Universal Tuning , the international version from the prequel . Director Mitsunori Takahashi stated the team wanted the sequel to have more changes than just new characters . This resulted in changes to gameplay features and the inclusion of new ones . The Assist feature was made to add more entertainment to the fights , as well as to act as a counterbalance to the EX Mode that was the strongest area from the first game . This was done in response to feedback commenting that the EX Mode was too powerful in the original game . The world map was created in order to appeal more the RPG fans . Returning characters had their movesets modified to provide the player with new strategies when fighting . One of the most revised ones was Firion due to feedback from players . Since the original Dissidia had a concrete conclusion , the staff decided to make its story a prequel and encourage players to revisit Dissidia once concluding it . 
 Choosing new characters proved difficult as the staff chose them based on their popularity and fighting styles . The amount of new characters was restricted due to memory limitations . Vaan 's inclusion met several hardships since his Japanese voice actor , Kouhei Takeda , was busy at the time . They decided to replace Takeda with Kenshō Ono as a result of fan response . Battle system director Takeo <unk> made contact with Hiroyuki Ito regarding the character 's design and moves based on his Final Fantasy XII appearances , which was well received by Ito . While designed by Tetsuya Nomura , various of the new alternative outfits the characters were given were based on artworks by Yoshitaka Amano , another designer from the Final Fantasy series .

 = USS Aylwin ( DD @-@ 47 ) = 
 USS Aylwin ( Destroyer No. 47 / DD @-@ 47 ) was the lead ship of Aylwin @-@ class destroyers built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the second U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of John Cushing Aylwin , a U.S. Navy officer killed in action aboard Constitution during the War of 1812 . 
 Aylwin was laid down by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in March 1912 and launched in November . The ship was a little more than 305 ft ( 93 m ) in length , just over 30 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) abeam , and had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 036 long tons ( 1 @,@ 053 t ) . She was armed with four 4 in ( 100 mm ) guns and had eight 18 in ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes . Aylwin was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to 29 @.@ 5 kn ( 33 @.@ 9 mph ; 54 @.@ 6 km / h ) 
 Aylwin failed to make her contracted speed of 29 @.@ 5 kn ( 33 @.@ 9 mph ; 54 @.@ 6 km / h ) in builder 's trials in August 1913 , but was eventually accepted by the U.S. Navy and commissioned in January 1914 . On 6 April , two sailors on board Aylwin died when she suffered an explosion in her No. 1 fire room . Out of commission while repairs were made , Aylwin was recommissioned in May 1915 and joined the Atlantic Fleet . In October 1916 , she was one of several U.S. destroyers sent to rescue survivors from five victims of German submarine U @-@ 53 off the Lightship Nantucket . 
 After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Aylwin conducted experiments with Reginald Fessenden until January 1918 . She was then sent overseas to conduct anti @-@ submarine patrols from Queenstown , Ireland , and Plymouth . In December , she accompanied light cruiser Chester on an inspection tour of German Baltic ports . Upon returning to the United States at the end of June 1919 , Aylwin was placed in reserve . She was decommissioned at Philadelphia in February 1921 . In July 1933 she dropped her name , becoming known only as DD @-@ 47 . She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1935 and ordered scrapped in April . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Aylwin was authorized in March 1911 as the lead ship of the four @-@ ship Aylwin class , which was almost identical to the Cassin @-@ class destroyers authorized at the same time . Construction of the vessel — like her three sister ships — was awarded to William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia which laid down her keel on 7 May 1912 . On 23 November , Aylwin was launched by sponsor Mrs. Joseph Wright Powell , wife of the assistant to the president of the Cramp shipyard . The ship was the second U.S. Navy ship named for John Cushing Aylwin , a U.S. Navy officer killed in action aboard Constitution during the War of 1812 . As built , the destroyer was 305 ft 3 in ( 93 @.@ 04 m ) in length , 30 ft 4 in ( 9 @.@ 25 m ) abeam , and drew 9 ft 5 in ( 2 @.@ 87 m ) . The ship had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 036 long tons ( 1 @,@ 053 t ) and displaced 1 @,@ 235 long tons ( 1 @,@ 255 t ) when fully loaded . 
 Aylwin had two steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers , and an additional pair triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each connected to one of the propeller shafts , for cruising purposes . Four oil @-@ burning boilers powered the engines , which could generate 16 @,@ 000 shp ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) , and it was hoped , move the ship at the design speed of 29 @.@ 5 kn ( 33 @.@ 9 mph ; 54 @.@ 6 km / h ) . However , during builder 's trials conducted in July 1913 , Aylwin failed to reach this speed , and was withdrawn from testing . After sister ship Palmer exceeded the design speed in August with a different propeller design , The Washington Post reported that Aylwin 's propellers would be changed to the new design . 
 Aylwin 's main battery consisted of four 4 in ( 100 mm ) / 50 caliber Mark 9 guns , with each gun weighing in excess of 6 @,@ 100 lb ( 2 @,@ 800 kg ) . The guns fired 33 lb ( 15 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles at 2 @,@ 900 ft / s ( 880 m / s ) . At an elevation of 20 ° , the guns had a range of 15 @,@ 920 yd ( 14 @,@ 560 m ) . Aylwin was also equipped with four twin 18 in ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes . 
 = = Pre @-@ World War I = = 
 Aylwin was commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 17 January 1914 , under the command of Lieutenant Commander Leigh C. Palmer , the former naval aide of U.S. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels . Following a short cruise to Cuba , Aylwin conducted operations off the North Carolina coast in April . On 6 April , she and sister ships Benham and Parker were exercising off the North Carolina coast , about 15 nautical miles ( 28 km ) off the Diamond Shoals lightship . An explosion ripped through the forward fire room on Aylwin , injuring three men . Benham loaded the three wounded sailors and sped to the naval hospital at Norfolk , Virginia , while Parker took on the remainder of Aylwin 's crew . One of the injured men died on Benham before landfall was made in Virginia ; another died a short time later . The crews of all three destroyers raised $ 250 to help defray funeral expenses for the widow of one of the men . 
 Aylwin remained afloat but , unmanned , was towed into Norfolk by Parker and U.S. Navy tug Sonoma , arriving on 7 April . According to a report in The Washington Post , Aylwin made it to port with only five hours of buoyancy to spare . The report described the fore deck of the ship as " badly rent and torn up " and noted that two of the destroyer 's four stacks were knocked out of alignment by the blast , with one askew at a 25 ° angle from its normal position . The newspaper speculated that faulty metal in the No. 1 boiler 's mud drum was the cause of the explosion . Although repairs were estimated to take roughly three months , Aylwin was placed out of commission and remained inactive for more than a year at the Norfolk Navy Yard . 
 She was recommissioned on 25 May 1915 and assigned to the 6th Division , Torpedo Flotilla , Atlantic Fleet . The ship then cruised along the east coast carrying out routine patrols . Prior to the entrance of the United States into World War I , she served on Neutrality Patrols , trying to protect American and neutral @-@ flagged merchant ships from interference by British or German warships and U @-@ boats . In the course of <unk> those duties , Aylwin was at Newport , Rhode Island in early October 1916 . At 05 : 30 on 8 October , wireless reports came in of a German submarine stopping ships near the Lightship Nantucket , off the eastern end of Long Island . After an SOS from the British steamer West Point was received at about 12 : 30 , Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves ordered Aylwin and other destroyers at Newport to attend to survivors . The American destroyers arrived on the scene about 17 : 00 when the U @-@ boat , U @-@ 53 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Hans Rose , was in the process of stopping the Holland @-@ America Line cargo ship Blommersdijk . Shortly after , U @-@ 53 stopped the British passenger ship Stephano . As Rose had done with three other ships , U @-@ 53 had sunk earlier in the day , he gave passengers and crew aboard Blommersdijk and Stephano adequate time to abandon the ships before sinking the pair . At one point , Rose signaled Aylwin requesting that she move out of the way to allow Stephano to be torpedoed , much to the later chagrin of Lord Beresford , who denounced Aylwin 's compliance as " aiding and abetting " the Germans in a speech in the House of Lords . In total , 226 survivors from U @-@ 53 's five victims were rescued by the destroyer flotilla . Aylwin picked up the crew of Stephano and a number of passengers , later transferring them to destroyer Jenkins for return to Newport . 
 During the early months of 1917 , Aylwin sailed to Cuban waters for winter maneuvers and returned to the Virginia capes area upon America 's entry into World War I. 
 = = World War I = = 
 From June 1917 @-@ January 1918 , the destroyer participated in special experimental work with Reginald Fessenden while operating out of Boston , Massachusetts , and Newport , Rhode Island . On 4 January 1918 , Aylwin sailed for Queenstown , Ireland ; and , shortly after her arrival there , began patrolling out of that port . However , shortly thereafter , she was detached to join British forces operating from Portsmouth and Devonport in conducting antisubmarine patrols . 
 Aylwin remained in European waters following the end of the war . On 26 December 1918 , she sailed in company with light cruiser Chester for an inspection tour of the Baltic ports of Germany . The ships , which , were operating under the auspices of the Inter @-@ Allied Naval Armistice Commission , were to remove any American prisoners of war or citizens discovered in the German ports . 
 = = Postwar = = 
 In May 1919 , the base of operations for U.S. destroyers in European waters was shifted from Brest , France , to Antwerp , and Aylwin , arriving there on 22 May , was the first ship to relocated to the Belgian port . The following month , Aylwin returned to Brest , and departed from there for the United States , arriving at New York on 26 June . She then proceeded to the Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was placed in reserve . 
 Aylwin was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 23 February 1921 . On 1 July 1933 , she dropped the name Aylwin to free it for a new destroyer of the same name , becoming known only as DD @-@ 47 . The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 March 1935 , and on 23 April was ordered scrapped in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty . 
 = HMS Euryalus ( 1901 ) = 
 HMS Euryalus was a Cressy @-@ class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy around 1900 . Badly damaged by multiple accidents while fitting out , she was not completed until 1904 . She became flagship of the Australia Station that year and was reduced to reserve upon her return in 1905 . Recommissioned in 1906 , she became a training ship for the North America and West Indies Station before being placed in reserve with the Third Fleet in 1909 . 
 Recommissioned at the start of World War I , Euryalus was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron . She became flagship of the Southern Force defending the eastern end of the English Channel from any German attack , shortly after the war began . She was present at the Battle of Heligoland Bight a few weeks after the war began , but saw no combat . She was transferred to convoy escort duties in the Bay of Biscay in late 1914 , before being sent to Egypt in early 1915 . Euryalus was then assigned to support British troops during the Gallipoli Campaign by providing naval gunfire . She covered the landing at Cape Helles in April as well as providing fire support during one subsequent British offensive . She became the flagship of the East Indies Station in January 1916 , until relieved in July 1917 . Later that year she began a conversion into a minelayer at Hong Kong , but this was still incomplete when the war ended . Euryalus returned home in 1919 and was sold for scrap the following year . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Euryalus was designed to displace 12 @,@ 000 long tons ( 12 @,@ 193 t ) . The ship had an overall length of 472 feet ( 143 @.@ 9 m ) , a beam of 69 feet 9 inches ( 21 @.@ 3 m ) and a deep draught of 26 feet 9 inches ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She was powered by two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft , which produced a total of 21 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 15 @,@ 660 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . The engines were powered by 30 Belleville boilers . On their sea trials all of the Cressy @-@ class cruisers , except the lead ship , exceeded their designed speed . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 626 t ) of coal and her complement ranged from 725 to 760 officers and enlisted men . 
 Her main armament consisted of two breech @-@ loading ( BL ) 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 234 mm ) Mk X guns in single gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . They fired 380 @-@ pound ( 170 kg ) shells to a range of 15 @,@ 500 yards ( 14 @,@ 200 m ) . Her secondary armament of twelve BL 6 @-@ inch Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships . Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather . They had a maximum range of approximately 12 @,@ 200 yards ( 11 @,@ 200 m ) with their 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shells . A dozen quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats , eight on casemates on the upper deck and four in the superstructure . Euryalus also carried three 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . 
 The ship 's waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of 6 inches ( 152 mm ) and was closed off by 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) transverse bulkheads . The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick . The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from 1 – 3 inches ( 25 – 76 mm ) and the conning tower was protected by 12 inches ( 305 mm ) of armour . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Euryalus , named after the Greek hero Euryalus , was laid down on 18 July 1899 by Vickers , Sons & Maxim at their Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness shipyard . She was launched 20 May 1901 in front of 30 @,@ 000 spectators , and christened by Mrs. Douglas Vickers , wife of one of the directors of the company . On 11 June 1901 , the south side of the Ramsden dock at Barrow caught fire , and was practically destroyed before the flames could be extinguished . The recently launched Euryalus was laying alongside this wharf , and the fire set ablaze the teak wood sheathing of the cruiser . Considerable damage was done to the ship before she was hauled from the pier into the middle of the dock , and her completion was severely delayed . Towed to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for repairs , the ship slipped off the blocks supporting her in drydock and was severely damaged . While on sea trials , she collided with the auxiliary vessel Traveller on 27 June 1903 at Devonport . Euryalus was finally completed on 5 January 1904 , nearly two years after her sister ships . 
 Upon commissioning she became flagship of the Australia Station before returning home in 1905 . Reduced to reserve upon her arrival , she was sent to the North America and West Indies Station in 1906 , where she served as a boys ' training ship attached to the 4th Cruiser Squadron for the next three years . Euryalus was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet when she returned home in 1909 . At the outbreak of the war in August 1914 , she was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron , tasked with patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea in support of a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich , which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France . On 10 August , she became the flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Arthur Christian , commander of the Southern Force , formed to command all of the forces defending the eastern end of the Channel . During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August , the ship was in reserve off the Dutch coast , and saw no action . 
 On 20 September 1914 , Euryalus and her sisters Aboukir , Cressy and Hogue were on patrol in the Broad Fourteen . Euryalus had to return to port that morning to recoal . Two days later the three remaining cruisers were sunk by the SM U @-@ 9 and Christian was subsequently relieved of his command . As a result of these losses , she , and her sister Bacchante , were transferred to the 12th Cruiser Squadron to escort ships between England and Gibraltar in early October . 
 Euryalus and Bacchante were transferred to Egypt in late January 1915 to reinforce the defences of the Suez Canal , although the Turkish raid on the Suez Canal had already been repulsed by the time that they arrived in February . Upon arrival Rear @-@ Admiral Richard Peirse , commander of the East Indies Station , hoisted his flag in Euryalus . By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the Dardanelles had already occurred , and the sisters were transferred north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be reasonably quiet . 
 Euryalus became the flagship of Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss in April , after he was put in charge of the main landings at Gallipoli . During the landings at Cape Helles on the morning of 25 April , Euryalus transported three companies of the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers and a platoon of the Royal Naval Division , and then provided fire support to the landing after the soldiers were transferred to their boats for the actual landing on Beach ' W ' . She also bombarded Turkish positions during the Second Battle of Krithia on 6 May . A month later , Wemyss hauled down his flag and resumed his original commanding of the Allied base at Mudros . Euryalus received a brief refit at Malta from 30 December 1915 to 20 January 1916 before proceeding to Egypt to reinforce the defences there . 
 On 15 January 1916 Wemyss , the new Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , East Indies , hoisted his flag aboard Euryalus . From 3 January 1917 through 24 April , she was refitted at Bombay . On 29 June she bombarded the barracks in the Yemeni town of Hodeida together with the troopship RIM Northbrook of the Royal Indian Marine . Rear Admiral Ernest Gaunt relieved Wemyss as commander @-@ in @-@ chief on 20 July 1917 and transferred his flag to Northbrook on 29 August . In early November , the ship dismounted four 6 @-@ inch and four 12 @-@ pounder guns at Bombay before proceeding to Hong Kong . She was paid off there on 20 December to complete her conversion into a minelayer . This was not finished when the war ended , and she returned to Britain to be laid up at the Nore in April 1919 . Euryalus was sold for scrap on 1 July 1920 and broken up in Germany beginning in September 1922 . 
 = Lazarus ( Travie McCoy album ) = 
 Lazarus is the debut album by Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy , released on June 8 , 2010 . McCoy announced his plans to pursue a solo career in early 2010 , although he insisted that Gym Class Heroes had not broken up . After creating demos of melancholy and low @-@ tempo songs , McCoy decided to abandon his early material and start over , as he claimed the songs were " too personal " . He began to write more uptempo " party anthems " with lyrical themes of overcoming grief . Musically , McCoy draws from various influences on the record , including hip @-@ hop , reggae , and rock . The album contains collaborations from Bruno Mars , Cee Lo Green , and T @-@ Pain , among others . 
 Upon its release , Lazarus debuted at number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with sales of 15 @,@ 000 copies . The lead single from the album was " Billionaire " , which peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 . The songs " Need You " and " We 'll Be Alright " have also been released as singles . Critical response to the album has been mixed to positive , with most critics praising the album 's upbeat songs yet criticizing the overabundance of featured collaborations . Gregory Heaney of AllMusic opined that " Even though every track on the album isn ’ t a keeper , it has some solid additions to any summer playlist and will definitely please fans of Gym Class Heroes . " The album has sold more than 74 @,@ 000 copies as of April 2012 .

 In early 2010 , Gym Class Heroes vocalist Travie McCoy announced that he would be pursuing a solo career . He denied rumors that Gym Class Heroes had broken up , asserting that " Since the inception of Gym Class in 1997 , every member has had another musical outlet , if not three or four . This is just another one of those . " McCoy began writing new material while Gym Class was on the road promoting The Quilt ( 2008 ) . He had originally prepared to record an introspective album of " sad and somber " acoustic songs reflective of his state of mind following his breakup with Katy Perry and his addiction to painkillers . However , he decided to scrap his early material and start over , calling it " too personal " and saying " I didn 't want that to be my first look as a solo artist , " comparing the album to Kanye West 's 808s & Heartbreak ( 2008 ) . He relocated to Miami , Florida , to record new material and recover from his addiction , which helped him to create a more upbeat album because he " want [ ed ] to do something positive . " McCoy decided to officially call himself " Travie " on the album instead of Travis ; he explained that he has been called Travie by friends and family for " as long as [ he ] can remember . " He believes that the new name allows listeners to the become " that much closer " to him and to " feel much more comfortable with calling [ him ] Travie and being part of the family . " 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Lazarus was released after being in the works for a year and a half . McCoy calls the album " The longest , I think , I 've spent on a record in my whole career . " He wished to keep the number of collaborations on the album " kinda tight , " but he plans to work with other artists on remixes of the album . Producers on the album include Bruno Mars , T @-@ Pain , The Smeezingtons , The Stereotypes , Lucas Secon , Oligee and Josh Abraham ; Mars , T @-@ Pain and Cee Lo Green provide guest vocals . Lazarus is mainly influenced by hip @-@ hop , although " at the same time , [ his ] love for live instrumentation is still reflected on the record . " " Billionaire " , the album 's first single , was the first song McCoy began work on after abandoning the original material for the album . Working on more uptempo music helped put him in a " different headspace " . He also credits his " really awesome friends " and collaborators on the album for helping him recover from his depressed state during the recording process . McCoy felt uncomfortable with his singing voice as he was more accustomed to rapping ; however , T @-@ Pain encouraged him to sing more on the album and overcome his insecurities . 
 McCoy " took a lot of time " with the track listing of the album to make sure the album was cohesive and felt like a " ride " . He said of the album 's writing process " With any project , I just go in and blindly start writing songs and then find out which way we want to go with it . This one took a bit longer to find the lane . " Despite the album 's long gestation period , McCoy was able to write some of the songs at a very rapid pace . The song " After Midnight " was written , recorded , and mixed in less than a half an hour . He began by recording himself humming the song 's melody and creating a constant loop that repeated throughout the song , and then recorded his verses over the track . McCoy also selected the guest appearances for the album quickly after writing individual parts of songs , choosing artists he felt would work best with the musical style he had in mind . The hook of " Dr. Feel Good " was written by Bruno Mars , and upon hearing Mars sing it , McCoy decided that Cee Lo Green would be a good candidate to sing the hook , as McCoy had idolized Green since his teenage years after listening to him on the song " Git Up , Git Out " from OutKast 's debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik ( 1994 ) .

 With Lazarus , McCoy intended to create an album of mostly uptempo , positive songs . During his time in Miami , he was exposed to EDM genres , which influenced Lazarus ' sound . McCoy stated " If you 're looking for an introspective , in @-@ depth look into my personal life or my deepest emotions , this is definitely not the record . It 's just a record you can put on , turn up , roll the windows down , and drive around to . " He intended to save more personal themes for Gym Class Heroes ' subsequent release , The Papercut Chronicles II ( 2011 ) . 
 The album 's opening track , " Dr. Feel @-@ Good " , which features Cee Lo Green , has been referred to as a " top @-@ down summer anthem " and features hip @-@ hop beats and funk @-@ inspired guitar riffs . Emily Zemler of Alternative Press opined that " Superbad ( 11 : 34 ) " sounds like " T @-@ Pain covering Linkin Park " . The song was inspired by an inside joke between McCoy and a friend which involved superstition that looking at a digital clock at 11 : 34 is bad luck , as it reads " hell " upside down . He added , " To me , it 's really anthemic and it 's a confidence booster as well . When you listen to this song , it gets you prepared to do anything . " " Billionaire " , the album 's lead single , displays reggae influences ; Gregory Heaney of AllMusic compared the song to Sublime . 
 " Need You " has been described as an " R & B @-@ tinged pop rocker " comparable to the work of Justin Timberlake . McCoy noted the contrast between the song 's subject matter and musical style , as the song touches upon failed relationships in an uptempo manner and " explodes " as it reaches the chorus . In the same vein of " Need You " , McCoy described " Critical " , featuring Tim William , as " really personal , introspective subject matter put into an upbeat pop song . It 's kind of like a rock song , but at the same time , it has this really shimmery , cute vibe to it . " " Akidagain " features a children 's choir and samples Ahmad 's " Back in the Day " . " We 'll Be Alright " , which McCoy refers to as a " party anthem " , samples " Alright " by Supergrass . He described the album 's closer " Don 't Pretend " as " probably the most personal " song on the album ; during recording of the song , he suffered from allergies and had difficulty breathing , which " added to the emotional vibe of the song " .

 McCoy drew from various lyrical inspirations on the album . The subject matter often deals with topics such as partying , personal insecurities , and overcoming grief . McCoy explained that the opening song " Dr. Feel Good " is about " escapism through music " and that it expresses how he felt about recovering from drug addiction and depression . " Superbad ( 11 : 34 ) " is about McCoy 's experiences on the road , considering the song to be his " theme song " . Bruno Mars came up with the lyrical concept for " <unk> " during a trip to London in which he was given £ 250 ( $ 350 ) by his record label to spend for 11 days . He found the amount of money to be insufficient , and explained " We were like , ' Is this the biggest mistake we 've ever made ? We thought we were broke in California ; what are we going to do here ? ' So we 've got no money , and I 'm walking the streets and came up with , ' I wanna be a billionaire , so frickin ' bad . ' " With the song , McCoy intended to avoid " superficial " lyrics in the wake of an economic recession , and added " There ’ s something to sing about here ; if I was in the position to have a ridiculous amount of money , would I be selfish or selfless ? ’ I just took that concept and ran with it . " " Need You " describes a situation in which a person wants to start a new relationship , but still needs time to heal . 
 " Critical " is an apocalyptic @-@ themed song inspired by natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina . McCoy explained that the song discusses these subjects in " a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek way . Basically , if the world was to end tonight , fuck <unk> have a beer and watch it all go down . " " Akidagain " is reflective of McCoy 's childhood and pop culture shifts that influenced his life , featuring three verses ; in the first verse , he discusses his early childhood , the second verse is about his teenage years , and the final verse meditates on his life as an adult . " We 'll Be Alright " shares lyrical themes with Michael Jackson 's " Off the Wall " . McCoy says that the song is about " not caring about what people think and just ignoring your insecurities . " McCoy was given the idea for " The Manual " after reading music blogs that were critical of his music . He explained " It 's so easy to get online and lose all your inhibitions and complain and nag about what 's wrong with music . But if you 're going to do that , offer some way to change things . Or make music . A lot of the people aren 't even artists . The title of ' The Manual ' is asking if there is a manual out there on how to do things the right way , then please show it to me and I 'll read it five times over . " " After Midnight " was inspired by the movie Gremlins , and the idea that seeing gremlins after midnight means " trouble " .

 McCoy chose the name for the album , which is also his middle name , after his experiences in charity work in HIV awareness in South Africa , India , and the Philippines in the summer of 2009 that " really changed [ his ] outlook on life . " Lazarus of Bethany is the subject of a miracle in the New Testament of the Bible in which Jesus restores him back to life after being dead for four days . McCoy said of the name " I never really thought about how synonymous it was with the biblical reference with the fact that my middle name is Lazarus . I feel like I ’ ve been dead and resurrected on many occasions . I went public with a lot of dark things that people usually keep in the closet like drug addiction and what not . " The album was originally titled " The Lazarus Project " , but the name had to be changed due to the 2008 drama film of the same name . 
 The album 's artwork , designed by Brent Rollins and Alex R. <unk> , features a recurring theme of clouds and city skylines . Amber McDonald of The Daily Loaf felt that the artwork accurately portrayed the album 's key themes : " This convincingly fun record is filled with lyrical introspection and , in spite of all its hip @-@ hop , pop @-@ hook , pay @-@ it @-@ forward @-@ ness , there are gray clouds that work to keep the mood of the album realistic and relatable to the worlds of listeners . After all , the album cover art is of a gray backdrop with clouds , not sunshine and blue skies . " 
 = = Release and promotion = = 
 The album was released on June 8 , 2010 . McCoy aimed for a June release because he believes that summer is " when most of the memorable music drops . You want music to have a good time to , music to connect to . You wanna play it at the party . " 
 On April 28 , 2010 , McCoy embarked on the Too Fast For Love tour with Cobra Starship and 3OH ! 3 , featuring a backup band that includes Gym Class Heroes drummer Matt McGinley . He planned to tour extensively to promote the album in order to make the album " a household object — and hopefully not a coaster . " Starting from October 18 , 2010 , McCoy set off on his first solo European headline tour along with Bruno Mars who supported the tour throughout . The majority of dates took place at smaller venues throughout the United Kingdom . On March 17 , 2011 , he began performing throughout the United States and Canada on the Sgt. Schlepper 's Who Needs Hearts Club Band Tour featuring Black Cards .

 In early May 2010 , McCoy released " Billionaire " as the album 's lead single , which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at 92 . The album , released a month later on June 8 , 2010 , debuted at number 25 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with sales of 15 @,@ 000 copies . On June 26 , 2010 , the album reached the apex of its sales , peaking at number 25 on the Billboard 200 and number 11 on the Billboard Digital Albums charts . On August 21 , 2010 Lazarus was released in Europe and entered the UK Album Charts , peaking at number 69 . 
 " Billionaire " continued to be successful , peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The song was positioned at number six on the Billboard " Songs of Summer 2010 " chart . The next single , " Need You " , was released to mainstream radio on September 14 , 2010 , and peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Pop Songs chart . " We 'll Be Alright " was also released as a single by Pete Wentz on May 17 , 2010 on his blog . However , the single failed to make an impact on any of the Billboard charts .

 Reviews of the album were generally mixed to positive . Spin 's Mikael Wood gave the album 3 ½ out of 5 stars and commended its pop @-@ oriented sound , stating " most of Lazarus is so bright you 'll need ( designer ) shades " . Gregory Heaney of AllMusic called " Akidagain " the " real highlight of the album " and stated that " Even though every track on the album isn ’ t a keeper , it has some solid additions to any summer playlist and will definitely please fans of Gym Class Heroes . " Jerry Shriver of USA Today praised the album 's " all @-@ night party gems " and referred to " The Manual " as the album 's " true keeper " and praised the song 's introspective lyrics . Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard agreed with Shriver about " The Manual " , and praised the album 's " relatable themes " further commenting that " The 10 @-@ track album 's inclusion of reggae @-@ influenced beats and dance jams may polarize listeners , but its snappy wordplay and deep introspection will appeal to a wide demographic of music lovers . " Emily Zemler of Alternative Press awarded the album four out of five stars and deemed McCoy 's singing to be " the most engaging thing " about the album : " Not only are the tracks incredibly catchy , but McCoy belts out his choruses like he 's just discovered his voice . " 
 Nathan Slavik of <unk> called Lazarus a " smile @-@ inducing , high quality hip @-@ pop album from a distinctly creative and original voice " , praising the record 's uptempo yet dark songs . Entertainment Weekly 's Brad Wete gave the album a B + and commended McCoy for keeping with Gym Class 's hip @-@ hop / rock style , calling the album " a summery set that serves as a nice break from Class . " Drew Beringer of AbsolutePunk enjoyed the album 's upbeat songs and noted a departure from McCoy 's earlier work , commenting " Full of summer time jams , it 's hard to imagine this is the same guy who rapped about desolate times and experiences in his band ’ s second album The Papercut Chronicles ( 2005 ) ... This is not a world @-@ beater by any means , but it shows some growth in McCoy as an artist and lets him get out his ideas before recording and releasing the next Gym Class Heroes album . " 
 However , not all reviews were positive . Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the album 2 ½ out of 5 stars , calling his crooning @-@ style rapping " more unctuous than charming " . Blare Magazine criticized the over @-@ abundance of guest appearances and likened the album to " a newborn child forced out of a hip @-@ hop womb by 13 different fathers " , while opining that McCoy still demonstrates musical potential . Mike Diver of the BBC was highly critical of the disc , noting that " McCoy employs too many disparate styles ... for Lazarus to hold any attention for more than a fleeting period . " Although Diver praised Cee Lo Green 's " spotlight @-@ stealing " contribution to " Dr. Feel Good " , he referred to " We 'll Be Alright " as " repulsive " and the reggae stylings of " Billionaire " as " horribly dated " . Andy Gill of The Independent felt that although the disc had songs with potential to be hits such as " Dr. Feelgood " and " We 'll Be Alright " , the remainder of the songs " expose McCoy 's shortcomings " and the album is " unlikely to make him a household name " .

 = Clarence 13X = 
 Clarence Edward Smith ( February 22 , 1928 – June 13 , 1969 ) , better known by his assumed names Clarence 13X and Allah , was an American leader and founder of the Five @-@ Percent Nation . He was born in Virginia , and moved to New York City as a young man before serving in the United States Army during the Korean War . After returning to New York , he learned that his wife had joined the NOI and followed her , taking the name Clarence 13X . He served in the group as a security officer , martial arts instructor , and student minister before leaving for an unclear reason in 1963 . He enjoyed gambling , which was condemned by the NOI , and disagreed with the NOI 's teachings that Wallace Fard Muhammad was a divine messenger . 
 After leaving the NOI , Clarence 13X formed a new group with other former members . He concluded that all black men were divine and took the name Allah to symbolize this status . He rejected the belief in an invisible God , teaching that God could be found within each black man . In his view , women were " earths " that complemented and nurtured men ; he believed that they should be submissive to men . He and a few assistants retained some NOI teachings and pioneered novel interpretations of them . They devised teachings about the meaning of letters and numerals : understanding the meaning of each letter and number was said to provide deep truths about God and the universe . Clarence 13X referred to his new movement as the Five Percenters , referencing a NOI teaching that only five percent of the population knew and promoted the truth about God . One way that he distinguished his group from his previous faith was by rejecting dress codes or strict behavioral guidelines — he allowed the consumption of alcohol , and at times , the use of illegal drugs . 
 Clarence 13X was shot by an unknown assailant in 1964 but survived the attack . After an incident several months later in which he and several of his followers vandalized stores and fought with police , he was arrested and placed in psychiatric care . He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia . He referred to himself as " Allah " , which had become his preferred name . He was released from custody after a 1966 ruling by the Supreme Court placed limits on confinement without trial . Although he initially taught his followers to hate white people , he eventually began to cooperate with white city leaders . They gave him funding for a night school , and in return , he tried to prevent violence in Harlem . Clarence 13X was fatally shot in June 1969 ; the identity of his killer is unknown . The mayor of New York City and several other prominent leaders expressed condolences to his followers . Although the Five Percenters faltered in the immediate aftermath of his death , the movement rebounded after new leadership emerged . The group took a non @-@ hierarchical approach to leadership , and no single leader replaced Clarence 13X . He has been held in high regard by Five Percenters , who celebrate his birthday as a holiday . 
 = = Early life and Nation of Islam = = 
 Clarence Edward Smith was born on February 22 , 1928 , and raised in Danville , Virginia , with his five brothers and one sister . During his childhood , Virginia was racially segregated , and he witnessed incidents of racism , including a fight between his father and a white man that was sparked by racial tensions . In 1946 , he moved with his mother to New York City , where they settled in Harlem . He attended only two years of high school . 
 In 1949 , Smith fathered a child , Clarence Jowers , with Willieen Jowers . Although he married a woman named Dora Smith in 1950 , he fathered another child , Otis Jowers , with Willieen in 1951 ; he also had several sons and daughters with Dora . Smith joined the U.S. Army in the early 1950s and was stationed in Korea from 1952 to 1954 , where he served as an infantryman in the Korean War . After returning to the U.S. , he lived in Harlem and served in the United States Army Reserve until 1960 . During his military service , he became skilled in karate . 
 Dora Smith embraced the Nation of Islam ( NOI ) while her husband was away and he converted after returning to New York . By 1961 , he had registered at Mosque No. 7 and changed his name to Clarence 13X in accordance with NOI practice . Before his conversion , he often smoked marijuana and gambled , activities forbidden by the NOI . After joining the group , he studied the NOI 's doctrines and quickly progressed within their organizational structure , possibly thanks to skills learned in the military . His responsibilities included teaching martial arts and serving on the Fruit of Islam security team . He was also recognized as a skilled speaker and reached the rank of " student minister " at Mosque No. 7 . By 1963 , he had come to the attention of the FBI — informants recorded his presence at rallies led by Malcolm X. 
 The early 1960s were a turbulent period for the NOI ; unrest was caused by conflicts between leaders Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X. Around that time , Clarence 13X became disenchanted with the organization , although the root of his qualms is not known . NOI members have offered contradictory accounts of the events that caused his exit and whether he left voluntarily . His departure has been variously attributed to doubts about the NOI 's theology , violations of their moral code , objections to the luxurious lifestyles of their senior leadership , or Malcolm X 's distrust of him . Dora Smith elected to stay with the group , prompting the couple 's separation . Before leaving the NOI , Clarence 13X had begun to doubt their teaching that Wallace Fard Muhammad was a divine messenger . He believed that the NOI 's teachings were contradictory because they taught that God is black but encouraged reverence of Fard Muhammad , who was not of exclusively African descent . Clarence 13X concluded that divinity was found in all black men , rather than in a single person . Several times before he left the NOI , he was censured by leadership for these assertions . His friend John 37X elected to leave with him . Malcolm X also left the NOI in 1963 and remained on good terms with Clarence 13X . Clarence 13X did not join Malcolm X 's newly created group , Muslim Mosque , Inc . 
 = = Founding the Five Percenters = = 
 After leaving the NOI , Clarence 13X and John 37X continued to study the group 's teachings , sometimes while smoking marijuana . They assumed new names : Clarence 13X took Allah , and John 37X , Abu Shahid . After reading an NOI book with 34 riddles , known as the " Lost @-@ Found Lessons " , John 37X concluded that numbers represented specific concepts , such as knowledge or wisdom . He referred to this system as " living mathematics " . During its development , he was imprisoned on firearms charges . While John 37X was in prison , Clarence 13X taught a system of beliefs he referred to as " supreme wisdom " , which he saw as the core of Islam , to groups of young men . He was assisted by his friend James Howard , with whom he developed a modified version of living mathematics , " supreme mathematics " , and an accompanying doctrine about letters , the " supreme alphabet " . The development of these systems , considered a " divine science " by adherents , may have been influenced by the teachings of Sufism ; like some schools of Sufism , they found esoteric meanings in the alphabet . David <unk> of The Boston Globe compares these teachings to Kabbalah ; Felicia <unk> of Middle Tennessee State University sees similarities to Gnosticism and <unk> . 
 Clarence 13X developed novel teachings , assigning <unk> to familiar words . He stated that the letters of the word " Allah " stood for " arm , leg , leg , arm , head " , signifying the human body . This was said to prove that humanity held a divine nature . He named parts of the New York area after locations in the Middle East that are significant to Islam : Harlem was referred to as Mecca , and Brooklyn , Medina . Other disaffected NOI members , including some who served the Fruit of Islam , were soon drawn to his burgeoning group . Several people from the NOI who were unwilling to choose between loyalty to Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X also joined ; Clarence 13X incorporated aspects of the theology taught by the feuding leaders . In the group 's early years , some Five Percenters attended NOI events , and Clarence 13X 's theology had much in common with the teachings of the NOI , although there were notable differences . He taught his followers that he was an incarnation of God , and they each were gods . His followers were thus encouraged to look within themselves in their search for God . Clarence 13X taught that there was an inherent greatness in those of African descent not found in Europeans and their descendants , echoing statements made by Elijah Muhammad . He did not enforce the NOI 's strict moral rules : one way that the group appealed to potential converts was by allowing many practices condemned by the NOI , including gambling , alcohol , and drug use . Clarence 13X told his followers to avoid developing addictions but that drug use was not inherently wrong . He strictly forbade the consumption of pork , arguing that pigs were similar to animals that are not eaten in the United States , such as rats and dogs , and hence should not be consumed . Owing to their belief that black men are gods , the group allowed its members to make choices about clothing and most aspects of diet . 
 Early members of the group often proselytized on street corners for hours , and Clarence 13X 's assistants led classes about the group 's teachings , strictly enforcing study habits . He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters . Once they did so , they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths . These lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms . Rather than hold services in mosques , they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments , which were often held outdoors . Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings . 
 Clarence 13X 's group was initially known as the " Suns of Almighty God Allah " or the " Blood Brothers " . After Malcolm X 's death , the group became known as the " Five Percenters " or the " Five Percent Nation " . The name was drawn from the NOI 's claim to be the five percent of the black community who knew and promoted the truth about God ; Clarence 13X considered his movement to be the five percent of the NOI that still held to truth and integrity . The other 95 percent were said to be unaware of the truth or corrupt . Clarence 13X assembled an inner circle of assistants , nine of whom are referred to by Five Percenters as the " First Born " : they are said to embody his attributes . The assistants were assigned to spread the group 's teachings to younger people , many of whom took African names , including some from non @-@ Islamic societies . Clarence 13X taught Afrocentrism to his disciples and often wore a <unk> ; male Five Percenters members frequently wore <unk> <unk> , and female members wore colorful African head wraps . Some Five Percenters supported themselves via drug dealing and petty theft ; others intentionally committed minor legal infractions , hoping to proselytize to others who had been arrested . 
 Clarence 13X 's followers saw him as a divine messenger and referred to him as " Father Allah " . This elevated him to a higher position than Elijah Muhammad , who had deemed himself the " Messenger of Allah " . Eventually , Clarence 13X stopped identifying himself as a Muslim and spoke out against the reverence of Fard Muhammad , casting him as a " mystery God " . He rejected the idea that God is invisible , which he felt weakened people . He encouraged his followers to learn about and respect other spiritual traditions . 
 Although female converts were initially referred to as " nurses " , Clarence 13X renamed them " earths " in 1967 . He taught that women were not gods , as he believed that they were created by man and did not possess creative power . In his view , women could nurture , but only men could make children . Women were said to resemble the Earth in their ability to sustain life . Clarence 13X had a patriarchal philosophy , and the Five Percenters were initially overwhelmingly male . He spoke in favor of fathers ' arranging their daughters ' marriages and told women to embody submission by serving their husbands as God . Polygamy or serial monogamy were allowed , and legal marriage was discouraged . Clarence 13X encouraged his followers to have many children and discouraged the use of birth control . 
 = = Opposition = = 
 NOI leaders were angry that Clarence 13X freely taught portions of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members ; although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop , he refused . Clarence 13X also experienced conflict within his family : his children did not revere him , and hostility quickly developed between core Five Percenters and some of his sons when <unk> Jowers brought them to visit him . 
 On December 9 , 1964 , Clarence 13X was shot twice in the torso while at a popular gathering place in the basement of a Harlem tenement . He was brought to Harlem Hospital , where he was treated and released . He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later . In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement , American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure . The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown ; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence 13X . Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts . Clarence 13X 's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence . While recuperating from his wounds , Clarence 13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements , abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions . 
 The Five Percenters soon attracted attention from media and law enforcement . Local papers published negative coverage of the group , casting them as a violent hate group or a street gang . The New York Amsterdam News reported that Clarence 13X had threatened to kill white children if his group did not receive a government subsidy . In 1965 , the FBI initiated an investigation of his group and may have provided sensationalized rumors to the press . That year , FBI director J. Edgar Hoover deemed Clarence 13X as a " Harlem rowdy " , and feared that he would form ties with more dangerous groups . The FBI developed a detailed file on Clarence 13X ; in 1967 , Hoover described him as a potential threat to the President of the U.S. , and sent a detailed folder about him to the United States Secret Service .

 After Malcolm X 's death in 1965 , Clarence 13X mourned his loss but did not attend his funeral . In May 1965 , while visiting the site of Mosque No. 7 , then closed , Clarence 13X and several of his companions were told to leave by a police officer . They left , began to vandalize nearby buildings , and blocked the street near the former headquarters of Muslim Mosque , Inc . More police arrived and subdued Clarence 13X after an altercation , bringing him into custody with several of his followers . After being arrested , he refused to identify himself and was charged with assault and drug possession . About 60 of his followers attended his arraignment , but were removed from the court after shouting " Peace " . Clarence 13X proclaimed his innocence and announced his intent to defend himself in court . He told the judge that he was Allah , and that the city would face grave judgment if he were not released . The judge disregarded his prognostication and set his bail at $ 9 @,@ 500 . At a court date in June , about 50 Five Percenters protested outside the court ; afterwards , several were arrested on charges of making Molotov cocktails . In July , the court sent Clarence 13X to Bellevue Hospital Center for a psychiatric examination . While in the hospital , he made a few disciples and communicated with some followers through a hospital window . Under his instructions , Five Percenters resisted future NOI leader Louis Farrakhan 's attempts to convert them . 
 Knight states that Clarence 13X 's psychiatric results were not processed for an unusually long time ; he posits that the delay was due to FBI involvement and argues that Clarence 13X was a political prisoner . In November 1965 , Clarence 13X was ruled incompetent to stand trial and committed to the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene , which placed him at the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane . After he declared himself Allah and a " Master Gambler " , the doctors concluded that he had schizophrenic reaction , paranoid type with delusions of grandeur ; he faced indefinite commitment . Many Five Percenters and their converts traveled to the hospital to meet with him and receive instruction . He also proselytized to fellow inmates , converting one young white man , who later became a committed follower . 
 While Clarence 13X was in prison , the Five Percenters continued to proselytize and teach their doctrines . He instructed his followers to adopt names different from those used in the NOI to differentiate their group . After attaining a certain degree of knowledge of the group 's doctrines , members were allowed to adopt the surname " Allah " and sometimes " God " as a first name . This was in recognition of Clarence 13X 's teachings that black men were gods , and that each member should worship himself . His followers often took the name Allah , but would refrain from referring to themselves as such in his presence , in deference to his authority . After a decision ( Pate v. Robinson ) by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1966 , limits were placed on the confinement of mentally ill criminals , causing many to be released . Clarence 13X was consequently released in March 1967 .

 In mid @-@ 1967 , New York City mayor John Lindsay sought to develop closer ties with leaders of impoverished neighborhoods . Prompted in part by concerns voiced by the New York Police Department ( NYPD ) , the mayor dispatched one of his aides , Barry Gottehrer , to meet with Clarence 13X . Belying his fearsome reputation , Clarence 13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer , during which he requested more bus routes and school funding . Clarence 13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion , the mayor 's official residence . The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park , and with help from the National Urban League , obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school . It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools . Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school 's overseers ; Clarence 13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers . Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the students were not being radicalized . In 1975 , Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence 13X in The Mayor 's Man . The book was well received by some Five Percenters , who republished portions of it after it went out of print . They have not reprinted the entire book , owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence 13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter . 
 In February 1968 , Lindsay estimated that there were about 500 to 700 Five Percenters . Some of Clarence 13X 's followers attempted to create break @-@ away groups , proclaiming themselves prophets and starting their own movements . They generally retained aspects of Five Percenter doctrine with different emphases . 
 After the assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr. in April 1968 , Lindsay feared that rioting would occur in Harlem . He traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences ; Clarence 13X and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets . Clarence 13X also instructed his followers to try to prevent violence and looting . He was commended by the city 's leadership for his efforts , and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of Five Percenter teachings and portions of the Quran . Willieen Jowers recalled that Clarence 13X admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time . He later described himself as " neither anti @-@ white nor pro @-@ black " and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings . His white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in Harlem during the February 1969 nor 'easter . He was accepted as a Five Percenter , as Clarence 13X maintained that " civilization " — rather than race — was valued by the group . Clarence 13X made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed . Contrary to his radical reputation , he endorsed some conservative positions in the late 1960s , including capital punishment , respect for the U.S. flag , and American involvement in Vietnam . He also allowed his supporters to attend Christmas celebrations . Knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement . Clarence 13X was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young Five Percenters and won some concessions from the institution 's leadership . Some secular black leaders disliked him , owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric . On one occasion , he was invited to address an audience of black Marxists , then spoke to them about numerology . 
 Around 1968 , Clarence 13X fathered a son with a young convert named <unk> . That year , Gloria Steinem published an article about Clarence 13X in New York magazine . She blamed the NOI for the previous attempt to kill him , arguing that they were angered by his claim to be Allah and thus above Elijah Muhammad . Clarence 13X also received coverage from international media , including a Canadian television program . 
 = = Death = = 
 By 1969 , Clarence 13X became very tired and slept little . He feared that he would be killed and instructed his followers to remain strong if he died . On June 12 , he spent time with several of his disciples at their school . He left the school between two and three a.m. on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two . As was his occasional practice , he traveled to Dora Smith 's house to rest . He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him while he was in the lobby of her apartment building . That morning , several people from the mayor 's office met with his family , and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters ' school to express condolences . 
 Clarence 13X 's funeral was held four days after his death . It was attended by about 400 people and was followed by a procession through Harlem . His death put the leadership of his movement in question — there was no clear successor . At that time , his followers were primarily teenagers , and several of his top leaders subsequently struggled with drug addiction . 
 Most local media sources gave Clarence 13X positive coverage in the wake of his death . The Daily News connected his murder with the recent death of NOI activist Charles <unk> , casting them as part of a " Muslim War " . The mayor believed that the NYPD told them this and was angered by their claim . Louis Farrakhan denied culpability , maintaining that he had good relations with Clarence 13X . NYPD investigators suspected that he was killed by members of an extortion ring , possibly connected to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee . In August 1969 , an arrest was made in connection with his murder . The suspect denied involvement , and charges were soon dropped . Five Percenters have posited different culprits , including the CIA , the NOI , or a disgruntled follower . 
 = = Legacy and reception = = 
 Five Percenter membership plunged after Clarence 13X 's death , but rebounded in 1970 after new leadership emerged and revitalized the group . After his death , the group was not dominated by a single leader . This may have been a result of their teaching that all black men are gods , which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable . 
 Knight doubts that Clarence 13X set out to build a movement or a culture , but after his death , the movement expanded and gained converts across the United States . Five Percenters have celebrated Clarence 13X 's birthday as a holiday , and minimized the descriptions of his flaws in their accounts of his life . Numerous apocryphal stories from his life have circulated among the group ; some accounts have claimed that he gambled only as a means to reach others with his teachings .
